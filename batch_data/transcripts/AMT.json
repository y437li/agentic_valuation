Petersen - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Derek McCandless, Junior Vice President and General Counsel for CoreSite. Please go ahead. Derek S. McCandless: Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2014 conference call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website at coresite.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom. Thomas M. Ray: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll discuss highlights of our financial results, review our sales results and update our view of market conditions. Jeff will then present a detailed review of our financial results, development activity and balance sheet position. First, our Q1 financial results reflect continued systematic growth. Total revenue increased 16% year-over-year, led by greater than 20% growth in revenue from interconnection and breakered-amp power and 11% growth in data center rental revenue. Adjusted EBITDA grew 21% year-over-year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 220 basis points compared to the year-ago first quarter. FFO per share and unit of $0.49 correlates to a 20% increase over the prior year quarter. This $0.49 of FFO in Q1 incorporates a noncash expense of approximately $0.02 per share associated with the impairment of certain software development investments, which Jeff will discuss in more detail. Excluding this noncash charge, Q1 FFO was $0.51 per share and unit, correlating to 24% growth over the prior year quarter. Regarding new and expansion turnkey data center sales, in Q1, we executed 131 leases, representing annualized GAAP rental revenue of $5.1 million, comprised of approximately 40,000 square feet and an average GAAP rental rate of $129 per square foot. Total sales production of $5.1 million for the quarter is 12% above our trailing 12-month quarterly average and represents a greater than 50% increase over the prior sequential quarter. The $129 rental rate is 13% below our trailing 12-month average per foot. However, when normalized for power density, our Q1 rate was in line with the trailing 12-month average. We were pleased to see our normalized rental rate in line with the trailing year, in light of the greater total sales volume recorded in Q1 and, in particular, 4 larger leases in the Q1 sales mix. Additionally, we are encouraged to see sales volume increase in terms of the number of new and expansion leases signed, with our Q1 total of 131 leases representing a 16% increase over the trailing 4-quarter average and representing our highest number of leases executed in the quarter since we became a public company. Finally, our Q1 new and expansion executions reflect an average lease size of 306 square feet, increasing 12% from the trailing 12-month average. We attribute the increase to the fact that we executed 4 previously mentioned leases, each exceeding 2,000 square feet. Our execution of these 4 midsize leases is consistent with our long-standing goals and business model and is in contrast to the trailing 12 months only due to what we believe to be normal lumpiness in the execution of this size of lease. Reflecting continued strength in our network and cloud verticals, fiber cross-connect volume increased 17% year-over-year, with total connections growing by 9%. We focus upon the growth of fiber cross connections as an important metric for 2 reasons. First, we believe that fiber cross connections represent the true growth engine of the digital world and that their growth serves as a proxy for the health of the ecosystems in place and being developed in our data centers. Second, fiber cross connections, on average, realize unit pricing more than 90% greater than other physical cross-connects in our platform and currently account for more than 75% of total interconnection revenue. As such, fiber cross-connects are the predominant driver of revenue growth in our cross connection business. Beyond our cross connection product line, we were pleased to see continued expansion in our platform from our logical interconnection partners. Specifically, during the quarter, we announced another AWS Direct Connect deployment, bringing Direct Connect availability to our NY2 facility in Secaucus. Additionally, Frankfurt-based DE-CIX added a new deployment to our platform, placing a peering switch in our Reston campus. Importantly, we were pleased to see what we believe is greater success for our switch peering partners in our platform compared to that with most other U.S. data center providers, as reported by a respected public source. Regarding the geographic distribution of sales in the quarter, our strongest market in terms of annual GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases were Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Chicago and Virginia. Turning to the performance of our verticals. Our network and cloud verticals together accounted for 61% of leases and 38% of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in the quarter. Importantly, in Q1, we set another record for the number of leases signed in our network vertical. We believe that our strong position in the network and cloud verticals enables enterprises to reduce cost and accelerate performance in our platform, and we are seeing that play out in our Q1 sales results. Specifically, our enterprise vertical accounted for 17% of the annual GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in Q1. Importantly, we are realizing strong penetration of the Fortune 500's top computer software and information companies, with nearly 50% of those companies accounted among our current customers, including 9 of the top 10. Finally, with regard to leasing. In Q1, we took a meaningful step toward extending the contracted term of cash flows we expect from our SV3 facility in Santa Clara. To that objective, we executed an agreement with our customer at SV3 to restructure its lease, creating a win-win for both parties. The restructured lease enables us to recapture salable capacity in the building in phases, retain a component of the economics of the original lease, reduce the rental obligations of our existing customer in this space and enable our existing customer to relocate some portion of its capacity to other locations across our portfolio, subject to certain parameters. Following the execution of the restructuring agreement, in early Q2, we executed a new lease with one of our other customers for over 28,000 square feet at the site, or approximately 57% of total capacity. The new lease has a 5-year term and is with one of our current global ICT customers as it serves a global end user, who will be new to our portfolio, establishing and strengthening a set of relationships with great additional promise for all 3 organizations. Regarding sales staffing, we are now 83% staffed in terms of frontline sales reps on board with the company. After considering the extent to which newer reps are not yet fully off-ramp, the quota coverage of our current team correlates to approximately 60% of where we expect to finish 2014. In terms of the geographic distribution of our frontline sales reps, we are substantially staffed in each of our markets with the exception of our New York campus, where we currently have approximately half of the quota coverage in place, relative to what we target to have in place at the end of this year. Turning to our view of the markets where we participate. We do not see material changes from our last update in February. We continue to believe that Northern Virginia may see moderately softening rents for undifferentiated requirements, as the number of suppliers has increased and sublease exposure weighs on the market. Chicago is exhibiting strength in the prospect for improving rents, while we see Greater New York, the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Boston and Miami as substantially consistent with last year. Our objective remains to focus our sales efforts upon differentiated opportunities that benefit from the network and cloud advantages we built into our platform, which we believe bring attractive interconnection and breaker-amp power revenue to our company. In addition, we continue to expect to augment our company-wide performance system strategy, with a near-term objective of executing a limited number of larger leases in our new buildings in Secaucus and Reston to accelerate occupancy in these new sites. As we look to the remainder of this year, our focus is well-defined and simple : execute our business plan and drive occupancy in our existing platform and markets; and capitalize upon the strong internal growth opportunity before us. Specifically, we believe that inherent in our existing assets, we have the ability to more than double the amount of leased square footage in our company, with that growth coming at an attractive incremental cost and return on incremental investment. Pointing toward our execution on our growth opportunity, we're encouraged by the momentum that our sales team established in Q1, and we believe we are well-positioned to build off of that. That said, we still have work to do in building out our sales team, particularly in the Greater New York area. Also, we see an opportunity to streamline our technology systems and internal processes, and we remain committed to that goal. Put simply, we believe that our future is bright, and that in Q1, we took meaningful steps towards accelerating our execution on the promise before us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey S. Finnin: Thanks, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q1 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development activity, and third, I will provide an update regarding our capital investments and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. As a reminder, last quarter, we provided enhanced disclosures in our quarterly supplemental around the components of our operating revenue to provide more transparency into data center revenue trends. Many of my comments regarding revenue will relate to data center revenue performance, which can be found on Page 12 of the quarterly earnings supplemental. Our first quarter data center revenues were $61.7 million, a 3.9% increase on a sequential quarter basis and 16% increase over the prior year quarter. Our first quarter data center revenue consisted of : $50.9 million in rental and power revenue, up 2.5% sequentially and 13.5% year-over-year; $8.1 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 2.5% sequentially and 22.6% year-over-year; and $2.8 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $2 million, substantially consistent with the fourth quarter, and an increase of 6.5% year-over-year. Q1 lease commencements represented $3.8 million of annualized GAAP revenue, comprised of approximately 28,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $134 per square foot. Renewals in the first quarter totaled approximately 22,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $159 per square foot, and represented mark-to-market growth of 4.7% and 9.4% on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively. Churn in the first quarter was 1.2%, in line with our expectations of 1% to 2% per quarter. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $5.7 million. We expect approximately 85% of the backlog to commence in 2014. Our first quarter FFO was $0.49 per diluted share and unit, flat on a sequential basis and an increase of 19.5% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $920,000 or $0.02 per share to FFO. This charge is related to our ongoing IT initiatives and, more specifically, to internal-use software previously under development. Specifically, during the quarter, we elected to discontinue internal development efforts associated with certain software applications and, instead, pursue implementation of commercial, off-the-shelf software. Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $30.1 million reflects an increase of 6.1% sequentially and 21.4% over the same quarter of last year. As Tom mentioned, in the first quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 220 basis points to 47.2% of total operating revenues. This represents annualized revenue flow-through to adjusted EBITDA of 61%. Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter were approximately 5.6% of total operating revenues, down 10 basis points sequentially and below the estimated range of 6% to 6.5% that we previously provided. This decrease is due to the timing of hiring sales and marketing resources. We expect sales and marketing expenses for the year to be closer to the lower end of the range we previously provided. Our G&A expenses were 13.5% of total revenues, up 200 basis points from the previous quarter, primarily due to the impairment charge I discussed previously and, to a lesser extent, a charge associated with the elimination of the Chief Operating Officer role, which we discussed on last quarter's call. Going forward, we expect G&A expenses to be approximately 11% of revenue. As shown on Page 18 of our supplemental, we spent and expensed $2.3 million during the first quarter related to ongoing repairs and maintenance, in line with the average amount spent over the trailing 12-month period. As of March 31, 2014, our stabilized operating data center portfolio was 83% occupied. Including leases executed as of the end of Q1 but not yet commenced, our stabilized data center occupancy rate would be 84.7%. I will now discuss our recently completed and ongoing development activity across the portfolio. At NY2 in Secaucus, New Jersey, we completed Phase 1 construction by delivering 2 additional computer rooms in March. As of the end of the first quarter, we have approximately 53,000 net rentable square feet of data center space at NY2 in our pre-stabilized pool, including the 18,000 square feet placed into service at the end of the fourth quarter. We have seen good momentum in leasing activity at NY2, with the first computer room now over 75% leased. At LA2, we delivered 33,700 square feet of turnkey data center capacity in the first quarter, all of which is now reflected in our pre-stabilized pool. We developed the additional computer room at LA2 in response to solid demand in that market, which, as Tom noted, was again our strongest market in terms of GAAP rents signed and number of leases executed. At our Reston, Virginia campus, we now expect to complete the first phase of our VA2 development late in the third or early in the fourth quarter as we timed the delivery of additional space to meet market demand. We continue to see solid demand for colocation capacity in Northern Virginia, with data center occupancy at VA1 up 260 basis points over the last 12 months. As we've discussed previously, as we complete development projects, we realize a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting in a corresponding increase in the amount of operating expense. To provide increased transparency, we have included the percentage of gross interest capitalized on Page 20 of the supplemental. As you think about your models for 2014, keep in mind that we expect the capitalization of interest to decrease to approximately 40% to 50% of total interest expense incurred. Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2014, our debt to Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.2x, and if you include our preferred stock, it is 3.1x. We anticipate our leverage to increase as we continue to execute our capital spending plans related to development activity. We continue to target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock to annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 4x. As of March 31, 2014, we had $160 million drawn on our credit facility, with approximately $236.6 million of available capacity. As we mentioned on our February call, in January, we entered into a $100 million 5-year senior unsecured term loan and executed a $100 million interest rate swap agreement to fix the rate in order to protect against adverse fluctuations in LIBOR. These transactions enabled us to retire the $58 million mortgage on SV1 and pay down a portion of the revolving credit facility, leaving us with ample liquidity to fund our development activity and growth plans for the remainder of 2014. Finally, we are reiterating our 2014 FFO guidance of $2 to $2.10 per share and OP unit, as well as additional guidance metrics we disclosed with our fourth quarter earnings call. A thorough summary of all 2014 guidance items can be found on Page 21 of the earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Emmanuel Korchman from Citi. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Jeff, if I'm looking at your capitalized leasing commissions, they look kind of high in the quarter, especially on a sequential or year-over-year basis. Could you help us figure out what that is? Thomas M. Ray: Yes. You might recall in the second half of 2013, we renewed our primary lease here in Denver. That Denver facility was part of the Confluent acquisition back in April 2012. As a result of that renewal, we were -- are now able to go and renew those customers inside that particular data center. And we've got emphasis and particular focus on getting that done here in 2014. And as a result, that led to the increase in the run rate associated with those lease commissions. I would say that on average, you could see those lease commissions on a quarterly basis being somewhere between $2 million to $4 million per quarter through 2014 as we get those leases renewed in Denver. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. And then I think you guys have spoken in the past about increasingly using a channel partner program alongside increasing the quota of sales staff. Have you seen any progress in that program? Thomas M. Ray: We have. I don't have the data at my fingertips, Manny, but I think our channel production in Q1 was roughly double that of the trail. I wouldn't describe -- I wouldn't position that as a permanent increase in the run rate, although we do think we can get to that point, but the short strokes are we had a very good Q1 in terms of the channel. But I think that there's a lot of lumpiness in that outperformance. At the same time, we have been pretty methodically adding to our channel capabilities. Number one, signing agreements with new partners, that's been going very well. And now we're well into the process of training them, getting them up to speed on our product catalog and pricing and us doing the same with them so that the organizations can work effectively together. So yes, we have seen very good channel results in Q1. And that process of building that team continues. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. Last one for me, Tom, and correct me if I'm wrong here. I think you talked about the undifferentiated product landscape in a few different markets, including New York, New Jersey, as sort of being weaker. And then at the same time, you spoke about filling part of your space with larger requirements in, at least, in New York markets, if not the others. How do I reconcile those 2 statements of -- there's lots of product that suits that sort of large customer, but that's the customer you're targeting? Thomas M. Ray: Yes. I mean, you reconcile it just by NPV and IRR-based math. In New York and Virginia, I mean, to make this as clear as we can, we do expect to sign some larger deals that are probably going to be at pretty low rates. And if those markets, we were -- our assets there were 80% full, and as such, most of the capital that we'd outlaid in the market was already being productive, and we had a small amount of available capital deployed not yet leased, we would not go look to go to those deals. But in each of those markets where you have a large new development with a lot of run rate, as we've said, ever since we've been public, we found it advantageous. We found that NPV and IRR are positive to go out and sign -- to move velocity faster in a new development. What we are not interested in doing, what we try to avoid, is signing low rent deals without breaker power without a lot of cross-connects for -- when the tenant can tie up the space for 15 or 20 years. So look, if we can go to a 5-year deal that -- and the economics of that deal are highly to produce a strong return on the next tranche of capital to build out in that same building, our investors win. So that's been our model for 15 years. We've been very effective at what we call warehousing inventory with wholesale users until it's time to recycle back into our resale program. And early in the life cycle of large new developments, that's how we've always played the game, and we don't plan on changing that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore. Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : A few here, if I may. First, Tom, can you remind us from a competitive perspective, who you see most often out in the marketplace and how you differentiate against that next closest competitor? And then the second question has to do with sort of the cloud and enterprise verticals. You guys have done a very nice job of sort of building up a critical mass of cloud platforms; the AWS announcement today along those lines. And I'm just wondering if you're starting to see the sort of the second generation of demand coming in from the enterprises that want to take advantage of sort of the security and the consistent performance by dropping a cabinet into one of your data centers to access those cloud platforms. Thomas M. Ray: Regarding who we compete against, look, in each of our markets, we most strongly compete against the colocation provider that has the most dense interconnection offering, the best ability to offer high-performance solutions to performance-oriented apps and workloads and the best ability to connect lots of people and, as such, reduce operating cost. So in general, you see Equinix and, by market, other companies that are very strong, and those are the guys we compete against. And how we differentiate, look, the first differentiator -- the first and most important differentiator is again for the rest of the market. It's location, location, location. It's being on top of lots of networks, and it's having a business model that drives more and more networks, more cloud providers and more capability into the data centers. So the key differentiator is against everybody else. And then how do we differentiate against -- if we're the #2 solution in the market in terms of network density and cloud density, we really do look at it of how -- what percentage of workloads and applications will see a difference in performance between us and the other guy? And we actually think that percentage is quite low in most of our markets. And so our objectives are to drive customer service and provide the best experience in our marketplace. And we think we have an excellent reputation and a very good relationship with our customers around how we serve them. And secondly, I think we are an attractive, all-in value. We -- I think we've stated before that our all-in price point per unit of capital deployed is, in some areas, lower to substantially lower than the price point of whoever the incumbent might be in that area. And so as we've said for a long time, we can still make a tremendous amount of money and get very good returns relative to the past. And we have room to run around that while still providing our customers a very strong value. So the key is understanding the application and being able to communicate with the customer, \"Okay. Somebody has 280 networks, and we have 50. Does that difference really matter to you for what you're doing here?\" And we find that, that discussion has legs. What was the other question, Jon? I'm sorry. Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : It was on the enterprises showing up to take advantage of the cloud platforms that have been set up inside your facilities. Thomas M. Ray: Yes. I think our experience is similar to the other guys in our space, as well as the cloud guys themselves. It is working. We're seeing it, and it is accelerating. But it is -- it's not going to revolutionize our portfolio and our sales results over the next 12 months. We are seeing growth of cross-connects that is disproportionate to that of other users. We're seeing growth of cross-connects to our larger cloud partners, and we're seeing that rate of growth beginning to accelerate. So all the arrows are moving in the right direction. But it's not going to change the world overnight. And I think that's what you see from Racks and the other guys, right? So I'd say our experience is similar to the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your sales headcount versus your targets in light of the recent leadership transition in both sales and marketing. And then in Virginia, 2 questions. One is the DI-CEX deployment. Is that just a good solid win for you, kind of a one-off? Or do you view that as a magnet for incremental business that would come to you, either in the way cross-connects or just new cabinet-type deals? And then in light of the -- again in the Virginia market, in light of the Yahoo! situation and then CyrusOne opening up space later this year, yourselves opening up space, are you seeing delayed decisions by enterprises, maybe awaiting better price points as a lot of inventory comes into the market? Thomas M. Ray: Sure. I guess -- what was the first question? Jeffrey S. Finnin: Head -- sales count. Thomas M. Ray: Sales count -- the sales staffing. So we're -- look, I think we're making solid progress. Again the bodies in place are up 21% from when we last talked. Of course, those new bodies in place are not offramp, so they don't really add much to quota coverage right now. I think in the big picture, number one, the rate at which we are adding salespeople and getting them trained and making them productive and the rate at which we're increasing quota and productivity around quota has gone up over the last quarter. Steve Smith has been an extraordinarily strong hire and the vice presidents who've been here for a while and are working with Steve, are really producing, as are their people. So I guess, we just let our Q1 results stand for themselves and we look forward to working to build on that. Separately, we've tried to be transparent about where do we expect to drive quota coverage during the year, and we expect to drive that up substantially. So I don't know what else I can add on that, but if you want to follow on a question on that, feel free before we move on to the next topic. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : That's fine. So DE-CIX then? Thomas M. Ray: DE-CIX is kind of in the middle of what you said, Jonathan. I think -- we're very pleased to have them as a partner. We're pleased to have all of our public Swiss peering partners in as many of our data centers as they want to come into. It's additive to the value of our data center on the margin. It's nice. At the same time, it doesn't change the world and it -- having those partners in next to our Any2 Exchange is not meaningful to us in terms of our profitability or our stickiness with our customers. Having the European exchanges provide greater connection over to Europe is a service component that is nice to add to our portfolio, and that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Jeffrey S. Finnin: Last one's the Yahoo! and CyrusOne, whether or not it's weighing on the market. Thomas M. Ray: Virginia, look, we just -- yes, I think -- I don't know that I've seen enterprises making decisions more slowly. I just think rents are softer in Virginia now than they were 1.5 years from now, and we've been calling that out and it's playing out the way we expected. I can't say I've seen a change in leasing velocity, but perhaps this is not transparent to me off of our data. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And if I can just follow on another East Coast question, with New York, too, given the activity there, which industry verticals -- is it broad-based or does anything kind of stand out in terms of the type of business that you're getting there? I imagine there were a lot of carriers that connect into your building initially. That might account for some of the leasing -- the volumes. But apart from that, any particular verticals stand out? Thomas M. Ray: Not really; I think you hit it. Again, we attack each new data center with a business plan of building value in it. So you start with the networks and you start working to bring clouds along with them. And so in terms of number of lease signings in the early days, that what has happened and it's been -- frankly, it's exceeded our expectations. It's been really good. Now with a very nice base in place, we're seeing a very broad set of demand from enterprises, including healthcare, in particular, and financial services in particular. No, not high-frequency trading. We've been clear, we don't expect to take that away from anybody else. But there are other aspects of that business that we are seeing in our funnel and we've seen nice movement from content. So it's -- if you think of it -- again, we look at it kind of this 3-legged stool of networks, clouds and then enterprises. And we talk about enterprises as separate from how we term enterprises or the content guys. Other people might call them enterprises, we could show an enterprise sales number of 50% of sales if we reconfigured our definitions. But the way we define it, we have content. That is very strong in the greater New York area. And then we have enterprise and that is doing very well for us in New York, in terms of the funnel and what we're seeing. So it's broadly based. And that evolution, once you establish some network and cloud density, toward those other verticals is a natural evolution that we've worked to achieve in each of our markets. Operator : Our next question comes from David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Questions for you. The first has to do with sublease space, and my understanding from talking to different industry participants is that there's likely more sublease space coming on the market, probably more at the wholesale level. Do you see significant amounts of sublease space within your portfolio? And what are your expectations for that going forward? Thomas M. Ray: I think the only material sublease space I'm aware of, and frankly, it's the only sublease space I'm aware of in our portfolio is the space at SV3 in Silicon Valley. And we just took 57% of that out of the market on a 5-year term with the new customer. So we've been consistently clear for 2 years that our tenant -- our customer at SV3 isn't using a portion of their capacity and that at some point in time, we expected there to be something smart to do whereby everybody would win. And in early Q2, we -- in Q1, we executed an agreement with that customer that gave us the flexibility to go do something smart. And a couple of weeks later, we signed an attractive new lease with a customer that bid smart. It -- that set of events is NPV positive to our company, and we believe it's an attractive win for both the existing customer at SV3 and the new customer at SV3. So in our portfolio, with that building, and we've taken 57% out of the market. And we have 2 years to address the remaining 43% and now we have a mechanism in place to go do that freely where everybody can win. So we feel very good about our sublease exposure. We feel like it's small and we feel like we're in the driver's seat to be smart about dealing with it. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. My other question has to do with sort of capital flows within your subsector. And if we step back and we look at development nationally, it would seem that development supplies are tapering, private equities pulling out of some of the more speculative construction of the merchant building. Number one, is that true in your perspective? And number two is, are you seeing more capital then move into acquisitions? And has the acquisition market changed, in your mind, in terms of there being more bidders and potentially some compressed cap rates in certain markets? Thomas M. Ray: So I think in terms of number of new entrants, I think that has cooled somewhat. We don't see as many new startups with $300 million of private equity money or $150 million of private equity money. That has not happened as much now as it did a couple or a few years ago. I think that the publics continue to bring capacity to market like production builders, and I haven't really seen a change in that. I don't know any of the larger publics who's saying, \"In market X or Y, I'm completely out of the space. And I'm not going to bring any more to market.\" I think, practically, I'm not seeing anything really different from the public guys, and there you have it. On acquisitions, I think that -- I don't -- there are always small deals for people to look at. But some of those trades, I don't think many of them trade into data center guys and colo guys like us. They trade at either to PE guys or to telcos, that kind of a thing. And I don't really see the acquisition landscape as materially different. There'd be -- the reports of impending huge scale consolidation in our industry have been out there for about 3.5 years. All I can say is we get up every day and go to work and try to create value, and that's what we focus on. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Two questions, if I may. A lot of headlines this past quarter about price reductions at public cloud providers, AWS, Google and Microsoft, Azure. Just curious, when you see stuff like that, how do you think about that as it relates to potentially impacting your business? I guess one could argue that with AWS direct connecting some of your facilities, the more demand the AWS sees, the more benefit that is to someone like yourself. But is there also a negative potential impact to that, and just kind of your thoughts on how you think about these things and how it overall impacts your business? And then, I guess, the second part, speaking specifically about Secaucus and Reston and the desire to fill that up with what you've just called, I guess, more wholesale or larger footprint type of space to kind of fill up those facilities. Just for point of clarification, are those going to be wholesale type deals, where there is no real value proposition to the ecosystems that you built into those facilities? Or did I hear you correctly that you're actually looking for customers, that may be taking large space, but also value that aspect of your business and still could ultimately become very sticky customers over time? Thomas M. Ray: Sure. On the first one, compressing -- perhaps, compressing margins for the cloud guys, I think its impact on our industry is a function of the business model of the companies with the industry. We really focus on the part of the cloud service provider architecture that is oriented towards accessing a large volume of customers and being on top of a lot of networks that support that, and where performance matters to them. And there's a component of their architecture where that does matter and we've seen our pricing hold up just fine in that and I don't see it changing meaningfully. I haven't seen it change meaningfully, if at all. I think the other component of the cloud service provider's architecture that is, perhaps, more traditionally thought of as wholesale, a big block of space. Those guys are very intelligent buyers. And to the extent they gain market power, I think that will -- can have an impact on the wholesale sector. At the same time, I mean, I think those guys have been achieving quite favorable, customer-friendly rates for a couple of years now. And I don't see it going a lot lower. You just -- I would think for the wholesalers, you reach a point where you're just going to say no to putting capital out for that use. So I mean, that's how we look at it. I think, for us, we -- the cloud has been very good for our business and we think it will continue to be so, but we're not trying to land every piece of all -- of each cloud service provider's architecture. Regarding Secaucus in Virginia, I want to be clear, we're absolutely not trying to fill up those buildings with wholesale users. We're -- if you -- the Secaucus building is a plus or minus 20-megawatt building. I can see us going out and getting 1/3 of that leased. If we can get 1/3 of that leased on 3- or 5-year deals, that is going to be NPV, cash flow, IRR-positive to our company, but we do not want to load up those buildings as wholesalers. We're -- we didn't go there to be in the wholesale business. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And I guess, just one quick follow-up to the cloud question. Do you have -- what about, I guess, the risk that there's actually some customers that have chosen to go to the colocation route, who may potentially now look at the pricing at an AWS and ultimately change their mind, at least for a specific application, and ultimately change how they purchase services to go less to colo and more to actually directly purchasing from a cloud provider. Is that something you've seen in your business in the past? And is that something that you guys spend much time on thinking about? Thomas M. Ray: Well, we've seen it go both ways, and it's a fair point, and it's -- it does happen. It also happens and I think today, we've probably seen it balance, where somebody is purchasing cloud services with an AWS and then they reach a certain level of scale, where they rolloff and go hybrid, and then they take colocation space. So I look at the general dynamic, kind of like I've looked at Moore\u2019s Law in our industry for the last 15 years. There've always been dynamics, a component of which will point toward less demand, right, for our business. But there've always been other dynamics that point toward greater demand. And we've -- throughout all of these changes, we've seen demand grow very, very consistently. I would say 5 years ago, we worried a lot about what you've just described and we've done a tremendous amount of work around it. And we paid a lot of attention to it and we're actually very comfortable with it now with the -- the cloud has been a friend, and we expect it to continue to be so. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Barry McCarver from Stephens, Inc. Barry McCarver - Stephens Inc., Research Division : I think you've got most of my questions, but I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. On the restructuring of the lease for SV3, is that going to have any -- a lumpy effect on churn during the year or do you think that will be pretty evenly spaced out? Jeffrey S. Finnin: Barry, in terms of the churn, we don't think it will have an impact. As Tom talked about in his prepared remarks, most -- or the customer has the option to take some of that deployment and relocate in some of our other markets. And as such, if it's advantageous for them to do so, we think that, that might be the end results. We don't think it will have much impact on the churn. Thomas M. Ray: Sorry, I'm going to -- my CFO should kick me here, but I think it -- I think we'll be adding 20,000, 25,000 feet of churn into the system over the next 2 years, with the chunk of that in this year, maybe half of that this year was -- we hadn't built it in. It's not net churn, right, because it's already back-filled with a new lease. But in terms of gross churn, yes, I mean, we didn't factor the technical departure of that SV3 customer until 2 years from now at the end of their lease. Now that churn out will hit our gross churn number. But on a net basis, it's -- again, it's a positive to us. If it's a loss in terms of square footage, it's a positive in terms of cash flow. Barry McCarver - Stephens Inc., Research Division : That's very helpful. And then just secondly, talking about larger deals, not necessarily wholesale deals. I think we kind of beat that to death. But last quarter, you mentioned the fact that creating opportunity to bring larger deployments in was something you were focused on. Can you talk about the mix of business this quarter and maybe the pipeline for some larger deals? Thomas M. Ray: Well, I think the big picture was in the latter half of 2013, we just didn't sign any, frankly, even many mid-sized deals, much less larger ones. And in Q1, we kind of saw a return to normalcy of -- and we executed a handful of 2,000-foot, 1,000-foot, 1,500 square-foot deals, which maybe those are 100-kilowatt to 200-kilowatt deals each. So these are mid-sized deals that for whatever reason, we just didn't execute on them in the second half of Q3. We have a long history of executing very well on them and we're pleased that in Q1, we again executed well. In terms of larger deals -- in terms of that business, we're optimistic that : number one, our productivity in close rates around those deals has returned to norm; and number two, that by adding more resources during the year, we're optimistic that we'll actually be able to drive sales around that up a little bit, again, by the end of the year. As for the larger deals, after 14, 15 years in this business, I've just learned that they are lumpy. There's just no way to forecast them. Our funnel is, I think, stronger around that than it's been in some time. But you never know until deals are signed. And I would -- I want to go back to the churn question. I think what we'll start doing -- what you'll probably see from us this year is you might see us report churn with, \"Here's churn and here's churn excluding that one lease.\" And I think churn, excluding that lease, is not going to be any different than what we had been forecasting to the Street. But we'll just need to be clear about the delta with this new restructure. Operator : Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I wanted to just follow up on the guidance and as it relates to SV3, specifically. So 2 points here, one, your -- you did $0.49 of FFO and then you had a $0.02 charge related to the impairment. But there was also -- was it $0.02 related to the departure? So was it safe to assume that the clean number, if you will, would've been a $0.53 number, Jeff? Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, Jordan. Yes, you're right. We had a $0.02 impairment charge, as we alluded to. And then if you look at the full quarter of 2014 as compared to the full quarter of 2013 for that departure, it's really about $400,000 in -- for the full quarter, difference this quarter over last. That was largely offset by with a couple of lease terminations that we received during the quarter, but it's about $400,000 for that particular departure. Thomas M. Ray: Jordan, I think at a high level, you see the onetime cost of eliminating the COO position is essentially offset by other one-time gains, so scattering of onetime gains in Q1. And so the real delta is the $0.02 impairment on the software. And then separately, I mean -- it would be normal to say, \"If your run rate is $0.51, then why did you move guidance up?\" And I think that it's important to discuss quickly here. We continue -- right now, we're still evaluating the rest of our software. And so we just -- we have uncertainty as to whether we might -- as to how much longer we're going to use certain things. We just have uncertainty. So on a core basis, excluding any of those, any of that variability, there might be a little bit of upside to the midpoint of our guidance, but we're just not clear yet on those other issues. And so we stand by the guidance we've given and we're confident right now we'll make it. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Well, I'm not going to let -- that wasn't going to be my question. So I'm going to make that your question about the guidance going higher, Tom. But in terms of the actual SV3 economics, can you kind of share a little bit more with us as it relates to that specifically? What did that look like? I mean, I assume that was 21 -- 2901 Coronado? Thomas M. Ray: The SV3 is 2901 Coronado. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And so that was a legacy lease at a big number. Tenant was expiring in the '16 and '17. What was the mark-to-market on that 28,000 square feet? Thomas M. Ray: Yes, we won't disclose any specific economics about either lease, the new one or the old one. We will say, we were able to offer an aggressive, a customer-friendly rental rate for the new customer, by which CoreSite, the new customer and the old customer, all came out ahead of where they otherwise would've been. And we wouldn't... Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : A lease termination fee sort of helping to ease the pain there a little bit? Is that the right way to think of it? Thomas M. Ray: The old customer, the prior customer will continue to pay some degree of rent. And so the net of the new rent and old rent is favorable compared to the old rent. And I think comparing to mark-to-market, it would be strongly negative, but we would not have done this aggressive of a deal at this point in time but for the totality of the circumstances, putting all these pieces together. And again, that's what we've been trying to say forever. We're confident there'll be a chance for us to do something smart, and we believe we just did. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And the expiration, the remainder of the original lease, is that now a '17 or a '16 departure? The other 20% -- the 50% -- the 43% that was not dealt with. Thomas M. Ray: 2/3 of what remains are in '16 and 1/3 of what remains is in '17. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. Will we see a lease termination fee in the second quarter or third quarter, or not necessarily? And we saw in 1Q, and that's it? Jeffrey S. Finnin: Yes, that -- Jordan, that lease termination fee in the first quarter was not associated with the particular transaction Tom's talking about at SV3. And again, as Tom alluded to, there will not be a lease termination fee going forward that you'd see on a one-time basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Petersen from MLV & Co. Jonathan M. Petersen - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : I have a feeling, at some point this year, everyone's going to know -- want to know exactly how much exposure each of the data center leases has to high-frequency trading. My understanding is you have a very minimal exposure, but I just wanted to get you on the record saying that. But then also, Tom, get your overall kind of macro thoughts on if that business goes away or contracts significantly, what kind of ripple effect that might have on the New York and Jersey markets? Thomas M. Ray: Well, guilty as charged for the company not having much high-frequency trading in our portfolio. And I'm sorry to say it, right? I mean the guys that do have very high-class problems. So we don't have that in -- to a meaningful extent in our company. And I wish we were struggling with where this is headed, but we're not. For the broader industry, again, I think there's -- we have estimated in the past that perhaps 20% of the space or capacity demand for data centers from the financial services market is HFT-related. So 80% is not. And if HFT contracts some, I don't think it's going to have a massive disruption on greater Jersey, New York. So there you go. I mean, I think it will impact a small part of that market, which has historically been enormously profitable, and we don't have much of that in here and that's not something we're proud about saying. Jonathan M. Petersen - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : Well -- so when you say 20% of financial services are now having high-frequency trading, are you talking about colocation or does that include wholesale? Because I assume the HFT guys are almost entirely colocation. Is the high percent -- is it colo? Thomas M. Ray: Yes, that's colo. That's colo. Operator : Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. We do have a follow-up coming from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Sorry, on the -- I have sort of a little bit of a macro question, and you've touched on it in different ways. But in terms of the overall fundamentals, you've kind of run through it by business, but some of the larger competitors in the marketplace have supposedly reduced the amount of speculative construction that's been going on. And allegedly, there's been net absorption of space. And so, I'm curious as to -- are you seeing that in those conditions? I know Northern Virginia you flagged as experiencing some pressure. But are you seeing net absorption of space and then an overall improvement in the supply-demand equilibrium? Thomas M. Ray: I think we're starting to, Jordan, probably everywhere other than Virginia. I think we're starting to. We are optimistic that 2015 might offer a little bit better balance between supply and demand in favor of the service provider, guys like us. But right now, I think, yes, there might be fewer megs [ph] under construction or breaking ground at the moment. But if you go around at each of the major markets, each one of the publics is still selling capacity. So that the current competitive landscape, I don't think has changed much and I think the combination of additional construction starts and sublease potential in Virginia means that will be a little bit softer, a little bit longer. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers from Robert W. Baird. David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I got in really late, so if I -- if this is answered, I'll go back and read the transcript. But could you comment, if you haven't on any cross-connect pricing pressure that you're seeing and more broadly and even maybe within specific verticals where you're seeing greater or lesser success in getting that pricing? Thomas M. Ray: Sure. Our -- we've not seen pressure on our cross-connects. I think there is some pressure on cross-connect pricing for providers whose price points are measurably higher than ours. But for ours, no. I mean, we actually think there's probably still room to run on that. So no, we're not seeing pressure on cross-connects. And separately, I think it can be challenging to kind of follow the delta between Open-IX and public peering and cross-connects and on the Open -- or on the public peering side of our business, we're not seeing any pressure on our rates at all because our rates are incredibly low. Our -- look, our average port price across our company is now in the order of $300 a month. And so Equinix might have gone from $3,500 to $5,000, 3 or 4 years ago to $1,500 to $1,000 now. We offer our ports, our -- that business is at best a breakeven business, and that's at scale. So I think if you talked with the MCIX guys and the DE-CIX guys and the providers that things like Open-IX are trying to bring in the data centers, I think those providers would tell you their breakeven for their members is north of our price. So no, we're not seeing any pressure on our prices at all. We actually think we still have room to run and I mean, that's where we stand in the market. David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. Second question, and I appreciate that color. With regard to Santa Clara in Northern California, the demand for you and some of your peers seems to be improving again after it had kind of lulled for a while. Anything incrementally new in that market in terms of driving demand or is it just kind of the same types of customers, but they finally kind of revived with lower overall new supply? Thomas M. Ray: Well, I guess the only thing different that we would point to, that we've seen is, we've done some more business now with offshore companies, Asia-based companies. So I think there's more of -- there's more native deployment from those guys now, as opposed to going through -- as opposed to just taking colo with a U.S. reseller or a U.S. guy, they are now putting more architecture across the water. Operator : At this time, we have no further questions. I will turn the call the back over to Tom Ray for closing comments. Thomas M. Ray: Thank you very much. And thanks, everybody, for sharing time with us today. Well, look, we're pleased that our Q1 results showed good financial results, but most importantly to us, frankly, strengthening, accelerating sales and importantly, accelerating sales productivity. We've been through a tremendous amount of change over the last couple of years and a tremendous amount of change over the last handful of months. And we're just proud of and thankful for the skill and the energy and the heart of our colleagues here at CoreSite. We feel like we have good things going on, that there is very strong momentum that we've captured in Q1 and we can keep driving throughout the year. So we're pretty darned excited. It's because of the people here, and we're thankful. As we go forward, look, we're just trying to drive clarity, focus and execution around the existing portfolio and the development deals we have ongoing right now. And with that, we're going to work hard to keep growing our company and driving strong returns to our investors. Thank you, again. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partner Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Derek McCandless, General Counsel for CoreSite Realty Corporation. Please go ahead sir. Derek McCandless : Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2014 conference call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations which are based on currently available information and management\u2019s judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Ray : Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I\u2019ll discuss highlights of our financial results, review our sales results for the second quarter, update our view of market conditions and provide insight into our view of our near term growth opportunities. Jeff will then present a detailed review of our financial results and balance sheet position, as well as update you on our outlook for the full year. In Q2, we continue to see sales momentum, which coupled with focused internal execution, resulted in continued solid financial performance. Total operating revenue increased 14% year-over-year, led by greater than 20% growth in revenue from interconnection. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of interconnection revenue growth in excess of 20%. In Q2, we recorded some onetime items that Jeff will explain in more detail later on the call. Excluding those onetime items, Q2 FFO was $0.51 per share in unit, correlating to 13% growth year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding onetime items, increased 12% year-over-year, to $30.04 million. Including onetime items, the net of which added $0.06 to the total reported FFO. Q2 FFO amounted to $0.57 per share and unit. That said, we focus upon our earnings metrics excluding onetime items as we measure our performance. Regarding new and expansion turnkey data centre sales, in Q2, we executed 121 leases, representing annualized GAAP rental revenue of $9.4 million, which is our highest level of GAAP rent signed from TKD leases since we became a public company. This was comprised of approximately 59,000 square feet at an average GAAP rental rate of $159 per square foot. Total sales production of $9.4 million for the quarter is more than double our trailing 12-month quarterly average and includes the 26,500 square foot lease at SB3 with a new customer that we discussed last quarter. The $159 average rental rate is in line with our trailing 12-month average. During the second quarter we executed four leases in excess of 2,000 square feet, resulting in our average lease size executed in Q2 of 490 square feet. Excluding the large backfill lease at SV3 our average lease size executed in Q2 was 270 square feet, 6% higher than our trailing twelve month average of 254 square feet. Regarding the geographic distribution of sales in the second quarter, our strongest markets in terms of annual GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases were Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Boston and Virginia. Regarding New York, Phase I of our NY2 facility consisting of the first three computer rooms brought to market, is now 19% occupied and 30% leased. We had limited, new and expansion signings at NY2 in Q2, however activity at this site has been strong and our follow-up reflects several opportunities at advanced stages of discussion. Regarding Northern Virginia, at our VA2 development in Reston, the skin is going on, generators and transformers are set on site and we expect to deliver the first phase of TKD inventory by September or October of this year. Related in Q2, we saw solid sales at VA1, as we work to drive occupancy in that building before we open VA2. To that, we believe that VA2 will deliver just as we become limited on large blocks of capacity at VA1. Turning to the performance of our verticals. Our network and cloud verticals together accounted for 51% of leases and 27% of annualizes GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in the second quarter. The digital content vertical was also quite strong this quarter, representing 25% of leases signed and 65% of annualized GAAP rent with substantial contribution from the large lease at SV3. We continue to see increased penetration with enterprises, with this vertical accounting for 19% of new and expansion leases signed in the quarter. As a point of reference, the number of our enterprise customers grew by 18% over the last 12 months. In the second quarter, we continue to experience strong net fiber ads across our network dense portfolio, with particular strength in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. Total fiber cross connect volume increased 19% year-over-year, with total connections growing by 9%. Regarding sales staffing, we\u2019re now 94% staffed in terms of frontline reps onboard with the company. After considering the extent to which newer reps are not yet fully off-ramp, the quarter coverage of our current team correlates to approximately 76% of where we expect to finish in 2014. Similar to the dynamic we discussed last quarter, all of our markets are substantially staffed, with the exception of the New York campus as we continued to hire that NY2. We are pleased with the concealed execution of our sales and marketing teams and focused upon further accelerating the sales pace we established in the first half of this year. Turning now to the view of the markets our outlook is substantially consistent with what we discussed last quarter. We\u2019ve seen a pickup in demand activity in the New York, New Jersey market although there remains a large supply of the available capacity in that market. We are seeing rents solidify in the Bay Area and sublease space has been absorbed and demand has remained robust. The downtown Chicago market is exhibiting increasing rents as near term supply remains somewhat limited. We continue to see Los Angeles, Boston and Miami as substantially consistent with last year. We are more optimistic on the margin regarding the Northern Virginia market than we have been in the last few quarter. Our analysis of this market continues to point at 60 MW of new supply coming to the Loudoun and Fairfax County sub market excluding the 23 MW Yahoo sub release. This compares to trailing annual absorption of approximately 40MW per year. We previously thought that this could lead to softening rents for undifferentiated requirements in the market. However our current final data suggest that the market may see better than expected absorption in 2014 somewhat offsetting the potential of near term oversupply. We continue to watch the market closely to see the extent to which final demand converts to signed leases in the market. Regarding our plans for continued investment in growth we remain very excited about our opportunity at our NY2 facility. Leveraging off the upfront cost we\u2019ve already invested in the asset. We believe we have the ability to construct approximately 16 MW of additional inventory at the site at an incremental cost of between $4.5 to $5.5 million per MW, with this low cost to deliver additional capacity we believe we may have the opportunity to invest significant additional capital into this investment at a yield on incremental investment that will meaningfully exceed our target of 12%. Similar to NY2 we are excited about our opportunities with our VA2 development in Reston. At that site we expect deliver a highly scalable 2000sq ft core and shell data center along with 3MW of TKD capacity in the first phase later this year. Much like NY2 at VA2 we believe we have the ability to construct approximately 9MW of additional inventory at the site at an incremental cost of between $4.5 and $5.5 million per MW. As such as at NY2 we believe that the follow on investment opportunity inherent at VA2 is substantial and brings the potential for strongly attractive yields on incremental capital. The combination of NY2 and VA2 alone represents 4,53,000 sq ft of new Class A product in two of the largest markets of US. Laying the foundation of opportunity to develop an aggregate of approximately 25 additional MW at an incremental cost substantially below for replacement cost. We believe this represents a mathematically significant opportunity for follow on investment a very strong returns on capital. Beyond NY2 and VA2 we remain focused upon driving occupancy in our existing TKD space which including the 3MW to be delivered at VA2 later this year represents 21% of our current portfolio. We believe this component of our portfolio represents a further opportunity to drive earnings and in this case with even more limited requirements for new capital. Further our follow-on investment opportunity in our LA2 and Boston locations provided added headroom to invest attractive yields and drive earnings with reduced requirements for new capital. Finally with regards to our growth plans based upon trailing sales in our current funnel we anticipate that our inventory availability will become more constrained in the Bay Area and downtown Chicago over the next 18 to 24 months. As such we are currently evaluating potential next steps in those markets as we access our broader strategic in growth plans all relative to the strong internal growth opportunity inside our existing asset base. In summary, we are pleased with our financial results thus far this year and very encouraged with the progress shown by our sales and marketing teams and with our execution on development activities for the year. With that I turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks Tom and hello everyone I\u2019ll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q2 financial results. Second I will update you on the development activity, third I will provide an update regarding our capital investments and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. And fourth I will update our outlook and guidance for the full year. Our second quarter data center revenues were $63.7 million a 3.3% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 14.5% increase over the prior year quarter. Our second quarter data center revenue consisted of $53.5 million in rental and power revenue up 5.1% sequentially and 14.2% year-over-year $8.6 million from interconnection revenue an increase of 6.6% sequentially in 21.8% year-over-year and $1.6 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $2 million substantially consistent with the first quarter in the prior year second quarter. Q2 lease commencements represented $8.2 million of annualized GAAP revenue, comprised of approximately 61,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $135 per square foot. Renewals in the second quarter totaled approximately 42,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $167 per square foot and represented mark-to-market growth of 2.1% and 8.1% on cash and GAAP basis respectively. We continue to expect full year cash rent growth in the range of 1% to 4%, churn in the second quarter was 1.8% at the high end of our expectations of 1% to 2% per quarter primarily due to the impact of the churn associated with the amendment to a single customer release at SV3. Our back log of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $6.9 million. We expect approximately 60% of the current backlog to commence in the remainder of 2014. I would point out that approximately 36% of the back log is associated with the new lease at SV3 which is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2016 at the point in time our current lease is completed. Excluding the impact of onetime items FFO was $0.51 per share and unit for Q2 representing an increase of 4.1% on a sequential basis and 13.3% year-over-year. Total reported FFO for the second quarter including onetime items was $0.57 per diluted share and unit. Related to onetime items in the second quarter we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1 million or $0.02 per share to FFO related to our ongoing IT and software development initiatives. As we discussed in the first quarter we embarked on a deep dive of our investment in internally developed IT systems and through further evaluation have decided that the currently available commercial off the shelf packages can effectively and efficiently address our business needs. Therefore with discontinued internal development on a number of work streams and recorded a commensurate impairment charge. Additionally in the second quarter we realized a benefit of approximately $3.7 million or $0.08 per share in FFO resulting from a true up of accrued real estate tax liabilities associated with estimated amounts from 2010 due to a change in ownership of our acquired properties at IPO. The final tax amounts for these properties acquired at IPO became known in the second quarter and we reconciled the actual amounts to the accruals accordingly. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned onetime items in second quarter adjusted EBIDA increased 12% year-over-year. In terms of total reported results including onetime items due to adjusted EBIDA was $34.1 million. Sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter were approximately 5.7% of total operating revenues in line with last quarter. We expect the sales and marketing expenses for the second half to be approximately 6% of total operating revenues. Our G&A expenses were 10.2% of total revenues down a 190 basis points from the previous quarter. We expect G&A expenses to be approximately 11% of revenue for the remainder of the year. As shown on the page 18 of our supplemental, we spent and expensed $2.6 million during the second quarter related to ongoing repairs and maintenance slightly above the average amount spent over the trailing 12 month period as of June 30th 2014 our stabilized operating data center portfolio was 85.4% occupied. Including leases executed at the end of Q2 but not yet commenced. Our stabilized data center occupancy rate would be 88%. I will now discuss our recently completed and ongoing development activity across the portfolio. As reported last quarter in Q1 we completed the last two computer rooms being delivered in Phase I at NY2 in Secaucus resulting approximately 53,000 net renewal square feet of data center space in our pre-stabilized pool at this asset. We now carry $43.3 million on our balance sheet as completed capacity plus $54.5 million as construction and process related to corn shell that is currently being held for future turnkey data center development. Regarding VA2 at the end of Q2 we carried $66.2 million of construction and process related to the asset. And we anticipate investing an additional $12.8 million this year to complete the corn shell and deliver 3 megawatts of turnkey data center capacity to the market. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, as we complete development projects we realize a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance resulting in a corresponding increase in the amount of operating expense. As a reminder we have included the percentage of gross interest capitalized on page 20 of the supplemental as you think about your models for 2014 we continue to expect the capitalization of interest to decrease to approximately 40% to 50% of total interest expense incurred similar to where we were in Q2. Turning to our balance sheet as Tom stated we strongly believe in our follow-on investment opportunity not only at NY2 and VA2 but across our current portfolio. As such we are focused upon maintaining the liquidity and capital to support these investment opportunities. And we believe we are well positioned to execute and fund this opportunity. Specifically as of June 30th 2014 our debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.0 times. And if you include our preferred stock it is 2.9 times. We continue to target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock to annualize adjusted EBITDA of approximately 4 times. As of June 30th 2014 we had $177 million drawn on our credit facility with approximately $221 million of available capacity. Regarding our mix of floating versus fixed rate debt plus preferred equity, as of June 30th 2014 we had a floating rate debt equivalent to 1.3 times Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA and the combination of our fixed rate debt plus preferred equity correlated to 1.6 times Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Finally excluding a onetime charge of $0.02 per share in the first quarter and the onetime net benefit recorded in the second quarter in the amount of $0.06 per share. We are increasing our guidance for FFO per diluted share and unit to arrange $2.07 to $2.15. From the previous range $2 to $2.10 including the impairment charge and net benefit of $0.06 per share noted previously. The updated 2014 guidance of FFO per diluted share and unit is $2.11 to $2.19. When excluding the net $0.04 benefit from the true up of real estate taxes and the impairment charges recorded through the first half of the year. The midpoint of our new guidance is $2.11 per share in unit. The $0.06 increase in organic guidance is been driven in part by increased revenue expectations for the second half of the year as well as lower property tax expenses offset to some extent by approximately $0.02 to $0.03 of accelerated non-real estate depreciation expected in the second half of this year related to our IT systems. We now expect total operating revenues of $265 million to $270 million compared to the previous range of $260 million to $270 million. Data center revenue is now expected to be $260 million to $265 million compared to the previous range of $255 million to $265 million. Lastly we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $127 million to $132 million compared to the previous range of $120 million to $125 million reflecting the outlook for higher revenues in the second half and the $3.7 million real estate [indiscernible]. A thorough summary of our 2014 guidance items can be found on page 21 of the earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we\u2019ve discussed today. Now we\u2019d like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Our first question today is coming from Emmanuel Korchman from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup: Hey good morning guys thanks for taking the questions. Jeff if we could stick to guidance for a second you said there was a $0.06 increase at the midpoint to 2014 FFO guidance part of that is increased revenues which on my numbers is $0.02 to $0.03 of that. How much is being driven by the property tax at the lower property taxes especially if you\u2019re saying that there\u2019s a depreciation offset? Jeff Finnin : Yeah overall when you look at the property tax run rate we would expect for the second half of this year to generate about a $0.5 million incremental FFO to the bottom line for the back half of the year so about the $0.01 a share. Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup: So you\u2019ve got $0.01 there let\u2019s call it something like a $3 million increase of revenues and you float it down with expenses you get probably again $0.03 to $0.04 there I\u2019m just not getting to $0.06 so what am I missing in terms of guidance shift \u2013 the guidance amendment? Jeff Finnin : Yeah I think overall when you look at the increase in revenues, Manny, there\u2019s really three things that\u2019s driving the increased revenues. If you look at overall we just got better visibility into the remainder of the year obviously plus what we were able to generate in sales for the first half. In addition the lease that we signed at SV3 add some incremental revenue there associated with the particular customer that the \u2013 this second quarter. And then thirdly the continued growth of our interconnection business as Tom alluded to. And as I mentioned in my call you know interconnection grew up in excess of 20% per quarter, all of that\u2019s been factored into the overall revenue guidance. And then ultimately you just need to assess how much of that you really drop under the bottom-line that incremental revenue a large portion of that if not substantially would be dropped into the bottom-line with the exception of some offset for power expense. So if you take that on the top line you\u2019ve got some, you\u2019ve got the property tax run rate that comes down by $0.5 million on the back half of the year offset to some extent with the non-real estate depreciation that I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well. Hopefully all that gets it to about the $0.05 to $0.06 I guess it\u2019s really $0.06 at the midpoint in the guidance. Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup: And then on SV3 the language in the press release perhaps an early termination on the last call we spent a lot of time talking about the fact that, that existing tenant would still be involved, is that still the case or should we read more into the early termination language? Thomas Ray : There\u2019s been no change so yeah I\u2019m sorry if we confused it this quarter but the prior tenant, get back our computer room, upon execution of the new lease were surely after execution of the new lease. The prior tenant will surrender another room in accordance with the terms of the lease. And that second room is already pre leased to the new tenant and that\u2019s, that\u2019s the story of the new tenancy. Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup: Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Atkin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Yes couple questions. First of all on the follow-on opportunities for expansion you gave some good color around Virginia and New York and then alluded to LA and Boston. I wonder if you can quantify to a little bit greater detail timing and magnitude of Latin Angles and Boston and when you\u2019re likely to expand. And then on the cross-connect strength you gave a kind of a geographic breakdown or the sources of that but qualitatively what do we think about as being the key drivers of the increased acceleration and the cross-connect revenues? Thomas Ray : Sure as to LA2 and Boston I guess at a high level John we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need additional inventory in LA2 in the next several quarters, we have enough there. And when we do add inventory there, there\u2019ll be smaller sequential add-ons. So I think that\u2019s the right way to look at it, you just look at our absorption and what\u2019s available to building and when that gets constrained we\u2019ll add a little bit more. Boston the approach is the same, moderate, adds to inventory as absorption demands. In Boston we are pretty tight on space right now, we have activity frankly and what\u2019s leftover at the moment. So we\u2019re going to look hard at a very small add in Boston maybe in the beginning of next year but just as needed and as lease is signed but neither of those markets are markets were you absorb a tremendous amount of capacity in the year so those would be fairly measured incremental adds. And as to cross-connects qualitatively I just think it\u2019s just the fruit of the business plan but this is what we wanted to do. We wanted to driver further network density, we\u2019ve been reporting record adds of network customers, network leases for the last year, year and half, two years. And we\u2019ve already said you kind of get a lot of cross-connects ramping in. Six to nine months after you sign the lease, after deployment and so I just think you\u2019re seeing, you\u2019re seeing the fruit of that show up in the numbers. Jonathan Atkin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Great and then if you could touch on Chicago and any kind of thoughts on expanding in that market whether it\u2019s downtown or suburban. Your competitor\u2019s maybe thinking similar as well but what do you see happening in that market in terms of new space becoming available either by yourself or by peers. And then just on the management side Steven Bryan is kind of settled into the roles. And I wondered what \u2013 you talked about kind of where you are in terms of quarter bearing headcount and so forth. Anything else you feel like sort of highlighting from a qualitative standpoints in terms of go-to-market approach? Thomas Ray : You bet. And Jon I would add you\u2019re getting four for one on this, that\u2019s okay because we love you. As to Chicago what we said in the prepared remarks we\u2019ll evaluate it since we\u2019re \u2013 we have a little bit of availability in our Chicago one asset to convert, to data center capacity still but that\u2019s not going to last forever. And so our next move in Chicago might necessarily would be a little bit larger move than just converting one floor of 20,000 feet. And so it just takes thought we\u2019re going to look at all of our opportunities for our capital and look at the broader operating environment and make a decision. So we just, we haven\u2019t made any decisions regarding what or when in Chicago and we can\u2019t guide anybody else and what was the fourth question? Steven Bryan I think it\u2019s \u2013 again we\u2019re doing what we wanted to do this year. And you\u2019re right we have very good people executing in their roles and producing quantified results. I think the only thing I would add is just, underscore what we said over the last two quarters and then what we said in this script and that is in order to hit the quota coverage that we would like to hit and we expect to hit as a run rate at the end of this year. We need to be substantially fully staffed with quota bearing heads by the end of Q2 then we met that objective. We were 94% then I would characterize the 6% as fairly standard churn and so what we wanted to have for complimented of \u2013 of quota bearing reps in place and we\u2019ve done that. Hats off to Steven Bryan and hats off to our HR group, Veena Bricker and a lot of internal staffing. So we what I would add is, I think we\u2019re executing and doing what he came here to do. Jonathan Atkin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Thank you. Wanted to \u2013 question on the leasing volume. Good numbers this quarter obviously curious if there\u2019s been any change in the compensation structure to sales people, in the quarter or over the course of this year to sort of kick start the effort? Thomas Ray : None we put in a slightly revised and updated comp plan at the beginning of this year. And fairly normal we evaluate sales comp each year and we\u2019ll make some tweaks but our approach to sales comp this year is to not mess with it. Just let people rely on what they see in front of them or let our sales teams rely on a structure and a pattern and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. So no, no changes. Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. And how do we \u2013 looking at the sort of capitalized leasing cost. How do we think about those in the context of just on an everyday basis or on a quarterly basis, I know they\u2019re going to move around? We\u2019ve seen them move around but last couple of quarters they\u2019ve come in little bit higher, anything in particular driving that? Jeff Finnin : Hey Jon its Jeff. A couple of things when you look at the year-to-date amounts of the capitalized leasing cost, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve incurred about $9.4 million of total leasing cost. One item that is driving that higher this year and we\u2019ve talked a little bit about it on previous calls is related to purposely going out in retaining and renewing our customers here in the marketplace that is leading to some higher associated commissions in line with the transaction we did back in 2012 with the previous owner of that business. So that amount is, is in the first six months that amounting resulted in about $4.2 million here in the first half. That together with the transaction we signed at SV3 is leading higher commissions as well as we had one incremental commission on an office lease that we finalized and put into place and commenced here in the second quarter at SV1 in the Bay Area. Thomas Ray : I\u2019m going to hit the former point with a hammer just because I think it has been maybe not as clear to the investment community. When we bought the compliment business in Denver as we disclosed it that time we paid the certain amount upfront with a deferred payment structure. Some people might call that an earn out Jordon but our accountants do not. And the way that deferred payment associated with the purchase agreement is structured it\u2019s in relation to signing leases. So they\u2019re committed they are but they are, those commissions are payable only in association with that PSA a purchase and sale agreement. And at the end of this year there\u2019s a measurement date related to that purchase and sale agreement related to these commissions that are driven by signed leases. And at the of that year and that measurement period you won\u2019t see further accruals related to those activities. Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay that\u2019s helpful stuff. Hey Jeff could you just throw us the cash backlog number? Jeff Finnin : Yeah the cash backlog number is $10.8 million Jordan. Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Perfect thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore: Great, thanks. Maybe first I\u2019ll do a little follow-up on the lease commission question. And then I have a few others. I think in the last 10-Q Jeff you guys had targeted or thought the lease commissions associated with the Confluent acquisition would be I think in the $8 million range, is that still the right number? Jeff Finnin : Yeah I\u2019d say as we sit here today and you\u2019ll see the 10-Q filed later this \u2013 I guess actually probably tomorrow or Friday, that number is at $8.9 million. Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore: Thank you. Just two other questions, first there was still really good momentum around the MRO per cabinet. I think it was up about 7% year-over-year and I was wondering if you might give us some sort of insight into through the breakout of your, of your footprint between say wholesale and retail or some other sort of insight into where we might think that MRO could go over time. And then the last question and I think you talked a little bit about this but with occupancy still high right now. And I think it\u2019s the highest that I\u2019ve seen on record. Do you have the ability to meet the demand that you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. Thanks. Jeff Finnin : Sure with regard to occupancy and our ability to meet demand I think absolutely we disclosed some of our occupancy statistics in terms of the stabilized portfolio Jon from the net lease out. The development properties that have been delivered but are not yet stabilized. So if you look at total availability across the portfolio and you include the three we\u2019re about to deliver at VA2 over the next handful of months. We\u2019re about 79% to 80% occupied, so we feel like we\u2019ve really maintained and we\u2019ve been running at that number somewhere between 75% and 85% for the last four years. So our expectation at growth from the turnkey data center capacity that we deliver to the market frankly is the same as it\u2019s been for the last 4 years. I think what\u2019s a little bit different right now is thatVA2 and NY2 investments bring tremendous additional scalability. That low incremental investment relative to that replacement cost. So as we view it honestly John, we do our internal growth opportunity right now better than it\u2019s been over the last 4 years, same within the existing store with a lot more on the attractive follow on capability we\u2019ve ever had. Thomas Ray : And John just a little bit more color on the occupancy as Tom brings up the difference between our pre-stable and stable pools. On the pre-stable, just keep in mind as we go into 2015 first quarter, we outline on page 18 exactly when those pre-state pools or developments will come into our stabilized pool. And so that may have some impact on the occupancy, it just depends ultimately the percentage occupied ultimately when they roll into the stabilized pool. Secondly on your other question around MR per [indiscernible] the revenue growth is just shy of 8% year-over-year is really coming away from three component, first of all it is as those customers renew we are getting some uplift from a rental perspective and you know our numbers reflect that in terms of the rent growth we reported this quarter and in previous quarters, so that\u2019s part of it. Secondly is just the incremental cross connect and interconnection revenue coming as those customers add incremental cross connects. And thirdly it would relate to some level of incremental power to the extent they\u2019re adding power in that same particular space. Jeff Finnin : And I think at the highest level we\u2019ve talked about, there\u2019s a meaningful discount between our revenue per rack between some other folks in the industry and us, and we\u2019ve been working purposely to close that gap. We\u2019ve closed a portion of it, but frankly there\u2019s a lot of head room left to work on and we continue to believe in our ability to keep moving that up, moving up ARPU and close more of that gap. Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore: If I can sneak just one more in here, do you have a number for what percent of your bookings came from your existing base for the quarter? Jeff Finnin : We don\u2019t have it in our fingertips, Johnson it will be probably, technically it will be a little bit higher than in the past because of the large lease at SV3 which was an existing customer, the end user under that was not an existing customer. So that there\u2019s a new relationship there, but because of the SV3 lease, we typically run in that kind of 65% to 80% range. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it\u2019s little bit higher on the cube. We\u2019ll have to go look at that, we didn\u2019t check it this time. Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore: Thank you for taking the questions. Jeff Finnin : Thanks John. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Rogers \u2013 RW Bear. Please proceed with your question. Dave Rogers \u2013 RW Bear : May be for Tom I want to ask a couple of different questions may be around leafing spreads as you look to that going forward. You\u2019ve given guidance for the second half of the year and you\u2019ve been pretty much tightly within that range for the first half, any variability in the second half of that number do you think around each of the two quarters? You look at 2015 and I know it\u2019s a little early, I think it\u2019s big year of exploration than in the average rate next year as well and in that where you have been signing deals, any color you can give on the second half of this year and both this year and next year what you should be thinking about that? Thomas Ray : Yeah look, I think the spread should follow market racks and relative to the trailing 12 we expect you know the rest of this year to be more favorable. So we\u2019ll have to see what that leads to, but the markets are, I think, more healthy. And I think we\u2019re executing in the markets more favorably than we did on the trail, so hopefully that will lead to not pressure, but some upside in terms of 2015 explorations, look Jeff we have a very disciplined process around doing a deep dive on the top 20 roles and getting very specific information about those. And then we do a statistical analysis on what\u2019s left over and we look at the in place ramp versus where we think the market is. And we don\u2019t see anything out there that is concerning, and in terms of more specifics around churn and market to market, they\u2019ll come out with our new guidance at the beginning of the year, but I would say we think we\u2019re pretty disciplined about looking at that, and there are no bombs hiding out there. Jeff Finnin : And Dave, in terms of the other question around Q3 versus Q4 variability, the only thing to be sure you factor in is Q3 is typically our one quarter where our power expense tends to be higher just do the summer rates. So you will generally see a reduction in the overall contribution from the power portion of our revenues, just keep that in mind as you look at Q3 versus Q4. Dave Rogers \u2013 RW Bear : And mainly on the same topic that\u2019s all in the same topic FD3 can you recap for us what the impact of the spread there is or was or will be I guess I should say, and then when you\u2019ll really recognize the impact of that? Thomas Ray : We can\u2019t provide any financial information that would lead to back solving the restructuring of the tenant that gave some space back or the economics of the tenant moved in. We can say it is MPB and FFO positive, we think that across the Bay area market, when you look at everything we\u2019re doing there; we\u2019re probably a couple pennies up. Two sets of FFO more favorable to the company\u2019s bottom line across that old market than we thought we\u2019d be at the beginning of the year. And there\u2019s a component of GAAP that is related to the SV3 transaction and that\u2019s the best we can give people. Dave Rogers \u2013 RW Bear : Okay I appreciate that, and may be tell on your comments both on the capped interest as well as new investment opportunities. The development pipeline as thin as we\u2019ve seen it I think maybe since you\u2019ve come public. And I guess if you talk a little bit more about how purposeful that is maybe to be able to drive more occupancy in what you term the portfolio, or what is out there today. Is it more of a function of timing or supply in the market that is keeping you a little bit more cautious about that back log, is it more internally willing to execute or is it surely about opportunities and I guess there\u2019s a lot there. If you can give some color on where that might be headed Tom it will be helpful? Thomas Ray : Yeah, it is what we\u2019ve been saying, the bottom line is we have capacity in most of our markets we were out and we were headed out towards running out in Virginia first, so we\u2019ve addressed that and we wanted to have a stronger presence in New York, so we\u2019ve addressed that as a strategic goal. In addressing those strategic objectives, we have laid out what we foresee as our best internal growth capability we\u2019ve ever had. So we\u2019ve always liked having a disciplined balance sheet that leads to \u2013 that can support potential opportunities down the road. For other strategic objectives, may be to use that tool may be you don\u2019t, but we like having that weapon available to us, which is a balance sheet with room in it. We have the ability to grow tremendously off the investments that are on the plate right now. So I would say we\u2019re very happy with the risk return profile of the company. It would be different if we were also out of inventory in LA and out of inventory in three or four other markets. We\u2019d be having a different discussion, but we have room to run in most of our markets, we\u2019ve addressed two big strategic moves on the East Coast. We do need to start thinking about Chicago and in Santa Claire over the next couple of years. We have landed developing Santa Claire should we choose to and we just like the risk return profile and importantly we like the capital profile of how we run the business right now. We\u2019re happy and we think we\u2019re going to do good things for our investors. Dave Rogers \u2013 RW Bear : Great then one last question, sorry just in terms of any competitive discussions that you\u2019ve had with tenants that make you think about open \u2013 the more competitive platform to you today than a year ago? Thomas Ray : You know sincerely. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had challenging discussions about cross connections, certainly in the last quarter in Q2 to date, I sincerely think that 99% of the discussions I\u2019ve had about cross connection Open IX have been with mostly analysts, not customers. Dave Rogers \u2013 RW Bear : Talk one more, thanks. Thomas Ray : Turn it up, Dave Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Colby Synesael \u2013 Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Colby Synesael \u2013 Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure I understand this and I apologize if it\u2019s been said and I just didn\u2019t pick it up but the 26,000 square feet the customer in the Bay Area you talked about. I think you said that you\u2019re going to commence that in the second quarter of 2016 I just want to make sure I understand that from the revenue will actually start to come in the door. And then as part of that I guess, part of that 26,000 feet is space been taken up by the customer who\u2019s returning 12.6000 square feet. And I was trying to get a sense when you stop recognizing revenue from that 12,600 square feet and if you can write it actually how much revenue is associated with that. So let me just stop there and then I have a follow-up question. Jeff Finnin : Let\u2019s just take the highest level one on the transaction again SV3 and again we, we just can\u2019t give you guys any granular financial data related to the lease that went out, the lease that went in but at the highest level the building is four computer rooms. The existing tenants before this provision to occupy and leased off four of them. We leased two of those rooms for a total of 26,000 feet to a new customer. And half of that space or in this case 12,500 just because the size of rooms but the first room has already been vacated by the old customer. And the new customer has moved into it. And that, the earning from that are now coming through our income statement beginning in Q2 that was there. A year from now, two years from now the second computer room, the remaining square footage of the total 26,000 that room expires by its own terms on the prior customer. And the new customer has already leased it from us. Thomas Ray : And that\u2019s the piece of revenue that won\u2019t commence until the second quarter of 2016. Jeff Finnin : Maybe one way to think of this, we did two 12.500 foot leases essentially and one is already started and the old customers moved out. The other one the customer will move out, the newer will move in, in two years in accordance with that leases LXD. Colby Synesael \u2013 Cowen and Company : So I guess post second quarter the situation on all moving parts if you will, associate with SP3 and [indiscernible] result, is that right? Thomas Ray : Well you will see a commencement and a churn \u2013 Colby Synesael \u2013 Cowen and Company : Yeah in 2015 but you\u2019ve already all the pieces have been figured out in terms of what goes where. Thomas Ray : They\u2019re all in place, as to the first half of that building. It\u2019s all done. Colby Synesael \u2013 Cowen and Company : And is the customer who is initially the four computer rooms too which they\u2019ve now what they will be vacating. Are they going to also for your understanding vacate the remaining two at some point? Thomas Ray : I think that\u2019s more likely than not but we honestly don\u2019t know and kind of what we\u2019ve been saying for the last couple of years but because the customer doesn\u2019t know. The customer may need to keep those. And again we have a great relationship with that customer, very open dialogue. It\u2019s just unclear but what there was an opportunity for us to eliminate risk as they have to build and make money doing it, that\u2019s done. And as to the other half of the building that the amount of capacity that would come back if they did move out is less than one year of trailing absorption and so we were very comfortable with that but they may keep it who knows. Colby Synesael \u2013 Cowen and Company : When did the lease and the other two computer rooms that you were referring to right now. When do those expire? Thomas Ray : One of those in two years, one of those in three years. Colby Synesael \u2013 Cowen and Company : Okay, perfect. And then I guess a different question just a real quick housekeeping item. Do you plan executing the accordion feature of the term loan in the second half I mean obviously you\u2019re keeping the cash balance pretty tight right now, you have variety of different projects going on. Can you just kind of give us your thoughts on how you \u2013 I know you have room in your leverage. Can you just kind of remind us how you plan on paying for all these various things? Thomas Ray : Yeah Colby I think as we sit here today we don\u2019t have any firm plans to execute the accordion on a term loan. However it\u2019s just one of the options available to us as we look out and look at what our available capital needs and sources are, as we look at the back half of this year and early into 2015. So what we monitor that plus all the other market opportunities and capital that\u2019s available to us. And ultimately when we look at pulling down a commutable debt capital, it\u2019s one that we look at but it will depend ultimately on the amount we need and the pricing will lead to those sources. Colby Synesael \u2013 Cowen and Company : For our own modeling purposes would you suggest that whatever incremental cash we feel that you need beyond what\u2019s currently on your balance sheet as of June 30th we just pull it from the credit facility? Thomas Ray : I think that\u2019s a good way to model as you look at the rest of the share absolutely. Colby Synesael \u2013 Cowen and Company : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Barry McCarver from Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. McCarver \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Hey good morning guys, good quarter and thanks for taking my questions. I think you\u2019ve got most of them, I did have one. Tom on your prepared remarks talking about northern Virginia and renewal rates there it sounded like you were a little bit pleasantly surprised that, that rates have remained so firm in that market despite quite a bit of capacity. A little more color on I guess the top of business that CoreSite seeing and maybe your thoughts as to why pricing has been so stable? Thomas Ray : Well you know we were pleased, our bitter concern really was from this point forward in the market as a significant amount of new supply hits the market. So I\u2019d say that, I think rents in the market on a year-over-year basis were up about 6% on the trail versus the you before then for us at CoreSite in northern Virginia again our big concern was going forward. And we\u2019re, there is just a lot of activity in the market. There are lot of big block deals in the market that are not CoreSite deals but other people might be interesting in them. And that might take some of the pressure off absorb some of that spec supply early. And the kind of activity we\u2019re seeing is completely consistent with what we are seeing ever since we\u2019ve been in that market. It\u2019s an amazingly broad market in terms of the sources and demand. You have an attractive cost of power there so for regional requirements Virginia has been an area that\u2019s one lot of out of market regional base requirement let\u2019s say a company wants big presence in the East and the West. Virginia captures some of that out of region demand we have a great government situation there. You have an excellent internet and telecom demand base there. I shouldn\u2019t have said great government situation but, you have demand from the government. And so there was a very broad base of demand generators across industries and which has led a very steady absorption. So we are there\u2019s the chance and I mean really we just have to get side right now it is little more than I hope. But there\u2019s reason to be hopeful that some of these big blocks of supply will get taken out reasonably early and lead the continued stability in that market. But we are going to have to see pens put to paper for that to happen. McCarver \u2013 Stephens Inc.: That\u2019s very helpful thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you our next question today is coming from Prior Cristanio from Jeffries. Please proceed with your question. Prior Cristanio \u2013 Jeffries: Good afternoon congrats on the good quarter most of my questions have been answered but just a follow on V2 I appreciate the comment about the Virginia market overall but specifically with your asset I was just how you guys are feeling about pre-leasing before it opens and what is kind of leasing velocity could look like whether you\u2019re kind forecasting more like what\u2019s happening to NY2 asset, we expect things to move a little bit faster or slower just trying to get a general sense for modeling purposes. Thomas Ray : I would say we do feel on the margin better about continuing the traction Virginia that we\u2019ve been enjoying at VA1. The situation for us in Virginia is different than New York. It\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s really a new market for us. We had to lease up with the staff up as you guys know and we are finishing that process. In Virginia we have a team on ground and we got an excellent team on the ground for quite some time. And so we think we\u2019re going to be better able to just keep marching in Virginia rather than even to start things up as we needed to do in New York. So we\u2019re optimistic, we are hopeful the funnel has some new good opportunities in it. And we will just see what happens but we would hope that will go little bit faster than that startup Phase in NY2. Prior Cristanio \u2013 Jeffries: Sounds good to me, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Petersen from MLV & Co. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Petersen \u2013 MLV & Co.: Great thanks. You talked about enterprises, how that kind of been growing as a tenant base and I think it\u2019s at up 18% over last 12 months. I was hoping you could talk about kind of that trend relative to what we read in the press. We\u2019d like the aggressive push by Microsoft and Google and Amazon. Recently they offered like a lot of storage for corporate users. And I am just curious from the ground level speaking to customers why they make decision to go to CoreSite rather than outsourcing a public cloud? Thomas Ray : I think that decision is really driven by the enterprise decision to what extend to use the public cloud versus the private cloud. And the private cloud environment is quite often going out to a third party data center provider. And that decision is still driven by security and cost. We haven\u2019t really seen it, I think that will continue to be the case. So for workloads that are not highly secure and that are may be less predictable. When you have something that isn\u2019t very sensitive and you need burst capacity or you need capacity for certain amount of time. The public cloud is a great way to solve for that need. When you have a very predictable set of very large long-term workloads I think we still see enterprises find better economics in putting those in a private cloud and using their own infrastructure. So the issues surrounding when enterprises go to the public cloud versus when they do it on their own, have been around for a number of years and I think they are holding steady. I just think you see such tremendous growth in data in bits and bytes in workloads that the public clouds are growing very rapidly and you see private cloud activity growing very rapidly as well. Jonathan Petersen \u2013 MLV & Co.: Okay. Can you give us any examples of may be like stand out sectors whether its healthcare financials or energy or any of that we could think of is like a typical tenant of CoreSite and what kind of applications they run are there any good examples for that. Thomas Ray : You might think of it more in terms of workloads or requirements been companies or industries. I mean the financial service industries or health care industry might have a greater portion of its workload in data that they want to keep secure and in private. But let\u2019s take up any of those companies to extent they have visual mundane back office needs for their own internal networks, employee email. That\u2019s not sensitive so when they are very comfortable putting that into public cloud environment. And then the only question is cost. Is the public cloud going to be less expensive or more expensive. I think just like real estate, when a user in the cloud environment knows how much data storage and processing capacity they need and they know they\u2019re going to need it for a long time. I think they can still get a better deal if they use private club. When they have to burst the public cloud makes sense. So for any company they have some information that is sensitive. They have some information that isn\u2019t. So that\u2019s the security filter by which they look at public versus private clouds. And then separately you have a cost filter. Jonathan Petersen \u2013 MLV & Co.: Okay I appreciate the color. Thank you Operator : Our next question is a follow up from Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore: Great no conference call would be complete without an question on M&A and so as you over the hour here so this would give the opportunity to at least complete it. Tom we haven\u2019t seen a M&A in the sector just wondering your perspective on whether you think this space needs M&A. And then may be some other reasons that we haven\u2019t seen so much or what might be impetus to see M&A occur thanks? Thomas Ray : Well I believe the analysis the industry to others. Jonathan and you guys probably have a [indiscernible] as we do as to who is going to do what we can\u2019t speak for other folks clearly there\u2019s been talk and discussion of various M&A opportunities among various parties for ever since we\u2019ve been public. As for us we are open minded because we\u2019re just clinical about driving returns on capital for investors. As we\u2019ve said consistently we have a very high bar with regard to risk and return on transformational M&A because we believe very strongly in our ability to make a lot more money for our investors what we perceive as lower risk that\u2019s inside or existing portfolio. So look we are open you can see scenarios where footprints are complimentary and that might lead to a little bit better reach for customers. You certainly see G&A savings but we have a good business and we\u2019re going to keep operating it. And if there is something smart to do we\u2019ll take a look at it. How\u2019s that for a non-answer? Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partner : Pretty good non-answer. Thomas Ray : Okay Jonathan. So I am running for office so I am just practicing. I\u2019m not by the way. Operator : Thank you we\u2019ve reached the end of question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ray for any further closing comments. Thomas Ray : Alright. We just want to thank everybody for being on the call and joining us as we look at in front of us. We feel like we really started to generate some momentum in the first half of the year. Our objective is to leverage off that and accelerate it in the second half of the year. We want to thank the people at CoreSite we always thank our investors and our board which we do again but the people at CoreSite have driven what you\u2019re seeing unfold in front of you right now been its on their backs and their hard work that it\u2019s happening. We are grateful to them, we think we have a great road in front of us. And we think we\u2019re off to the races so we are going to keep working on serving customers being disciplined about where we send our cash and just driving returns to our common equity. Thanks for your time. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

My name is Lea and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the American Tower\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After your speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Leah Stearns, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury, you may begin your conference. Leah Stearns - Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury : Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab on our website. Our agenda for this morning\u2019s call will be as follows. First, I will provide a brief overview of our third quarter results, then Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO will review our financial and operational performance for the quarter, as well as our updated outlook for 2014, and finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO will provide closing remarks. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our 2014 outlook and future operating performance, our expectations regarding our future growth, industry trends, leasing demand, leverage and any other statements regarding facts and circumstances that are not historical. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning\u2019s press release, those set forth in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 and in our other filings with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. And with that, please turn to Slide 4 of the presentation which provides a summary of our third quarter 2014 results. During the quarter, our rental and management business accounted for over 97% of our total revenues, which were generated from leasing income producing real estate primarily to investment grade corporate tenants. This revenue grew 26.9% from the third quarter of 2013 to over $1 billion. In addition, our adjusted EBITDA grew 26.2% to approximately $666 million, adjusted funds from operations increased 25.2% to approximately $460 million and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was approximately $200 million or $0.50 per basic and diluted common share. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Tom Bartlett - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone and thank you for being here with us this morning. As you can see from our press release our business continued to perform well in the third quarter. Elevated wireless CapEx spend in the U.S. led to strong growth in the quarter and wireless network initiatives by large multinational carriers in our other markets allowed us to post solid results internationally as well. As a result, we are raising our full year 2014 outlook for all of our key metrics. If you please turn to Slide 6, our total rental and management revenue in the quarter increased by nearly 27% to over $1 billion. On a core growth basis, our total rental and management revenue growth was more than 31%. Of this core growth, nearly 12% was organic driven by continuing strong new business commencements. The balance of our core growth of over 19% was attributable to properties we have acquired since the beginning of Q3 2013. This includes the GTP portfolio, which generated organic core growth of over 10% during the quarter outpacing the growth rate even of our legacy domestic portfolio. Turning to Slide 7, our domestic rental and management revenue growth in the quarter was over 25% with core growth of around 28%. Domestic organic core growth was over 9%, which consisted of just over 3% from escalations and more than 8% from existing site revenue growth less 1.6% from tenant churn. This organic core growth reflects our tenants continued aggressive network investments in 4G. In the U.S. about two-thirds of the commenced new business activity we saw in the quarter outside of our holistic master lease agreements was in the form of amendments. Similar to the year ago period after several quarters of an increasing proportion of new leases we saw very active amendment activity, which reflects additional equipment being placed on towers by our customers in part driven by VoLTE rollouts. As a result of the continuing strong new business trends in the U.S. we are raising our expectations for organic core growth in the U.S. to 9.5% for the full year. Domestic rental and management gross margin increased by almost 22% to $530 million and grew by about 26% on a core basis. Domestic organic gross margin core growth was about 9% and reflects a nearly 80% conversion rate for properties we have owned since the beginning of Q3 of last year. We constructed nearly 200 towers in the quarter and purchased or extended the remaining term on more than 500 ground leases with the extensions averaging about 34 years. As of the end of the quarter 64% of the land under our U.S. towers was either owned or controlled for more than 20 years and we continue to target about 80% for that metric within the next three years. Within the framework of this target we continue to focus on extending our land leases for significant terms or purchasing the land beneath our towers where the return on invested capital meets our required hurdle rates. Finally, we generated domestic rental and management operating profit growth of nearly 22% or about 26% on a core basis. Moving on to Slide 8, our international rental and management segment generated revenue growth of over 30% or about 37% on a core basis during the quarter. Of this core growth about 18% was organic with the balance driven by the over 8,000 new assets we have acquired or constructed since the beginning of the third quarter of 2013. Similar to the U.S. we are seeing a very strong demand backdrop overseas especially in Brazil where we had another record quarter of commenced new business. Excluding pass-through revenue, our total international organic core growth was over 13%. Organic core growth rates across the international footprint were strong with India in particular seeing a step up in site leasing activity. In fact a 13% organic core revenue growth rate excluding pass-through we saw in India, specifically during the quarter was the highest in several years. This growth includes increased wireless CapEx spending by the large carriers including a significant contribution to new business from Reliance Jio. International rental and management gross margin in the quarter grew 25% to about $212 million, while core growth in gross margin was about 31%. Our international gross margin conversion rate was about 52% in the quarter or 72% excluding pass-through. Our international rental and management segment operating profit grew nearly 30% to $180 million, while the operating profit percentage was about 51%. Excluding the effects of pass-through revenue, our international operating profit margin was about 70%. Turning to Slide 9, our reported adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter was 26% with adjusted EBITDA core growth at nearly 32%. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin was 64.2% and excluding the impact of international pass-through revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was over 70% and our adjusted EBITDA conversion rate was about 66%. This conversion ratio was impacted by our 2013 acquisitions, which have lower margin profiles due to lower initial tendencies than our legacy assets as well as $11 million in year over year net straight line decreases in the quarter. Cash SG&A as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was about 8.4%. And for the full year we continue to expect our cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be under 9%. Part of this outperformance is attributable to the GTP portfolio where we have achieved the synergies embedded in our deal model much faster than we expected. Our strong EBITDA performance resulted in solid growth in AFFO, which increased to $460 million or $1.15 per share. AFFO and AFFO per share growth were both about 25% with core AFFO growth 28% driven by strong organic new business growth, coupled with the impact of a number of FFO accretive acquisitions. Our adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion rate during the quarter was about 67%. Moving on to Slide 10, we remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Year-to-date, we have distributed over $400 million to stockholders through our dividend, invested over $700 million in CapEx, spent over $500 million on acquisitions, and have reduced our total debt by nearly $550 million. As a result, we continue to prove our ability to simultaneously return capital to stockholders, deploy capital for accretive investments, and maintain our investment grade balance sheet. We continue to expect that our primary method of returning capital to stockholders for the rest of this year will be through our REIT distributions as well as dividend payments to holders of our mandatory convertible preferred stock. The amounts and timing of our REIT distributions are at the discretion of our Board, but our goal continues to be to deliver annual growth of over 20%. And over the last 12 months, this growth has been nearly 26%. Our net leverage as of quarter end was approximately 5.1 times on an LQA basis and we continue to maintain a long-term target range of between 3 to 5 times. We have maintained significant liquidity and as of the end of the quarter had about $3.4 billion of cash in borrowing capacity under our revolvers. Our average remaining term of debt is over 5 years with an average cost of approximately 4%. Turning to Slide 11, based on the strong customer demand trends we are seeing across our footprint, we are raising our full year 2014 outlook for rental and management segment revenue by $10 million at the midpoint to $3.99 billion. This increase is driven by $12 million in organic revenue outperformance in our domestic business partially offset by $2 million decrease in U.S. straight line. On the international side, we are keeping our projections for revenue consistent with prior expectations as revenue outperformance driven by organic growth and about $5 million in incremental pass-through is expected to be offset by some incremental FX headwinds in Q4. As a reminder, BR Towers portfolio, which we expect to close during the fourth quarter is not included in these projections. For the year, we expect core growth in consolidated rental and management segment revenue of nearly 27%, which includes organic core growth of 9.5% and 16% for our domestic and international segments respectively. On a consolidated basis, we expect organic core revenue growth to be about 11% for the full year. In addition, while not yet included in our core organic metrics, the portfolios we have acquired since the beginning of 2013 continued to deliver solid results and are expected to contribute over $640 million in revenue to our full year results. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $15 million at the midpoint, which primarily reflects the favorable revenue trends we are experiencing, the year-to-date strong performance of our services segment and our continued focus on cost management. The midpoint of our outlook reflects gross margin conversion rates of 67% and SG&A as a percentage of revenue at about 8.7%. On a consolidated basis, we now expect core growth and adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be nearly 27%. And finally, we are raising our full year AFFO outlook at the midpoint by $35 million, reflecting the $15 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and a $20 million decrease in maintenance CapEx. This decrease in maintenance CapEx is largely driven by increased efficiency within our maintenance operations, primarily in the area of new lighting systems. We now expect to generate AFFO growth of about 23% for the year or over 26% on a core basis. Moving on to Slide 12 and in summary we have been able to carryover the operating momentum we saw in the first half of the year into the third quarter. Strong U.S. organic core growth in revenue continues to be driven by investments in 4G coverage in capacity, while most of the international activity we are seeing is related to significant investments in 3G. We translated this organic core growth, together with contributions from new assets to solid adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share growth in the quarter, with both metrics significantly outperforming our long-term growth targets. In addition, we declared a common dividend of $0.36 per share or about $143 million representing an increase of nearly 29% as compared to the third quarter of 2013. We believe we are well-positioned to sustain this momentum and as a result are once again raising our 2014 outlook across all of our key metrics. By year end, we expect to have deployed about $3 billion through our capital allocation program and to have simultaneously achieved our de-levering targets. Although we will wait to issue formal 2015 guidance until our Q4 call in February, we remain confident that our long-term target range of 6% to 8% organic core growth in the U.S. and at least 200 to 300 basis points above that in our international markets is supported by the underlying demand trends we are seeing across our footprint. We believe that this organic growth complemented by our consistent and disciplined capital allocation strategy will enable us to continue to deliver strong growth in AFFO per share. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take Q&A. Jim? Jim Taiclet - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. It has been our practice in prior third quarter calls, I will focus today\u2019s remarks on the fundamental trends in wireless technology and markets, which we believe will continue to drive network investment and long-term growth for American Tower. Based on the integration of our most recent internal and external research, our main three conclusions are that : first, the number one factor that correlates to our U.S. core organic growth rate is the total amount of data traffic carried on the domestic networks of the major carriers; the second is the consumers that upgrade from basic functionality to smartphone type handsets in the U.S. or elsewhere to use substantially more data per month and that their data usage then increases significantly over time after they upgrade; and third, within our international served markets, handset upgrades and related data growth are likely to occur at a much more rapid pace that has been the case in the U.S. due in part to significantly cheaper handset pricing. So, let\u2019s begin by diving into the results of our most recent assessment of the drivers of our domestic organic core growth. Using our multi-variant regression analysis, we found that wireless carrier CapEx spending, total carrier service revenue, and data as a percentage of service revenue, do continue to be among the key indicators. However, one specific metric exceeded all of these as well as the other 26 independent variables that were evaluated. That number one metric with the highest predictive relationship to our domestic growth rate was total mobile data traffic. We then evaluated the underlying drivers of total mobile data traffic and the resulting long-term forecast for its growth in the U.S. We found two predominant root causes of data traffic growth here. The first being the number of devices in the market by technology type, basic feature phones primarily designed for talk, text and e-mail versus smartphones with a much broader array of apps for Internet use, social networking, gaming and entertainment generally utilizing a touch-screen interface. The second root cause identified was the increase in monthly data usage of each type of device over time is measured in gigabytes per month. When combined, these factors underpin the projected doubling of data traffic every 2 years to the end of this decade on the U.S. wireless network. Let\u2019s spend a few moments on smartphone device penetration in U.S. as shown on the next slide. In the United States, the launch of the original Apple iPhone in 2007 and the App Store in 2008 served as catalyst for widespread smartphone adoption. However, it took until 2012 for smartphone penetration to first overtake the basic feature phone. And even today, 30% of the U.S. population still has yet to upgrade to a smartphone. Three years after that first iPhone launch, U.S. wireless carriers began deployment of their fourth generation or 4G mobile networks to meet anticipated consumer demand that they were seeing. Early adopters of 4G saw tremendous improvement in the quality of their mobile experience, especially with respect to video, music and social media applications. Consequently, 4G subscribers gravitated to more and more advanced applications or apps, that requires significantly higher bandwidth. The resulting proliferation of mobile video, for example, is now one of the major drivers of overall mobile data traffic growth in the U.S. For example, watching a 30-minute Netflix Show in high-definition uses 164 megabytes of data. This is the equivalent of sending 11,000 e-mails as you can see on the chart. The proportion of consumers who regularly stream TV shows and movies on their smartphones continues to grow across all demographics with the highest levels of growth unsurprisingly concentrated among younger consumers. In just the last year, the percentage of adults age 18 to 24 who watch TV shows and movies at least once a week on their smartphones increased by 50% with nearly half of consumers in this age group watching shows weekly using their smartphone device. Consumers are also streaming more music, which is driving increasing traffic over the mobile network. One domestic carrier is even offering consumers free music streaming with a data subscription in an effort to compete for more wireless subscribers. Streaming one song uses around 2 megabytes of wireless data. So, a consumer that streams 30 minutes of music each way on their commute to work over the course of a month uses nearly a gigabyte of data, which is equivalent to sending 60,000 e-mails. The longer a subscriber uses a 4G phone the more familiar they have become with mobile apps such as music, video, social networking, and gaming and they tend to use these apps more often. In addition, as more of the subscribers, friends and family upgrade to 4G service, the more people they have to interact with using broadband apps, such as YouTube, FaceTime, Instagram and Facebook. Consequently, the average 4G smartphone today uses 50% more network capacity per month compared to just a year ago. As a result of 3G to 4G migration and accelerating utilization of high bandwidth apps, the average smartphone subscriber in 2013 use 42 times the network capacity of a traditional feature phone user. Moreover, we are still in the early stages of this technology cycle with 4G LTE mobile device penetration in the U.S. at just 30%, which that is expected to double over the next 5 years to 60%. And as you would expect, mobile computing devices such as 3G and 4G capable tablets and laptops draw even more data usage per month from the network. Therefore, given the relatively low current levels of 4G LTE penetration and the forecasted rapid growth of adoption with respect to both handsets and computing devices, U.S. mobile data usage is forecast to more than double every 2 years through 2018, which we feel will strongly support our U.S. organic core growth expectations over the course of the period as Tom pointed out. Furthermore, extrapolating the compounding effect of increasing 4G device penetration and expanding monthly data utilization results in mobile data traffic growth projections to be on the order of 16 times between 2014 and 2024. Over that 10-year period, while additional spectrum and improved spectral efficiency will provide both some additional data capacity for carriers, we expect that these two improvements alone will not be sufficient to preserve the network quality that subscribers demand. So, while traffic data is expected to grow around 16% over those next 10 years, average spectral efficiency is expected to grow just two times and the amount of available spectrum is expected to increase by only 40%. This leaves a significant gap which we believe will need to be filled with wide spread carrier investments and incremental cell sites and transmission equipment. In urban areas where population density is about 5,000 people per square mile, we expect a significant portion of the incremental investment will be made in macro site supplements such as small cells, Wi-Fi and other capacity solutions, many of which American Tower offers today through its distributed antenna system installation. However, we believe that the majority of U.S. future network investments will continue to be deployed in suburban and rural environments where over 85% of the U.S. population resides. From capacity coverage and economic perspectives, we believe the traditional macro\u2019s tower network will also continue to be the preferred solution in these types of areas. And since 95% of our U.S. assets are located in suburban and rural environments with 85% of the people, we fully expect that these longer-term trends will continue to support strong organic growth for our U.S. business well into the future. While mobile data consumption on smartphones and computing devices alone is expected to grow dramatically, there is also emerging technologies that are expected to create even more demand. The number of new devices reliant on wireless network connections or the Internet of things continues to grow as our cars, homes and even electrical meters are becoming increasingly interconnected through wireless systems. It\u2019s expected that this Internet of things will drive 31% of total U.S. mobile traffic in 2018, up from just 17% today. Additionally while our smartphones and tablets will primarily use the 4G network by this time, other connected devices will be still use \u2013 utilizing 2G and 3G further prolonging the long lifecycles of those legacy technologies. Turning now to our international markets, we anticipate similar patterns in smartphone adoption and increasing monthly utilization, resulting in significant increases in total data traffic. Most of these markets are at least one mobile technology behind the U.S. and compared to smartphone penetration of 70% here as discussed earlier, our rapidly evolving and emerging international markets range between approximately 10% and 20% versus that 70%. A great example is Brazil, one of our largest international markets producing around 8% of our rental and management revenues. The wireless sector in Brazil is at roughly the same pace \u2013 place as the United States was in 2009 with smartphone penetration of approximately 20%. While that smartphone penetration in the U.S. grew from 20% to 70% over the last five years, we believe that the slope of the adoption curve could be even steeper in a country like Brazil given the greater availability and relatively lower cost of advanced devices today as compared to five years ago. As a result, mobile data usage in Brazil is expected to grow 10 times over current levels by 2018. To support this type of mobile data expansion, we believe the Brazilian carriers will need to invest significantly in their existing networks. This need is illustrated further by our estimate that there are currently 4,400 subscribers for cell site location in Brazil compared to just 1,500 for cell site locations in the United States. The case of Brazil is representative of the state-of-wireless-networks in many of our international markets and we anticipate that we will be able to convert high levels of incremental carrier investment to strong core organic growth across our entire international segment. Another example is South Africa, mobile data traffic there is expected to grow at 53% CAGR through 2018 of a base of just 20% smartphone penetration today. To support this evolution carriers and handset manufacturers are working to get low-cost smartphones to South African consumers. In August for example, Vodacom as you can see on the chart introduced an affordable smartphone for South African consumers that retails for about $50 and includes 250 megabytes of free data to get customers familiar with its capabilities. Two other major South African carriers also introduced smartphone devices for $180 earlier this year. This trend is also benefiting consumers in India, where mobile network access is already vital to consumers. Over 90% of Internet connections in that country are made over a mobile network and there are virtually no wired alternatives. Last month, Google introduced its first family of Android One phones in India that offer fairly advanced capabilities starting at around $100. Additionally, Google has teamed up with one of our major Indian customers, Airtel, to enhance the value proposition to consumers by offering 100 megabytes of free data for application downloads. Essentially, consumers in India will now be able to buy a smartphone with 70% of the functionality of a mid-tier U.S. smartphone at just 30% of the cost. This should help drive rising smartphone penetration and data growth given that penetration is just 10% in India today. So, in conclusion, we believe the investments we have made position us very well to benefit from the expansion of wireless networks within the United States and throughout our international markets. Domestically, we are still in the early stages of the 4G technology deployment cycle and we expect rising consumer adoption to drive increasing data traffic and sustain strong organic growth for our U.S. business for the foreseeable future. Longer term, we believe that the increasing number of technologies utilizing the mobile wireless network from connected cars to smart meters could expand the size of the wireless network market and drive even more growth. Meanwhile, our international operations continue to benefit from favorable technology trends as well, the availability of cheaper smartphones, the lack of fixed line alternatives and the presence of emerging middle classes, eager to use advanced wireless applications and devices are all driving significant levels of network investments across all these countries. We have been able to convert these investments into organic core revenue growth significantly in excess of the U.S. and expect to continue that as long as these long-term trends progress. Thanks again for joining us today. And Tom and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator, you please go ahead and open up the call. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citigroup. Your line is open. Michael Rollins - Citigroup: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I had two if I could. The first is when you look at the size of your international portfolio how is the Board and the management teams thinking about the optimal size of international versus domestic in terms of the mix? I feel like a few years ago, you had some aspirational targets of where you wanted to get international too and curious where that might be today? And then secondly and related, is there a level or set of circumstances in which you may consider separating the domestic business from the international business? Thanks. Jim Taiclet : Michael, good morning, it\u2019s Jim. We have said publicly couple of times in the past that given our really strong positioning both in the U.S. and in these major markets that we have selected overseas that we no longer have a sort of percentage revenue target that we are aspiring to, but rather given that widespread kind of aperture of opportunities that we are just going to pick the very best ones whether they are in the domestic market or they are in global markets. We have a really disciplined approach to that as you have seen conduct over the years and we have made investments over the last 12 months sizably in both sides of that equation. So, we will continue \u2013 we expect to do so. As far as separating the business, that\u2019s not something we contemplated. We feel that there is incredible amount of management synergy, knowledge of how to do master lease agreements, our global financial and financing abilities were increasingly getting local currency debt in the number of markets, for example. So, we think that this is a strong global company and intend to keep it that way. Michael Rollins - Citigroup: Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors : Thank you very much. I appreciate your forecasting of data traffic growth, I thought the analysis was real interesting. I was wondering if you could comment on some of the technological advances that we have made \u2013 might be seeing specifically \u2013 especially in densely populated areas, one thing that kind of peaked our interest was the mesh networks that were being created in Hong Kong so that the protesters could communicate with each other where I think it\u2019s the cell phones that are specifically talking to each other, is that technology in it\u2019s infancy, is that a real threat down the road? Jim Taiclet : We don\u2019t see mesh networks or P-cells or small cells or Wi-Fi as a threat to our core business at all, because our core business is in rural and suburban environments with population densities under 5,000 people per square mile. That\u2019s a really important demographic measures that you need to keep track on. And a crowd in Hong Kong is almost the opposite of a rural or suburban environment, because of the density of people that are in one place. Same can be said of Time Square during a summer afternoon when there are lots of tourists. And those are kinds of places where a lot of these technologies should be employed. The capacity requirement in an extremely targeted geographic area is so great that those technologies do make sense. 99.4% of our towers serve locations with less than 10,000 people per square mile and 95% of our towers serve places with less than 5,000 people per square mile. Those types of areas based on coverage and capacity, equations in RF physics and also on the economics of how many sites you would need to put together or to enable from a bad call and computing perspective to make a network operate in those kinds of topologies just it essentially insist that the towers is the correct solution if you do all the math. Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors : I appreciate your response. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Your line is open. David Barden - Bank of America : Thanks a lot guys. So, I guess maybe two questions if I could. First one for Tom would be just on the opportunity set on the radar screen right now, we see Verizon, we see America Movil contemplating a big tower sale, I don\u2019t expect you to comment on kind of what\u2019s preferred, but could you scope out your financial wherewithal as it stands right now, your willingness to kind of go back up to the high 5s in leverage plus your revolver, plus your other financing resources, what is your resource pool to go after all these big opportunities that seem to be on the radar screen. And then second, Jim just maybe a follow-up on that question earlier was we are obviously having a very strong period right now, as we look into \u201815, \u201816 the carriers are saying that they are going to be deploying more of their capital towards those densification efforts maybe in areas where your tower portfolio isn\u2019t as dense and we have got the Clearwire decommissioning the Metro PCS decommissioning, the LEAP integration at AT&T, should we be expecting that growth is more likely to be slower rather than steady or faster in the next couple years, because of these forces and if you could talk to that, that will be helpful? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : David this Tom, I will take them in order. First, to your first question relative to kind of the strength of our balance sheet and the strength of our ability to access the markets, I think our history kind of speaks for itself. I mean if you take a look at the transactions that we have done over the last year, we have added 14,000 towers in the last 12 months. And we have been able to manage that in a way that we have been able to de-lever, we have been able to continue to fund the business, continued to obviously increase even the rate of our dividend and de-lever in such a way that we ended the quarter at 5.1 times net debt to LQA EBITDA. So, I think relative to all of the transactions and candidly there are many transactions around the globe in addition to the two that you had just mentioned that it makes sense for us to look at. And as Jim mentioned we have used the same discipline in capital allocation strategy and investment thesis for 15 years. And so it has served us well. And we also have additional facilities we put in place. I mean, as I mentioned we have $3.5 billion of liquidity available. So, I think as we have talked in the past to the extent that the transactions are strategic and makes sense for us, we have told our investor base that we would be willing to use equity where if it makes sense, but we are very committed to our target leverage of 3 to 5 times net debt to EBITDA. We think long-term having that kind of quality balance sheet and investment grade capability giving access to market and lower cost of funds is one of our core foundational strengths that we have in our business. So, we have I think a lot of opportunity, a lot available to us in terms of being able to raise the kind of cash, if in fact those deals presented themselves. Jim Taiclet : And David, it\u2019s Jim. We will provide guidance for 2015 as Tom said in February and the reason we think it\u2019s important to provide the guidance then is we have a lot more information on very specific carrier projections for CapEx plans, individual company sort of application flow with us and a lot of other data. So, we will provide the guidance specifically then. But we want to just remind everybody, we have run this company for 5-year, 10-year and 20-year time horizons and the overall trends we feel are going to support the 6% to 8% domestic core organic growth for us over certainly that 5-year and 10-year time horizon in our Q with everything we know today. There will be some ebbs and flows and individual and even collective carrier spending for market or country, but when you have the differentiation we have across major positions with all four national carriers in the U.S., in addition to that, we have tremendous diversity across regions, customers and technologies in our international segment. I think again, we can be very confident that between the 6% to 8% domestic core organic growth and 200 to 300 basis points above that again for that 5-year to 10-year time horizon, you are going to get a more stable output from AMT in any given year than you are going to get from sort of a portfolio that\u2019s much more weighted to say one country whether it\u2019s here in the United States or others. So, that\u2019s how we run the business. And we do think that the consistent technology trends, the strength of the mobile operators, who whether they are in the U.S. or overseas are very, very sizable companies and also the fact that in the U.S. 85% of the people have to be served over that time. We are not going to see tremendous fluctuation in our growth rates anywhere. David Barden - Bank of America : Great, thanks Jim. Jim Taiclet : Yes. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Tim Horan - Oppenheimer: Thanks, guys. Jim, where do you think we have wireline replacement, it seems like the carriers are building out more and more in rural areas, is there any insight on how those trials are going and the ability to basically do that? And then secondly, just your insight to maybe how the voice-over-LTE trials are going at this point now and the quality of that? Thanks. Jim Taiclet : Sure. One of our served vertical industry initiatives has been rural employment. So, we have relationships both with the major carriers that are looking to do some of that work and their rural operator partners. There is a solid trend of deployment going on in these markets, but it is a complementary piece of our sort of massive core U.S. business. It\u2019s not going to be an overwhelming part. So, definitely helpful along with some of our other verticals that we work with and constructive, but again it\u2019s not overwhelmingly impactful, but positive. From voice-over-LTE perspective, the two leading national carriers in that are Verizon and AT&T. Verizon feels again we are just with \u2013 I would respect our customers who basically reflect their public statements. And so public statement from Verizon has been that they are finishing coverage, they are going to be launching the product over the next year or so. AT&T is in this similar sort of perspective with the commercial launch they say within the next year. So, the two carriers that will probably come out first with widespread VoLTE will be those two, but also T-Mobile has been working on it and we have sort of yet to hear from Sprint on that particular topic. So, over the course of 2015, I think you will see more advertising for this kind of product, more handset deployment that includes the technology that\u2019s needed. And so it will take a few years to roll it all out, but it looks like it\u2019s starting in 2015. Tim Horan - Oppenheimer: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs : Yes, thanks for taking the question. There is an emerging conversation about whether tower operators should be paying out a much higher percentage of their AFFO as a dividend. You are in an unusual position for a REIT in that, because you still have NOLs, you are able to retain most of your cash and reinvest it in the business. And so just a couple of questions here. First, could you just remind us sort of where you are in the utilization of your NOLs? At what point in time for REIT requirements, will you have to go to a higher payout and what would that look like? And then just also remind us why are you choosing to do this, meaning you could just have a very high payout right now if you wanted to? What are the factors that have caused you to think it makes the most sense to retain your cash or alternately what would cause you to change your mind about paying out a higher percentage even if you weren\u2019t required to? Jim Taiclet : So, Brett, this is Jim. I am going to start off and then I will turn it over to Tom for some of those specifics on the NOLs and the payout ratios and all. But I think you are well aware since you have been covering the company for quite some time that since I have joined in 2001 in American Tower, we have had a consistent discipline and decisive strategy based on three strategic pillars. The first of those was and still is achieving large-scale and leasing tower assets in the U.S. and other select major markets. The second of those was continuously improving our operational capabilities on our contracting skills, which are really critical. And then thirdly was maintaining a strong balance sheet enabling us to the acquire assets at depressed prices in times of dislocation in capital markets. So, all three of those pillars remain really important to us. Our capital allocation strategy, our financial leverage targets and our dividend policy are all really meant to enable the execution of the three pillars of our strategy. So, the combination of organic growth for operational excellence and inorganic growth through acquisitions and construction programs have worked we think really well for the company during this whole period of time. So our management teams focuses on optimizing the returns on our existing assets on generating maximum cash flow from those assets and then reinvesting that cash flow augmented by what we call appropriate leverage levels. And so we are constantly evaluating the opportunity set of acquisitions as we have already talked about and seeking attractive construction opportunities with the goal of investing in our business whenever it meets our discipline decision criteria. And knowing there is excess cash, you have seen us return it to shareholders beyond our REIT distribution through share repurchases. And some of those share repurchases say 4, 5 years ago when the opportunity side of acquisitions wasn\u2019t that great, those repurchases were quite sizable. So, this straightforward capital allocation strategy has consistently generated strong cash flow growth and returns for our shareholders and we intend to continue to pursue that again in disciplined manner and decisively. So, Tom, why don\u2019t you ahead? Tom Bartlett : Yes, I would just add on to that, Brett, couple of things. First of all, is in my remarks I talked about us allocating about $3 billion of capital this year and just to kind of reinforce what Jim had said, I mean, $1.5 billion of that will be on acquisitions assuming the closure of the acquisition that we have pending down in Brazil, $1 billion on CapEx, and $0.5 billion plus relative to our dividend. So, again, it\u2019s very consistent, it\u2019s all simultaneous, it\u2019s driving return on investment to our shareholders in terms of driving AFFO per share, driving accretion, driving value that way as well as complementing it with we think a very strong dividend. With regards to the dividend, we will pay out about 30% of our AFFO this year. We started the year with about $650 million of NOLs and will end the year with about $300 million of NOLs, which will probably get utilized over the next 18 months or so. So, as a result, we would expect over the next few years to be up in the 40% to 50% of AFFO payout. And again, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the 20% plus growth in the dividend. And as you saw on the last dividend payment last quarter, it was 25% to 30%. So, we think that this whole balance in terms of being able to kind of really walk and chew gum at the same time driving top line good performance in the business as well as a solid growth into dividend really putting them together provides a really compelling return story. And it\u2019s worked as Jim said for 15 years and we have stuck to that game plan and it\u2019s all within the construct of having a very strong balance sheet and we think that\u2019s going to position us really well going forward as it has in the past. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs : And just to clarify when you are at that point where you are closer to a 40% to 50% payout after you have utilized the NOLs, I would assume that that was essentially a proxy for the taxable net income in the QRS because that\u2019s roughly what you\u2019ll be required to distribute? Tom Bartlett : That\u2019s exactly right. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs : And are there any challenges bringing cash back home from overseas to pay the dividend or is that something you get around simply by including that in the QRS and you don\u2019t\u2019 have deal with repatriation? Tom Bartlett : Keep in mind that even if and we do have a couple of properties in the REIT mainly Costa Rica, Germany and Mexico. And even through the taxable income is generated there it doesn\u2019t mean we have to bring back the cash from there to meet the dividend requirements. So no, we can use cash that\u2019s generated in the U.S. to meet all of the REIT distribution requirements. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Tom Bartlett : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Hi great. Thank you. A few question if I may. One, it seems like there is a lot of talk about capital market activity in Brazil, I was wondering if you could just talk about what the potential for consolidation in that market would be on your business or what you think it could be. And then the second question you cited this traditional 6% to 8% organic growth rates in the U.S. that you are targeting long-term, obviously we are doing to your own guidance greater than 9% this year, any sense whether based on what you are seeing right now would suggest that you are getting to get back to that 6% to 8% next year or is there still what you think an ability to sustain higher than above average at least for the next 12 months? Thanks. Jim Taiclet : Colby, this is Jim, there are often rumors of industry or operator consolidation whether it\u2019s the U.S. or other markets. We have a solid understanding of what is in a number of scenarios, but we are not sure any of them are going to play out, so I think speculating on that right now is premature. And as we talked about we will provide guidance with all kinds of specifics around it in February for 2015. And the company\u2019s public statement for last few years has been always for the mid and long-term that we expect 6% to 8% organic growth in the United States for the foreseeable future. So we will update that or be more specific I should say in February. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Your line is open. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James : Thanks. Good morning guys. Jim Taiclet : Hi Ric. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James : Hi, I have a couple of question. First back to Brett\u2019s on the dividend, is the 40% to 50% payout a little lower than what you had thought historically and could there be some movement of other international assets from the taxable to the qualified REIT subsidiary that would raise that over time? Tom Bartlett : Clearly, if we did move other entities into the REIT that would increase over taxable income and clearly the requirement for dividend but we don\u2019t see that now. Ric we have tremendous amount of headroom on all of our tests. We think we have the right balance between what\u2019s in the REIT and what\u2019s not in the REIT and I don\u2019t see any change to that in the foreseeable future. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James : Okay. And then on the M&A front, you had some acquisition with NIHD that was announced but there is still I think maybe a ballpark of 900 towers that you hadn\u2019t closed yet, any thought on if those are still going to close and the BR Towers it seems like maybe you didn\u2019t hedge that so the currency fluctuation has caused it to be a lower price now? Tom Bartlett : Yes. I mean on the BR \u2013 I mean first of all on the NII I mean we will continue to look at those. We are not going to be \u2013 we haven\u2019t brought significant amount of them in, but we have the ability to kind of cherry pick which ones makes sense for us and so it\u2019s been relatively immaterial in terms of any incremental activity on that front. And with regards to the BR acquisition, yes it\u2019s right. I mean the currency is now at 2.45, I think to the dollar. We expect to again close that in the \u2013 sometime during the quarter, we have it included in our guidance Ric, so I just want to make sure that people understand that. And for 2014 or 2015 we will roll that out as part of our guidance when we rollout it out in February. So, we are continuing to be excited about the acquisition about that particular opportunity. We think it\u2019s going to be a great set of assets for us going forward. Jim Taiclet : And right, it\u2019s Jim, you are right the purchase price is in reais, Brazilian reais, so your assumption is correct on the front. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James : Okay. And the final question on the kind of M&A side, any concern that the regulators whether it\u2019s Mexico, U.S. or elsewhere would have concern about assets and size of tower companies and concentration of towers, have you heard anything from any of the regulatory bodies out there? Jim Taiclet : Well, we have not received a challenge historically on any of our deals, Ric, in any of the countries that we are operating in, but we can\u2019t predict the future behavior of regulators, so I just can\u2019t address what they might do, but in the past we have not dealt with any regulatory requests or changes to our proposed deals. Ric Prentiss - Raymond James : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Your line is open. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays: Thank you very much and good morning folks. Jim Taiclet : Hey, Amir. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays: I wanted to see if I can probe a bit more on your U.S. organic growth here. I mean, some of the demand statistics you provided on your prepared remarks certainly helpful in understanding the core technology trends over the mid to longer term, but of course there has also been a lot of discussion among both the telco equipment community and the carriers themselves around the pace of investments taking place in the U.S., I mean, I realized that drawing a parallel between their CapEx and your demand levels is a bit more of an art than science, but wanted to get a better sense on what you are seeing in the mix between coverage and capacity expansion plans? And particularly, what gives you the confidence that in the foreseeable future you will be able to get this sort of 6% to 8% growth? That would be very hopeful. Jim Taiclet : There is a couple of things going on in coverage and capacity, Amir. And it\u2019s again by major U.S. operators saw again to kind of summarize and integrate some of their public statements. So, Verizon as regards to LTE has said that it\u2019s essentially got nationwide 4G coverage today and they have also made the point that they need to add capacity to that and they are doing it in a couple ways, one of which is to add AWS spectrum to a lot of the sites they have already deployed and so that\u2019s further overlays on sites that were already overlayed with the original 700 megahertz spectrum, but part of that capacity also includes new transmission sites, which are co-locations for us. And so we have seen and I think they have said also that they are going to be deploying and have been deploying some more new sites for transmission in addition to those overlays. With AT&T, they are just about, again their public statement is up to about $300 million pops is essentially the LTE builders complete for them across the country. And they have already initiated a program to densify that network, they call that project, VIP and there is a number of aspects of that, which includes better sort of rural coverage, also density in urban and suburban areas to be able to handle more of the handsets that are being deployed through their customer base. The interesting thing about Verizon and AT&T is though the total market in the U.S. only is about 30% LTE handset penetration those companies are both about 50%. And so they need to kind of stay and get ahead of the handset deployment that their marketing teams are successfully accomplishing. Turning to T-Mobile, they have adopted what they call a challenger network strategy. And as of the third quarter, they said they had $250 million pops covered with that new network and they are rolling out LTE in 43 of the top 50 markets. So, that\u2019s in process and they think again based on their public statement, they will have national coverage by the end of 2015. And again, I think you will see them, deploying different kinds of spectrum to get more capacity and density as time goes beyond that. And then Sprint has essentially successfully completed its first pass the network vision and now they are adding 2.5 gigahertz spectrum and 800 to that deployment. And so again, these are very long-term projects, they are multi-year, we think and the handset base won\u2019t be sort of totally converted price at the end of the decade. And I think that you will see these companies having to match the handset deployment with the capacity improvement that\u2019s going to have to go with that. So, we are very confident again about the 6% to 8% for the balance of the decade and probably beyond that. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays: Jim, the detail was very helpful. I really appreciate that. And then if I may one quick follow-up here. Obviously, there has been a lot of talk around Verizon\u2019s potential sale of its tower assets. Now, perhaps you can\u2019t answer this, but it does seem as though one of the reasons they are somewhat shifting their tone on considering the sale of their assets was the terms by which AT&T was able to sell their assets, particularly some of the terms around the ability to reserve space on the towers, etcetera. Clearly, you folks didn\u2019t end up procuring the AT&T Towers. And I was just wondering if that type of attractiveness for Verizon influences whether or not you think that their assets could be attractive or not given sort of where you guys shook out from that perspective? Jim Taiclet : I mean, the only answer we can give you is they might be, because we have crafted over the last 10, 15-year period of time a way to evaluate tower assets that we applied both in U.S. and overseas. And that method of evaluation is very much in depth. There are some terrific people in this specific potential case in our U.S. tower operation that have been doing this as long as I have been here. And they know how to model the behavior and we actually learned from prior acquisitions we have done an actual activity in the network to re-inform our assumptions on a lot of these models. And so we sometimes win using this approach and we won with SpectraSite in 2005 and GTP just last year. For better or worse, as you pointed out, there have been a number of portfolios. We did not meet the requested or competitive purchase price and that includes AT&T, T-Mobile, Mobility, Tower Co., Global Signal, which is essentially the Sprint portfolio of towers. So, it all depends as you sort of were pointing out the combination of purchase price to either the market or the carrier request to trade that asset and the integration of all those terms and conditions that we model over a 10-year DCF of the terminal value. So, unless that entire equation, which is a very complex equation, works and meets our investment criteria, you won\u2019t see us act unless it does meet that investment criteria. And then the other aspect of our global strategy is that, we have never felt and do not currently feel that we have to do a deal because it\u2019s our last inorganic growth opportunity. We have got many, many inorganic growth opportunities currently and in the future whether they are in the U.S. or elsewhere and therefore we never feel boxed in to have to do a deal. So, it will all come down to the math with us, the terms and conditions and the purchase price integration. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays: Great, thank you very much for the incremental color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : Great, thank you very much. Tom, I think you mentioned that about two-thirds of your leasing activity was amendments this quarter and that was the reversing a trend of towards more co-locations. Can you just talk about the dynamic there and how you expect that to trend going forward? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Yes, sure, Simon. And I think in the last 3, 4 months, we have seen an increased amendment activity there. By the way, they are \u2013 in the U.S., they are up in the $700 to $800 range. So, they are again high-end kind of amendment activity. And I think it\u2019s a function of a number of things. I think one of the questions we had before and some of the comments that Jim made relative to VoLTE, I think that we are seeing more activity from our customers gaining nationwide VoLTE coverage. And so as a result, we are seeing more radio heads, more electronics actually finding its way on to the platform. And I think we saw a lot of that activity as I said over the last 3 to 4 months. I would expect as we have seen in the past that that would again reverse once that coverage is in there and we would then move more to co-los, new leasing just as the carriers continue to fill in the some of the capacity elements. But over the last as I say several months as they have been trying to prepare for VoLTE roll-out, I think we have seen that impact and that\u2019s come in the form of amendments. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : And is that across all carriers or specific to the big two with their push for VoLTE? Tom Bartlett : Well, as Jim said there are a couple that are kind of leading the way in terms of VoLTE and so I think you can assume that it\u2019s more related to those. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley : Okay, great. Thank you. Tom Bartlett : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore. Your line is open. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore: That was often close to a dirty word. Yes. I have two questions, first is in terms of looking at the AFFO outlook for the fourth quarter and I know this is just math here, but it does look like there is a sequential step down and that must be related or may be related to some of the incremental sustaining CapEx, it looks likes there is a step up. So if there is any specific projects that are happening in the fourth quarter that would be helpful to understand. And then second, following up on Simon\u2019s question about sort of a shift towards amendments, as we think about carrier CapEx and sort of relationships towards incremental revenue opportunity for Tower operators, is there better a flow through whether it\u2019s an amendment or a new cell site you through your lens? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Yes. I mean Jonathan on the first question, yes I mean as had or always had expected we would see a slight uptick in maintenance CapEx in the Q4. I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent that way for a number of years. So while we did increase our AFFO by $35 million we obviously don\u2019t see it as high as we have thought, but there is going to be a slight uptick in maintenance CapEx. And relative to new leasing and amendment, it\u2019s kind of interesting, because I know that\u2019s from the analyst community that\u2019s kind of a big deal in terms of how much is amendment, how much is new leasing. I mean for us it\u2019s just a sign wave, it\u2019s just trends. They are going to go through a significant amount of amendment activity as the coverage occurs and then as capacity needs are occurring, you are going to see the densification. From just this past quarter in the U.S. from an amendment perspective it is $700,000 to $800,000 for an amendment and the average new lease I think was probably in the $2,300 range. So, yes I get it from just more revenue coming from the Co-Lo, no doubt about it. But this is all just part of the migration plan and the network plans that the carriers will continue to deploy. And as Jim talked about I mean this is 4G is going to be the better part of it \u2013 of the decade. So we are going to continue to see these kinds of swings in terms of new amendments and new Co-Lo throughout the balance of the decade. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Tom Bartlett : You bet. Operator : And this concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the call back over to our presenters for closing remarks. Tom Bartlett - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : That\u2019s great. I really want to thank you all for joining us today. If there are any further questions, comments Leah and I are here to be able to take those. So have a great day. And again, thanks again. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Now I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom Ray : Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We're pleased to report continued execution of our business plan in Q4, delivering solid growth and finishing out 2014 as a strong year for our company. During the year, we worked to make our Organization leaner, more efficient and more productive and we believe that our work is reflect in our financial and operating results. Our financial results for 2014 reflect solid growth over 2013, with increases in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO of 16%, 20% and 20% respectively, all excluding the impact of non-recurring items from the first half of the year. We believe that in Q4, our momentum continued to accelerate, with our Q4 results compared to Q4 of the prior year reflecting stronger growth than our year-on-year results. Specifically, Q4 2014 over Q4 2013 results reflect growth of 18% in revenue, 28% in adjusted EBITDA and 25% in FFO. We achieved this strong top-line growth while simultaneously working to make our organization simpler and more efficient. Reflecting that work, G&A as a percent of revenue decreased by 140 basis points in calendar 2014 over 2013 and correspondingly, G&A as a percent of adjusted EBITDA and FFO declined by 400 and 500 basis points respectively. We believe that we accomplished stronger growth with lower relative expense by simplifying our internal structure, streamlining decision-making and enhancing clarity among our employees. A key component of our work in 2014 to simplify and increase clarity across our organization was to specifically address our sales and marketing functions. To that end, we view fixed and mobile networks, cloud and IT service providers and the enterprise as the three legs of the stool that support differentiated value in the data center. Early in 2014, we simplified our sales structure to organize our teams around these three mark segments and we believe our teams produced strong results. In Q4 we executed new and expansion leases representing $11.1 million of annualized GAAP rent, which represents record leasing of TKD capacity for our company. During the quarter, we signed 96 new and expansion leases, comprising approximately 92,000 net rentable square feet, at an average rate of $121 per square foot. Q4 leasing was well distributed among smaller and mid-sized leases, with only six leases exceeding 2000 square feet. Specifically, in the quarter, we executed five mid-sized new and expansion leases averaging approximately 7000 square feet each, plus one lease of 44,000 square feet. The 44,000 square-foot lease was with an anchor customer that leased 100% of our phase 1 TKD capacity at VA2. The GAAP rental rate on this lease was below our trailing average, which impacted our average rate per square foot for the quarter. Adjusting to exclude the impact of this lease from our broader Q4 results, the average rental rate associated with new and expansion leases signed in Q4 would have exceeded our trailing 12-month average. Looking more broadly at our leasing results for all of 2014, we believe that we had a solid year across all metrics. During the year, we signed new and expansion leases, representing $33 million in annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 245,000 square feet, at an average rental rate of $136 per foot. The $33 million in annualized GAAP rent leased reflect an increase of over 80% over 2013 and represents record new and expansion leasing for our company. A portion of the increase in the volume of annualized GAAP rent leased in 2014 stems from our decision to sign the wholesale lease at VA2. However, we believe that the dominant portion of the increase in leasing steps from two factors. First, our ability to increase transaction count, of which smaller co-location leases comprised the primary component and second, our renewed strength among mid-sized lease opportunities. Specifically, in 2014, we signed 466 new and expansion leases, also representing a record for our company. Beyond simple leasing volume, we believe that our leasing during the year produced strong results from a strategic perspective. To that, we meaningfully advanced the network and cloud capabilities in our portfolio, executing upon our strategy to provide solutions for high performance workloads and applications. During the year, our network and mobility and cloud and IT services verticals together accounted for 55% of transactions and 53% of annualized GAAP rent from new and expansion leases signed. Further, these two verticals represented 80 or 63% of the 127 new logos we signed in the year. We believe that this reflects continued growth in the number of service providers in the marketplace, as well as the attractiveness of our platform to those service providers. In addition to growth in our network and mobility and cloud and IT services verticals, we're pleased with our execution related to the third key component of our strategy, the enterprise. Within our enterprise segment, we continued to see solid performance in digital content, systems integrators and MSPs serving the enterprise, healthcare and other professional services. We also saw robust activity among financial services customers in our New York, Chicago and northern Virginia/DC campuses. In total, our enterprise segment represented 45% of the new and expansion leases signed during 2014, a 25% increase year-over-year. Regarding our interconnection product line, interconnection revenue increased 22% in 2014 over 2013, driven by strong growth in unit volume among our basket of interconnection products at higher price points. Specifically, we saw a 26.8% revenue growth across the products that we believe represent current architecture, namely, intra- and inter-building fiber cross connects, [inaudible] transport within the metro market, our blended IP product and our logical interconnection services comprised of our Any2 internet change and our ethernet-based CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange. This basket of high-growth, current architecture products compares to the lower price point and volume declines associated with our copper cross connect product, which we view as a legacy architecture. Specifically, in Q4 2014, our copper cross-connect product reflected unit pricing of 52% of that of the basket of current architecture products. Additionally, in-place unit volumes of our copper product reflect a decline at a 4.8% compounded annual rate from Q1 2013 through Q4 2014. We offer this more granular information regarding our interconnection products for two reasons. First, the dynamics in growth among our higher- and lower-priced products help inform a deeper understanding of the growth in our total interconnection revenue. Second, we believe that our strong growth in our basket of current architecture interconnection products provides insight into the true health and growth of our platform in serving high-performance computing workloads and networking requirements. In addition to growth in interconnection revenue and volume, 2014 saw meaningful progress from us in other areas related to our interconnection product line. In 2014, we saw new deployments from AMS-IX and DE-CIX, adding to our global and national peering partners, which already included LINX and NYIIX across our Bay Area, New York and Northern Virginia/DC campuses. Additionally, during the year, we secured new metro dark fiber partners and assets, with which we believe we can further enhance our solution set in our New York, Los Angeles and Northern Virginia-DC campuses. Looking forward into 2015 we anticipate continued port growth on our ethernet-based CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange. Further, we're seeing increasing demand for 100-gig services on our Any2 Internet exchange and we will be working in the year ahead to meet that demand. With 2014 behind us, we're focused upon our activities and growth plans for 2015. At a high level, we prioritize our activities and capital allocation according to our view of risk-adjusted return on incremental investment. As such, our top priority for 2015 is to lease existing available TKD inventory. To that, at December 31, 2014, our data center portfolio was 82.6% occupied and 85.9% leased, providing us with the ability to increase earnings from available capacity with a minimum investment of additional capital. Our second priority is to build out additional TKD capacity in our existing powered shelves. Key among these are NY2, VA2 and LA2, together representing the opportunity to build 480,000 square feet of new data center capacity, representing 39% of our occupied data center square footage at December 31. We forecast that our cost to develop this capacity will be substantially below full replacement cost and as such, that upon lease-up, this capacity will generate yields substantially above those on new ground-up construction. Our third priority is to build additional capacity in markets in which we currently have a presence. To this, we own land on our Santa Clara campus, upon which we believe we will be able to build two additional data centers, ranging from 135,000 square feet to 210,000 square feet. We also own land on our NY2 site in Secaucus, upon which we believe we will be able to build an additional building, as market conditions may warrant. Our fourth priority is what we refer to as opportunistic external growth which can take a variety of forms. We remain diligent in evaluating all such opportunities that we identify, but note that we view these opportunities as a fourth priority for our capital, given the attractiveness of other alternatives. With that landscape surrounding our capital priorities laid out, I will take a moment to offer insight into our leasing objectives for 2015. First, we entered 2015 with limited capacity available for lease in the Bay Area and no blocks of TKD capacity greater than 5000 square feet available in the area, which is roughly the equivalent of one-half of a computer room. As such, we expect leasing volume for TKD capacity in the Bay Area to be substantially lower in 2015 than in 2014, as we evaluate the potential of building more capacity in the market. Our limited availability of leasable capacity in the Bay Area may impact total leasing volume for the year, since the Bay Area represented approximately one-third of total leasing volume for us in 2014, defined in terms of annualized GAAP rent sold in new and expansion leases. Second, as we communicated early in 2014, when we build a large new development project, we may look for one or more larger leases to bring immediate income to the building. During 2014, we believe that we successfully accomplished this at both NY2 and VA2. With those large leases now in place, in 2015 we anticipate orienting our efforts more toward our more traditional co-location activities. Specifically, we will work to increase leasing volume in the small and mid-sized segment of the market, focused upon performance-sensitive workloads and customer requirements. Our objectives in sharpening our focus upon this segment of the market are to increase the profitability associated with new business, drive returns on invested capital and further cement our assets and company as having a sustainably differentiated value proposition. We finished 2014 and began 2015 with accelerating momentum and we will work to capitalize upon that momentum as we focus upon growing our company and generating strong returns on capital. Further, we will continue to focus upon enhancing the ecosystems across our platform as we work to provide an industry-leading solution for our customers' performance-sensitive requirements. Finally, we will continue to work to make our business leaner, simpler and more productive, with our goal to produce strong financial results and to continue to provide our customers with industry-leading customer service. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Tom and hello, everyone. I will begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q4 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development activity. Third, I will provide an update regarding our capital investments and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity and fourth, I will introduce our guidance for the year. Turning to our financial performance in the fourth quarter, data center revenues were $70.6 million, a 3.1% increase on a sequential basis and an 18.9% increase over the prior-year quarter. Our Q4 data center revenue consisted of $59.1 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 3.7% sequentially and 19% year-over-year; $9.5 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 4% sequentially and 21.2% year-over-year; and $2 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light-industrial revenue was $$1.9 million. Consistent with our performance in the first three quarters of 2014, we continued to drive solid growth in our same-store MRR per Cab E. During the fourth quarter, same-store turnkey MRR increased 7.1% year-over-year, while same-store data center occupancy increased 710 basis points to 81.7% year-over-year. Q4 lease commencements represented $4.9 million of annualized GAAP rent, comprised of approximately 34,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $145 per square foot. Renewals in the fourth quarter totaled approximately 44,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rental rate of $153 per square foot and represented mark-to-market growth of 2.6% and 5.2% on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively. For the full year, cash rent growth of 2.9% was in line with our guidance range. Churn in the fourth quarter was 1.4%, bringing the full-year rate to 5.6% or 1.4% on average per quarter, which is also in line with our guidance range. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $15.4 million or $18.8 million on a cash basis. For reference, this is more than 2.5 times our GAAP backlog entering 2014. We expect approximately 77% or $11.8 million of the current GAAP backlog to commence by the end of the second quarter of 2015. Another 5% is expected to commence in the second half of 2015. Our fourth quarter FFO was $0.61 per diluted share in unit, an increase of 10.9% on a sequential quarter basis and a 24.5% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $36.3 million increased 10.4% sequentially and 28% over the same quarter last year. Our full-year 2014 results reflect total operating revenue of $272.4 million, an increase of 16% over $234.8 million for 2013. Excluding non-recurring items recorded in the first half of the year, our adjusted EBITDA of $129.6 million increased 20.2% from $107.8 million in 2013. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 170 basis points to 47.6% of revenue from 45.9% in 2013. FFO for the full year also excluding non-recurring items was $102.7 million, an increase of 20.4% over the 2013 amount of $85.3 million, while FFO per diluted share and unit increased 19.8% year-over-year to $2.18. This represents revenue flow-through-to-adjusted EBITDA and FFO of 58% and 46%, respectively. During the fourth quarter, approximately 52,000 square feet of land in an ancillary parking lot at our BO1 facility in Boston was acquired by The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, pursuant to an order of taking. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a $1.2 million gain on land disposal for GAAP purposes for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. We exclude gains on sales of land or property from both our FFO and adjusted EBITDA calculations as shown in the reconciliations on page 13 of the earnings supplemental. Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter totaled $3.4 million, approximately 4.7% of total operating revenues, down 70 basis points compared to last quarter as we continued to focus on simplifying the business and increasing productivity throughout the sales organization. For 2015, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be approximately 5% to 5.5% of total operating revenues. As Tom stated, G&A as a percent of revenue decreased from 11.6% in 2013 to 10.2% in 2014. You may notice that for Q4 2014, G&A as a percent of revenue was 8.6%. The reduction in G&A during the fourth quarter was due in part to a $400,000 adjustment to our bad debt allowance due to favorable collections in the quarter and a seasonal decrease in travel costs due to the holidays. We expect G&A for 2015 to correlate to approximately 10% of total operating revenue. As of December 31, 2014, our stabilized operating data center portfolio was 87.4% occupied compared to 81.7% at the beginning of 2014. Including leases executed at the end of Q4 but not yet commenced, our stabilized data center occupancy rate would be 89.7%. Including pre-stabilized space, our total data center portfolio was 82.6% occupied at the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of 530 basis points over the last 12 months. I would like to point out that we have enhanced our disclosures in our quarterly supplemental with a number of changes I will briefly discuss. First, on page 14, we have updated the layout of the operating properties table to provide a more comprehensive overview of the total data center portfolio by including pre-stabilized and total data center square footage and occupancy. We have separated the office and light-industrial portion, which can now be found at the bottom of the table. Additionally, we have separated the square feet currently under development from space held for development to provide more insight into our near-term construction projects. Second, on page 17, we supplemented the geographic diversification with a breakdown of vertical diversification, based on total annualized data center rent. Third on page 23, we have provided our view of the components of net asset value to provide more clarity around valuation. Lastly, we have enhanced the annual guidance on page 24 to include the implied growth ranges of our key financial metrics based on the midpoint of 2015 guidance. Note that the 2014 amounts are normalized for non-recurring items, which can be seen on the guidance page of the supplemental. Turning to development activity, we expect total capital expenditures in the range of $85 million to $115 million in 2015. We forecast to invest $65 million to $80 million in expansion capital in 2015, comprised of follow-on development project in key markets across our portfolio. This is in line with our prioritized capital expenditures Tom outlined. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 92,000 square feet of data center space under construction at VA2 related to Phases 1 and 2. This amount includes the 44,000 square feet associated with Phase 1 that was 100% leased as of December 31, 2014. We have seen good momentum at NY2 with Phase 1 75% leased at the end of the fourth quarter. With this in this mind, we began construction on Phase 2 at NY2 with a total of 49,000 square feet expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2015. Lastly, we had approximately 29,000 square feet of turnkey data center space under construction at three additional locations to add incremental capacity in Boston, Denver and Chicago. Through the end of the fourth quarter, we have spent $81 million out of the estimated $129 million required to complete all of the projects under construction. As we've discussed previously, as we complete development projects, we realize a reduction in our run-rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting in a corresponding increase in operating expense. At the end of 2014, the percentage of interest capitalized was approximately 48% for the full year. As we look ahead to 2015, we estimate this percentage could decrease to a range of 25% to 30%, depending on the volume and pace of development during the year. As a reminder, we have included the percentage of gross interest capitalized on page 22 of the supplemental and also in our Form 10-K to be filed tomorrow. Turning to our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2014, our debt-to-Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.2 times. If you include our preferred stock, it is 3 times. We remain focused on maintaining the liquidity and available capital necessary to execute our capital spending plans to support future growth. As we have discussed previously, we target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately 4 times. As of December 31, 2014, we had $218.5 million drawn on our credit facility and approximately $179 million of available capacity under the facility. During the fourth quarter, we announced an increase in our dividend, representing the fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth in the quarterly dividend rate and 34% compounded annual growth since becoming a public company. We increased our dividend by 20% to $0.42 per share on a quarterly basis or $1.68 per share on an annual basis. We remain focused on maintaining our dividend payout levels to comply with our REIT requirements, balanced with our need to retain cash to invest in and grow our portfolio. Now in closing, I would like to address guidance for 2015. I would remind you that our guidance is based on the current view of supply-and-demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we've discussed today. As detailed on page 24 of our supplemental, our guidance for 2015 is as follows. FFO per share and OP unit is estimated to be $2.55 to $2.65. This implies 19% year-over-year FFO growth based on the midpoint of the range and the $2.18 per share we reported in 2014, excluding the net benefit of $0.04 in non-recurring items recognized in the first half of 2014. Total operating revenue is estimated to be $313 million to $323 million. Based on the midpoint of guidance, this implies 17% year-over-year revenue growth. Data center revenue is estimated to be $305 million to $315 million, correlating to 17% year-over-year revenue growth. Keep in mind that the increased volume of larger leases in 2014 will likely correlate to a greater percentage of new power revenue from metered customers in 2015. As we have discussed in the past, metered revenue is a pure pass-through, which should be accounted for as you think about your models for 2015. Consistent with the goals Tom outlined to orient more toward co-location leasing in 2015, our objective is to return our mix of power revenue between metered and [inaudible] products to historical norms in 2016 and beyond. General and administrative expenses are estimated to be $30 million to $32 million or approximately 10% of revenue. This implies an 11% increase in G&A expenses, well below the estimated increase in revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $153 million to $158 million. This implies 20% year-over-year growth based on the midpoint of the range, excluding the non-recurring items recognized in the first half of 2014. The significant drivers of this guidance are as follows; estimated annual churn rate of 6% to 8% for 2015. Note, this is our expected churn for the full year and is different than the quarterly guidance we have provided in the past. Keep in mind, there is variability associated with the quarterly churn rate and in 2015, we would expect the first half of the year to have a higher churn rate compared to our historical results with more normalized levels in the back half. Cash rent growth on our data center renewals is estimated to be 2% to 5% for the full year. Total capital expenditures are expected to be $85 million to $115 million. The components are comprised of data center expansion cost, estimated to be $65 million to $80 million. This includes the expansion capital related to the continued build out of VA2 and NY2, as well as incremental turnkey data center capacity discussed earlier. Non-recurring investments are estimated to be $10 million to $15 million and include amounts related to our IT initiatives, facilities upgrades and other capital expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures and tenant improvements are each estimated to be $5 million to $10 million. Now we would like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Dave Rodgers : Tom, maybe talk a little bit about the higher churn that Jeff mentioned here toward the end of the call. It sounds like it's pretty localized or specific, so wondering if there's a particular market or specific asset that's going to drive some of that churn and what the outcome you expect there is? Tom Ray : Sure, Dave. There are really three specific items that we're thinking about as we guide to a little higher level of churn. First and we'd note we expect that to be happening in the first half of the year. Those three items are and the first item may occur at any time during the year, but we're hopeful that we can accelerate the backfill of some of the remaining space from the building at SB3, where we had formerly had one large customer and then we backfilled some of that. If we're able to accelerate the backfill of the rest, you will see an acceleration of the churn of that former single-tenant customer. The timing of that and the likelihood is uncertain, but we've built that into our model and the timing is equally uncertain, but we thought it prudent to say this might come about during the year. For that to happen, we would also have an offsetting backfill, so it shouldn't impact cash flow as to that piece of churn. The other two components are customer and customer-specific, one of our larger content customers has just changed part of their data center architecture to needing lower power. So we're working through refitting them in our portfolio where it is appropriate to do so, but we expect to see some contraction from that customer in a couple of locations. They're widely distributed. This change is not happening to all deployments all the way across our company, but we do expect some to come from that and we expect that to really take place more in the beginning of the year and then be worked through. The third dynamic in the churn guidance is we have a larger enterprise customer that acquired some businesses and assets in 2014, a component of which had fee-owned data centers in the stuff that they acquired. So they're going to move one component out of one of our LA buildings over to a fee-owned building that they just picked up that has a lot of spare capacity. So I don't think anybody should interpret our churn guidance as something endemically different about our business model or about the stickiness of the customers. These are, in general terms not the performance-sensitive, not the smaller stuff with high cross-connects. These are specific things and sometimes the ball bounces that way and we expect it to bounce that way in the first half of the year. Dave Rodgers : Maybe a follow-up to that with regard to the leasing spread guidance for the year and where you expect rents to be. Looks like this year of expirations is a fairly high number for the expiration schedule for you in terms of dollars per foot or pricing, but can you talk about the guidance of up 2% to 5% maybe being a little bit more cautious than we've actually seen? Is some of this churn related to this pricing or is this just where market conditions are and are you seeing more pricing pressure in the market? Tom Ray : That mark-to-market, number one, is distinct from churn, so to the extent somebody churns out, releasing that does not go into the market-market calc for us. That calc is only an in-place lease that renews. Secondly, the mark-to-market is on rent only. As we've been saying for a while now we're really working to increase the profitability of our business and returns on capital through product mix and so there are times when an in-place customer is rolling where we might move the needle more in mark-to-market we might get more uplift in the non-rent components of the product mix. So I would just say, Jeff leads that activity, he has done a great job in looking through what will happen. We feel good about the forecast for rental mark-to-market and we're going to try to improve on that in other areas, but as to leases that stay in place and renew, I would expect the improvements in other areas to be on the margin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Douglas with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. Stephen Douglas : I guess two questions if I could. First, specifically on the wholesale customer at VA2, maybe for you Jeff, can you just provide a little bit more color in terms of how that ramp occurs, specifically on the power side? And then second question, maybe for Tom, just interested in your thoughts on the proposed Telecity Interxion deal both from a strategic standpoint and maybe as it relates to the existing cross-selling agreements you have there? Thanks. Jeff Finnin : Overall, that customer ends up deploying into our VA2 data center in the second quarter of 2015. As you can expect with some of our larger wholesale deals, many of those deals, especially to the extent they are at the size in which this one is, they will ramp in over that over a period of time. For this particular customer, you can expect that to ramp in over about a two-year period of time. Tom Ray : We're under a tight [inaudible] under that lease and we're not really able to give any information regarding the economics or give any information that would support backing into them. So for anybody out there, if that's one of your two questions, you might want to pick a different one. And Telecity and InterXion, it's consolidation among the three leading folks in Europe is to be expected and it makes a lot of sense. The consolidation in terms of just strategic platform will be good for both companies involved. We know that, that deal isn't done and other dynamics may be at play, but that - consolidation among the leading guys in Europe is healthy for Europe and for the industry. As to what that points toward elsewhere, my guess is in the immediate term, maybe not much. When two big companies merge, there is a lot of work to be done there. My guess is that, that deal is going to take its time to get completed and digested and that will be it for Europe. Our view of M&A in the states has not changed from the past several calls that we've addressed it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question. Jordan Sadler : First, just curious if you could address market rent expectations. I see that the first priority here is lease-up and it ties in well with, as you have discussed before, filling in around some of the hard work you've done over the last year in putting the anchor tenants in New York and here in Virginia. Just maybe curious just about market rents and the trends you are seeing and then what the impact might be of just the type of leasing that you're doing? Tom Ray : Sure. Again, for our business, it's important to think about market rents but also, again, product mix. So with regard to market rents, for the same leasing opportunity with the same customer in 2015 as in 2014, we expect some further strengthening. I don't think it will be dramatic, but you will see some further strengthening, probably in most marks other than New York, New Jersey. We don't expect New York, New Jersey to go down, but nor do we expect it to strengthen meaningfully, but perhaps in Virginia, in the Bay Area even more likely, you will see some strengthening. LA will probably have that same 3% growth that's it's been in LA for quite some time. So for the same lease and the same requirement, that's our view of market rents. That said, what we're really focused on accomplishing in 2015, as we said, is to increase the volume of smaller transactions and importantly, increase - to take it from other industries, the ARPU of each square foot or each kilowatt that we sell. So as you said, Jordan, that dovetails into what we've already executed on in the east. We brought in some anchors. We really want to start driving ROI. That dovetails into being limited on the capacity in the Bay Area and frankly in LA, that's pretty much all we've been doing for quite some time, are those smaller and mid-sized transactions. With that orientation, with the eastern region, Virginia and New York with anchor leases in there, with limited inventory in the Bay Area, I would be surprised if we sold as much square footage volume in 2015 as we done 2014. But I would say, we're very focused on working to maintain the rate of earnings growth of the company. You can see, just the math of our industry, a 20% increase in ARPU can point toward a 40% increase in adjusted EBITDA per unit of capital deployed. So we're very focused on that relationship and we'll work hard during the year to take advantage of where we stand and our ability to increase ROI. I hope that's helpful. Jordan Sadler : It is. As a follow-up and this is implicit in some of your comments in that you look to maintain the growth, is that while you may sign less square footage this year, it's safe to assume that your optimism and the comments surrounding the momentum into 2015 and that the revenue signed or the rent signed in 2015 could potentially meet or exceed what you did in 2014? Tom Ray : I wouldn't say that. Frankly, that would surprise me if that happened, but the rate of growth of earnings - distributable cash flow and adjusted EBITDA, we're going to work hard to continue to drive that - but our objective, you will see in our objective for the year is to continue to drive that with fewer square feet and kilowatts sold and that will speak to likely a lower growth in rent, that's not to be unexpected. Don't it expect to be dramatic, but the fundamental message is, it would be natural for folks to look at CoreSite's year this year and say, they got sales running again, Q4 finished out really strongly in TKD sales, are we going to see a 5% or 10% growth rate on that in terms of rents sold and top-line revenue and we're saying no. We could, but I would be very surprised. Jordan Sadler : What was the nature of the accelerating momentum comment then? What is that focused on? Is that EBITDA and cash flow and distributable--? Tom Ray : Exactly. It's the bottom line. And again, our-- Jordan Sadler : That's all we care about. Tom Ray : Yes. And especially related to how many capital dollars we consume to drive it. We're very focused on that relationship. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question. Jonathan Schildkraut : I thought the chart, Jeff that you provided on the breakdown of revenue from different customer verticals was interesting and I was wondering if you could give us a little perspective on that, because it's a new chart and maybe a year-over-year. Which verticals was the growth really coming from and will we see a notable change in the percent of revenue driven from those particular groups? In particular, I would love to get an update on your progress in building incremental on-ramps to some of the cloud service provider platforms? Thanks. Jeff Finnin : On page 17 in the supplementals, which you are referring to and historically we have provided the breakout on a vertical basis, simply based on the number of customers we've had. So as we continued to receive questions, we thought this would be helpful in terms of the rent associated with each of the verticals. In terms of where has it changed as compared to 12 months ago, really where it has increased and I wouldn't say it's enormous, but where it has increased is really the work around networks and cloud. What that's driven by is again the sales execution during the year in terms of that being our two best verticals for the year, as Tom indicated in his prepared comments and so that's really where you saw some of the increase year-over-year. Tom Ray : On the forward, you might see 2015 revenue, new-build revenue sold to the cloud and the content, go down a little bit from where it was in 2014 and some of the other areas go up. I would say I wouldn't expect network and mobility to change a ton. It could be that other - that the share of other enterprise gets a little bit larger relative to cloud and that really circles back to some of the larger deals we did in 2014. Sometimes the cloud and the content verticals take down bigger slugs of space. So if you're - if your leasing orientation for a coming year is to decelerate around that, you might see a deceleration in booked revenue in those two verticals. I hope that helps. Jonathan Schildkraut : It certainly does. If I can ask a second question, just in terms of looking at the cash flow statement and the guidance for 2015, the guidance is better than we anticipated on the EBITDA side and FFO side and at the same time, capital is coming in a little bit lower. So we see a pathway here that the company will generate positive free cash flow. It's the first time, based on our model and while dividends are still going to be a drag on cash, as we think about the company's need for incremental financing, given this important inflection in the year is there any incremental commentary you can give us? Thanks. Jeff Finnin : Yes. Jonathan, first and foremost as you look at our guidance and what we've laid out from a capital expenditure standpoint, given the liquidity we have and the capacity in our revolver, we've clearly got the liquidity to fund the business plan for the year. Having said that, we continue to look at the market and where rates are and the pricing of our instruments that we have in place and to see whether or not we can provide any incremental value by modifying those. As we look out into 2015, similar to what we've done in previous years, we would probably look to term out some portion of our debt. The only question is associated with how much and what type of instrument to use. As you know, we like to maintain as much flexibility in our capital structure as possible and obviously, that weighs in terms of what that decision ultimately would be. The timing of it obviously is uncertain at this point, but it's something we're watching closely and ultimately working internally and with our Board to figure out exactly what that next step looks like. Tom Ray : Jon, I also want to circle back. I half-answered your first question and I want to ensure clarity to the extent I can around our view of leasing and sales in 2016, among the verticals. I said, the revenue sold into the cloud into the content may decline as a percent to total new revenue sold in the year, but again, that is because of the very small number of larger deals. Our focus and the part that I didn't answer as you asked about on ramps and our activity around that area - our focus is to increase the number of new leases signed in - certainly in the cloud vertical and perhaps also in the content vertical. That's really focused on these on ramps. We have attractive penetration among one of the leading public cloud providers. We have very attractive penetration among private clouds stood up through SIs and MSPs that are in a hybrid architecture with the public cloud. We're later in the game as you're very well aware with a couple of the other larger or what we expect to be larger public cloud providers. Some of those providers are later in the game, as well, but we're optimistic that in the year ahead, we'll start to see movement around those, while we also further our relationship and the on ramps with the leading group we're with right now. So we're very focused on driving not only the switch component of getting onto the cloud, but also the higher-value cashing component. We're just not super focused on trying to do longer-term storage. So I hope that color helps to give insight into how we're thinking about what we're trying to get done. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Jonathan Atkin : So coming back to Tom's earlier comments about square feet sold, kilowatts sold, was interested is it competitive factors in the markets where you operate or just the contour of overall demand that led to you make those observations? And then was interested also in the occupancy analysis and maybe your new disclosure addresses some of this, but it looks like percentage occupancy in Chicago and New York has decreased. I just want to be clear of the reasons for that? Thanks. Tom Ray : The first question Jon, are you saying, hey, Tom, you've said probably leased fewer square feet in kilowatts maybe this year than last year and more color around that? Is that the question? Jonathan Atkin : Yes. Tom Ray : It's not because of market dynamics. Again, I would expect rents to increase in most of the markets in which we compete. It's really because of how we're focused on running our business this year. Really that's no different than it has been for many years on the trail. We just hope that folks remember, 1 year, 1.5 years ago we said, we'll probably add a couple of large wholesale deals into the mix because on an IRR basis we think that's smart math on new big developments. Really what's underpinning my comments about the forward is we've accomplished that, so now we don't plan on - and those deals were done at lower ARPU and lower ROI than what I think of as our more day in and day out core business. So we're going to work hard this year to do less of those and more of the more profitable core business. But we see the market opportunity mainly getting better and as you have hopefully known from us for a long time, with regard to wholesale, we really hit the wholesale market for two reasons. One is IRR math around new developments and the other is spot market, opportunistic pricing. If we see significant spikes, we'll go hit that spot market, but the core of what we work to accomplish day in and day out is this higher value, higher ARPU component and we just expect that to be a greater portion of the sales in 2015. Jeff Finnin : Jonathan, on your questions about Chicago and New York, when you look at Chicago quarter-over-quarter, the occupancy percentage actually has increased slightly. What you might be referring to in terms of occupied square feet actually came down. The reason for that, we had a customer that exited a part of a floor there in our data center and that floor has now been put into redevelopment. So you see that on the construction under development tables back on page 20 in our supplemental. So that space is being redeveloped and we'll put it back into our operating portfolio as soon as it gets completed. In terms of New York, we had a customer move out and that impacted our occupancy negatively for the quarter. Obviously, we're working to backfill that particular space at this point in time. Tom Ray : I would say in New York, the move-out was about 2700 feet, between 2000 and 3000 feet at NY1. What we've seen during this year at NY1 is more and more transaction and more of the stuff we really want moving into that. In a year to trade out one 2000- to 3000 foot requirement and put in eight, 10, 15 more valuable ones, we like that trade, but that's what happened in New York, is we had to move out of a larger requirement. Jonathan Atkin : And then on the lease expirations, you had the schedule for 2015 through 2017. Does anything jump out? Is it a lot of smaller leases or are there any years in which you're more indexed towards major or larger expirations occurring? Jeff Finnin : Jonathan, obviously we gave some color around 2015 and that is obviously the area that we went into some granularity around. The only other thing you can think about is when you look out into 2016, you do have that customer at SB3 that ultimately will leave the premises there at SB3 and that is the space that has been backfilled, at least one-half of it at this point in time and we're working to solve for the rest of it. Keep that in mind, as you look through. That may drive the churn up, but keep in mind, as Tom mentioned, a large part of that has already been backfilled from a cash standpoint. Jonathan Atkin : And then finally, the metered tower mix growing this year in terms of new business, is that just a reflection of the VA2 situation and therefore it would be weighted more towards 2Q, 3Q, 4Q or are there other dynamics going on? Tom Ray : It's really three locations and a small number of deals. It all points to, in 2014 we did a handful of larger deals more than we usually do, so there's the large lease at VA2, the anchor lease, there's also the collection of mid-sized but metered leases at NY2 and then there's a larger backfill inside SB3. So you have a fair amount of metered activity among that group. The backfill in SB3 isn't - it's a metered deal replacing a metered deal, but on the east coast, in NY2 and VA2, just a significantly greater proportion of metered deals than is our norm in a typical year. You'll see that power come in the income statement this year, so you will see that dynamic. We expect to do a greater proportion of breakered deals or of smaller deals this year, new signings and we expect to see that come back into the income statement beginning in 2016. Hopefully that helps. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. Emmanuel Korchman : Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned continuing to focus on simplifying the sales and marketing platform and that contributing to a lower expense run-rate there. Could you elaborate on what you mean by simplifying? Is it less heads? Is it a more a focused ask of each person working within that platform? Is it different incentives, depending on what type of leases they're doing? Jeff Finnin : Emmanuel, I will give you some color around that and Tom can add to it, as well. But in general it is making sure that our productivity is increasing and productivity increasing goes to the standpoint, a little bit about what Tom comment on his comments around is streamlining, decision-making and making sure that we're as efficient and effective as possible there. The only thing I would had is that, as you saw, as a percentage of revenue come down a little bit in the quarter, we do expect it to go up a little bit as we've been adding some heads and we just didn't get them added in the fourth quarter, but they've come on here early in Q1 of this year. So expect that to come up around 5% to 5.5%, is what we guided to. Tom Ray : We had positions [inaudible] and we did eliminate a few positions in 2014 really just to reduce the extent to which people were bumping into each other and to create a leaner operating environment and quicker decision-making. We're just fundamentally pleased that some pretty minor adjustments around those things has helped contribute to significantly greater sales. It's just communication, making communication simpler. Emmanuel Korchman : Tom, in the past you have talked about how built out that organization is from a revenue production standpoint versus an expense load perspective, is the easiest way to think about it. Where would you say that is right now? Tom Ray : We're pretty close to equilibrium, Emmanuel. Any given month, you might have more churn among quota-bearing positions. I don't think we've had that in the last month or two but it will oscillate over the coming year, but where we stand right now is pretty close to equilibrium. I would say that our view of compensation to the sales team and our view of measuring productivity among that team is a deeper view now than it was a year ago. A year ago, that view really stopped at the ARPU or the GAAP rent line and now we're really focused on exactly what we described a few minutes ago and that is the distributable profit to the investor related to sales force activity. So we're measuring that relationship and we're defining productivity based on that metric and we believe that we can continue to get better. Emmanuel Korchman : Maybe another one for Jeff, it looks like some space came out of your office and light-industrial pool, but it doesn't look like that's had a major hit on rent, in 2014 nor in your guidance. How should we think about maybe what's going on in that bucket in 2015 and also do you plan to - you gave a new expiration schedule here for the office and light-industrial space, do you plan to renew those as they come due or are those all going to roll back into the development pool? Jeff Finnin : At least in terms of what happened in the quarter, Emmanuel, we had a particular customer that was leasing one of our light-industrial buildings out on our Santa Clara campus and that customer's lease came to an end about midway through the fourth quarter. So at this point in time, that particular light-industrial building is vacant. It's similar to what we had to do when we ultimately ended up building SV5 which was to make sure that our customers are out of there so at some point we can tear down the building and get it ready for future development. That's what happened in the quarter. That's really what happened in terms of the OLI life of the space for the quarter. In terms of going forward, the important thing is when you look at ultimately the remaining square feet that exists inside that office portfolio, you will see that the lion's share of that is office portfolio at SV1. That particular space is leased on a long-term basis to a governmental entity and so that's not going to change at any point in the near-term. So give that some thought in terms of as you guys look at the office. Hopefully that helps. Tom Ray : As Jeff said, as to that OLI building, the light-industrial building on the Santa Clara campus, we don't expect to attempt to re-lease that. It's available to be repurposed into a data center and the timing and the certainty of that is a discussion point, not decided, but we don't expect, within our guidance and within 2015, to rush out to market and try and backfill that with an industrial tenant. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Colby Synesael : Two questions, if I may. It seems like from an industry perspective there is an increasing focus on customers going to metered pricing as opposed to breakered. While I recognize that the company is going to focus more on smaller deals in 2015 versus 2014, can you just give us some color on where you think the line is in the sand these days in terms of customers who are still comfortable going to breakered power versus metered and maybe how that's been changing over time? And then the second question, as relates to 2016, which I recognize is obviously still a long ways out, but considering the planning process that's required to put new space on-line, how can we think about some things that might not be coming in guidance whether it's potential land purchases, M&A, you just talked about, for example, potentially reformatting some of your office space. How are you guys thinking about that right now, whether it's based on specific cities where you think you will need space or just more broadly how you are thinking about how you solve for that? Thanks. Tom Ray : As to the latter, you look at the four priorities that we laid out for our capital and we just expect to honor that sequencing. So in markets where we have sold successfully and we could generate attractive returns on capital, if we're out or about to be out, those are the areas where we're discussing how to approach that. Is it a new building, how else do we think about those? We're not going to talk about exactly what we may or may not do until we've made decisions, but the guiding principles are firmly established in the four categories of capital priority and then you match that against our property table and say, where have they been successful and where do they seem to not have a lot left? And then we rank these different priorities and make decisions, but we can't point to any specifics until we make decisions. We haven't done that yet. What was the first question? Jeff Finnin : Metered versus breakered. Tom Ray : Metered versus breakered, at a high level, the industry seems to have settled in reasonably well around 130 kilowatts and smaller, tend to have a much greater percentage of non-metered pricing models or power pricing models. And then you have that 130 to 250 where there's a lot of hybrid models. There are draw-cap models, other pricing models that are hybrids between metered and breakered and that hybrid model sometimes reaches up close to 500 kilowatts. Above 500 kilowatts, it is predominantly a traditionally metered market. So one of the things for us is to - we hope we have studied very carefully the hybrid models and the kinds of customers and the kinds of customer deployments where it might be more attractive for us to sell under a hybrid model versus the kinds of customers and deployments where it's unattractive to us to sell into a hybrid model. So we just - it's all mathematics and we just try to have good statistical data, analyze it and then be thoughtful about our go-to-market approach around those things. But that's how we see it. We see 130 and below pretty much breakered, 130 to 250, hybrid and above 500, almost always metered. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Barry McCarver with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question. Barry McCarver : You got most of them already covered. Back on the discussion around M&A, you talked about that internationally, but what about consolidation here in the U.S. some. We still have a pretty good number of mid and large providers with some unique footprints. Your thoughts on what we could see here this year or next? Tom Ray : Over the very long haul, consolidation among providers is probably a healthy thing and maybe a natural outcome over a long period of time, but you also have different social dynamics going on and different multiples. It's very hard to determine what's going to happen among publics over the next year or two, that story might take longer to play out. Who knows? There are private assets that I think will come to market and you will see different among the publics going after those private assets. But even there, that the publics now have a pretty good view of what fits for them and there's, at least for us, we think there's a fairly logical outcome among some of the private assets and where those end up has more to do with the timing than anything else. Barry McCarver : Okay. And then, Tom, you said in your prepared remarks that without that large wholesale customer in the quarter, average rental rates would have been above the previous 12 month average? Tom Ray : Yes. Barry McCarver : Can you give us an idea - can you give a little more color about exactly how much higher? Tom Ray : I can't. We really want to but if we get specific then that leads to back solving into the VA lease and we're just prohibited from doing that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Matthew Heinz : I was just hoping to get back to your commentary around the composition of cloud and content bookings in the current year and your focus on signing a higher number of smaller-sized deals. Was just hoping to get some detail around the application or workload type you be targeting as compared to last couple of years and is that really more of a function of some demand shift you're seeing or is that something that's more strategic on your end? Tom Ray : It's really what we're trying to get done. And it's the timing of when some of the other - what we think will be larger public clouds. Some of those organizations are going to be coming to market with more on-ramps and as such more caching in 2015 than the market saw in 2014. So we would like to grab our share of that and we think that will be greater than it was last year. So as to the larger, longer-term storage component of those companies' architectures, we did more of that in 2014 than we expect to 2015. Matthew Heinz : And then just a follow-up. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how your same-store MRR per cab breaks down by its component, maybe in terms of the base co-lo rents versus the newer fiber connectivity and then the legacy copper connectivity? Tom Ray : The best place to take it is right off the income statement. You've got data center revenues and you've got interconnection revenues. Jeff Finnin : That's representative of what it is, Matt. When you look at, overall, when you look at the growth associated with the dollars year-over-year, I can tell that you roughly 75% of that growth is coming from our increase in power revenue and increase in interconnect business. In terms of the individual components, it's consistent with what you see on the income statement. Tom Ray : To that, we've seen nice growth in MRR per cab over the last couple of years. Getting back to what we communicated about a greater proportion of metered power coming into the income statement in 2015 than the historical norm, you will see that MRR per cab growth slow down or - I don't know if it will flat-line for a Q. It is going to slow down, because of this metered dynamic and because of these larger deals with lower rent. You will see that moderate in 2015 and if we execute what we plan to execute in terms of new sales in 2015, we would expect to move that up at a faster rate beginning next year. Matthew Heinz : Right, I was getting at the flattish nature of the MRR this quarter on a sequential basis. We've seen a trend of pretty steady quarter-over-quarter increases in that number and I was just wondering if - obviously the power dynamics have a lot to do with that, but I was wondering if there's anything else you are seeing in terms of conversions. I didn't notice that you gave us the fiber volume numbers this quarter in the prepared comments. Did I miss that? Tom Ray : I thought we did. If we failed to, we'll certainly update those next quarter. There is no - the trend around fiber growth has been favorable. Jeff Finnin : It's been consistent with what we saw in the previous quarters as well, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Tayo Okusanya : Most of my questions have been answered. Gentlemen, in light of what happened at DFT this quarter and the unpleasant surprise of a tenant basically now not paying rent, just wanted to ask questions about your overall tenant roster, whether there was anyone on your watch list, where over the next six to 12 months, you do have some concern about that company's viability, that maybe we should know about sooner than later? Tom Ray : Not really. To the extent we have any views around that, it's reflected in the churn guidance and in the churn discussion around those three dynamics. We've got an enterprise in LA. We've got maybe the opportunity at some point during the year in SB3 and then you have a content person re-architecting to some extent, that's it. I just look at this dynamic as real estate 101. Look, there are times when just credit tenancies are fortresses in terms of churn. There are times when heavily, heavily multi-tenanted buildings with a good diverse rent roll are steadier. I'm not suggesting one business model is better than the other. I'm just saying those are both ways of managing disruption and our business model speaks to lots of customers, lots of leases, heavily, heavily multi-tenanted and that's another way of managing churn and disruption. So to the extent we think there's any out there, we've disclosed it on this call. Tayo Okusanya : And then again, while I know on a near-term basis you guys are definitely focused on the markets you are already in and expanding those assets, I'm just curious with many of your other peers operating in, quote unquote, Tier 2 market, how attractive you find some of those Tier 2 marks whether a little bit, not at all? Tom Ray : Tayo, I would just fit into it those four priorities and that would be in bucket number four. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Bejjani with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question. John Bejjani : Most of my questions have been answered but just wanted to ask about G&A. In your guidance you've got a growing 10% year-over-year. Can you just offer some color as to what is driving the increase? Tom Ray : Yes, large top-line growth. G&A is growing much more slowly than revenue and much more slowly than profit, but our business is still growing rapidly and you are going to see some G&A growth. The math says the G&A is getting more and more efficient every year, but as long as we keep growing, you will probably continue to see some growth in G&A. Our job is just to make that growth at a lower rate. John Bejjani : Yes, I just figured most of the - as you guys grow, a lot of this would be at the sales and marketing level as opposed to corporate level, so just hence my question? Jeff Finnin : Just in general, John, as Tom mentioned, continuing to grow some level of G&A at a much slower pace than what the top line is growing at is obviously something we continue to watch and it's really just necessitated on incremental individuals we need to support the office and to make sure we're supporting the go-to-mark platform, that's really what's driving that. They're not enormous increases in headcount, but there are obviously some amount in order to make sure that we're giving them the support they need as they go out and execute. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Thomas Ray for closing remarks. Tom Ray : Thank you. Well, we want to say thanks to the investment community and to our Board and for everybody for helping make 2014 a great year and giving us optimism for running a better business, doing more with an investor's dollar of capital in 2015 than we did in 2014 and continuing to grow. More than anything, I want to also say thanks to the employees at CoreSite. People have worked incredibly hard. We've been through a lot of change and we've just gotten better and better and that's because of the heart and soul and hard work of the people, so thank you there as well. We're all going to continue to work hard to serve our investors. Thanks a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Derek McCandless, General Counsel. Thank you. Please go ahead. Derek S. McCandless - Secretary, Senior VP-Legal & General Counsel : Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2015 conference call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. CoreSite had a solid first quarter, both in financial results and operating performance. We continue to execute our business plan, and are pleased that we were able to further increase efficiency across our company and see our work reflected in our quantitative results. Specifically, our financial results reflect an increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 48.1%, measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q1 2015. This represents an increase of 166 basis points over the comparable period in the prior year. Additionally, we increased stabilized data center occupancy by 520 basis points over the last 12 months to 88.2%. Driven by these dynamics, our Q1 results reflect continued growth with increases in total operating revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and FFO of 17%, 26% and 27% respectively over Q1 2014. Leasing in Q1 was also solid with new and expansion leasing totaling $8.9 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 100 new and expansion leases totaling 54,000 net rentable square feet, at an average rental rate of $163 per square foot. During the quarter, we saw continued strength in leasing among mid-sized opportunities. Specifically in Q1, we executed five leases exceeding 1,000 square feet, totaling approximately 40,000 square feet for an average of 8,000 square feet each. Importantly, we also made progress towards our goal of increasing leasing volume to smaller customer requirements that we believe generate higher revenue per square foot than larger wholesale requirements. Specifically, in Q1 we executed 95 leases of less than 1,000 square feet, averaging a 152 square feet each. In total, we executed 100 new and expansion leases in Q1, representing a 4% increase in the number of leases signed over Q4 2014. As we communicated previously, we are focused upon increasing the total number of leases signed each quarter, and importantly, the number of small and mid-sized leases. While we are pleased to see an increase in total leases executed in Q1, going forward, we believe that we have an opportunity to drive additional growth in leasing volume among smaller deployments. In addition to strength in new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q1 was similarly strong, as renewals sold approximately 40,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $179 per square foot, reflecting mark-to-market growth of 5.3% on a cash basis and 11.4% on a GAAP basis. In terms of geography, Q1 leasing was well distributed across our portfolio with our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent being the Bay Area, New York, and Northern Virginia, D.C. In New York, we executed a lease in Q1 with a global financial services enterprise, but leased a computer room at NY2. This lease reflects a lower than typical rent per square foot, driven by lower power density requirements than it's typical in our portfolio. We believe the return on capital associated with this lease remains attractive. In the Bay Area, we leased an additional computer room at SV3, backfilling that room approximately two years before the scheduled expiration of the lease with the previous full building customer. As of the end of Q1, we have backfilled 75% of the capacity at SV3, with the remaining computer room occupied by the original customer through April 2016, and with solid demand for that space. Turning to our vertical performance, we saw significant strength in our enterprise vertical, accounting for 52% of new and expansion leases executed, and 85% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the quarter. We also continued to see strength in our network and cloud verticals, together accounting for 48% of new and expansion leases executed in Q1. We believe this reflects continued strong demand for network connectivity coming from carriers, content providers, and larger enterprises that are increasingly integrating their corporate communication networks partly driven by deployments of private and/or hybrid clouds. In addition to our Q1 leasing results, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we executed a lease for and began construction on the powered shell build-to-suit for 136,500 square feet on land we own on our Santa Clara campus. This building will be known as SV6, and the build-to-suit supports the needs of a strategic customer. We believe this project will add strategic value to our Santa Clara campus, while also producing a return on capital in line with our stated objectives. We expect to invest approximately $27 million to construct SV6, and anticipate that the lease will commence in the first half of 2016. Upon completion of SV6, we expect our Santa Clara campus to be comprised of four operating data centers, comprising approximately 390,000 square feet, plus an additional land site, upon which we anticipate being able to construct a new data center. Moving on to supply and demand conditions in our markets, we see the market substantially consistently with how we saw them at the time of our call two months ago. Regarding our plans for growth, we continue to build out additional TKD capacity in our existing powered shells. Two key projects currently under development are the second phases of both NY2 and VA2, each representing approximately 50,000 net rentable square feet of incremental TKD capacity, which we anticipate substantially completing and placing into service in Q2. We continue to view our internal growth opportunity optimistically, and believe it is driven by three key factors. First is our ability to continue to achieve positive mark-to-market on renewals across the portfolio. Second is the continued lease-up of our currently available 207,000 square feet of TKD capacity. And third is the steady execution of our development program on land and in buildings we currently own. To wrap-up, our operating results for the first quarter reflect continued execution of our business plan. We believe that CoreSite remains well-positioned within our industry, and that the supply and demand dynamics in the markets we serve remain favorable. We will continue to focus upon providing our customers with industry-leading solutions and service, running our business efficiently, and managing our capital prudently, all with the goal to generate strong returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Tom, and hello everyone. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q1 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development activity and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity. And third, I will discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Turning to our financial performance in the first quarter, data center revenues were $72.6 million, a 2.8% increase on a sequential quarter basis, and a 17.7% increase over the prior-year quarter. Our Q1 data center revenue consisted of $61 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 3.2% on a sequential quarter basis, and 19.8% year-over-year; $10.2 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 7.1% on a sequential quarter basis and 26.8% year-over-year, and $1.4 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $2.1 million. Our first quarter FFO was $0.64 per diluted share and unit, an increase of 4.9% on a sequential quarter basis, and a 25.5% increase year-over-year excluding non-recurring items in Q1 of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA of $38 million increased 4.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 26.3% over the same quarter last year. As Tom mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA margin continued to expand through Q1; related, our Q1 results represent revenue flow through to annualized adjusted EBITDA and FFO of 72% and 58% respectively, which is a significant improvement on a year-over-year basis. In thinking about our margins for the remainder of the year, keep in mind that our adjusted EBITDA margin has historically been negatively impacted by seasonal increases in our cost of power, which typically occurs in the second and third quarters. Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter totaled $3.8 million, approximately 5.1% of total operating revenues, up 40 basis points, compared to last quarter, and in line with our guidance of approximately 5% to 5.5% of total operating revenues for the full year. General and administrative expenses were $7.9 million in Q1 correlating to 10.5% of total operating revenues. We continue to expect G&A for 2015 to correlate to approximately 10% of total operating revenue. Regarding our same-store metrics, Q1 same-store turn-key data center occupancy increased by more than 11 percentage points to 83.1% from 71.6% in the first quarter of 2014. Additionally, same-store MRR per cabinet equivalent increased by 5.1% year-over-year. That said, same-store MRR per cabi was essentially flat on a sequential basis, as we expected, due to the greater proportion of wholesale leasing relative to total leasing we completed in 2014, compared to prior years. We expect a similar dynamic in MRR per cabinet equivalent in the near future, and are focused upon executing leases with higher MRR per cabi in 2015, with a view towards returning to a higher growth rate in this metric in the mid-term. Remember that our same-store pool is redefined annually in the first quarter, and only includes turn-key data center space that was leased or available to be leased to our co-location customers as of December 31, 2013, at each of our properties and excludes powered shell and SV3 data center space. Also, as we communicated previously, churn in Q1 was elevated above that of the recent past. However, it was elevated for positive reasons, pointing to the health of our business. Specifically, churn in the first quarter was 2.2%, which includes 120 basis points related to two transactions at SV3, each accelerating the backfill of space in the building currently leased by the building's original full building customer. Excluding these two transactions, Q1 churn would have been 1% in line with recent experience for our company. We note as well that leases signed at SV3 also point towards incremental churn of approximately 150 basis points during the fourth quarter. Our backlog of projected annualized GAAP rent from signed, but not yet commenced leases is $14 million as of March 31, 2015 or $20.9 million on a cash basis. We expect approximately 87% or $12.2 million of the GAAP backlog to commence by the end of the second quarter of 2015. To that, leases representing approximately $5.7 million or 41% of the GAAP backlog commenced on April 1, 2015. The remaining GAAP backlog is expected to commence over the next four quarters. Please note that all of the preceding information related to our backlog excludes the impact of the build-to-suit lease at SV6 executed subsequent to the end of the quarter. As Tom noted, the combination of solid new leasing in the first quarter and high retention drove an increase in occupancy in our stabilized operating data center portfolio by 80 basis points over Q4 to close Q1 at 88.2%. Keep in mind that the recently developed data center projects that are in the initial lease up phase are classified as pre-stabilized until they reach 85% occupancy or have been in service for 24 months. To that point, in the first quarter, two rooms at LA2 totaling 29,000 square feet moved from the pre-stabilized pool into our stabilized pool as they have now been in service for two years. Additionally, as shown on page 19 of the supplemental 15,000 square feet at SV4 and 20,000 square feet at CH1 will move into our stabilized pool in the second quarter. Turning to development activity, as Tom mentioned, we began construction on the build-to-suit powered shell data center on the Santa Clara campus during the first quarter. Incremental to that, we had 48,000 square feet of data center space under construction at VA2 Phase 2. We expect to complete construction of this project in the second quarter of 2015. We also had 49,000 square feet under construction at NY2 Phase 2, which is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, we had 12,000 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at CH1 in Chicago. At the end of the first quarter, we had invested $19.6 million of the estimated $78.1 million required to complete all of the projects currently under construction. As a reminder, when we complete development projects, we realized a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance, resulting in a corresponding increase in operating expense. For 2015, we estimate the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 25% to 30% depending on the volume and pace of development during the year. Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2015, our debt to Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.2 times. And if you include our preferred stock, it is three times. As we have discussed previously, we target a stabilized ratio of debt plus preferred stock to annualized adjusted EBITDA of approximately four times. We remain focused upon maintaining the liquidity and available capital necessary to execute our business plans and support growth. In support of those goals, as of March 31, 2015, we had $233.8 million drawn on our credit facility, and approximately $164 million of available capacity under the facility. Finally, we are reiterating our 2015 FFO guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per share NOP unit. We are increasing our guidance for capital expenditures by $30 million to a range of $115 million to $145 million, primarily to account for the development of the powered shell build-to-suit on the Santa Clara campus. All other guidance metrics we disclosed in our fourth quarter earnings call remain unchanged, and a thorough summary of all 2015 guidance can found on page 24 of the first quarter earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we've discussed today. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning out there guys. Tom, maybe first question for you; I understand the power revenue impact with regard to the leasing that you had done in 2014. I guess, I wanted to maybe dig in little bit on the MRR per cabi in your outlook for 2015. I mean, do we expect it to be flat? I thought the last commentary on the last call was kind of slower growth, but obviously we saw it drop a little bit sequentially. And then, maybe just to tag one more into that whole confusing question was; the cross-connect impact. I mean, should we expect to see cross-connect revenue growth then kind of slow later in the year, the same that power is seeing, but on a delayed basis? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, as to the power revenue, Dave, I think that, MRR per cabi \u2013 so just \u2013 the bottom line is, the MRR per cabi on these wholesale deals is typically lower, and in some cases substantially lower than on the more transactional deals \u2013 the smaller deals. And last year, we signed a much greater proportion of larger wholesale deals, as we were getting out of the gate and stabilizing some \u2013 getting traction at VA2 and NY2. So those \u2013 the MRR per cabi off of those big deals, because the big deals get factored into our MRR per cabinet equivalent. So the MRR per cabi off of those big deals is lower than the installed base. We've got this kind of anchor this year that's dragging it down a little bit. You also have lease up activity going on this year, that's countervailing, pushing things up, but I think the net for this year as these big deals ramp, commence and get going, especially in the first half of the year will be fairly flat, maybe it's down a little bit, maybe it's up a little bit, but I think it will be a fairly flat. After those leases commence, and provided we continue to execute in the transaction engine, we expect the MRR per cabi of new sales to be greater than the big wholesale deals done last year, and to be greater than the MRR per cabi in the installed base. So we would hope that we'll get \u2013 we'll see a return to growth in the MRR per cabi stat, maybe late this year, maybe it's next year, but those wholesale (21:47) deals are just kind of an anchor in there, what we told people to expect, and those rates are below that of the installed base. Regarding interconnection revenue, I just think, you need to look at that separately from the wholesales deals. Again, the interconnection revenue is more driven by network-dense deployments that are typically not very large, super large wholesale deals by cloud-based deployments and by certain enterprise deployments. And so, that business line, if you will, is just distinct from this wholesale business line. So we've been seeing consistent growth in the more transactional side of our business. Even while last year, we layered a bunch of wholesale on top. And so, that should point toward fairly consistent growth in interconnection revenue going forward, because that business that generates that growth is still healthy. What we're really saying is, in 2015, we expect to do less large wholesale than we did in 2014, but we should \u2013 our objectives is frankly to accelerate sales around the transaction engine, even if total sales in terms of megawatts decline this year because we're doing less wholesale. Does that answer your question? Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. I think, you got all the parts of it. So I do appreciate that. And then maybe a follow-up on that in terms of the sales force productivity, you spent last year building that out. Do you feel you're at, at the right run rate now, I mean, obviously there's always more to do, but are you pretty happy with the level of production now, where you're running the first quarter? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I guess, I think, we're fully staffed. We have people in the seats that we want to have \u2013 have in. I do think we can continue to improve in terms of productivity, you know, some of those people are still newer and fewer of them are on ramps in the end of the last year, but some are still on ramp. And even for some who are off ramp, they're probably not as productive as we would expect or hope, later in the year. So I don't think we need to add positions, but we do believe that we can do better than we're doing right now; we're not displeased, but we think we can continue to improve. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Last question from me. Jeff, with regard to your debt comments, I think it's clear that you're indicating you don't need the equity, but in terms of terming out some of that debt, if you did comment, I might have missed it. But any thoughts on timing or how you might go to market to take some of that off the line? Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Dave. I think in general from the type, I think, in general, we would continue to do what we enjoy, or I guess what we prefer, which is ultimately trying to maintain as much flexibility in our capital structure as possible. That, combined with the size of the proceeds \u2013 if we were looking at something today, our revolver only has about $233 million drawn on it today. So we don't need an enormous amount of capital. So that combined with maintaining flexibility is \u2013 leans towards doing something else, probably akin to a term loan, similar to what we did a little over a year ago. Timing, I think we're closer to it today than we were a year ago, and it's something we're looking at and continuing to monitor around the exact timing on. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. Thanks for the color, guys. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Dave, really quickly, regarding leasing and productivity, I want to reinforce this \u2013 the comment around the distinction between wholesale leasing and what we think of as our transaction engine. So when I say we're working to increase productivity and production, it's really on the transaction end. So we don't want people on the phone to take that statement of we think we can get more productive, as we're going to see more wholesale leasing come in and more kilowatts and square footage being sold. That's not what we're trying to do this year. So I just want to underscore that distinction. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey guys; just had a question for you on SV6. Is that lease at a set amount of power or do they have variable sort of uptake that they can take and they can expand their needs as they grow in the space. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a powered shell, Manny, with a maximum allocation from the substation onsite. They get their allocated share that they can use in the building. If they use less than that, fine, but they can't use more than that. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And the reason I asked, if you \u2013 based on your schedules here in the held for development bucket, the range for the \u2013 the rest of the campus dropped to 12 megawatts to 18 megawatts from 20 megawatts to 35 megawatts. So, SV6 is going to be somewhere between 8 megawatts and 17 megawatts. Is that the right way to think about it? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We can't speak specifically to SV6, Manny, we just \u2013 we'll ask you to just interpret this up. We can't say anything about that lease. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And then, it looked like you had a couple of leases drop out in NY2 \u2013 the lease percentage went down a little bit. Can you talk more about that? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We had a lease that we signed in the prior Q that we had targeted to commence inside the Phase 1 in that building \u2013 Phase 1 space. And some of the things the customer is looking for were a little bit different as we worked toward implementation. We put them in Phase 2. So you saw a square footage come out of Phase 1 and go into Phase 2. Phase 1... Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : 68%. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, 68% Phase 2, 50%... Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : 68%, it's about 40% range. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, the average is 53% I think. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : 54%, yeah. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: 54%. But that's why Phase 1 bounced. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. That was it for me guys. Thank you. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : You bet. Thanks, Manny. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for the incremental detail on the enterprise leasing activity this quarter. I'm just wondering if there are specific metros where you're seeing notable enterprise demand uptick or whether that's more of a broad-based function of your sales focused on smaller to mid-sized deployment? Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : It's really broad based. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then as a follow-up to that, just sort of reconciling the flattish MRR per cabi, kind of this quarter and subsequent quarters with the strong uptick in rate per square foot booked this quarter. Just given the heavy enterprise mixed book this quarter, I'm wondering kind of what the underlying dynamics there are between metered versus breakered power and kind of the appetite for fiber connectivity within that enterprise base? Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think we need to distinguish between enterprise and wholesale. You can sign wholesale deals with enterprises, you can sign more transactional deals with enterprises that are on a breakered amp as opposed to a metered power base (29:08) would generate more cross connects per square foot. So the dynamic that is unfolding at the moment in terms of more MRR per cabi is, the rent on the wholesale deals we signed last year is, though in some cases not \u2013 generally speaking is not bad rent, but it doesn't generate a lot of cross connects, and it's all sold on a metered basis. So your MRR per cabi is total revenue. So when you throw a couple of big wholesale deals in the pot in a given year, they might have a strong space rent, but they're not going to have MRR per cabi, total revenue, like the rest of your base. And then as to the enterprise vertical and going forward, I think the key to focus on with us is, as you already enquired, what percent of the leases are likely to be \u2013 and what percent of square footage sold is likely to be on a breakered amp basis versus metered. We're trying to give people some insight into that when we say; we signed five deals that were greater than 1,000 feet. Everything else was less than 1,000 feet. And generally speaking, less than 1,000 feet is more often going to be breakered, and end up generating more cross connects per square foot. So, that's the map and those are the dynamics. Does that help? Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful commentary. Thank you very much. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Barry McCarver with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys, and good quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess first off, Tom, would you speak kind of broadly to all of your markets, what you're seeing in terms of the demand, and then supply coming on from some of your competitors? Any big changes there? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, not big ones, I think that, that broadly spoken Barry, I think most of the markets are getting better, showing a little bit of a price strengthening over the last few quarters. I probably carve out Los Angeles, Boston, and Miami that are not negative; they're just reasonably flat or maybe showing that 2% to 3% annual inflation-related market adjustment. The rest of the markets in general, I think are showing a little more health in that. I wouldn't point to one that I think is measurably different than we said it was a quarter ago. Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.: Are you seeing any kind of unusual speculative building in some of the bigger markets or is that pretty even with demand? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's pretty even with demand at least in terms of permits and breaking ground. There are \u2013 anytime rents are rising, I think you see more people looking for dirt and thinking about doing more. I wouldn't say the behavior around that right now is outsized, but we see a little more interest. I would expect that to accelerate over the next couple of years. And \u2013 but we haven't seen any speculative behavior that we think is going to be meaningfully disruptive in the near-term. Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then just let me touch again on the sales productivity, which I know we've already kind of beat to death, but you've had several really strong quarters in a row. And then in your prepared remarks early on, you mentioned that the thought the total number of leases you sign each quarter could continue to go up. I mean what are your kind of targets or thoughts for this year on just the number of deals on a quarterly basis, you're going to ramp up to? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And Barry, we're really just thinking more up into the right in the transactional engine. So again, if you think of it this way, much for wholesale last year, we have a \u2013 we would hope to have less wholesale this year relative to total leasing. And we're not going to work to try and do more wholesale than that might suggest. If the markets are favorable, and if we get more production out of our team, we want to get that in that smaller transactional bucket. And look, all we can say is, we were up 4% or 5% this quarter over last quarter. And we think we have \u2013 we've staffed, and we've invested such to do better, and go up into the right, it's really hard to predict the slope of that curve, we're just focused on up into the right. Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.: And just so, I'm clear on the concept, and certainly, I understand the difference between, your transactional deals and the wholesale deals, but for this strategic customer that you've announced that you'll be building here. And that's really more driven by that customer's demand, I mean that's not really something you're out there, selling or avoiding the sale, it's a current customer that needs additional space, is that the way to think about that? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well yeah, I mean \u2013 I think we are now established as a highly capable developer, and there are \u2013 there's a market for those development services, so we don't shy away from it. It's not traditionally been a big piece of our business. I think you see that business more active where you already have land. And so you see that from us in Santa Clara, this is our second build-to-suit. Our general view on build-to-suits is, as we've said in the past, to build a 100,000 square foot or 200,000 square foot building on a TKD basis at today's rate, probably does not make sense for our balance sheet, but if you can serve an important need, accelerate monetization of land you own, and get a good yield on the capital going to build the shell, that's a business we've executed successfully in the past. I think we have another one this quarter, and we don't shy away from it in the future as well, but it's \u2013 I think the growth of that business probably has more to do with land, and we're pretty happy where we're right now in terms of having spec land lying around. Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.: Very good. Thanks, guys. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd just say if we \u2013 to the extent we buy any more land in the future, it's going to be with a view towards putting it to use in our TKD program and it's going to make that clarification. We're not trying to go long on land and build a gigantic development services business. Development services is a good business, we will not shy away from it, we'll do it when it's smart. But probably not going to be a big piece of our balance sheet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore. Please go ahead with your questions. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This Bob (35:53) for Jonathan. Pricing this quarter looked pretty good at $163 per square foot and above the trailing 12 month average. I was wondering if power density is a factor here or if this is just rising pricing on an apples-to-apples basis. And I was wondering also if you could just go through and reiterate the targeted stabilized trends for development project including SV6? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks for the question. Regarding the increase in rates, power density for the Q is in line with the trail. So we just did see better rates in general, and better yield on the lease assigned in the last Q, that can be affected little bit by geography, and I just neglected to take that part of it apart this time, and compare it to the trail, we get higher rates in LA than we do in Miami. I think in terms of geographic distribution, it's reasonably consistent with the trail, nothing really anomalous. So that's the rent per foot answer. It was just a little bit better. And what was the other question, I'm sorry. Unknown Speaker : Stabilized deals \u2013 targeted stabilized deals on the development project, and the new ones, BTS \u2013 any BTS project? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Same old story. We've been saying for four and a half years, we target north of a 12% (37:15) on the use of our capital, and there are times when we do a whole lot better than that. The \u2013 we believe the build-to-suit, the return on incremental capital, we're going to invest in that is in line with our objectives. And the range of yields we get on our respective elements, again, we shoot for north of 12% (37:40) we've been, I think pretty good at making that happen, and we've had some that are considerably higher. We just don't really like pointing at that. And over time, as you compare us to others, just look at the change in EBITDA, and you look at the change in the balance sheet and yields over three-year or four-year period will be crystal clear in the math. And we invite people to continue to perform that diligence on us. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you for taking the question. Regarding rents rising, you made a comment in the response to a question here, and you've also said that the supply/demand dynamic remains favorable, which make some sense. Can you maybe quantify what you're seeing in terms of market rent increases or what you expect to see? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: My best quantification, Jordan would be poquito (38:49). It's \u2013 you're seeing some. Nothing is going to wild, right. The \u2013 it's tighter in most of the markets, but most of the markets still have the same number of competitors who are still out there with some degree of capacity. I think you just see more discipline across the industry now. People have learned what works and what doesn't work and start to say no to things that don't work. And markets are a little bit tighter. So look, yeah it's moving in the right direction. I just don't think we're going to see huge spikes, and we're not seeing those right now. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Can it be more equilibrium oriented? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's my guess. Yeah. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: (39:30) increases. Okay. Okay. Along the same lines, this build-to-suit, I noticed that the cost on a per square foot basis was plus 5% or so relative to SV5, and number one, I'm hoping, I'm comparing apples-to-apples in terms of what you're building, but separately would it be safe to assume that the rents would be up a similar amount? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Just can't speak to that lease at all, Jordan. We \u2013 I thought we met somebody's need in a way that was very good for our company last time. I think the markets are little bit more competitive right now and we're responsive to that, but we still felt very good about the new lease, and again our statements that we feel, it's in line with our hurdle is where we stand. But we can't point to anything about that lease in particular. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Okay, and that's fair, I guess I'm \u2013 I think, I'm curious more about you guys building PBB, and it seems like you're saying look we'll do PBB when everything makes sense. But I know, your land is inventory in a market like Silicon Valley or Santa Clara is kind of scarce or becoming increasingly scarce. How do you think about \u2013 and you have another lot of left, and I think you said, you'd build another data center on there; can you maybe talk about that, is that something you're looking to do on speculative basis? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, our comments in the prepared remarks were that we believe we have the opportunity to build another data center there, and it's certainly something we look at. We are getting very full in the Bay Area, and then it turns to a question of \u2013 discussions with our Board around what's the best use of the balance sheet, and what are the most attractive alternatives on not only return, but a risk adjusted return basis. And certainly Santa Clara is in the mix of things that we're looking hard at. But there are a lot of, we believe, intelligent things to do with our capital, and we're still working through that prioritization with our Board. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Can you just remind us what the cost of power is at Stender, roughly? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Going from $0.10 to close to $0.11 plus or minus. Yeah. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: About $0.11 currently. It's gone up again in that whole area. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your questions. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. When you look at the growth rate that you've been achieving, call it the last 12 months, and arguably the growth rate that you aspire to achieve the next 12 months, relative to your current development pipeline, how comfortably do you feel with the number and the timing \u2013 the number of projects and the timing to which those projects are expected to come online to effectively have enough capacity in the market, based on the type of demand that you're seeing in those markets, to continue at those growth rates? And then, I just wanted to go back to the question related to metered versus breakered. Certainly appreciate that you see the majority of call it sub-500 kW deals being breakered. But are you seeing an increasing number of those deals or those customers asking for metered? I guess, are we seeing a trend potentially developing there? Thank you. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, you do see more of the markets, sub-500 kW, and this is consistent with past statements over the last year, year and a half. There is clearly market pressure in that 130 kilowatts to 500 kilowatts range, for more of that to be either metered or a synthetic meter basis \u2013 a draw cap model or other models that have less return on them in terms of total revenue than a pure breakered model that is smaller. That threshold is pushed from 500 kilowatts down to 250 kilowatts to 130 kilowatts, and it's a little muddy in that 130 kilowatts to 500 kilowatts range, but you are seeing pressure \u2013 downward pressure. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Growth and development pipeline? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think on growth and development \u2013 look in the \u2013 certainly in the foreseeable future, we feel very good about our ability to grow the company. And if you look at how we've done that in the recent history, the last four and half years, a significant amount of our growth comes from the Bay Area, D.C./Virginia, LA. A year, year and a half ago, we added New York to that; so that's kind of our big four. Chicago and Boston have been kind of medium-sized growth contributors, and then Denver and Miami are frankly pretty small. And so, the key for us is continuing to fuel in these big markets. We've accomplished a significant growth rate really three out of those four markets over the years, because we didn't have NY2. Now we have NY2 and we have plenty of room to run in three markets : NY2, Virginia and LA, and we're certainly looking at the Bay Area, because that's where we are constrained. But even without that, I think we can continue to do a good job of growing the company. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: If I can then Tom, just a follow-up to that line of questioning. What is the \u2013 what should we be expecting as it relates to announcements for newbuilds as we go into call it the middle or the back half of next year. Is it fair to assume that there should be another two or three announcements that we'll see come across the tape? Or is it something different? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well look, we just \u2013 we \u2013 first we look at growth the way we've described it, with these four layers. And the first layer is depth inside markets we're currently active in. And we look at how much room is left to \u2013 how much capacity can we continue to deliver really in those big four markets, and to some extent the other two, Chicago and Boston, and we look at our balance sheet capability, and we match those things up. I'll encourage you guys to do the same. If there's a point where your forecast says we've delevered below where we are right now in terms of times EBITDA coverage, and your model says we're running out of inventory in Virginia, that's probably something we're going to \u2013 want to use that debt capacity to go address. But it's a dynamic relationship between these four prioritizations of capital, the first one being the markets we're in and our balance sheet and specifically our leverage capacity. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we're toggling those two things all the time and encourage you guys to think about your models the same way. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your questions. Tayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Tayo. Tayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Yeah. I'm just trying to reconcile the guidance versus results and your outlook. So you beat for the quarter, there's a focus left on wholesale going forward, which should improve margins. You have a strong development pipeline. So I'm just curious why guidance numbers did not go up given the positive momentum. I'm just \u2013 is there anything I'm kind of missing in the back-half of the year? Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Tayo. It's Jeff. Thanks for the comments. I think just in general when you look at our results for Q1, obviously we're happy with the results, and that would equate out to a run rate of about $2.56 per share, that's obviously at the \u2013 right at the low end of our guidance for the year. Tayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Right. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : I think as you think about your models going forward, I just want to point you to a couple of things that I mentioned on the prepared remarks. First, we always have margin compression around our power in the second quarter and third quarter of every year, that was at the times when the rates increased, so just focus a little bit on that. And then secondly, the other item is, as we're finishing development obviously, we finish development on the first phase at VA2 this quarter, and we'll finish the second phases of development at both NY2 and VA2 next quarter, that's going to lead to a lower amount of capitalized interest, taxes and insurance. Tayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Right. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Broadly speaking, we've guided the last quarter to say that our percentage of capitalized interest would drop to somewhere between 25% and 30% for the year. In the first quarter, we are right at about 50%. So if you take that run rate for the quarter from the first quarter, that difference between the 50% actual and 30% where we think it'll be for the whole year is roughly $500,000 to $600,000 per quarter. So just factor that into your modeling as well. Tayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Got it. All very helpful tidbits (49:05). Appreciated. Thank you. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. Just one last follow-up on the macro picture. So we're still presumably in the early innings here on the turn in \u2013 in industry pricing, and you talked about kind of a better discipline across the space in terms of spec development. But I guess, the last time we had bullish pricing cycle that didn't take long for the non-traditional capital to kind of come in and chase a little bit. Do you think it's different this time around and just given the maturation of the industry over the last several years or could we once again see more new non-traditional players coming into \u2013 to the space? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I do think, the highest level that real estate development cycles tend to repeat themselves, I think it's hard to get away from that. So \u2013 and again, I think that, that activity has a much greater impact on wholesale rents. We're really trying to really drive growth in the non-wholesale part of our business, but it takes time to get land, get power, get entitled and get built. So certainly over the next year or maybe even two years, you have pretty good visibility that \u2013 it's highly unlikely that supply is going to get out of hands. Two years or three years from now, I think if yields are gone up, I think alternative capital is going find its way back into the sector, and I think the wholesale business will remain somewhat cyclical. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Into the cycles \u2013 cycles is the amplitude, start to decrease a little bit as people get wiser or maybe as markets get bigger, maybe, but I still think you're going to see meaningful cyclicality in the wholesale sector over time. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to Tom Ray for closing remarks. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we just want to say thank you to, again to everybody on the call, investors and the analyst community. Thanks for putting the time to trying to understand our company better and better. We want to say thanks to our employees who've been working incredibly hard and continuing to do so and continuing to get sharper, better, faster more productive. And we're going to keep trying to move that trend forward and generate returns for our investors. Thanks again for your time. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

McCandless - Secretary, Senior VP-Legal & General Counsel : Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 conference call. I am joined here today by Tom Ray, our President and CEO; Steve Smith, our Senior Vice President, Sales and Sales Operations; and Jeff Finnin, our Chief Financial Officer. As we begin our call, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding projections, plans or future expectations. These forward-looking statements reflect current views and expectations, which are based on currently available information and management's judgment. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that the expectation will be attained. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. Also, on this conference call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of our website at coresite.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, and welcome to our Q2 call. Financial results for the quarter reflect continued steady growth, recording year-over-year increases in revenue of 24% and adjusted EBITDA and FFO of 19% each. Importantly, our financial results reflect an increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 49.3%, measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q2 2015. This represents an increase of 163 basis points over the comparable period ending with and including Q2 2014. Second quarter new and expansion leasing activity was exceptionally strong with record leasing totaling $19.6 million in annualized GAAP rents and 244,000 net rentable square feet. Our Q2 results reflect continued systematic growth in our core performance sensitive co-location activities with accelerating execution of smaller leases driving attainment of a milestone for our company. Specifically, at the end of Q2, our portfolio was comprised of over 1,500 leases of 5,000 net rentable square feet or less, representing over 90% of all leases in place in our company. We estimate that our leases in this size range correlate to an average size of less than 30 kilowatts per lease and we believe this size segment represents the most profitable segment in our company. Supported by our success around these smaller transactions, interconnection revenue in Q2 reflects more than 23% growth over Q2 of the prior year, adding to prior quarters of consistently strong growth in this revenue segment. Further, Q2 sales include strong performance in our network and cloud verticals, including a key win with execution of an agreement with a globally recognized provider of technology solutions regarding its recently launched public cloud service. Steve will discuss our cloud network and enterprise wins and provide a deeper dive around our sales activities more broadly later in the call. Even with our strong performance in our co-location activities, it is important to put Q2 new and expansion leasing results into context. In addition to the previously noted strength in smaller co-location leasing, a material component of new and expansion leasing in Q2 was driven by two wholesale leases we signed in Santa Clara. First in Q2, we announced the construction of SV7 along with execution of a pre-lease for 35,000 square feet in Phase 1 of that development. We view execution of this lease as consistent with our past practice of signing some degree of wholesale leasing to accelerate the cash flow generation in a larger new development. Second, in Q2, we signed the previously announced 136,500 square foot powered shell build-to-suit at SV6, representing our second build-to-suit project since becoming a public company almost five years ago. As with our prior build-to-suit, in executing this new lease, we served a strategic customer, earned an attractive return on incremental capital, and accelerated the monetization of a portion of one of our larger land position. All while ensuring we retain land and balance sheet capacity to support our performance sensitive co-location objectives. Looking forward, we expect our quarterly new and expansion leasing to moderate to a more historical pace. Our expectation is driven first by our objective to remain focused upon our performance sensitive co-location business plan, and second by the fact that we do not have any new larger developments currently planned to commence construction in the near-term. We believe our focus upon our performance sensitive co-location business plan will lead to an increase in the number of smaller new and expansion leases we signed, in turn driving an attractive product mix, comprised of an increase in breakthrough power revenue and higher cross-connect volume and associated revenue. With regard to supply and demand, we believe that the overall picture of our market is substantially consistent with how we saw them at the time of our call three months ago, steadily attractive in the performance sensitive end of the market, and slightly improving in the wholesale end. Specifically, and as we've discussed in the past, with regard to larger wholesale requirements, competition remains significant in general but accelerating demand in certain markets is pointing toward moderate increases in rents in select areas. In our core focus around the performance sensitive market segment, the location, network and cloud strengths of our facilities has supported and continues to support steady and favorable pricing dynamics. And looking at our big four markets more specifically, we're encouraged by the strength of demand in the Bay Area, as trailing 12-month absorption is approximately 3% to 4% ahead of the 2014 level and materially above that of 2013. In Northern Virginia, industry data suggests that net absorption in 2014 increased by roughly 50% over 2013. And that net absorption in the first half of 2015 has accelerated meaningfully over the average from last year. As such, although there is ample supply in the market, we believe accelerating demand has led to stabilizing rents in the wholesale sector. Finally, the Los Angeles market remains steady, while the New York, New Jersey market continues to be somewhat soft with regard to larger customer requirements. Reflecting our overall positive view of the industry dynamics, we have a number of development projects underway or scheduled to commence in Santa Clara, Northern Virginia, Los Angeles and Chicago. In Santa Clara, we expect to begin site construction on our 230,000 square foot SV7 building in the third quarter, with an estimated completion of Phase 1 in the second quarter of 2016. As noted a moment ago, we have preleased 35,000 square feet of our first phase of construction in this development. In Northern Virginia, we are building out an additional 48,000 square feet of data center space as part of Phase 3 of VA2, 50% of the new capacity in Phase 3 is pre-leased to our anchor customer at VA2 as that customer executed its expansion rights under its original lease. Beyond this pre-lease, we have a solid pipeline of activity, reflecting the value we've created at our Reston campus with more than 140 customers currently deployed, including over 50 network carriers and cloud providers. In Los Angeles, we've commenced the build out of 12,500 square feet of capacity at LA2 where our attractive cost basis associated with incremental expansions have supported what we see as attractive returns. Finally, in Chicago, we are under construction on 12,000 square feet of data center space where demand has been steady and supply remains limited in the downtown market. As it relates to future growth, we view our opportunity optimistically. We remain focused upon executing against our stated business plan as we continue to grow organically. As we have shared with you previously, we are focused on deepening our penetration in current markets where we can leverage our established ecosystems and gain efficiencies with added local scale. While we evaluate expansion opportunities beyond our current markets as well as other avenues of external growth, we do not feel compelled to alter our business plan and we believe strongly in our ability to execute upon the attractive growth opportunity we see before us. Our objective is to continue to make investments across our portfolio that lead to continued strong growth and increased returns on invested capital. We remain committed to systematically enhancing CoreSite's strength in providing differentiated value in supporting our customers' requirements for high-performance data center solutions supported by industry-leading customer service. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steven J. Smith - Senior Vice President-Sales & Sales Enablement : Thanks, Tom. I'd like to start by reviewing our sales activity during the quarter. As Tom mentioned, Q2 new and expansion sales totaled $19.6 million in annualized GAAP rent, a record for our company. Importantly, we made further progress on our goal to increase leasing volume to smaller customer requirements executing 110 new and expansion leases of less than 1,000 square feet in Q2, a 16% increase over Q1. We also saw continued strength in leasing among mid-sized opportunities across our platform, starting five new and expansion leases between 1,000 square feet and 5,000 square feet, compared to two mid-sized leases signed in the first quarter. The combined leasing in the small and mid-sized categories drove solid total transaction count during the quarter as we signed 122 new and expansion leases, a 22% increase over the prior quarter. Also driven by strength in our smaller and mid-sized leasing activity, we continue to broaden and diversify our customer base, adding 44 new logos during the quarter and 143 new logos over the trailing 12-month period, including Q2. We continue to see strength in our network and cloud verticals, together accounting for 45% of new and expansion leases executed in Q2 including seven key cloud deployments. Importantly, during Q2, we also executed an agreement with one the world's leading providers of cloud services to the enterprise. We are excited about the opportunity to roll out those deployments across our portfolio going forward. Further, we added more global cloud providers to our CoreSite open cloud exchange, increasing density on that exchange fabric and further fueling momentum around enterprises, clouds and networks coming to our company to solve performances requirements. Driven by these successes, Q2 fiber cross-connect volume increased 17% year-over-year and total connections grew by 12%, both growth rates in line with recent trends. Considering our drive to increase penetration in enterprise vertical including digital content, we saw significant strength building off our strong success in Q1, specifically in Q2 leasing and the enterprise vertical accounted for 55% of known expansion leases executed and 59% of annualized GAAP rents signed in the quarter, well distributed across our national footprint and among a healthy mix of industries. Concerning lease rental rates, Q2 new and expansion leasing reflects an average annualized GAAP rental rate of $81 per square foot. This GAAP rate reflects the 136,500 square foot powered shell build-to-suit with a strategic cloud customer at SV6 in Santa Clara. While an excellent win with favorable returns, this also negatively impacts the total average rate per square foot when compared to our core retail co-location product. Excluding the build-to-suit at SV6, our Q2 pricing was in line with our trailing 12-month average rental rate. In addition to new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q2 was similarly strong, as renewals total approximately 35,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $185 per square foot, reflecting a mark-to-market growth of 5.7% on a cash basis and 9.1% on a GAAP basis. Churn was 1.6 % in the second quarter, better than our expectations as one of our expected moveouts renewed a portion of this deployment in the second quarter as well as the timing of expected moveouts being pushed to subsequent quarters. Approximately 50 basis points or one-third of our Q2 churn is related to SV3, where over last year we have been proactively re-tenanting the building prior to the anticipated move out of the full building customer that originally leased the asset. In Q2 of this year, we completed retenanting the remaining 25% of the building. We continue to retain some economic benefit of the prior customers lease and that benefit will turn out of our portfolio over time. Jeff will provide more detail around this later on the call. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in Q2 were the Bay Area, Northern Virginia DC, Chicago and Los Angeles. Leasing in the Bay Area were driven by demand at our Santa Clara campus and includes 35,000 square foot lease with an anchored customer at our new SV7 development. The Northern Virginia DC, our anchor tenant VA2 expanded and we continue to see solid leasing at VA1 where occupancy is now at 91.8%. In Chicago, Q2 leasing activity includes a new logo signed with a large global financial services enterprise. Leasing in Los Angeles continues to be well distributed between the two buildings comprising our One Wilshire campus. We note that we recorded minimal Q2 leasing in our New York market. This was driven by what we believe as normal lumpiness among large leases. Specifically, our leasing in the market among smaller deployments were steady to prior quarters with 12 new leases signed in Q2, including five new logos with all leases smaller than 1,000 square feet. However, in Q2, we signed no leases exceeding 1,000 square feet, whereas in the trailing 12-month period, we signed six leases exceeding 1,000 square feet each for a total of 43,000 square feet. We don't describe a meaningful change to the market dynamics or our position in the market and bolstered by our current pipeline activity, we believe prospective leasing volume will be more in line with the past trailing 12-month period than Q2. In summary, we are making progress on our goal to increase the effectiveness of our transaction engine while providing our customers with the best-in-class customer experience supported by our high performance data center solutions. We believe our Q2 sales demonstrate the value inherent in our platform as we continue to focus on enhancing the robust customer communities and our high performance network-dense cloud enabled data centers. We will continue to focus on driving profitable growth across our platform, enhancing our customer communities and diversifying our customer base. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q2 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development CapEx and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity and, third, I will discuss our revised outlook and guidance for the remainder of the year. Turning to our financial performance in the second quarter, data center revenues were $79.5 million, a 9.5% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 24.7% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Q2 data center revenue consisted of $66.6 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 9.2% on a sequential quarter basis and 24.5% year-over-year, $10.6 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 3.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 23.3% year-over-year, and $2.3 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $2 million. Our second quarter FFO was $0.68 per diluted share and unit, an increase of 6.3% on a sequential quarter basis and a 33.3% increase year-over-year, excluding non-recurring items in Q2 2014. As Tom mentioned, FFO per diluted share and unit increased 19.3% year-over-year as reported in unadjusted. Adjusted EBITDA of $40.6 million increased 6.9% on a sequential quarter basis and 33.2% over the same quarter of last year, excluding non-recurring items. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 49.8% increased 340 basis points year-over-year and declined 100 basis points sequentially. If you recall, our adjusted EBITDA has historically shown a seasonal decline on a sequential basis in both the second and third quarters, generally related to seasonal increases in the cost of power. Related, our Q2 results represent revenue growth flow through to annualized adjusted EBITDA and FFO of 64% and 51% respectively, which is a significant improvement on a year-over-year basis. Sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter totaled $4.3 million or approximately 5.2% of total operating revenues, up 10 basis points compared to last quarter and in line with our guidance of approximately 5% to 5.5% of total operating revenues for the full year. General and administrative expenses were $7.9 million in Q2 correlating to 9.8% of total operating revenues. We expect G&A for 2015 to correlate to approximately 9.5% to 10% of total operating revenue. Regarding our same-store metrics, Q2 same-store turnkey data center occupancy increased 850 basis points to 84.9% from 76.4% in the second quarter of 2014. Additionally, same-store MRR per cabinet equivalent increased 4.1% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. As Steve discussed, we have now fully backfilled customer leasing at SV3. As we have communicated previously, we executed a restructured lease agreement with the original customer in order to meet current demand and backfill the space at SV3. Under the amended agreement, the original customer is making payments discounted from its original lease amount that maybe applied to new leases with us on a dollar-for-dollar basis until the staggered terms of the new agreement expire. Revenue associated with the restructured lease agreement is included in our financial results and the annualized rent reflected on the operating table shown on page 14 of the second quarter earnings supplemental. This revenue stream is scheduled to decline in increments and expire over the next two years, reflecting associated churn related to each expiring increment. We currently forecast that these expirations will be approximately $2.6 million in Q4 of 2015, $1.9 million in Q2 of 2016, and $4.2 million in Q2 of 2017. In turn, correlating to churn of approximately 150 basis points, 100 basis points, and 190 basis points respectively, absent any such amounts applied to new leases. Lastly, we commenced a 123,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $123 per square foot, which represents $15.1 million of annualized GAAP rent. Turning now to backlog. Our projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases is $18.5 million as of June 30, 2015 or $29.8 million on a cash basis. We expect approximately 37% or $6.8 million of the GAAP backlog to commence in the second half of 2015. Another 30% is expected to commence in the first half of 2016 and 15% of the GAAP backlog expected to commence in the second half of 2016. Within the total backlog amount is rents associated with the build-to-suit at SV6 as well as the SV7 pre-lease each forecasted to commence upon completion of construction in the first half of 2016. In the second quarter, we increased stabilized data center occupancy by approximately 160 basis points sequentially to 89.9%. Stabilized data center occupancy now reflects the addition of 44,000 square feet at VA2, which commenced on April 1, and is 100% leased and occupied by a single acre tenant. I would remind everyone that the recently developed data center projects that are in the initial lease up phase are classified as pre-stabilized until you reach 85% occupancy or have been in service for 24 months. To that point, in the second quarter 15,000 square feet at SV4 and 20,000 square feet at CH1 in Chicago moved from this pre-stabilized pool into our stabilized pool as they have now been in service for two years. Additionally, 16,000 square feet at NY2 associated with Phase 2 has been placed into our stabilized data center pool as it was 100% leased and occupied by a single customer as of June 30, 2015. Turning to development activity and expansion CapEx. During the second quarter, we placed into service Phase 2 at both NY2 and VA2 with 33,000 square feet and 48,000 square feet, now reflected in our pre-stabilized pool respectively. During the second quarter, we began construction of VA2 Phase 3 with 48,000 square feet under development, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the second quarter, we also began construction on the powered shell build-to-suit at SV6. As we announced in early June, we expect to begin construction on SV7 in the third quarter with the first phase expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2016. Based on all of the development projects currently under construction and the expected construction of Phase 1 of SV7, we expect to spend approximately $140 million in incremental expansion CapEx, most of which will be spent through the first half of 2016. In a few moments, I will update you on our estimated capital expenditures for 2015. As a reminder, when we complete development projects we realize a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes, and insurance, resulting in a corresponding increase in operating expense. For 2015, we estimate the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 30% to 35%, depending on the volume and pace of development during the year, including the expected commencement of construction on SV7 in the back half of the year. As shown on page 22 of the supplemental, the percentage of interest capitalized year-to-date is 43%. Turning to our balance sheet, as of June 30, 2015, our net debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.1 times, and if you include our preferred stock, it is 2.8 times. Based on the current and expected development projects disclosed on page 20 of the supplemental, we would expect our leverage to increase by year-end to approximately 3.1 times, comfortably within our stated target ratio of approximately 4 times. During the second quarter, we executed and amended and expanded $500 million senior unsecured credit facility, extending and staggering our debt maturity profile, lowering our overall borrowing cost and continuing to balance our mix between fixed and variable rate debt, including our preferred stock. The amended unsecured credit facility is comprised of a four-year $350 million revolving credit facility and a five-year $150 million term loan. Subsequent to the transaction, we used the term loan proceeds to pay down a portion of the existing revolving credit facility balance. The execution of the amended and expanded credit facility supports our goals of maintaining the liquidity and available capital necessary to execute our business plans and support growth. To that point, as of June 30, 2015, we had $102.3 million drawn on our revolver and approximately $241 million of available capacity. Finally, with regard to our outlook, we are increasing our 2015 FFO guidance to a range of $2.75 to $2.83 per share in OP unit, from the previous range of $2.55 to $2.65, an increase of 7.3% based on the midpoint of both ranges. The increased guidance reflects our performance in the first half of the year, increased visibility into financial and operating performance in the second half of 2015, and improved revenue growth flow through to both adjusted EBITDA and FFO as we continue to gain efficiencies as we scale the business. More specifically, we now expect total operating revenue to be $325 million to $330 million compared to the previous range of $313 million to $323 million. Data center revenue is now expected to be $317 million to $322 million, up from the previous range of $305 million to $315 million, driven primarily by our sales execution in the first half of 2015 and our expectations for solid growth in rental revenue, continued positive mark-to-market rent growth and increases in our interconnection revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be $162 million to $167 million, up from our previous guidance of $153 million to $158 million, implying a full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA margin of 50.2% based on the midpoint of guidance. As I mentioned, we estimate improved revenue growth flow through to adjusted EBITDA as our guidance for general and administrative expenses remains unchanged. We now expect cash rent growth on renewals to be in the range of 3% to 5% for the full year, taking into account the cash rent growth in the first half of the year of 5.5%. Our guidance for annual churn is unchanged at 6% to 8% for the full year. We are increasing our guidance for 2015, total capital expenditures by $20 million to a range of $135 million to $165 million, primarily to reflect the development of the recently announced construction of SV7 in Santa Clara. A more detailed summary of 2015 guidance items can be found on page 24 of the second quarter earnings supplemental. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics and our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio, resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we've discussed today. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you, and good morning out there. The first question is just on the continued accelerated monetization, I believe you referred to of sort of land bank and really of capacity, and just maybe you could speak to the plans to backfill and if any of that is factored at this point into your 2015 guidance? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Jordan. I think, the location where we've monetized land in the powered shell build-to-suit is both of those leases were in Santa Clara, on our Santa Clara campus, where we had a significant amount of land. We thought long and hard about the most recent build-to-suit, it was a very attractive return on incremental capital and a good use of the land asset sitting there. We probably \u2013 what helped us make that decision to feel good about that deal was the size of SV7, which is more than double the size of SV5. So in kicking off our last building, we have a lot of runway there, the biggest building by far we've put on that site. So that gives us, we think, plenty of time to look in the market and look for the right next path of growth, but I think we have several years to figure that out. Santa Clara is \u2013 the Bay Area has been a very powerful market for us, so we appreciate that as we think about our long-term planning. So there you go, the bottom-line is, we still have a lot of room to run with SV7 and there you have it. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: But your guidance, you're not anticipating taking down any additional land or buildings per se in your guidance for 2015? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's right, not in the guidance. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, interconnection, not to \u2013 I might not have caught the exact details there, but I just heard a plus 17% year-over-year number on cross connects, and I was curious obviously one quarter. There can be some volatility but relative to your previous growth, I think it's a little bit slower. I'm just curious about the thoughts on cross-connect and interconnection revenue growth going forward? And then, maybe if you can provide some context in terms of what you see your view as the outlook, if any, in terms of a shift at all as a result of the change in the capitalization or ownership of one-year larger competitors in that space? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Well, as to the cross connect, the growth rate of cross-connect revenue, we've said on the \u2013 at least one past call and we just reiterate over time that that growth rate should begin to align with the growth rate of volume plus whatever annual mark-to-market there is in the market. But we've been \u2013 and we really think it will align with the growth rate of the volume of fiber cross connects. So our copper cross connects have been a declining business for some time as it is in all parts of the communications landscape. Our fiber cross-connect volume has been growing organically pretty nicely at 17%. So if you think of over a couple years and it's really hard to predict the pacing, but if you think that at some point your growth rate in revenue is got to align with the growth rate in volume. And then if you add 2%, 3% a year, for inflation mark-to-market, that kind of thing, that's how we view it. So we'd just encourage people to align their models accordingly. So I guess what we're saying is we expect the growth rate to moderate to some extent, further over the next couple of years, but really you would expect \u2013 I would expect the growth rate of interconnection revenue to exceed that of rents on a same store basis. So hopefully that helps model. As to consolidation, look, I think with the Telx selling into DLRs footprint, there should be at some point over time, a little bit greater competition. At the same time, Telx has been in business a very long time. We've been here for a while, Equinix has been here for a while, and we've posted very consistent, very solid cross-connect growth. And we frankly expect that to continue. So it's a big market. The United States is a big place, and we expect to continue to be successful. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Last cleanup item here, just do you disclose your total number of cross-connects? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have in the past. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think traditionally, Jordon, we've typically said that we're in excess of 15,000. We haven't given a more precise number other than that at this point. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It is something we're looking at in terms of trying to update just so you guys have better visibility. It's been that way for few years, but we haven't given anything beyond that. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Atkins with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. I wanted to just see if you can discuss a little bit about the opportunities, threats from the Digital Realty, Telx combination, not just with respect to cross-connects, but in the retail business, in the wholesale segment and so forth, how do you kind of view that? And then I was interested in just the new logo that you signed and which of the top four did you sign the greatest number of new logos? Was it Bay Area or LA or where were you seeing kind of the most success? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I think as to Telx and Digital, again our view \u2013 my sense is that over time, it will increase competition in the Colo segment. Just with a talented co-location sales platform and operating platform, now working on a larger base of assets. So I would expect that to result in some greater competition. There is certainly the theory that consolidation over a longer period may lead to more disciplined pricing. So you can put whatever stock into that theory you like. I just think that \u2013 I think there will be some period as they're integrating the Telx acquisition and rolling that operational capability out onto more assets. But they'll probably be reasonably aggressive in pricing. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : And Jonathan, in terms of the new logos, I think you've probably heard in Steve's remarks, we signed 44 new logos in the quarter. I apologize, I don't have the vertical which produced the most. We'll try and get that by the end of the call, if not we'll follow back up with you? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The geographic breakout, yeah. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : But by metro. Okay. And then SV7, I'm just interested all-in, not just the initial phase for this one-acre customer, but just when all is said and done, how can we think about that project in terms of cost per megawatt? Is it going to be similar to what you've put up on some of your slides in the supplemental? Or is there any reason why it would be higher or lower? And then related to that, I'm just interested in demand that you may be seeing from your customers in any of your markets for an N (0:39:05) type products and any shifts in your design or product to accommodate that? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think you hit the big question about the ultimate cost basis in SV7. We \u2013 four comparable products, which we expect to comprise the bulk of SV7, that is a Tier 3, N+1, 2N (0:39:27) type product. We expect that to be most of SV7, and we expect the cost there to be very similar to that of SV4 and other new developments, nothing unusual. We do anticipate productizing, if you will, different levels of resiliency as other folks have done, and as there seems to be a market for. So with that, we might spend less capital on some portion of SV7 and as such the weighted average costs, the total \u2013 the cost per meg in that might decline a little bit from some other buildings. But that story has yet to be told. And like everybody else, we build modularly. We build to meet the demand in the marketplace. And I do think there is a segment of demand that is looking for better pricing with lower resiliency. And we're focused on ensuring we meet that market segment. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then finally, I was just interested in, to what extent your customers have been asking about your entering new metros where you currently don't operate? I know you've been fairly disciplined from a financial standpoint. There is a lot of interesting things happening, not just in your \u2013 in some of your top markets, but in other markets where you are currently absent, and is there a customer push in that direction that you're seeing? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, look, we've been asked to go to new markets since before we were public, right. I mean almost every large customer who has multimarket needs wants to know if we can meet them in additional markets, and that's domestic and abroad. But you nailed it, Jon. We've just tried to be disciplined about the use of our balance sheet. And we're just allocating capital by rank ordering projects based on risk and return. And we've been consistent in saying, we believe our lower risk, higher return opportunities in the immediately visible future are adding product into markets where we already have a team and interconnection density and some scale. And so that's just how we've been allocating capital. We don't have a positive or negative previous position toward markets. We just rank order the deployment of capital on a risk adjusted basis. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : And Jonathan just as \u2013 Jonathan just as a follow-up to your previous question in terms of the breakout by geo for the new verticals, the top two markets were LA, followed closely by the Bay Area in terms of the distribution of the 44 new logos. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Jonathan. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : All right. Thank you for taking the questions. Couple if I may, so Tom, you offered some, I thought, pretty positive commentary about the overall state of demand in the marketplace. And I was wondering if there was anything sort of driving in your view the overall demand that is, has anything changed, has something come into place that has allowed an acceleration in demand or is it just short of seeing more maturation of some of the trends that we've seen recently? And I'll follow-up with the second question. Thanks. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sharing my view and then I'll ask Steve to weigh in as well. I think it's some of both. I think that in the major markets where you've seen the largest acceleration of demand, I think a big component of that has been driven by the big clouds. They've been in this cycle recently, have much greater absorption, much bigger blocks of space than historically. In addition to that, that general steady drumbeat of the, kind of that, steady co-location business, the performance end of the business has also seen an acceleration of demand, I think, more moderate than these big blocks you're seeing, taken down by the cloud guys. So, I think it's a little bit of both. Steve, what are your thoughts? Steven J. Smith - Senior Vice President-Sales & Sales Enablement : Yeah, I would agree, Tom. I think the maturation of the cloud industry, and the adoption in that space has driven obviously more absorption in our space, which has been positive. But, I think, that has also led to more adoption in just the enterprise. And as more enterprises go through their natural cycle of refreshing their hardware and their infrastructure that leads to more and more adoption of outsourcing and to co-location. So, I think we're starting to see more and more of that. So, I think it is primarily just more maturation in the market. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : All right. Great. And then question for Jeff here. Jeff you know, you took us through some really good detail and through the financials. And I guess, I just had some questions around sort of the double dipping that's going on out on the West Coast. When you guys started the year, was it your expectation and was it in your initial guidance that you would be able to, sort of, both benefit from the exit of the customer out of the facility SV3, but also sort of backfill. So, just want to get a sense as to whether this is a change in expectation versus sort of where you were from a prior basis. And then, as a second question, in terms of the churn that you've pulled out for us, so for example $2.6 million in the fourth quarter, is that going to churn on sort of day one of the quarter, and that's the full quarter run rate or how should we think about that in terms of the quarter after the impact to that is? Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Let me hit your second question first, Jonathan, see if that helps. In terms of that $2.6 million in Q4, that will churn out at the end of that quarter. I think that term actually expires December 31. And so factor that in, as you look at your models as you go into 2016, but that will come in right at the end of the quarter. In terms of where we were heading into the year for our overall guidance, as it relates to that Bay Area property, I would say that we anticipated some of that in our guidance. And I would say maybe about solving for maybe about 50% of that. And the other 50% obviously, as Steve alluded to in this call and we alluded to in the previous call, we have solved for in the first half of this year and obviously that's helping to drive some of that incremental revenue growth. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And to be clear, Jonathan, we entered into an agreement with a structure with this customer a year ago. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And that's when we did the first backfill lease at SV3 and we created a structure whereby we've encouraged the customer to redeploy in smaller and the target is more performance dependent deployments across our portfolio and to use some of this rent bank to support them doing that but also whereby we would get a little higher rate, a rack rate on the deployments and more term. So we've created a structure where you're trying to reconstruct a wholesale deal into a series of on-ramps and other things and to create an incentive to support the customer in doing that. So that tale has yet to be written, right. They \u2013 that some of this \u2013 the churn that we've talked about, the forecasted churn that's in the supp is really kind of a worst case scenario or we'd assume that the customer doesn't utilize any of their remaining available rent bank elsewhere in the portfolio. And we're working with them actively to encourage them to do that and that the extent to which that's successful for both parties may soften a component of that churn. I bring that up both to explain what's going on and to say, as we entered the beginning of the year as Jeff said, we'd already taken back half the building under the structure. We had a good structure in place to move forward with the customer, and we've been fortunate that that's worked out a little bit sooner than we anticipated for the rest of the building. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Great. And those were annualized numbers, right? The churn, not quarterly? Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : That's correct, those are annualized amounts. The only other thing, Jonathan, I'd add to your churn as you guys think about churn in total, we've obviously given guidance and that is unchanged at that 6% to 8% level for the full year. When you look at where we are in the first half, we're at 3.8%, the customer you're referring to in that $2.6 million at the end of the year, that adds an incremental 150 basis points to our churn. So, that combined with where we are year-to-date, you're at 5.3% you're all-in. If you think about our midpoint of typical guidance 1% to 2% per quarter, that's going to put you just up above the 8% churn for the year, I just want to \u2013 have guys think about that, it wouldn't surprise me that we end up at the higher end of our churn guidance for the year. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : That makes sense. And if I can squeeze one more in here, the mark-to-marks, obviously great to see that you're able to take up the guide here. Is this a reflection of the pricing sort of things that you \u2013 the pricing dynamics that, Tom, you were talking about early in the call? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I mean, I \u2013 look, I think, some markets pricing has firmed up and I think Steve and the team have just done a really good job of reinvigorating sales over the last couple of years and we've seen \u2013 as Steve's made it clear in his comments, you've seen acceleration in transactions. And as we've always talked about, think of our business as this core co-location business and there are times we elect to do wholesale on top and with the build-to-suit opportunity and then a new building SV7, we've layered that on top. So I think just execution from Steve, anything you want to add to the markets or the dynamics. Steven J. Smith - Senior Vice President-Sales & Sales Enablement : No, I think the market is also helping, right, as you look at supply and demand out there and the stickiness of our customer base. We obviously want to be fair with our customers, but also be fair to the market and so I think we've done a healthy job in striking that balance. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Thanks so much for taking the questions. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Our next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey guys, just wondering as both clients \u2013 tenants look for more flexibility and as you try to increase our interconnect opportunity. Are there any physical or design attributes that are changing in your new developments. You mentioned that SV7 will be much bigger than SV5. Is there anything else from just a building perceptive that we should watch for? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not really, certainly nothing related to interconnection. That SV7 will leverage off of the interconnection already at the campus. It will be connected to the other buildings and have the advantage of all that carrier mass (0:50:40) day one. And so hopefully we'll just keep building off of that. But in terms of the physical construction of the building, no changes related to interconnection. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And then Tom, you mentioned before, customers have asked you to go to new markets. When you think about that opportunity, do you look at it on an asset basis, buying existing assets, developing into markets or perhaps buying portfolios? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We sincerely look at all the above, right. I mean we just \u2013 we work extremely hard to just make good decisions for our shareholders, and that mandates that you pay attention to every opportunity in the target markets. Again, we focused on the top 12 markets in the U.S. There are a handful that we're not yet in. We've talked about those for five years now, and that's where we spend our time, so that's the line of our strategy. But we are open minded as to whether it's ground-up development or a redevelopment or an acquisition. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Maybe if you can just give us a quick update on what you're seeing on the acquisition front in terms of valuations and types of properties coming to market? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I don't know. I think the deals recently announced and certainly the Telx valuation, I think is probably the biggest indicator for large portfolios with interconnection density. I think it's probably prudent to make adjustments for owned versus leased and implicit debt and things of that nature, but that was \u2013 I don't know, I've heard the 15.5% or so multiples, so there is probably the biggest most recent comp. I think for smaller deals, there is a pretty big range depending on the attractiveness of the asset and can you scale. I mean, I think you see things trading close to 6% if they are really, really good, and we see things go up pretty significantly from there. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you very much. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Manny. Operator : Our next question is from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Good morning, guys. Tom, I wanted to just dive in a little bit more on the New York, New Jersey markets. I think you characterized it as soft in your comments and Steve's comments obviously did give more color on the amount of leasing you're seeing, but I think you talked about a backlog pretty good about. So maybe just dive a little bit more on what you really are seeing in that market and how it's impacting you? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's a continuation of what we've seen since we open the building, right. We've got out of the gate with very nice network traction, exceeded our expectations. We've had pretty consistent growth in smaller transaction co-location sales and this last quarter was no different. I think we signed 12 smaller deals and that drumbeat has been, I think over the last year accelerating. I mean this was the quarter where we didn't sign larger deals. We're not seeing a collection three to four multi-megawatt deals, but there is a pretty good funnel out there of kind of that 1 meg and down, 1.25 meg and down. So as you think about the opportunity to do the larger deals, I think it's still in the market and it's just difficult to predict when wholesale deal is signed. So we don't predict it. Anything to add? Steven J. Smith - Senior Vice President-Sales & Sales Enablement : No. I think that's accurate, Tom and the larger leases are much more lumpy as you mentioned. And I think as we look at those leases, we just need to be diligent about what makes sense for the asset that we're trying to sell, the value that we provide in that asset, provide value back to that customer, do they recognize that value and there's a lot of competition in that market, but at the same time, we do get traction from the sales team and overall, we're optimistic as of the future of where it's headed. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm encouraged in that the \u2013 we've had what we've got over the gate more strongly than we'd even hoped with regard to networks, but I think we're having more success with major clouds, in that location as opposed to Manhattan. So what is landing in the building is in line with the strategy and the thesis. And we continue to be believers in where that assets and that market is headed, just fewer big deals dropped in Q2. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And these smaller deals that you do and the pricing on those, I mean are they improving from the day you open the building, are they pretty stable, any color on that? Steven J. Smith - Senior Vice President-Sales & Sales Enablement : Yeah, I think the pricing is generally improving, but it's pretty stable, it's a competitive market, but we're seeing the volume pick up and we're seeing pricing firm up somewhat. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Dave, I think from when we opened the building as we've done our first deal or two \u2013 larger deal or two, we were at very aggressive low rates and we kind of turned that off now. We're at market and as Steve said, I think it's fairly steady. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. And, Tom, maybe shifting, one of your comments was stabilizing wholesale rents and I assume that part of that is just more control in competitive supply that's out there. But maybe talk a little bit about what you expect to see, are you seeing more permitting coming out, do you expect to see any kind of ramp in new construction, similar, I guess, we've seen in past years or is that landscape pretty stable as well? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think you see more stuff on \u2013 there's still a fair amount of ability to deliver inventory in Virginia. So I'd say shadow inventory of shelves that are ready to go or people that are in for permit. So, look I think Virginia can add supply more meaningfully, probably faster than any other market. I mean at the same time it still takes a year after you start swinging a hammer and that would suggest that the next year pricing there will probably firm up a little bit further, if demand continues the way it did in the first half of this year, which was exceedingly robust. So in the big picture, though, Dave, irrespective of permits and completed shelves over the next 12 months, I think anytime rents are firming up considerably, you'll see capital pour in, you'll see buildings get built and I think, wholesale rates will forever be somewhat cyclical. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, thanks. And then maybe finally for Jeff, I assume the answer, but I'll ask anyway, is in the expiration schedule, there's nothing in the expiration schedule for SV3 and the tenant that rolled out of there, right, this churn has kind of not embedded in that expiration schedule or is it? Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : No, the expiration schedule in terms of what we've put inside the supplemental, it is included in the respective periods in which that rent will churn out. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): It is. Okay, great. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Colby Synesael, with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks, two if I may. First one, I guess, just has to talk about cloud broadly speaking. As we've kind of started to see more of a shift from more public cloud type deployments in your facilities perhaps more to more enterprise oriented cloud deployments, maybe Oracle I guess being a good example, a company like that. Are you starting to see now a bigger pull through of enterprise type customers that are also now kind of coming to you whereas perhaps a year ago this just wasn't the type of customer that you were dealing with? And then the second question is, I know going into 2015, there was a pretty big focus on going after those smaller customers and also just more generally improving the efficiency return or contribution margin, I guess, in the \u2013 from an OpEx perspective. Is that largely done? And now, effectively the improvements we see on a go forward basis are going to be more one of scale or is there still some inefficiencies, if you will, that are inside the business that could lead to additional improvements beyond just kind of scaling up? Thanks. Steven J. Smith - Senior Vice President-Sales & Sales Enablement : Yeah, sure, and I'll take your \u2013 this is Steve, I'll take your first question, and then I'll have Tom answer your second. Relative to cloud and enterprises coming to us for more enterprise cloud type solutions, we are seeing more interest in that. I think the adoption of that is still being vetted out by a lot of enterprises. But I think the benefit to companies such as CoreSite is that we do see a lot of interest that's coming to us and exploring that and very interested in our open cloud exchange and how that provide on-ramps to those type of cloud environments. So the adoption of that I think is still being vetted, but I think the demand that it's driving is very positive for us. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And regarding efficiencies, I remain maniacally confident that we can continue to do better. And you know we haven't talked a lot about something we started about three years ago Encore, which was really an ERP and an IT and software reinvention of the company, if you will. We did a bad job the first two years. We wrote off some money related to that bad job. And we're transparent about that with the street. We haven't said much about Encore, because we decided to shut up and just do our work. We're very, very pleased that in Q2, we launched quite successfully the first very powerful phase of that effort. And our team there led by our VP of Corporate Operations, Jeff Dorr has done a phenomenal job. So we've made progress there. And I think we'll see more efficiencies flow out of just that launch over the next nine months. And then we've moved on to Phase II of that efforts of the Encore effort. Jeff and team are driving that forward. So I think across the company, via technology and via just again relentlessly simplifying our business and making simpler and simpler decisions, I'm convinced that we can continue to improve our efficiency. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah, I guess the other question to that, Tom, would be that as you start to see more of these enterprise type customers coming into your own facilities, I would think to some degree that there is some technological actual sophistication in products that might need to be made available to them to kind of hand hold and make it easier for them to adopt the type of services that you're selling. Is that something that you're seeing? Is that a focus for you? We've seeing obviously DLR as an example going higher, new CIO that's obviously been a focus for someone like for Equinix for some time, kind of where do you guys fit on that strategy or that thinking? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're I think on the same page, DCIM or Data Center Infrastructure Management is, I think, a key component of any data center offering in the marketplace today. And I think this is going to get more and more important, so that's a key part of our Encore roadmap enabling the enterprise customer and all customers with a greater degree of visibility and self help and self provisioning and clarity supporting that relationship with us and with their capacity inside our data center. So that's a key part of our roadmap. And then I think also in the communications or the interconnection product set, the logical connections are open cloud exchange, you see the larger clouds wanting to align APIs and so that takes development cycles to line up with those guys and I think the folks who are out in front of that and have some scale and can make those investments tend to benefit from getting more and more of those cloud ramps and those relationships that support the hybrid cloud and the ability of the enterprise to meet different needs inside a data center. So, yeah, I mean we \u2013 in terms of our product developments around technology, both in the interconnection space and in the data center infrastructure management space, both those areas are key parts of our roadmap. We'd like to think we've been pretty good at them in the past frankly. But we're really working hard to continue to accelerate. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Colby. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, thanks. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the commentary from Intel this quarter, who seemed to suggest that the weakness in enterprise server demand and simultaneous strength from hyper scale might reflect an acceleration in enterprise cloud migration as opposed to just an outright sort of decline in demand net-net, which seems to jive, I guess, with what you're saying around your business and major clouds. But the question is how do you see this playing out in the broader co-location space, and maybe if over time you expect more enterprises to come to you indirectly via service providers? Steven J. Smith - Senior Vice President-Sales & Sales Enablement : Yeah, I'll just start and then I'm sure Tom could add some color. In general, I do see more adoption of, really about the hybrid environment, where we see a lot of customers come into our data center, deploying their own enterprise solutions within our data center, and then wanting to connect to either public cloud or private cloud. So, I see that continuing. As I look at just my history and dealing with enterprises across various industries, I see very few that would go to a complete cloud environment. There's always something unique about their systems and back office that they need to have that hybrid environment. So, I think that will continue for some time, but I do see more and more adoption towards those cloud environments, and I think that will continue. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well I think just \u2013 I think we're all speaking toward the disaggregation of the enterprise IT architecture. And I think that's going to \u2013 Steve and I both believe strongly, our whole management team believes, that's going to continue. But that disaggregation \u2013 that old enterprise IT architecture reconstitutes into very, a lot of different things. You've got infrastructure service, you've got platform and service, you have SaaS. And within SaaS, you've got a lot of different solutions for different enterprise needs and then you have the enterprises' own, a dedicated private cloud for the enterprise, so with the public cloud capability on top of it. So I think we're going to see more and more of that. It's been happening, I think, it will continue to happen. So the big question in our view has always been around the cloud, is it good or bad for co-location? And we've been consistent in our thesis to the street that if the cloud ends up being dominated by two players or three players, who control 60% or 70% of the marketplace, that's going to be bad for the multi-tenant data center. You'll have a shift in those quarter's five factors that customer dominance will shift, and that won't be good. We just don't see that happening. And again, we use the analog to the communications landscape after the Bell's reconsolidated, and you have more communications providers, more applications, more devices, more networks than ever before. And we think cloud is another component of that wave. And if that thesis is sound, more applications, more networks, more devices, then we expect the dynamics throughout our business to remain very robust. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks. And then just a follow up if I may. Been hearing a lot of kind of a pickup in demand from cloud providers for build-to-suit projects with security compliance being a major factor, and particularly in areas where they can find cheap power and decent connectivity. You've done a number of these types of deals for strategics in the past, and it seems like your return experience has been improved a little. I'm just wondering, if you're seeing more of these opportunities pop up in your radar, and maybe if the returns are strong enough for you to consider doing more custom deals, that might be outside of your core footprint? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we've done two build-to-suits both in Santa Clara and both on land that we already owned. And as an old ProLogis guy from I think, a 137 years ago, I think, where you make premium returns in the build-to-suit business is off of your land. The incremental capital that goes into solving a build-to-suit with a large institution, that capital gets priced to the market, and with large companies with good credit and long-term leases, that market is highly competitive for cap rate. So you do see the build-to-suit business as a steady solid business out there, whether it be some infield locations like Santa Clara or the Pacific Northwest and Eastern Kentucky et cetera. Experience just suggests that where you make, the kind of returns we're really seeking is when you control an attractive infield land location. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks very much. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question is from John Bejjani with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Good morning guys. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: I know you \u2013 Jeff, I know you just expanded your credit lines. But you guys now have around $350 million of net debt outstanding and a healthy amount of upcoming development spend? At what point or under what conditions would it make sense to look to tap the public debt markets and further diversify your funding sources? Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I think, broadly speaking, when you think about the \u2013 some of the commentary we gave on the call, John, I think we said based on everything we've announced today we've got total CapEx of about $140 million that is queued up and obviously, we'll be spending through about the second quarter of 2016, with current liquidity of about $240 million, it gives us an incremental $100 million of liquidity. And as we go into 2016, it's obviously something we will look at and consider given the relevant pricing, the flexibility that we'd like to maintain inside the capital structure and obviously the size of the capital need. It's something we'll factor in every time we look at it. But it's clearly been on the table, it just hasn't been the financing of choice to date. John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Okay. And then just a couple of small income statement questions, I haven't had a chance to look into. First, is there anything one-time in nature driving the sequential increase in your real estate taxes and insurance? And then second, I noticed your rent expense ticked down a little bit over the quarter. Did you guys give back any space or renew any leases at lower rents or is there anything interesting there? Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Two things on the real estate taxes and insurance. We did end up recording about, call it $600,000 of incremental property tax expense this quarter. As we continue to work through some of the challenges in the Bay Area around increases in value and ultimately, what is appropriate for them to be billing us, I think it's clear we have challenges every quarter and we're just working through that on a period-by-period basis. But there's about $600,000 in the quarter associated with that. In terms of rent expense, really the dip in this quarter really relates to some CAM reimbursements that came in lower than what was expected from one of our lessors. John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: All right. That's it from me. Thanks. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Jon M. Petersen - MLV & Co. LLC: Hey actually it's Jon Petersen, here. Just a couple of quick questions. I hope I didn't miss this, but in terms of your lease volume, your new and expansion volume in the quarter obviously a lot higher because of the SV6 power base building and SV7 wholesale lease. Can you give us an indication of what the leasing volumes would be, what the $19.6 million would be if you took out those two leases. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : I think the combination, I guess, actually for purposes of what we can and can't disclose, Jon, I don't think we can actually give you the amounts just due to confidentiality purposes. Jon M. Petersen - MLV & Co. LLC: Okay, all right. And then maybe the same answer for this question, but maybe you can kind of dance around it, but earlier in response to a question, Tom, you talked about how with the power based lease, one of the reasons you did it is because the return on incremental capital was attractive. So when you say that, is that comparable to a normal co-location development, or you usually expect the 12% plus EBITDA yield. Should we expect a similar or more attractive yield on that investment? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Again, we can't speak to anything that would point too closely to the economics on that lease. But we're just not in the sub 12% business. I don't care what piece of our business it is, it's just not what we're trying to accomplish. And again we said we rank order opportunities based on risk-adjusted returns, build-to-suit preleased have a little bit lower risk, but we have a lot of investment opportunities with premium returns and we try to maintain that discipline no matter what we invest in. Jon M. Petersen - MLV & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes sense and then I guess outside of the economics of that deal, I mean you referred to that tenant as a strategic tenant. I'm curious whether their presence on your Santa Clara campus creates any sort of revenue synergies with the rest of your tenants, whether like you guys can do interconnection or any other reason that that would want people to be located in SV1 through SV5 and SV7? Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well. Look I think Santa Clara is, we all know, it's the heart of the data centers in the Bay Area. And I think that was important to this customer in their site selection criteria. And then in value to our portfolio, this is a larger customer. We have a broad relationship with and being able to serve them in ways that help their company just fosters a good relationship that has benefits for everybody quite broadly. So, excuse me, we're delighted to be of service. Jon M. Petersen - MLV & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. That makes sense. Thanks for your \u2013 thanks of the time. Jeffrey S. Finnin - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Thomas Ray for closing remarks. Thomas M. Ray - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I just want to say again thanks to everybody for the interest in and support of the company and what we're trying to accomplish and special thanks to the people at CoreSite, working extremely hard and doing a very, very good job. We continue to believe we have a very bright future in front of us and we're going to keep working hard for our investors to execute upon that promise. Thanks again. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

And now I will turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Ray : Good morning and welcome to our Q3 call. Financial results for the quarter reflect continued steady growth reporting year-over-year increases in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share of 23%, 33% and 35% respectively. We continue to see solid margin performance with our adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to 50.3% measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q3 2015. This represents an increase of 370 basis points over the comparable period ending with and including Q3 2014. Regarding sales, our momentum carried into the second half of the year and supported strong production in Q3. Further, we are pleased with our progress across our three primary objectives for 2015, namely, to increase transaction count, further drive network value and bring more leading global public clouds under our platform and on to our CoreSite open cloud exchange. Regarding transaction count, we again increased the number of leases signed and specifically the number of smaller leases targeted to increase interconnections and drive ROI. In Q3, total transaction count of new and expansion leases reached 149, which is a record for us as a public company. 93% or 138 of the new and expansion leases executed this quarter were for deployments measuring less than 1,000 square feet each. Regarding network value, in Q3 we signed leases to add 37 new network deployments to our platform. Network wins in the quarter include companies in the subsea, satellite, cable, and mobility sectors in addition to a broad array of fully integrated network service providers. Additionally, new network agreements signed in the quarter represent service providers from around the world including global providers based in North America as well as providers based in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Sweden, and United Arab emirates. More broadly over the past four quarters we signed agreements to add 130 network deployments to our platform from all over the globe further cementing our national platforms ability to provide high-performance, low latency solutions to requirements of businesses from a wide array of industries and conducting activities around the world. Beyond our network activities, we're pleased with our progress with major cloud providers as well as the broad set of company's supporting cloud adoption by the enterprise whether in a public, private or hybrid delivery model. To that, during the quarter we executed 56 leases with cloud system integrator and MSP partners. Included among these is our recently announced initial agreement with Microsoft to provide direct connectivity to Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute within our LA campus representing the only native Azure ExpressRoute deployment in the Los Angeles market. Azure ExpressRoute is now available to our customers via the CoreSite open cloud exchange and we expect to soon support the service with an API being developed in collaboration with Microsoft. We are excited to launch this partnership with Microsoft and we look forward to expanding the relationship to other markets across our platform. With regard to new and expansion leases with company's supporting cloud adoption by the enterprise, during the quarter we meaningfully expanded our relationship with a leading global file hosting service provider as well as two Fortune 100 providers of technology services. Among the key capabilities of the cloud, SI and MSP customers with which we executed leases in the quarter, our that FedRamp compliance, security, storage, multivendor service orchestration, software defined networking and other areas of technology support that help make the communities within CoreSite's platform accessible and valuable to enterprises from nearly all walks of life. With our focus on increasing the networking and cloud density across our platform and attracting performance sensitive deployments, our Q3 interconnection revenue grew more than 24% in Q3 2013 over Q3 2014. Related, we continue to see fiber cross-connect volume growth increasing 16% year-over-year in Q3 with total cross-connect volume growing 12%. With regard to supply and demand, there been no meaningful changes compared to the update we provided during our second quarter call. Supply and demand dynamics in our industry remain largely in balance and we view the environment favorably as absorption has remained strong in the majority of our markets. In the performance sensitive segment of the market, supply has remained disciplined with just in time delivery, a standard practice by us and our public peers, supported by steady demand, the performance sensitive market segment continues to see consistent pricing trends. As it relates to the wholesale segment of the market, absorption has remained steady in major markets including Northern Virginia and the Bay Area. Although supply remains robust in Northern Virginia, existing supply of large blocks of capacity is currently more constrained in the Bay Area resulting in incrementally positive pricing. In New York, New Jersey, we continue to see an uptick in funnel volume, but we have not yet seen a material increase in net absorption. Regarding our development activity, we have a number of projects underway or recently completed which we believe support continued growth. In Northern Virginia, demand remain steady and we're seeing solid leasing momentum at our Reston campus. As a component of our leasing in Reston, in Q3 we signed agreements to add three new network providers to the campus bringing the total number of network providers at the location to 32 We believe that the network community established in our Reston campus has helped to support an attractive pipeline of leasing opportunities with social media, digital content and cloud providers. Given the solid pace of leasing at our Reston campus coupled with support from our current funnel, we're under construction on both phase 3 and phase 4 at VA2 representing the remaining components of VA2 targeted for build-out of TKD capacity. These phases are expected to be delivered in late 2015 and early 2016 respectively. Each phase is approximately 48,000 square feet with 50% of phase 3 pre-leased to our anchor customer at the facility. In Chicago, we completed construction on 12,000 square feet of TKD capacity in Q3 of which we've preleased 54% with a targeted commencement date in Q4. In Santa Clara, we are under construction on the previously announced powered shell build-to-suit at SV6 and we expect to deliver that building in the first half of 2016. We also commence construction on our 230,000 square foot SV7 building with an estimated completion of phase 1 in mid 2016. We remain encouraged by the pace of demand in the Bay Area and are optimistic about our opportunity with this investment. In summary, we are pleased with our team's execution in Q3 and optimistic about our market opportunity closing out 2015 and looking ahead to 2016. We believe the growth potential of our business is attractive and we believe in our ability to continue to execute our business plan. Our focus remains clear, to provide our customers with differentiated high-performance solutions and industry leading customer service and by so doing continue to deliver strong growth and superior returns for our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steven Smith : Thanks, Tom. I'd like to start by reviewing our sales activity during the quarter. Q3, new and expansion sales totaled $8.8 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 64,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $138 per square foot. As it relates to pricing in the quarter, annualized GAAP rent per square foot on new and expansion leases was slightly below the trailing 12-month rate primarily due to lower power density sold in the quarter. Looking at the performance sensitive segment, the rate per square foot was in line with the trailing 12-month average. As Tom mentioned, we made good progress on our goal to increase leasing volume to smaller customer requirements, executing 138 new and expansion leases of less than 1,000 square feet in Q3, a 25% increase over Q2. We also saw continued strength in leasing among mid-sized opportunities across our platform signing nine new and expansion leases between 1,000 and 5,000 square feet compared to two mid-sized leases signed in the first quarter and five signed in last quarter. The solid leasing activity particularly the increased volume of smaller deployments contributed to the 53 new logos signed in Q3, a record since CoreSite became a public company. This continues to be a key focus as we look to further diversify our customer base. In addition to strengthened new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q3 was similarly strong as renewals totaled approximately 72,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $145 per square foot reflecting mark-to-market growth of 4.2% on a cash basis and 9.7% on a GAAP basis. On a year-to-date basis, cash rent growth is 4.9%. Churn was 1.4% in the third quarter and is 5.1% year-to-date. Jeff will update you on our outlook for mark-to-market growth and churn for the full year later in the call. Regarding vertical mix, networking cloud deployments accounted for nearly 60% of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases led by significant strength in the cloud vertical. The network vertical reflected similar strength including key wins with a large global provider deploying new fiber builds in multiple locations across our platform as well as a number of domestic and international carriers deploying new network nodes at LA2, all strengthening the network density and attractiveness of our LA campus. Following a very strong performance in our enterprise vertical in Q2, we continue to see increased penetration into this key market segment. Specifically, in Q3, leasing in the enterprise vertical accounted for approximately 40% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the quarter. Strength in this segment was led by the digital content and other general enterprises while the number of leases signed by SI and MSP customers increased materially on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in Q3 were Northern Virginia, DC, Los Angeles and New York. Performance in Northern Virginia/DC was driven by three key factors. First, we saw a robust leasing activity at VA1 among smaller deployments with 24 new and expansion leases signed of less than 1,000 square feet each, which is two times the average number of leases in this segment signed in the trailing 12-month period. This activity helped increase stabilized occupancy at VA1 to 92.5% at the end of Q3. Second, we realized continued leasing momentum at VA2 among larger deployments. A sizable component of the leasing at that building during Q3 consisted of an expansion by our original anchor tenant. The rental rate associated with this final expansion rate was below our average rate of the campus does negatively impacting the total leverage. Occupancy at VA2 is now 87.4% consisting of 100% occupancy in the stabilized space and 50% occupancy in our pre-stabilized space. Finally, we saw increased strength in the network and cloud communities across our Reston campus. Notably, we have seen steady demand in network-centric applications in the third quarter as well as a steady pipeline of social media, digital media, storage and cloud providers seeking to deploy interconnection hubs at the campus. At a high level, we are pleased with our progress in the Northern Virginia/DC market during Q3 with over 30 networks now deployed within our Reston campus. Moving to the West Coast, leasing in Los Angeles continue to be well distributed between the two buildings comprising our one Wilshire campus as well as among verticals. Network and cloud customers accounted for 50% of leasing with digital content representing 30% of leases signed. We also saw very good leasing activity related to our recently completed capacity at LA2. In Q3, the number of new and expansion transactions were 14% ahead of the trailing 12-month average and annualized GAAP rents signed was more than two times that signed over the same period. Additionally, we recently signed an agreement making LA1 the site of the newly announced faster transpacific submarine cable landing station in LA directly connecting the West Coast of the U.S. with Japan and the Pacific Rim. The faster transpacific submarine cable deployment represents the seventh subsea cable to offer direct access from our Los Angeles campus to Asian markets increasing our value proposition and providing our customers with enhanced connectivity options. Further, we continue to bolster our cloud capabilities at our LA campus with the availability of AWS direct connect and now the availability of the only native Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute deployment in the market. In New York, leasing activity picked up from last quarter with 22 new and expansion leases signed, including 10 new logos. As it relates to distribution of leasing, we signed three leases exceeding 1,000 square feet while the pace of leasing amongst smaller deployments remain solid. Enterprise leasing also picked up in Q3 with nine new and expansion leases signed in this vertical compared to an average of four leases signed in the trailing 12-month period leveraging the network and cloud density we have built across our New York campus. Related, we have seen significant fiber capacity added from a large cloud provider to support even greater on-ramp capabilities. In summary, we are pleased with our sales momentum in Q3 and our progress on our key priorities, including a solid increase in transaction count and attracting key network and cloud deployments, which enhance our customer communities. We continue to focus on differentiating the value of our platform and the solutions we provide to our customers supported by best in class customer service. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Finnin : Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. I'll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q3 financial results followed by an update on our development CapEx and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity and last, I will discuss our revised outlook and guidance for the remainder of the year. Turning to our financial performance in the third quarter, data center revenues were $84.6 million, a 6.4% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 23.5% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Q3 data center revenue consisted of $70.9 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 6.4% on a sequential quarter basis and 24.3% year-over-year. $11.4 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 7.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 24.3% year-over-year and $2.4 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $1.9 million. Our third quarter FFO was $0.74 per diluted share in unit, an increase of 8.8% on a sequential quarter basis and a 34.5% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $43.7 million increased 7.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 33% over the same quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 50.5% increased 390 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially. Related, on a year-to-date basis, our revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO is 67% and 56% respectively adjusted for unusual items in 2014. Sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter totaled $3.8 million, 10% less than the prior quarter, but in line with the trailing four quarter average. We expect sales and marketing expenses to be in line with the lower end of our guidance of approximately 5% to 5.5% of total operating revenues for the full year. General and administrative expenses were $8.6 million dollars in Q3 correlating to 10% of total operating revenues. We expect G&A for 2015 to come in at the higher end of our guidance range of 9.5% to 10% of total operating revenue. Regarding our same store metrics, Q3 same store turn-key data center occupancy increased 760 basis points to 86% from 78.4% in the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, same store MRR per cabinet equivalent increased 3.7% year-over-year and 1.5% sequentially to $1,441. Lastly, we commenced 66,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $139 per square foot, which represents $9.3 million of annualized GAAP rent. Turning now to backlog, our projected annualized GAAP rent from signed, but not yet commenced leases is $17.8 million as of September 30, 2015 or $28.2 million on a cash basis. We expect approximately 30% or $5.4 million of the GAAP backlog to commence in the fourth quarter, another 50% is expected to commence throughout 2016. As a reminder, within the total backlog amount is rent associated with the build-to-suit at SV6 as well as the SV7 pre-lease each forecasted to commence in the latter half of 2016. Turning to development activity and expansion CapEx, during the third quarter we placed into service two projects at CH1 and LA2 with 11, 700 and 12,500 square feet now reflected in our pre-stabilized approval respectively. We have seen good leasing activity in our pre-stabilized assets, which were 52% lease and 39% occupied as of the end of Q3 compared to 33% leased and 27% occupied at the end of the second quarter. During the third quarter, we began construction on Phase 4 the last Phase of VA2 with 48,000 square feet under development, which along with 48,000 square feet at Phase 3 is expected to be completed over the next two quarters. As a reminder, when we complete development projects we realize a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real estate taxes and insurance resulting in a corresponding increase in operating expense. As shown on page 21 of the supplemental a percentage of interest capitalized in Q3 was 22% and year to date is 36%. Based on our current development pipeline we would expect the percentage of capitalized interest for the full year to be in line with the year-to-date your today percentage. Turning to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2015, our net debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA is 2.0 times and if you include our preferred stock it is 2.7 times. As we mentioned last quarter, based on the current and expected development projects disclosed on page 19 of the supplemental, we would expect our leverage to increase by year end to approximately 3 times, including preferred stock comfortably below our stated target ratio of approximately 4 times.  Finally with regard to our outlook, we are increasing our 2015 FFO guidance to a range of $2.82 to $2.86 per share in OP unit from the previous range of $2.75 to $2.83. The increased guidance reflects our performance through the first nine months of the year and increased visibility into the fourth quarter. More specifically, we now expect total operating revenue to be $329 million to $333 million compared to the previous range of $325 million to $330 million. Data center revenue is now expected to be $321 million to $325, up from the previous range of $317 million to $322 million. Adjusted EBITDA is not expected to be $165 million to $169 million up from our previous guidance of $162 million to $167 million implying a full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA margin of 50.5% based on the midpoint of guidance. As it relates to churn, we now expect full year 2015 turn to be in the range of 8% to 9%.  Year-to-date churn at the end of Q3 was 5.1% and as we have previously communicated, we expect an incremental 150 basis points of churn at the end of Q4 related to the lease amendment debt SV3. In addition, we expect some churn related to a particular customer deployment in Chicago in either Q4 2015 or Q1 2016. Cash rent mark to market growth is now expected to be 4% to 5% for 2015, up from our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. This reflects our year to date performance of 4.9% and improve visibility into Q4. While we will provide formal 2016 guidance in connection with our fourth quarter earnings call in February, I want to highlight a few items as you begin to think about your models and the Outlook for growth next year. First, as it relates to our adjusted EBITDA and FFO margins as we go forward, we would expect to see a moderation in the rate of expansion, primarily due to product mix.  As we have discussed previously, the volume of larger leases signed over the trailing 12 month period impacts our earnings margin given the greater proportion of metered power associated with these deployments. While we mentioned on previous calls this year that we expected to see limited margin expansion in 2015 with greater opportunity to expand margins in 2016, the build-out and power draw are still ramping in from several of our newer wholesale deployments. As such, we have seen attractive margin expansion in 2015, but now expect more limited opportunity from margin expansion in 2016. We will provide more detail around us on our Q4 call in February.  Next, our available capacity under the credit facility plus cash at the end of Q3 is $243 million. Based on the development projects as reflected on page 19 of the supplemental, we anticipate spending $116 million of expansion capital through June 30, 2016 leaving us with current uncommitted liquidity of approximately $80 million. Based on this development pace plus the potential opportunity to fund additional investments, we're currently assessing the capital markets to decide the timing, amount, and the type of debt instrument to increase our liquidity to support future growth. Last, as it relates to churn for 2016, we would remind you that we expect an incremental 90 basis points of churn in Q2 2016, due to the SV3 lease amendment and as disclosed in our supplemental and 10-Q to be filed tomorrow. A more detailed summary of 2015 guidance items can be found on page 23 of the third quarter earnings supplemental.  I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today.  Now we\u2019d like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Jordan Sadler : Thank you good morning. First question is, I guess also looks at into the future a little bit leaving off where Jeff, you wrapped up your prepared remarks. I guess I\u2019m curious a little bit about capacity and as you\u2019ve been very successful over the last four quarters or so leasing up the portfolio I\u2019m curious about while you\u2019re in the process of assessing your capital needs, the process in assessing the need for additional capacity across the portfolio and how we should think about that either geographically or from a product perspective? Derek McCandless : Thanks Jordan. I think at a high level, just pays to think of what we\u2019ve been communicating in terms of our priorities for capital. So, really if you look at the markets we're in right now and where we\u2019ve had the most absorption, then do that math and look at how much is remaining to be available to either be developed or remain to be sold right now that\u2019s already turnkey that points you to where we\u2019re focused. I think we\u2019ve had accelerated leasing in Virginia VA2. The SV7 building is the last building available to be built on our current landholdings in Santa Clara. It\u2019s a big building, but it is the last one. We're running short in Chicago. So, same list of suspects and we\u2019re just evaluating what are the opportunities for investment and what are our returns and we're just working through all that with our board, but I think the easiest way to think of where we\u2019re going to spend our time is in line with those capital deployment priorities that we\u2019ve been articulating. And we just don\u2019t have anything specific to say right now other than, we're 2.9 times levered. We have capacity to keep growing. We have some markets where we\u2019ve had success that we\u2019re getting lean and we're just trying to be economically rational about what to do about that picture. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And geographically, any thoughts or need to expand beyond the current footprint or like the way you are situated today? Derek McCandless : Well, no change to Pat's comments. All things being equal, more markets are better, but I don't think that\u2019s a hugely meaningful driver for us. And in particular, if you look at this Q, which I think is not that different from past Qs we are attracting a global customer base here in the States. I think we\u2019re effective with platform requirements and we just don't feel meaningfully disadvantaged because of the market coverage. We feel like we\u2019re in the best places in the U.S. with a vast majority of them with the most data center demand in the country that we\u2019re addressing through our portfolio. So, we are pleased with our ability to keep growing in the markets we are currently in and on a risk-adjusted basis that\u2019s highly attractive. That\u2019s not to say that something else might be attractive at some point in time, but the table that is set before us is good and plentiful. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then on the mark-to-market increase, I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s coming from market rent growth or if it\u2019s a combination of market rent growth and the focus on the smaller transaction, what exactly is driving that? Steven Smith : Yeah, Jordan this is Steve. It\u2019s really a combination of both of those things. We're seeing obviously strength in the marketplace that allows us to hold rent and that\u2019s encouraging, but we're also seeing better traction in those smaller deployments which we built in some other renewals that help us in that regard, but overall renewals seem to be solid so we\u2019re pleased with both sides of the equation. Derek McCandless : And keep in mind Jordan that the mark-to-market stat is leases that were in the portfolio at the end of the Q and that renewed so that stat does not pick up selling to new customers. Jordan Sadler : Right, right okay. I get that, I get that. Lastly, just more housekeeping oriented, there was a transaction costs in litigation, it showed up as two different numbers in two different places and I was wondering what might have driven the Delta litigation seems to be added to the second spot in the supplemental and what the nature of those expenditures might have been. Jeffrey Finnin : Yeah, Jordan, you're probably referencing roughly $650,000 in the quarter and those costs are largely attributable to some certain legal issues that we\u2019re working through a couple of situations and that\u2019s substantially what those costs relate to. Derek McCandless : I think those accruals are for two different items and when you look at the amounts, I don't think they are game changers for the company but we felt it appropriate to take some reserves against two different items. And they are unrelated. Jordan Sadler : Should they be recurring or is this hard to predict? Derek McCandless : I think it\u2019s difficult to predict. In general, we don\u2019t have much litigation at the same time you have some the bigger a company gets you\u2019ve got slip and falls, you\u2019ve got all kinds of stuff out there and it is hard to predict. I think it\u2019s rare that a company of any size never has anything and I think it\u2019s equally rare that we\u2019ve had anything material. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Thank you. Jeffrey Finnin : Thanks, Jordon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Jonathan Schildkraut : Thank you for taking the questions. First, I just want to follow up on the development of your cloud communities, obviously you guys have made a lot of progress in getting Microsoft as your on ramp in LA. It was an exciting announcement. Can you give us a little bit of perspective on the development of the other side of putting together these cloud ecosystems that is, where are we as a company or as an industry in terms of seeing enterprises come into plug-in to the multi cloud environment or into the cloud ecosystems that you\u2019re developing and then I\u2019d like to follow up with maybe a couple of detail-related questions, thanks. Steven Smith : Sure, Jonathan. This is Steve. I\u2019ll give you my comments and then I'll let Tom wrap up, but in general I would say that it\u2019s of greater interest for the enterprises to want to have that connectivity flexibility within our data center. So, we work to provide that flexibility across our open cloud exchange and with the reconnect and various other providers, so that\u2019s driving a lot of activity on our end to make sure that we accommodate that from an enterprise perspective. But we\u2019re also seeing greater interest from the other side from the cloud providers wanting to connect back into those enterprises so between the two, we\u2019re at a very nice place in the marketplace where we\u2019re in between those two and being able to provide those connections. So, we look at it to be a continued focus for us as we go forward in part of the value proposition that we built into our data centers. So, I think it will continue to materialize and something will be continued focus for us as we go forward. Jonathan Schildkraut : But if you had but - go ahead Tom, I\u2019m sorry. Thomas Ray : I think it\u2019s very early innings still, we\u2019re just measured by cross connection to what extent our enterprise is connecting into the clouds. We\u2019ve had one of the large public clouds, their providers who\u2019s been with us longer than others and I\u2019d say the first year they didn't, we didn't see a lot of enterprise take up around that offering. I see over the last year, we\u2019ve seen it connections accelerate pretty meaningfully. That said it\u2019s still relatively small compared to the size of our company or all cross connects here, so I would say that we are starting to see it in the more mature deployments, but I still think it\u2019s very early. Jonathan Schildkraut : Great, thanks Tom. Ironically I was going to ask you what inning we were in, but you seemed to have nailed that one. A couple of detailed questions here, there was a $8.8 million of capitalized commissions in the quarter. I think that was somewhat of an anomaly from what we were expecting. Is there any incremental color around that? Steven Smith : Yeah, Jonathan, just to give you a little bit of color around the $8 million, I would say roughly 60% of that amount relates to external commissions, the rest of it are internal and of that external piece, a major component of that related to a single multi-market new logo that we signed during the quarter and anticipate commencing in Q4. Jonathan Schildkraut : Okay. Thomas Ray : I think it\u2019s important to understand the cash around that as well. Steven Smith : Yeah, I guess just to give you a little bit more color, that particular, for the one particular transaction is a transaction whereby the lease or the commission amounts will be paid out over the life of the particular term of that deployment as we collect cash from our particular customer. And so while it will be paid over a period of the customers\u2019 term, the supplemental reflects the entire amount that we anticipate paying out over that period of term just so you have an understanding of how that works. We provided some additional disclosure inside the supplemental in our definition just to make sure that gets cleared up for people. Thomas Ray : Jonathan, just the simple I guess the clearest thing we can say is the meaningful transaction to which Jeff referred is with an agent rather than a real estate broker, it\u2019s more of the telecom based agent on a longer-term multi-market deal and our work with our auditors and internally with our team pointed toward capitalizing all of those payments even though we paid that agent as we received the money over a longer term, capitalizing that and then accruing it as a liability since we haven't paid the cash. So, if you are trying to, as I think most people are trying to look at AFFO on a cash basis, a big chunk of the AFFO is frankly a noncash item in this quarter. Jonathan Schildkraut : Yeah, all right, thanks for that extra color. I\u2019ll just ask one more here and then I\u2019ll circle back in the line, but look it was a very solid quarter again for you guys and you\u2019re able to bring up the guidance. It\u2019s interesting to me that where we are in the year and the fact that there's usually a fairly decent lag time between the time deals are signed and they start to generate revenue to see you be able to take up numbers and so I\u2019m wondering as we look at your guidance increase this late in the year if this had to do with faster leasing or faster commencements or delayed churn like what are the factors that roll together to allow you to move the numbers here? Thanks. Thomas Ray : It\u2019s leasing. Our churn has been in line, our mark-to-market has been in line, so it\u2019s really leasing. There you have it. Jonathan Schildkraut : All right. Thanks guys, really appreciate you taking the questions. Thomas Ray : Yeah. Steven Smith : Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead with your question. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. So I was interested in any noticeable change in the demand or activity in your business as a result of the large M&A deal that recently closed and then, related to the commissions question, overall if you could talk about how much of your leasing is a result of direct sales to customers versus indirect channels? Thanks. Derek McCandless : What\u2019s the M&A deal you\u2019re just talking about? I have no idea. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m kidding there. Steve do you want to talk about what you\u2019ve seen? Steven Smith : Yeah, I would say from the M&A deal that you\u2019re discussing, I haven't seen a whole lot of difference in the marketplace relative to how we\u2019re competing and how they're showing up as of yet. That may change over time but as it sits today, nothing material. Derek McCandless : I just think it\u2019s too early. Steven Smith : And then Jonathan on the second one, I think in terms of I guess what the number of deals that would be coming through I think you said the channel and/or broker, I think on average it\u2019s going to vary based on and it\u2019s good to be driven by the size of those leases, but on average it\u2019s anywhere between 10% to 20% is what we would typically see. That\u2019s typically what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years in terms of number of leases. Jonathan Atkin : Number of leases, okay, got it. And then I'm interested in the growth, not the absolute volumes of interconnect revenues but just the growth you\u2019re seen in interconnect and how much of that would you characterize as coming from customer to carrier versus a customer to customer within your data centers? Any sort of change in the mixed shift and what should be the predominant driver? Thomas Ray : I think you are seeing some increase in the share that is non- carrier related or put differently enterprise to enterprise, enterprise to cloud, but the majority still remains involving a carrier. Jonathan Atkin : And then related to that, there is open cloud exchange and then there is design wins that can ExpressRoute and Direct Connect and if we isolate cloud related activities into those two buckets, which would be the more meaningful incremental driver that you\u2019re seeing right now? Thomas Ray : Between what John? Jonathan Atkin : Open cloud exchange versus the cloud specific on-ramps that you\u2019ve got like an ExpressRoute and Direct Connect and then perhaps a few others. Thomas Ray : We are kind of the same. ExpressRoute with us is number one, [indiscernible] the number two and it\u2019s currently only on the exchange and that\u2019s the request of the service provider. So I'm not sure how to answer it. There is a fair amount of \u2013 sorry. Jonathan Atkin : Go-ahead. I thought that those might be separate particularly in the case of say Direct Connect where some of that might come directly from the customer onto that cloud rather than through your CS platform. Thomas Ray : And with Direct Connect, that\u2019s accurate. The majority of connections into Direct Connect are via Cross Connect. And with [indiscernible] to different animal right now because of how they have come to market in our portfolio. Jonathan Atkin : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Dave Rodgers : Hey, good morning, Tom. I had a question for you I guess around the network wins. You talked about 37 I think network wins in the quarter, 130 in the trailing 12 months if I got the numbers right. I'm just kind of curious that the market is experiencing the same type of growth if you think within your markets you\u2019re just winning a tremendous amount of share in that business. I guess I just love a little bit of more color around the network side of the business if you could. Steven Smith : Yeah, sure. This is Steve. I'm going to start off here. I think we are attracting a fair share or maybe more than our fair share of the activity in that marketplace driven by increased strength in the enterprise space and just increasing the value in our hubs in LA and DC and so forth. But I think just the overall industry is seeing significant growth as you've seen in recent reports on the news that the value of Cross Connects and the interconnection strengthen the marketplace. So that\u2019s just driving more and more connectivity to the data centers in general but I think we\u2019re seeing a pretty good share of that come to our data centers which is great. Dave Rodgers : Great, thanks. Second question maybe around the Cross Connect side of the business, can you give a lot of details about fiber and total connect volume but I guess I was curious more on the market pricing that you are seeing out there with regard to Cross Connects? I know you\u2019re continuing to inch up and mark-to-market in that business, but I\u2019d like to know a little bit more about market pricing if you could comment on that? And then a second to that was, you talked about a large cloud customer impacting the Cross Connect volumes, was that a meaningful change, will that continue to be or is that something that we should see ebb in the next quarter maybe I didn't get that clearly. Thomas Ray : First on pricing, Dave, I think we haven't seen material changes in the market and as such we have been as you've said inching and marking our portfolio closer and closer to market but I haven't seen the market change a lot. So that's - that one. And regarding the cloud, Cross Connect to the cloud, I think that was in the context of may be responding to Jonathan around, to what extent is the enterprise really adopting the cloud? So we\u2019ve had - one of our early cloud partners, we have seen significant growth in Cross Connects for that partner from enterprise over the last year. That total volume is still not tremendously, it is still not material I think related to our total Cross Connect base. So if you think about the Cross Connect business I wouldn\u2019t describe anything material to that, it\u2019s a higher growth rate but often the smaller base. Dave Rodgers : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Last question maybe for Jeff. Jeff, you talked about churn, it looks like the churn for the fourth quarter is 3.5% to 4% plus or minus. You mentioned the extra customer in Chicago. If that customer I guess were to leave in the fourth quarter would that take churn above that number or is that embedded in the number and it could come in lower if it slips to the first quarter? Jeffrey Finnin : Yes, Dave. The guidance we\u2019ve given for Q4 includes the possible churn of that particular customer. So again while we are not certain of the timing or of the amount, we wanted to make sure people were at least aware of it at this point in time, especially if we have visibility into it. So we\u2019ve included that in our Q4 churn. Dave Rodgers : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Jeffrey Finnin : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Colby Synesael : Great, thanks. Two if I may. Just wanted to follow-up on the initial question regarding pipeline, so when you are looking for space, are you still seeing there's a lot of space available in the markets where you are going to need it that you\u2019ll be comfortable taking on and be able to turn into a type of facility that you\u2019ll be happy with I guess starting as far as just going to the land itself. And if you look at over the next 12 months, do you see any markets where you guys could be capacity constrained relative to demand that you're seeing today to the point where that could actually start to impact your top line growth at least for a brief period of time until you get that space brought on?  And then my second line of questioning is, recently there has been some talk whether it came from Cisco or Intel around some weakness in data center demand and I very much appreciate the term data center is a very broad term and very much appreciate that there has been a debate for many years now about does cloud ultimately eat Colo. But I would love to get your take on what you see happening and is there any risk you see longer-term from some of your for example digital media customers shifting from a Colo-type model to perhaps more of a cloud model and how that might impact you? Thank you. Thomas Ray : Sure. I guess related to the capacity and room to run inside the portfolio, first we focus on earnings and for the extent capacity is a component of that, it is certainly is a component but we are really focused on earnings growth and I would say over the last couple of years we have had spots where we have been very tight in some markets and more capacity in others. I don\u2019t expect that to change. I think there may be some markets where we get reasonably thin but we really do look at our planning and we try to look pretty hard out five years, what is the growth of earnings of the company and in the near term, we believe there remains a good opportunity for the organization, a good market opportunity and a good physical platform and a good balance sheet inside the company to maintain healthy growth rates. That is our belief. We are certainly not trying to \u2013 we are very aware of not running out of space everywhere and not being able to grow. We are measured and we plan pretty carefully and there are soft spots from time to time in some markets and over the years we have been able to navigate that pretty well. Colby Synesael : And weakness in demand overall, rumors out there. Thomas Ray : Let our sales speak for themselves. I did see the note from Intel and the weakness in data center demand I guess they\u2019ve been putting their gear into data centers as opposed to demand for their data centers. I know they have some type of third-party products, but I guess we can only see what we see. Steve, any comments on that? Steven Smith : Yeah, I would just say that we haven\u2019t seen that shelf in our pipeline as of yet, so we keep a close eye on it and we monitor and try to adjust to it but all those factors are important. But at this point we haven't seen them show up in our pipeline. Colby Synesael : Thanks. Thomas Ray : Thanks, Colby. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Matthew Heinz : Thank you. Good afternoon. If I could go back to the cloud exchange concept and just think about our cloud providers over provisioned today given what they anticipate in terms of future enterprise demand or would you think it is more of an add-on affect when the enterprise starts to meaningfully adopt the product or the solution, and how meaningful could that add-on affect be from the service providers standpoint? Steven Smith : Sure. I\u2019ll start off with give you my perspective. This is Steve. I think it varies pretty broadly across the various cloud providers out there. We\u2019ve seen over the past several years cloud providers come and go, some that have over provisioned and not seen the demand and had their gear be antiquated and not competitive and we\u2019ve seen others be much more measured and seen better adoption. So the big players out there are much better at it and they will come in and build out and then plan on scaling from there and that is part of our value proposition is being able to accommodate that scale. It has been a mix but I think many of the cloud providers have gotten much smarter over the past couple of years as to what they deploy and how they measure that growth and as adoption comes along with it. so it seem to be maturing and with that maturity we\u2019ve seen more consistency. Matthew Heinz : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then I'm not sure I\u2019ve heard you guys talk much about escalators built into your contracts and I\u2019m just kind of trying to get a sense of, as I look at that same-store MRR per cab growth of 4% to 5% and that\u2019s been pretty consistent, how much of that is a base rent or cash rent escalator versus just overall growth in the cross connects? Thomas Ray : Matt, is going to really be a combination of the two I think. When you look at the overall growth in the MRR per cab-e, historically we\u2019ve talked a little bit about and we haven\u2019t seen a meaningful change that typically about 75% of that growth from the MMR per cab-e comes from increases in power and cross connects. The other 25% is coming from the rent component. And so while there are escalations, cash escalations inside most of our contracts or I should say majority of our contracts that helps drive that to some extent but the lion\u2019s share of that growth continues to come from both increases in power and cross connects. Matthew Heinz : Okay, thanks. And can you quantify what the average escalator is written in? Thomas Ray : I think overall I\u2019d say ballpark-ish is 3% of a relatively on an annual basis a relatively good data point. Matthew Heinz : Okay, thanks guys. Thomas Ray : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Jon Petersen : Great. Thank you. I am curious about the [indiscernible] connection, a lot of people have asked question kind of about what it means in terms of demand and all that stuff. What I'm more curious about is how do you guys get these deals to start with? What is the negotiation process? Is it something that you have to pay for? I'm sure it is something that you and all your competitors want as well so how does it end up in a CoreSite facility and what are the contracts like? How long are you locked up in terms of having the only connection in the market or could that change tomorrow? Thomas Ray : I guess first, bringing them in actually - Steve, do you want to talk about how the process? Steven Smith : Go ahead. Thomas Ray : In bringing them in, I don\u2019t recall that we\u2019ve ever paid a cloud provider to launch inside our platform and it really just comes from how do we get them but we have long-standing relationships with these companies. We have people who work together with their people for years. And I just think those discussions start fairly early in the product planning cycle and it is a \u2013 that\u2019s the process, that is it. We have not signed anything, CoreSite has not signed anything that locks any cloud provider out of announcing or working with other parties in the marketplace so that dynamic does not apply to CoreSite. Steven Smith : The other thing I would add is, we do have very good relationships with many of the largest cloud providers and we do work with them on a continual basis. As far as how we start and ultimately formalize those relationships, it is a mutual interest so they want to have access to our customers, we want to have access to their cloud and as I mentioned earlier that makes pretty easy conversation, how we get there varies from cloud provider to provider but we are all interested in the same thing. Jon Petersen : Gotcha, okay. And then lot of people have talked about capacity and the runway in new markets and all of that stuff, I'm just kind of curious I know you have nothing new to announce in terms of plans for new markets but just internally how much time do you guys spend amongst yourselves or meetings with the board talking about potential markets you would want to be in whether it is domestic or international, how much of your strategic planning time do you spend thinking about that? Thomas Ray : How we deploy capital and how we think about our investment returns is certainly a key topic for the Board and for the Executive Team as we think about the strategy. There are times when that strategy is pretty well set for the next year, year and a half and as such we don't talk about it quite as much. There are times when there is more to talk about but we maintain a good discipline around thinking about how to invest, we are a capital intensive business and our Board is very rigorous and disciplined about staying up to speed on our strategies and helping us think through those things. So I can\u2019t quantify - it ebbs and flows with the needs of the company but it never goes away because we never stop thinking about it. Jon Petersen : Gotcha, okay. That makes sense. And then just one other question for Jeff, it sounds like to fund development spending with the pipeline you have right now I think you had about 160 million-ish left and it sounds like there is going to be some new debt issued. Can you give us any indication of the timing around that, what kind of routes you would use on that and then I'm also just curious with your leverage levels as low as they are, you guys have a fairly diversified portfolio, you\u2019re now a larger company than you were at the IPO, what kind of conversations you had with the ratings agencies about moving towards investment grade rating? Thomas Ray : Yes, let me see if I can give you some color as best as I can Jon. I guess somewhat as I said in my prepared remarks as we look out over the next call at nine months through June 30 of next year is kind of where we're looking from a timing perspective between now and then and ultimately it\u2019s going to depend on the things that really matter to us which is maintaining flexibility so that we can continue to trend towards that investment grade rating. And maintaining an unsecured instrument is obviously key from our perspective. As you\u2019ve seen we like to maintain a balance between fixed versus variable price debt and then obviously maintain an appropriate debt maturity stack in whatever it is we do. In terms of conversations with rating agencies, we meet with the rating agencies at least once a year with each of them, the main ones to make sure that we stay in front of them. We learn from how they are looking at things, how they look at the industry and importantly so they also understand what CoreSite is doing, has done and ultimately probably more importantly where we are headed. And so we have those conversations in terms of actually timing around a rating. That will really depend on when it is needed or sometime before it is needed but nothing at this point in time is concrete. Jon Petersen : Okay. Thanks for the color. Thomas Ray : You bet. I just want to respond to the prior question or about the growth rates and escalators built into our contracts et cetera. I want to make sure we are clear. You could hear what we shared as \u2013 if you have 3% escalators on rent and you are getting four on your mark-to-market and how can you be getting any more than a point on power and interconnection, and I think that would be - if we\u2019ve led towards that I think we\u2019ve misled you guys. It has been an incorrect analysis. What is key inside the MMR per cab-e is we\u2019ve been adding a lot of wholesale into the mix over the last couple of years, so the escalators are in the smaller agreements and the wholesale is typically at a lower MMR per cab-e than the rest of our business. So I think in general when you see wholesale, a flag of wholesale coming in because of a round of new development but you are still seeing reasonable strength in the MMR per cab-e.  Generally speaking I think what you have is very solid strength in MMR per cab-e inside the transaction engine in the performance sensitive side of our business being diluted by wholesale. And so I just want to make sure we're super clear about the component of MMR per cab-e. It is a moving base with more wholesale having come in over the last couple of years and that has muted what you might have otherwise seen from the rest of the portfolio, escalators, cross connects, break or power et cetera. I just wanted to touch on that to make sure we are clear. Thomas Ray : So with that, I think we\u2019ll wrap it up and just want to say thank you to everybody for taking time with us on the call today and for following the company and working hard to understand what we're doing and where we're trying to go. We will keep working hard. We are very grateful for our people here at CoreSite to drive our success and for the customers to keep putting their faith in us. Thanks again, we will talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Ray : Good morning and welcome to our Q4 call. We\u2019re pleased to report continued execution of our business plan in the fourth quarter, delivering solid growth and finishing out 2015 as another strong year for our company. Looking at Q4, \u201815 over Q4 \u201814, we reported 31% growth and FFO per share driven by 25% growth in revenue and 32% growth in adjusted EBITDA. We continue to see solid margin performance with our calendar 2015 adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 51%. This represents an increase of 340 basis points over our margin in 2014. In addition to our solid financial results for the quarter, we finished 2015 and began 2016 with positive leasing momentum. Signing in the fourth quarter 155 new and expansion leases reflecting record transaction count for our company. We\u2019re pleased that in 2015, we increased transaction count each quarter with Q4 \u201815 signings more than 60% greater than the same period a year ago. We attribute this growth to three key factors. First: staffing across our sales and marketing teams were steady in 2015, being largely intact for more than a year now with minimal voluntary churn compared to 2014. Second: we made material improvements to our front-end technology systems in 2015, with the first phase of our technology systems investment focused upon our sales activities and launching to strong success in Q2 of this past year. Finally, we believe that enterprise adoption of cloud services, maybe seeing an inflexion point with an accelerating number of customers connecting to cloud providers across our portfolio. Regarding our interconnection services, interconnection revenues saw another quarter of solid growth at 26% over the prior year quarter, with calendar \u201815 reflecting 25% growth over 2014. And looking at interconnection volumes, Q4 results reflect a similar story to the rest of 2015 as compared to 2014. First, 2015 saw a continued decrease in lower priced copper cross-connection volume of 3% over 2014. Second: we saw a continued strong increase in cyber cross connections with 2015 recording 15.8% growth over \u201814. Finally, in 2015, we saw over 50% growth in interconnections made over our higher value logical interconnection product set comprised predominantly of our Any2 Internet Exchange, Blended IP and the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange. In looking at this shifting mix, we\u2019re pleased to see the sales mix in our interconnection products, points where the high bandwidth latency sensitive workloads we work to enable our platform to support. Related to this, we were pleased in 2015 to launch 100 gig service on our Any2 Exchange in both Los Angeles and Denver in direct response to articulated customer demand. We anticipate scaling our 100 gig platform across other markets in 2016 as our customers increasingly rely upon us to serve high bandwidth requirements. In addition to strong leasing and growth in interconnection revenue, in 2015, our company executed upon several key operational objectives we had for the year. First, 2015 marked the fifth consecutive year that we achieved Six 9s and portfolio wide-up time, providing our customers with the performance and the liability they need to run their mission critical applications and support performance centered workloads. Additionally, in 2015, we obtained ISO 27001 Certification for our Data Center Colocation services across all of our operating data centers. This certification underscores our focus around our information security controls and our commitment to providing our customers with secure, reliable and high-performance data center colocation solutions. ISO Certification joined the robust mix of additional operational certifications in areas of compliance support that our company brings to the world\u2019s most demanding enterprises including many among the Global 1000 which represents over 30% of our revenue. Finally, as previously mentioned, in 2015 we delivered the first operational phase of our investment in technology systems, designed to simplify our company for our customers and employees. Beyond enabling our sales and marketing teams to move faster and more efficiently, we successfully laid the building block to support to further technology improvements across our company, many of which are currently in-flight and targeted to become operational in 2016. In summary, we are pleased with the operational advancements our team has made across our company in 2015. And even more strongly encouraged about the prospect of further advancement over this coming year. I\u2019ll now move on to provide an update on our outlook for our key markets. With regard to the performance sensitive market segment, we remain encouraged by the demand we\u2019ve been seen across our platform and we believe the trends we\u2019ve seen will remain favorable throughout the coming year and beyond. Regarding the wholesale market segment, current activity in the market suggest to us that the first half of 2016 maybe as favorable as 2015 in terms of growth absorption with upside regarding rental rates in select markets due to a more favorable balance between supply and demand. We believe we have less visibility into demand for the second half of 2016 and we\u2019ll continue to closely monitor demand dynamics as we progress through the year. Regarding our expansion activities, 2015 marked another year of significant capital investment for our company, specifically we invested $133 million in expansion capital during the year, completing construction of 185,000 net rentable square feet across our markets. At year-end, we had a number of additional projects underway which will increase our footprint by 370,000 square feet including two new buildings in the Bay area, additional capacity at VA2 in Northern Virginia, further build-out of LA2 in Los Angeles and expansion at BO1 in Boston. We estimate all of this capacity will be placed into service by the middle of 2016. The largest among our investments currently underway in the largest ground-up data center development in our history is our 230,000-square foot ft.7 project in Santa Clara. We are encouraged by current supply demand dynamics in the Bay area, and we believe that wholesale rents have returned to equilibrium increasing over 20% from the trough five years ago. With more rational and healthy rents now in the market for larger requirements, we are hopeful that we will bring ft.7 to market at a favorable time. As a reminder, our first phase of TKD delivery at ft.7 comprises 80,000 square feet and with 48% pre-leased to an anchor customer as of December 31, 2015. Turning to Northern Virginia, although there is ample supply in the market, demand remains steady and we saw solid leasing momentum at our Reston campus during 2015. We are now under construction at VA2 to convert the remaining 96,000 square feet of shell space into TKD capacity, which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2016. This capacity is currently 24% pre-leased. In Los Angeles, leasing activity across our campus has been robust with particular strength at LA2, where stabilized occupancy increased 120 basis points to 90% in Q4 compared to Q3. In light of the steady demand we\u2019re seeing in the market, in Q4 we commence construction of incremental capacity at LA2, which we expect to substantially complete during the first half of 2016. In summary, we\u2019re pleased with our financial and operational performance in 2015, and we remain focused upon executing our business plan. We believe that we are making important investments to support the future growth and continued evolution of our company, and that our national platform continues to grow in its ability to demonstrate added value to our customers. We entered 2016 with high morale and high energy and we will work hard to further strengthen CoreSite\u2019s position in nourishing key communities of interest and bringing differentiated value to the market. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith : Thanks Tom. I\u2019d like to start by reviewing our sales activity during the quarter. Q4, new and expansion sales totaled $8.9 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 42,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $211 per square foot of TKD capacity. As it relates to pricing, the Q4 rental rates of $211 per square foot represents a 44% increase over the average rental rate over the first three quarters of this year. Most of this increase was driven by increased power density in Q4. When adjusted for power density, our Q4 rental rates represents an 8% increase over the first three quarters of this year. While we have seen demand for high density requirements increase over time, this quarter was uniquely heavy in its way and therefore does not represent a marked change in our projected outlook. Overall, our Q4 and 2015 sales results reflect our broad appeal across our key U.S. markets as well as the progress our sales organization is making in targeted industry verticals. At the new and expansion transaction counts, we continue to see steady progress against our goal of increasing quarterly volume, with a specific focus on targeting small customer requirements. Regarding Q4, we executed a new company record of 155 new and expansion leases for TKD capacity. In terms of size distribution, 147 leases were for smaller requirements of less than 1,000 square feet, seven leases were for mid-sized requirements of 1,000 and 5,000 square feet and one lease was for 8,300 square feet for an average of lease size signed in the quarter of 272 square feet. Importantly, Q4 leasing represents continued strengthening in our transaction engine producing smaller leases, correlating to a 7% increase and a number of leases smaller than 1,000 square feet compared to Q3 and a 36% increase over the average of the trailing four quarters. Looking more broadly at our leasing results for all of 2015, we had a strong year across all metrics. Regarding new and expansion sales, we signed a record 526 leases totaling 404,000 net rentable square feet correlating to $46 million in annualized GAAP rent. The $46 million in GAAP rent leased reflects an increase of 39% over 2014 and represents the highest level of rents signed in our history. Related, we continue to make good progress in diversifying our customer base and enhancing the value of our communities of interest across the portfolio. In Q4, we added net new logos and cumulatively added 95 net new logos in 2015. This represents an increase of 16% compared to the number of new logos added in 2014. Among the logos, there were new to our base in Q4, 63% were in the enterprise vertical. As such, we continue to focus on enhancing the long-term value created in our data centers by the high quality of customers and applications attracted to our national platform and global customer base. In addition to strengthen new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q4 was solid as renewals totaled approximately 50,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $204 per square foot reflecting mark-to-market growth of 3.8% on a cash basis and 6.7% on a GAAP basis. On a full-year basis, cash rent growth was 4.6% in-line with our guidance of 4% to 5%. Q4 churn was 2.3% in the fourth quarter and includes the reduction in annualized rent of $2.6 million or 150 basis points of churn related to the original full-building customer at SV3 of which we\u2019ve been forecasting throughout the year. For all of 2015, churn was 7.5% below our guidance of 8% to 9%, and adjusting for the SV3 customer, it was 6%. Regarding vertical mix, during Q4, networking cloud deployments accounted for 46% of new and expansion leases signed. Within the network vertical we saw solid performance across our national platform with particular strength at our Reston campus, with new network deployments from six carriers including both domestic and international providers, as well as the completion of new fiber builds by two large providers. We believe these key wins highlight the continued interest in growth of the network ecosystem, we have dealt at a competitive enterprise alternative to the Ashburn market. Differently, in a cloud vertical, we continue to see strong demand for small ecosystem cloud services around the big cloud deployments across our platform, reinforcing our belief that the large cloud providers will continue to attract incremental customers and support future enterprise adoption. Additionally in Q4, we executed a new network edge node deployment for major file sharing platform at our LA campus, remaining positive about good momentum we have built around our cloud offerings in our portfolio in a variety of options for connectivity and diversity we provide our customers. Turning to our enterprise vertical, leasing in Q4 was strong again, with this vertical accounting for 54% of new and expansion leases signed in the quarter. Strength in this segment was led by digital content and other general enterprises. We signed 35 new logos in the enterprise vertical including a large international global asset management company for multi-market deployment with a leading provider of technology products and services and a leading social media platform. For the full year of 2015, we continue to see strong leasing momentum across both our network and cloud verticals as defined by transaction volumes as well as the type of deployments we\u2019ve been able to attract, increasing the value of our network dense in cloud enabled data centers. Specifically in 2015, the number of new and expansion leases signed in our networking cloud verticals accounted for 48% of leases signed, and we ended the year with more than 300 network service providers and more than 200 cloud providers across our platform. Also in 2015, we saw solid enterprise momentum with broad-based strength across a number of industries and verticals including digital content, healthcare and financial services. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases in Q4 were Los Angeles, the Bay area, Chicago and Northern Virginia, D.C. Together, these four markets accounted for 80% of the new and expansion leases signed in Q4 and 95% of our annualized GAAP rent in the quarter. In Los Angeles, we continue to see consistent demand and leasing continues to be well distributed between the two buildings comprising our One Wilshire campus. In terms of verticals, digital content remains solid accounting for 40% of leases executed in LA, while networking cloud deployments represented 48% of leases in LA in Q4. Stabilized occupancy across the LA campus was 89.3% at the end of Q4, an increase of 280 basis points compared to Q3, driven by increases at both LA1 and LA2. Absorption in the Bay area has been remarkably strong in 2015, and the fourth quarter was no exception as demand from the networking cloud verticals accounted for approximately half of the new and expansion leases executed in this market, with general enterprises falling closely behind. Stabilized occupancy across this market is now approaching 95%, while our Santa Clara campus is now 97% occupied. With limited supply in the market and the outlook for continued strong absorption, we are very encouraged for the opportunity regarding our investment in SV7. We expect 80,000 square feet of TKD capacity of Phase 1 to be completed in the middle of this year. In Chicago, leasing was driven by the enterprise vertical including a multi-market lease with global technology services organization. In addition, we saw demand from the digital content and network verticals, stabilized occupancy at CH1 is now almost 92% while our recently completed pre-stabilized phase is now 80% leased and occupied. As we discussed last quarter, in the New York, New Jersey market, we saw an up-tick in funnel volume but we have not seen that translate into net absorption. For the year, net absorption in this market was in line with the prior three-year average but significantly below the 2014 level, primarily driven by lower demand for wholesale requirements. In 2015, we did continue to see solid demand for smaller deployments as well as good enterprise penetration. In Q4, we executed 10 leases at NY2 all under 1,000 square feet including seven new logos. Of those leases, 70% were in the enterprise vertical. In addition to enterprise, we continue to focus on building the network and cloud density of our NY campus. To that end, we now cap 24 networks available at NY2 and our seamless connection to the carriers in cloud that NY1 continues to drive demand between the two locations. In Q4, we also completed another new fiber build into NY2 from a leading global network enhancing our ability to serve enterprise and contact companies in this market. Lastly, in Northern Virginia, D.C. leasing was strong at VA1, which accounted for the majority of signings in this market during Q4. Network and cloud deployments accounted for nearly 40% of new and expansion leasing, with stabilized occupancy at 92.5% at VA1, we look forward to delivering the new capacity associated with phases 3 and 4 at VA2 in Q1 and believe that will be well timed to meet market demand. In summary, we closed out 2015 with solid momentum and will continue to focus on executing against our stated targets as we go into 2016. We will continue to enhance the diversity and value of our platform while continuing to provide our customers with superior customer service. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. A - Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. I\u2019ll begin my remarks today by reviewing our Q4 financial results. Second, I will update you on our development CapEx and our balance sheet and liquidity capacity and third, I will introduce our guidance for the year. Q4 financial results were strong with total operating revenues of $90.9 million, a 5.3% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 25.4% increase over the prior year quarter. Q4 operating revenue consisted of $74.7 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 5.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 26.4% year-over-year. $12 million from interconnection revenue, an increase of 5.5% on a sequential quarter basis and 26.1% year-over-year and $2.2 million from tenant reimbursement and other revenues. Office and light industrial revenue was $1.9 million. Q4 FFO was $0.80 per diluted share in unit, an increase of 8.1% on a sequential quarter basis and a 31.1% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $47.7 million increased 9.2% on a sequential quarter basis and 31.5% over the same quarter last year. Related, for the full-year 2015, our revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO was 66% and 54% respectively adjusted for unusual items in 2014. Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter totaled $4.1 million or 4.5% of total operating revenues. For the full-year, sales and marketing expenses correlated to 4.8% of total operating revenues, 50 basis points below the 2014 level and slightly below the low-end of our guidance range. General and administrative expenses were $9.7 million dollars in Q4 correlating to 10.7% of total operating revenues. For the full-year, G&A expenses correlated to 10.3% of total operating revenues in-line with our guidance. Regarding our same store metrics, Q4 same store turn-key data center occupancy increased 770 basis points to 87.9% from 80.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, same store MRR per cabinet equivalent increased 3.2% year-over-year and 1.2% sequentially to $1,459. In Q4, two rooms of 18,000 square feet each at NY2 moved into the stabilized operating pool as both rooms exceeded 85% occupancy. As we have discussed previously, we define stabilization as the earlier to occur between 85% occupancy in 24 months after an asset is placed into service. Lastly, we commenced 54,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $172 per square foot which represents $9.3 million of annualized GAAP rent. We ended the fourth quarter and full-year 2015 with our stabilized data center occupancy increasing 510 basis points to 92.5% compared to 87.4% at the end of 2014. 390 of the 510-basis point increase was driven by lease commencements over the trialing year. The remaining 120 of the 510-basis point increase reflects Q4 \u201815 adjustments to factors we use to convert cage usable square feet to net rentable square feet based primarily upon three elements, namely, estimated cage usable square feet, critical power consumption and the associated cooling relative to the data center\u2019s capacity. From this evaluation, we adjust our conversion factors and the resulting occupancy based on the limiting resource of space, power or cooling. Turning now to backlog, projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $15.9 million as of December 31, 2015 or $27.2 million on a cash basis. We expect nearly 60% or $9.1 million of the GAAP backlog to commence in the first half of 2016, which includes rent associated with the powered shell built to suit at SV6. Another 21% is expected to commence in the back half of 2016, which includes a portion of the rent associated with the SV7 pre-lease. Turning to our development activity in the fourth quarter, we had a total of 370,000 square feet of capacity under construction consisting of both turnkey data center and power shell space. In addition, we have deferred capital projects under construction which relate to operating data-center square feet previously constructed and placed into service that following development completion requires incremental capital when a customer\u2019s density or space requirements exceed our initial development. We estimate a total investment of $211 million is required to complete these projects of which $86.2 million had been incurred at the end of Q4. These amounts are comprised of the following projects. In Santa Clara, we had 80,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity plus 150,000 square feet of power shell under construction at SV7. As of December 31, 2015, we had incurred $23.8 million of the estimated $110 million required to complete this project and expect to complete construction of Phase 1 near mid-year of 2016. Also on Santa Clara, we had 136,580 square feet of build-to-suit powered shell at SV6. As of the end of Q4, we had incurred $18.1 million of the estimated $30 million required to complete the development and we expect to complete it late in Q1 or early in Q2 of 2016. In Northern Virginia, we had 96,000 square feet of data center space under construction in Phase 3 and Phase 4 at VA2, and had incurred $22 million of the estimated $32.5 million required to complete these projects. We expect to complete construction of both Phase 3 and Phase 4 during the first quarter of 2016. In Boston, we had 14,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity under construction at BO1. At the end of Q4, we had incurred $9.4 million of the estimated $11 million required to complete this project and expect to complete construction in Q1. Finally, in Los Angeles, we commenced construction of 43,000 square feet at LA2 and had incurred $7.6 million of the estimated $18 million required to complete this process. Construction at LA2 is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. Moving on to other CapEx matter. This quarter, we had added disclosures in our earnings supplemental regarding potential deferred capital projects and expenses. While we have historically disclosed the expenditures related to these projects and our guidance regarding capital expenditures and data center expansion, the timing at which we make some portion of these investments can be uncertain. And in some cases, ultimately we may not invest a portion of the total cost that we initially disclosed as being associated with a given expansion project. Regarding these projects, at times, we do not complete the full build-out of new data center infrastructure to deliver all power and cooling capacity in accordance with our full design. And rather defer investment of a component of planned capital until customer utilization warrants such investment. Once a project is substantially complete, we define as deferred expansion capital, the difference between the amount, of capital then invested and the amount of capital we estimate would be required to fully build out this space in accordance with full build-out depending upon our assessment of future customer requirements and our plans to add capacity to our data centers. Again, the timing by which we might invest in deferred expansion capital and in fact whether we ultimately invested at all is subject to uncertainty based upon customer utilization. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had deferred expansion capital projects under construction in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and the Bay area, which should all be completed during the first quarter of 2016. We estimate the total cost of these projects to be $9.5 million as reflected on Page 20 of the Q4 earnings supplemental. On Page 21, we have provided an estimated range of longer term deferred expansion capital. We currently estimate this amount to be $30 million to $40 million, if, when and to the extent we determine that we will commence construction on any project representing any portion of deferred expansion capital, we will update our disclosures and add it to our current projects under construction reflecting the project as a deferred expansion capital project. As a reminder, when we complete development projects, we realize a reduction in our run rate of the capitalization of interest, real-estate taxes and insurance resulting in a corresponding increase in operating expense. As shown on Page 23 of the supplemental, the percentage of interest capitalized in Q4 was 29% and for the full-year it was 34%, in line with our estimate. For 2016, we expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be between 15% and 25%, weighted towards the first half of the year based on our current outlook and the development pipeline. We forecasted this reduction in capitalized interest what correlate to an increase of interest expense of $1.5 million or $0.03 per share of reduction in FFO in 2016. Turning to our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2015, our ratio of net principle debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA was two times, including preferred stock ratio was 2.6 times, below our stated target ratio of approximately four times. This correlates to incremental debt capacity of $264 million at December 31, 2015 based upon Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we entered into a new five-year $100 million term loan by exercising a portion of the accordion under our $500 million senior unsecured credit facility. We used the term loan proceeds to pay down a portion of the balance on the existing revolving credit facility as well as for general corporate purposes. The execution of this incremental $100 million term loan further extends and staggers our debt maturity profile and increases our liquidity to support our business objectives and fund growth. To that point, following the execution of the term loan, we have approximately $300 million of available liquidity which is more than sufficient to fund our current development plans. As it relates to our dividend, during the fourth quarter, we announced an increase in our dividend to $0.53 per share on a quarterly basis or $2.12 per share on an annual basis, a 26% increase over the prior year. This dividend rate equals 62% of the mid-point of our FFO per share guidance, in-line with our historical FFO payout ratio which has been in the range of 59% to 63%. Historically and again in 2015, the composition of our dividend has been 100% ordinary income, due to the Carlisle conversions in April and October 2015, and the associated increase of tax expense from the conversions, some portion of our 2016 dividend maybe a return of capital. As always, we remain focused on maintaining our dividend payout levels to comply with our REIT requirements, balance with our opportunity to retain cash to invest in future growth. And now, in closing, I\u2019d like to address guidance for 2016. I would remind you that our guidance is based on our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes on our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we\u2019ve discussed today. As detailed on page 25 of our Q4 earnings supplemental, our guidance for 2016 is as follows. FFO per share in OP unit is estimated to be $3.37 to $3.47. This implies 20% year-over-year FFO growth based on the mid-point of the range and the $2.86 per share we reported in 2015. Total operating revenue is estimated to be $380 million to $396 million. Based on the mid-point of guidance, this implies 16% year-over-year revenue growth. As it relates to interconnection revenue growth, we expect that 2016 growth rate to be between 15% and 17% which is more closely aligned with overall volume growth. General and administrative expenses are estimated to be $35 million to $37 million or approximately 9.3% of total operating revenue. This correlates to a 5% increase in G&A expenses over 2015 reflecting our efforts to scale our business and operate it more efficiently. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $196 million to $202 million. This correlates to 17% year-over-year growth based on the mid-point of the range and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 51%. Last quarter, we noted our expectation for moderation in the rate of expansion of our adjusted EBITDA margin primarily due to product mix. Our guidance suggest that relatively flat margin compared to full-year 2015 reflecting the volume of larger leases signed over the trialing 12-month period as well as the increase in metered power associated with these deployments. The significant drivers of this guidance are as follows. Estimated annual churn rate of 6% to 8% for 2016, keep in mind that we expect an elevated level of churn in the second quarter of 2016, due to another portion of rent associated with the original full-building customer at SV3 expiring. The amount is equal to $1.9 million in annualized rent or an incremental 90 basis points of churn. Cash rent growth on our data center renewals is estimated to be 3% to 5% for the full year. Total capital expenditures are expected to be $210 million to $240 million. The components are comprised of data center expansion cost, estimated to be $185 million to $200 million, this includes the expansion capital related to the final phases of VA2, the build-out of both SV6 and SV7 as well as incremental turnkey data center capacity across the portfolio as needed. Non-recurring investments are estimated to be $15 million to $20 million, and include amounts related to our IT initiatives, facilities upgrades and other capital expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures and tenant improvements are each estimated to be $5 million to $10 million. Now, we\u2019d like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from the line of Jonathan [sic] Schildkraut with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Schildkraut : You can call me Thomas. But, listen, a couple of questions here, I guess, first, Tom, you mentioned in both the press release and in your prepared comments some of the momentum from \u201815 as continued into the early part of the year. And I guess that sort of asks us to ask you precisely what you\u2019re seeing in the early part of the year and for a little bit more color. And then, sort of a second question, one of the things that Tom, you and I have talked about historically has been sort of the increase in the average sort of size of the performance sensitive deals that were coming in. Now, you guys report on square feet and I think our conversation was more about power density. And so, I was wondering if you might give us little sort of color around that and maybe what some of the drivers are if it is in fact still recurring? Thanks. Tom Ray : Sure, I\u2019m going to take the first and give Steve the second. On the - that\u2019s the second, the first was markets. Yes, Jonathan, I think what we\u2019re trying to make clear is we see continued firm demand in the funnel right now, pretty consistent with last year. As always, three or four quarters out, it\u2019s harder to see and there is certainly lot more chop in the macro environment right now. So, we\u2019ll be paying attention to where, to signs around longer term demand. But what we see right now is a good steady funnel in-line with that of last year. And that\u2019s it, there is no other message than that. Jonathan Schildkraut : All right, great. And then, on the sort of average size of the performance sensitive deployments that you\u2019re seeing? Steve Smith : Yes, this is Steve. As far as performance sensitive I think that can cover a broad range, anywhere from network providers to some of the more financial institutions, some of those that are very more inter-parted base. But have a latency since the requirement. And we\u2019ve seen increases across the board for more performance sensitive type of requirements. But I would say, as far as how that shows up as far as deal size is concerned, I think deal size has remained relatively consistently. As I pointed out in my comments, earlier in the call, we have seen density requirements increase over time. This quarter was uniquely heavy in its weighting. But we have seen equipment providers come out with you that is requiring more power and more cooling. And that\u2019s just to drive some of this heavy workloads. Jonathan Schildkraut : Great, I\u2019ll circle back into the queue. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Dave Rodgers from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, it\u2019s Stephen Dye [ph] here with Dave. What are the prospects for interconnection growth in 2016? 2015 you saw a keep-up with the recent trend and you\u2019ve discussed on past calls just in general the network density improving. Can we expect more of the same in 2016? Steve Smith : Well, we\u2019ve been consistent, in the past couple of years seeing that it at some point revenue growth is going to start to converge with unit count growth plus maybe there is 2% or 3% annual pricing bump on top of that. But what we pay most attention to is the rate of our fiber growth and our fiber growth is kind of been in that 16% to 18% range, more up in the not. And we don\u2019t know exactly when that revenue growth trend is going to converge closer to that unit cap growth trend. But we do believe that that\u2019s likely and I don\u2019t know, if you think of that happening over a few years that\u2019s probably not a bad way to model. Tom Ray : And Steve, and the only thing I would add to that is, right towards the end of my prepared remarks I did give some color around revenue growth in 2016 specifically unrecognized when we, I simply said we expected to be somewhere between 15% to 17% revenue growth in \u201816 largely due to what Tom just talked about. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. And then, for G&A in 2016, we think a similar pattern in terms of seasonality as 2015, I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense on that going forward given a bit of a bump in 4Q. Tom Ray : Yes, Stephen [ph], I think just address me with a bump in the fourth quarter as you get a chance to read this supplemental. Inside there you\u2019ll see that we ended up recording about $1.75 million in the fourth quarter. It was specifically associated with two legal issues that we are dealing with, we talked briefly about it in the third quarter call. That amount was expensed during the fourth quarter. And as we sit here today, we\u2019re estimating on those two cases that we expect to resolve them for somewhere between zero and $3 million. We\u2019ve accrued $2.7 million as we sit here today, which we\u2019re comfortable with. But as we move forward into 2016, we\u2019re obviously incurring some level of legal expenses on a quarterly basis just to defend those suits. But that gives you the spike in the fourth quarter of \u201815. Steve Smith : I think in general it\u2019s probably reasonable to straight line. Tom Ray : Yes, I think it\u2019s fairly flat as you think about it for 2016. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Can you expand on the inflexion point Tom that you commented on regarding enterprise adoption of the cloud in your prepared remarks, you generally not prone type pre-release. So what specifically are you seeing? Tom Ray : Well, there are two things that are behind that comment, one is funnel, and so perhaps there is more high-probably that might be our norm. But the funnel is to us demonstrably showing more interest in connecting to cloud. But second, we try not to just talk about the funnel and hopes and dreams and wishes. So, our interconnections to cloud and enterprise customers, over the last two years have increased meaningfully, that growth rate has increased meaningfully relative to interconnections to all other providers. And we saw a further increase in the slope of that line in 2015 over \u201814. So, we\u2019re really just tracking the growth of interconnections involving enterprise and cloud customers. And that growth rate has increased very measurably over the last two years and that rate of increase accelerated over the trailing 12 months. And the pace of that acceleration causes us to say, we\u2019ve been saying for some time, it\u2019s early days, it\u2019s very early we\u2019re working off of very small numbers. We\u2019re still working off of relatively small numbers related to the cloud but not miniscule any longer. And the growth rate continues to accelerate. So, that has a saying, something is strengthening around that cloud vertical. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Now, can you bridge that comment and sentiment around the slowdown in the interconnection growth, I realize that question was just asked. But you\u2019re going from 26% year-over-year in the quarter to 16% for next year, and there seems to be a disconnect there. Tom Ray : Well, I think you just see less growth in unit pricing going forward. We\u2019ll see how we\u2019re able to navigate through that and we\u2019ve also been clear that we\u2019re seeing growth in higher priced interconnection products and contraction obviously in the lower priced copper products. And the highest pricing among all of our products is within a logical interconnection set. That has the highest growth rate. So, look, we\u2019re going to hope to drive strengthening enterprise adoption around the higher priced product set and see where that takes us in terms of revenue growth. But it\u2019s really too early to tell. And we wanted to put out there some numbers that we felt good about people modeling. Jordan Sadler : It\u2019s great, thank you. Can you give us the latest on Cross Connect and the portfolio? Steve Smith : We\u2019re just over 20,000. Jeff Finnin : Yes, we disclosed last quarter, Jordan, it was over 20,000, and it\u2019s consistent with where we are today obviously. Jordan Sadler : Still over 20,000, excellent. Thank you. Steve Smith : Yes. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question today is coming from Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Jon Petersen : Great, thank you. I just wanted to touch on future development. I mean, I guess the first thing was NY2, you guys have done a great job of leasing up the first couple of phases there. It\u2019s at 95% now. But they\u2019ve got nothing in the pipeline, so I\u2019m curious when we see phases 3 through 5 start to enter the construction phase? Tom Ray : It\u2019s all dependent on leasing. And the bottom-line is, we are, as I think most of the industry is now very good at building in modular fashion and assets delivering new inventory fairly rapidly. We tend to think of the ability to deliver new product in existing Core and Shell in a range of 60 to 90 days. So, we just don\u2019t know. And when we have clear absorption, you\u2019ll see more space enter into the development pipeline. But there is no reason to point the bat around that right now and we\u2019ll see where demand takes us. Jon Petersen : So, I mean, so are you saying that you are pretty confident you\u2019ll be able to pre-lease it before you start construction or like the significant portion of it, is that what you\u2019re waiting for to 95%? Tom Ray : Not at all. We\u2019re just saying, we can build very rapidly so we\u2019d like to continue to push occupancy pretty high. And that\u2019s it, we\u2019re not saying anything more or less than that. Jon Petersen : Okay. Steve Smith : This is Steve, just to give you a little bit more color around that. As we went through in the earlier remarks, we\u2019re seeing a lot better transaction around the enterprise phase and those smaller individual deployments which does allow us to drive greater density before we\u2019re, having to fill that additional capacity. So that\u2019s what really allows us to kind of push the envelope further there where we\u2019ve had little bit lighter absorption relative to wholesale which I think is. Tom Ray : It\u2019s lumpy. Steve Smith : It\u2019s lumpy and that\u2019s really indicative of the market in that area. Jon Petersen : Okay. And then just one more question on future developments, so I\u2019m just looking at page 21, the hope for development. You guys are pretty much maxed out in Chicago, and once you finish Northern Virginia, you kind of maxed out. But once you finish VA2, this seems like you maxed out there. So, I guess, what\u2019s the plan for future expansion of market? Steve Smith : We\u2019re aware of both of those facts and are thinking accordingly. Jon Petersen : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Barry McCarver from Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Brian Hawthorne : Hi, this is Brian Hawthorne filling in for Barry McCarver. And first question, can you talk about the growth that comes from current customers versus new customers? Tom Ray : You want to answer that Jeff? Jeff Finnin : Yes, I think in general, it varies a little bit from quarter to quarter. But when you look at the volume of leases and Steve commented a little bit in terms of the logos. But as you look at it from a rents perspective, I think historically we have been around 20% has come from new in any given quarter and the other of it is coming from the existing customers. Steve Smith : And that seems to have kind of stabilized out over the last couple of years, it\u2019s pretty consistent since we\u2019ve reached a level of mass. Jeff Finnin : Yes. Brian Hawthorne : Okay. And then, on the pricing, you talked about on the new expansion leases is going to be little bit higher, it\u2019s going to be lot higher this quarter, but that was driven by power. I guess, kind of how should we think about that then going forward through this year and kind of how much of that was driven by power? Tom Ray : Well, as Steve said, on a power adjusted basis, we saw the rent in Q4 up about 8% over the trial. So, what, in general, the markets are healthier, we\u2019re seeing reasonable rent growth, in some markets more so than others. But things are healthier, we\u2019re expecting yields to go up a bit this year. And that\u2019s it. Brian Hawthorne : All right, thank you guys. Jeff Finnin : Thanks Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Rashim [ph] in for Jon. Can you update us on the strategic front and internationally do you feel it would benefit you to enter Europe? And then domestically, it seems a number of your public and private peers are entering new markets. Is this something you also feel inclined to do more or less? Thanks. Tom Ray : Sure, no change really to what we were saying for a long, long, long time. On the margin, we see some value and greater reach, greater breadth in terms of serving the customer, we see some value and scale in terms of internal operations. But we do believe that our existing platform has appropriate and very meaningful reach in North America which we view as a very big vibrant market. And so, we believe we\u2019re highly effective in increasing the value of our business, doing just what we\u2019ve been doing. And that sets a baseline, that belief and that expectation around growth and earnings sets a baseline against which we compare any other activities. And we do look, we do pay attention, we\u2019re the hardworking pragmatic people. We don\u2019t have any natural aversion or drive to grow for growth sake. The growth that we want to see is in earnings per share for the common shareholder, that\u2019s where we focus. And we don\u2019t anticipate that changing one bit. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matthew Heinz from Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Heinz : Thank you, good afternoon. Regarding the footnote disclosure on your third largest customer in the customer table. So, I was wondering if you could give us a bit more detail around the product mix of their deployments as well as your expectations for mark-to-market and then kind of the contribution for the expected churn there in your overall churn guidance? Steve Smith : Sure, I\u2019m just going to give you get some color from a sales perspective. That customer continues to mature with us, frankly, we\u2019ve seen them level out to some degree as far as their overall growth release within our portfolio. And we continue to look at how we can evolve that relationship. But overall it\u2019s stable and it\u2019s continuing to evolve. Tom Ray : Let me just give you some color Matt, I guess on the churn and the mark-to-market. Obviously, both of those numbers that we\u2019ve given for guidance reflect where we think that customer will ultimately end up as it relates to lease renewals as well as some churn. We do expect some churn to result. But we\u2019re still working with the customer and we anticipate some of that in the back half of the year. But again, those amounts are included in our annual guidance as it relates to both churn and the mark-to-market. Steve Smith : And I\u2019d say, that customer is very widely distributed across our portfolio, in a lot of different locations, in lot of different leases with a lot of different expiration dates. And the churn and mark-to-market are related. And we just, as everybody has pointed out, there are some markets where we\u2019re not sitting on a bunch of vacant space. And we\u2019re not inclined to, we\u2019re here to drive the returns on our investment and there will be times when that will contribute to churn. If we believe that we should, we paid more for space in certain markets or is there another set of customers, we\u2019ll create more value for our shareholders than you can expect to see churn in those markets. And we think that\u2019s just to divine and often good. Matthew Heinz : Okay, that\u2019s helpful commentary. Thank you. And then, if I could just follow-up one more on the interconnection piece. I guess, it seems like there has been about six or seven points of call it pricing or mix growth, that\u2019s benefited revenues versus what you site as fiber volumes in the last several quarters. And I suppose the 2016 guide kind of implies that that goes away. I guess, I\u2019m just looking for a little more color on, is it the mix of copper and fiber and that transition is largely over with or is it just kind of that you\u2019ve sort of reached the plateau in terms of how you can price fiber? Thanks. Tom Ray : I just think the upside on fiber pricing is less than it was a couple of years ago. Matthew Heinz : Okay, so, less driven by mix, transitioning more to fiber from copper? Tom Ray : Yes, I mean, look, the mix continues to support, and we believe the mix will continue to support revenue growth exceeding interconnection, total interconnection growth, because the mix is increasingly at a higher revenue per unit, pointed toward more units that are higher revenue per unit. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve moved our pricing closer to where we\u2019ve seen market, I think we deeply discounted the market, handful of years ago, we\u2019ve moved that up. I think we\u2019re still below that of probably the two larger interconnection incumbent. So we feel like there is still room but less though than before. And we don\u2019t expect to lean in on pricing as heavily in the next year as we did in some of the past years. Matthew Heinz : Okay, thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it. Jeff Finnin : Thanks Matt. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Manny Korchman from Citi. Please proceed with your question. Manny Korchman : Hi Jeff, just a quick one for you. The impairment of internal used software that you guys took in the quarter, is that related to the same software package that you\u2019ve taken impairments on in the past and if so, are we sort of done with those and that\u2019s a product that you just, or a project that you just shelved at this point? Tom Ray : I\u2019ll hit it Jeff, I mean, I own that step. That right up in Q4 was from a new initiative this year that we drew or drive well on. That\u2019s fixed, we\u2019ve got, as we\u2019ve said and as I said in my remarks, the technology platform we delivered in Q2, really focused on sales and marketing, the front-end of our business went very, very, very well. Also during \u201815, we started several other technology projects internally that are leveraging off of that Q2 delivery, one of those we pulled the plug on this year in Q4. Then we\u2019re going to take a different approach on it. So that\u2019s it. Manny Korchman : Thanks Tom. Tom Ray : Yes. Jeff Finnin : Thanks Manny. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Colby Synesael : Great, I have two. So just wanted to go back initially to, I think it might have been in Jonathan\u2019s question to start off. You mentioned in your prepared remarks you had better visibility on the retail oriented or small deployment type product. And you said you felt that guidance or the visibility was good through the course, you thought that the demand wouldn\u2019t perspective be similar to what you saw in 2015. But you said for wholesale you only had good visibility through I think the first half of this year. Can you just kind of walk us through, why you might have better visibility on the smaller retail part versus wholesale? I would think that the lead times that are required for wholesale that might have actually been flipped. And then I also have a question on AFFO, I know you don\u2019t give guidance for AFFO, but I was wondering if you guys can give us some color on your expectation there particularly that might relate to the straight line rent adjustment line item as well as capitalized leasing commissions? Thank you. Steve Smith : Hi, this is Steve, maybe I\u2019ll just take the first part of that question relative to pipeline strength and momentum coming into 2016. As far as the retail business is concerned, that tends to be more of a run rate type of business. So, as we look at how we finish the year and coming into 2016, we\u2019re just looking at the overall pipeline, it seems to be more consistent. As far as distance and visibility into the future, that can change these types of market conditions and everything else, right. So, that\u2019s TBD, I think as far as overall long-term 2016 view is concerned but overall pipeline and run-rate seems to be in line. Relative to wholesale, I think those type of opportunities do have a bit more I would call it six-months\u2019 worth of visibility. You do see those opportunity that take a little bit longer sales cycle, those kind of customers are a little bit more pragmatic and thoughtful about their planning and when they look to deploy. So that just gives us a little bit better visibility as to at least the next six months. Colby Synesael : I guess, the point there that was that, your comments you have better visibility on retail versus wholesale isn\u2019t necessarily a reflection of trends in the market as much as a function those types of specific services? Tom Ray : Yes, I mean, it\u2019s Tom, but look, retail, certainly for the performance sensitive and the colocation absorption in our business has been remarkably consistent for years and years and years. And we\u2019ve I think obtained a degree of comfort that that will continue in large measure for certainly for the next 12 months, we\u2019re giving visibility for a year around that and it feels very solid. And on the wholesale side, you\u2019re right, there are deals in the market and lots of people indicating the need space. Forgive us for being old and Maudlinly after living through several cycles, you just never know. So we just won\u2019t point the bat too far into the future around wholesale. You just never know. So, we\u2019re going to pay attention like we always do. Jeff Finnin : Yes, on your second question, just to give you some historical thoughts, you\u2019re right, we don\u2019t guide to AFFO. But if you just look at where we\u2019ve been over the past several years as a public company, our AFFO, it does become a little volatile, just it largely depends on leasing commissions as well as straight line rent as you point it out. I think if you look at us historically, we\u2019ve been, our AFFO as a percentage of FFO has been anywhere between 80%, to 85%, I think that\u2019s a good range to use as you think about modeling it for 2016. And then specifically around straight-line rent, straight-line rent increased during 2015 and that\u2019s largely due to some of the wholesale larger deployments we saw which typically have ran some and as a result have a greater proportion of straight-line rents associated with them. We would expect that number to come down and moderate slightly in 2016 just due to those ramping in the cash continuing to be paid, and the straight line amount decreasing. Secondly, on leasing commissions, you could see obviously the amount we paid in 2015 being about $21.5 million, we would expect that to moderate meaningfully in 2016, again what drives that are larger wholesale deployments. And we would expect that to be down in 2016 just due to the deployments we\u2019re selling in - anticipate selling in 2016 versus what we did last year. Tom Ray : But that\u2019s where the uncertainty is. Jeff Finnin : Yes, that\u2019s really where there uncertainty is. Tom Ray : Instant commissions. Jeff Finnin : Yes, absolutely, that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to be driven by what we sell. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. And congratulations on the results. Tom Ray : Thank you. Jeff Finnin : Thanks Colby. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Sadler : Thanks, I just wanted to come back to the availability of product that was touched on Chicago, Northern Virginia, potentially Santa Clara, you\u2019ve got some there now. But if you sign some of these, so this is kind of two parts, one if you opportunistically sign some of these wholesale tenants that are in the market, I would imagine some of this availability would dissipate even quicker potentially. So, one: I\u2019m curious about that appetite to sign the wholesale guys versus the smaller retail tenants. And then separately, do you see opportunity to do new De Novo builds out there given land pricing in those markets? Tom Ray : Well, that\u2019s the first, our appetite for wholesale, it\u2019s just driven by spot market pricing. There is no more magic to it than that. And again, we would lean more heavily when we have a lot of new inventory. How we think about that, hasn\u2019t changed over all the years. As we talked about it a minute ago, we feel like we have a pretty good read on the field rate from the really good colocation business, and that\u2019s a pretty steady line. And in a big new building such as Santa Clara, for one, when you have that big of a building, then some degree of wholesale, leasing is interesting. But again, the math has to work. The rent has to be attractive. And then, can we build more in these markets, I think that on the one hand, this kind of development is more challenging than other types of development, I do believe that with regard to power in particular. But on the other hand, its non-insurmountable, I think we\u2019ve proven for a long, long time that we\u2019re a highly capable land buyer and developer. We do stay on top of market opportunities, and we just continue to feel good about our ability to grow the company and to serve our customers and to take good care of our shareholders. And maybe we just don\u2019t feel under any form of duress, we think we can execute and continue to grow. Jordan Sadler : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just lastly, I look at and you guys have executed well on development obviously, but I also look at your portfolio today and how highly utilized it is in a sort of longer-term context basically, as long as I\u2019m sort of tracking the company. It\u2019s much higher, your stock price also much in terms of valuation looks good, and pretty rich relative to some of the peers. I mean, how do you think about that your valuation and using your currency opportunistically? Tom Ray : Well, we just think about our valuation mathematically on the trial, we\u2019ve tried to produce strong growth and we feel like we have. And on the forward, we view our valuation as a maniacal drive to under-promise and over-perform, nothing is going to change. We are going to work like hell to deliver on the promise that\u2019s inside this company and we still think that promise is pretty significant. With regard to using as a currency for M&A, I mean, again no change, and I know you don\u2019t expect anything other than that from us Jordan. It\u2019s, I\u2019m a firm believer that every decision needs to be accretive to what else you could have done. And maybe sometimes you\u2019re multiple is high because you\u2019re not using your currency in a manner that is dilutive or people believe you have discipline around how to use the currency. Maybe we should be running about as happy spread investors but that\u2019s not how we\u2019re made. Again we view our equity extremely dearly and we believe we have a really good run in front of us more to accomplish. And that sets a baseline against we measure everything else. And that\u2019s just not going to change. Jordan Sadler : I think we all appreciate that. Thanks Tom. Tom Ray : All right. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Jordan. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Ray for any further or closing comments. Tom Ray : Thank you very much. And thanks to everybody for being on the call. I would depart from our norm, we have we think a really good relationship with everybody in the community. But I do need to call everybody on the phone out on this one, absolutely no proper for Year 2016 Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos. We\u2019re hurt, we\u2019re stunned but we\u2019re going to still love you. We\u2019re back to business. That\u2019s just it, back to business. We have a lot we believe we\u2019re going to accomplish. We feel like we\u2019re still very well positioned to drive growth and drive earnings. And we\u2019re going to stay focused on that. So, thanks for taking the time to understand our company. We appreciate it. We\u2019ll be available to help anybody going forward to understand the company. And we\u2019ll put a wrap on it. Thank you again. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

And welcome to the American Tower First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And at this time I'll turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations, Ms. Leah Stearns. Please go ahead. Leah Stearns : Thank you, Tony. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining American Tower's first quarter earnings conference call. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows : First, I will provide some brief highlights from our financial results. Next Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO will provide a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the first quarter 2016, as well as our full year 2016 outlook. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on the US mobile market and our strategy. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance, technology and industry trends, anticipated closings of signed acquisitions and the impact of recently closed acquisitions, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in the other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. In addition to this morning\u2019s press release, we\u2019ve posted a presentation which we\u2019ll reference throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab on our website. In addition on our IR website, you will also find our quarterly supplemental package which includes expanded disclosure on the components of our revenue and revenue growth including historical trending of our run rate revenue, which reflects revenue associated with tenant leases that are typically non-comparable and include renewal options as well as annual escalation provision. We believe this disclosure will provide investors with greater visibility into the key drivers of our revenue model and a simple base line on which to model our business. Accordingly we have introduced a new metric to track the currency neutral growth of the organic components of our run rate revenue, which we will refer to as property revenue run rate organic growth. To the extent you have any questions on the new disclosures please don't hesitate to reach out to myself or another member of our Investor Relations team. So, with that please turn to slide four of the presentation, which highlights our financial results. During the quarter our property revenue grew over 19% to nearly $1.27 billion. Total revenues grew over 19% to nearly $1.29 billion. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 15% to approximately $833 million. Adjusted funds from operation increased by over 17% to approximately $602 million and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by over 35% to $248 million or $0.58 per diluted common share. And with that I would like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Bartlett : Thanks Leah. Good morning everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had strong start to 2016 with solid organic core growth in revenue and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also distributed our first quarter common stock dividend of $0.51 per share, which was up over 21% from the prior year period. And just last week we closed our previously announced Viom transaction in India. Our teams in India are now working hard to seamlessly integrate Viom\u2019s more than 42,000 towers into our portfolio. This transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share and we expect it will help us continue to deliver strong growth across our key financial metrics. If you please turn to slide six, let's take a look at our quarterly results. You can see that we drove strong growth in all of our key metrics in the first quarter, all in the 23% to 25% range on a core basis. Our total property revenue core growth of about 25% included consolidated organic core growth of nearly 9% or over 8% on an organic run rate basis, which excludes the impact of decommissioning revenues. This strong revenue growth combined with our disciplined expense management led the double digit growth and adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Turing to slide seven, our US segment generated organic core growth for the quarter of about 7.1% which includes the positive impact of $31 million of decommissioning revenue as compared to approximately $17 million recorded in Q1 of last year. On a run rate basis, again which excludes the decommissioning revenues, US organic growth was in-line with our expectations at about 5.9%. Our international markets generated organic growth over 600 basis points higher than the US and over 350 basis points higher than it generated in Q1 of 2015 at over 13% on a consolidated basis, the highest rate in the last two years. On a run rate basis, organic growth was about 14% with escalators associated with rising local market inflation contributing about 7% to our international run rate growth and organic new business commencements were even larger components of the growth at about 8% that growth was partially offset by some churn of less than 1%. There was broad strength across our international property segments with all three posting double digit organic core revenue growth rates. Our Latin American organic core growth was over 13% including 10% and 13% in Mexico and Brazil respectively as network rollouts remained consistent throughout the region even with some macroeconomic challenges. In India we generated organic core growth of over 12% as large incumbent Indian wireless operators continue to spend aggressively to support the deployment of new technologies and spectrum. And in our fastest growing region EMEA, organic core growth was over 14% or 18% excluding our more mature German market. These strong growth rates continue to highlight the benefits of our diversification across countries, customers and technologies. On a global basis there are nearly 2.5 billion people in the markets that we serve and our largest customers will be investing tens of billions of dollars in those markets just this year to meet their customers rapidly growing wireless needs. Complementing our organic growth on a consolidated basis where contributions from more than 25,000 sites built, leased and acquired since the beginning of the last year. Including the Verizon, Airtel and TIM portfolios as well as the roughly 3,700 sites we built ourselves. Collectively these new assets contributed over 16% to our core growth rate in the quarter and we are especially encouraged by the performance of our Nigerian assets which have so far exceeded our expectations for new business. Of the 3,700 new built sites, about 500 were completed this quarter generating average day one NOI yields of over 10%. In addition we also built 14 new indoor DAS or small cell networks in the quarter many in our international markets. Within the US where the indoor networks have been in place the longest, our tenants per note stands at approximately 2.3 driving gross margins in the 70% to 75% range. Our return on these investments is about 15% including those of Viom we now have over 700 indoor DAS venues globally. Moving on to slide eight, the combination of solid revenue growth and tight cost controls led to strong margin performance across our business. A gross margin excluding pass-through remained above 80% despite the impact of the additional 25,000 new lower tenancy, lower margin sites we brought into our portfolio over the last year. This was a result of our strong organic gross margin conversion ratios approximately 19%. We have been generating these types of conversion ratios for several years now. Adjusting for the impact of our recent acquisitions this grew 83%. Our land acquisition in extension team also made significant progress towards driving incremental NPV for the portfolio while enhancing our long term US gross margin and preserving future cash flows affecting more than 700 land leases this quarter by either acquiring them outright or extending them. About 50% of these transactions related to the Verizon portfolio and as a result of our continued progress in this area over the last year the percent of owned sites increased over 300 basis points in the US from the prior year period to nearly 27% and the average remaining term of sites and lease land increased to nearly 24 years. In addition, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased about 20 basis points year-over-year after excluding the impact of the lower margin, lower tenancy acquired sites. Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined about 30 basis points year-over-year to about 8.4%. Our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growth in the first quarter is detailed on slide nine. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 15% or about 24% on a core basis to approximately $833 million as a result of our top line growth coupled with diligent operational expense management. A strong adjusted EBITDA to AFFO conversion ratio of over 81% as well as some lower cash taxes and cash interest in capital improvement CapEx relative to our internal expectations led the AFFO growth of over 17%. On a core basis AFFO growth was about 25% and AFFO per share grew by about 13% to a $1.41 per share. As a result of our solid first quarter performance and improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecast, we are rising our full year guidance for 2016 as detailed on slide ten. At the midpoint of our outlook we are raising our expectations for property revenue by $40 million or nearly 1% resulting in projected growth of about 21% on both the reported and core basis. The increase is being driven primarily by $50 million and FX assumption favorability as compared to our prior outlook, partially offset by approximately $40 million associated with the delay in closing the Viom acquisition versus prior expectations. As you recall we closed the Viom transaction on April 21 versus unexpected April 1 closing. In addition we expected $20 million increase in pass-through revenue and around $9 million in incremental straight-line revenues. Within our total revenue projections, we are reiterating our organic growth outlook for our US and international businesses. We continue to expect mid 5% organic core growth for our US property segment given consistent activity levels that have been in-line with the expectations we discussed in late February. As we have touched on previously, there are few items impacting this rate in 2016 versus 2015 including more evenly distributed new business versus of being more frontend loaded last year and flat decommissioning revenue, which are being partially offset by lower churn expectations as compared to 2015. On an ending run rate basis as of December growth for 2016 is expected to be closer to 6%. Internationally organic growth is still expected to be nearly 12%, at a consolidated level our expectation for total organic core growth remains unchanged at approximately 7% for the year or nearly 8% on a run-rate organic growth basis. Newly acquired in-built sites which include the impact of Viom are expected to contribute the balance of our anticipated core growth for the year or about 14%. Our outlook highlights the benefits of the increasing diversification of our revenue base and our decreasing dependence on any one country to deliver consistent and predictable growth. We are vital provider of communications real estate in vibrant markets like Mexico where aggressive 4G rollouts are ramping up. In Brazil where significant 3G network augmentation is continuing and India where the transition from 2G is only now getting underway for majority of the populations. This diversification supports our ability to generate consistent, sustainable growth rates on a consolidated basis. Our improved revenue growth outlook and strong conversion rates are in turn expected to lead to a higher 2016 adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $25 million or nearly 1% at the midpoint. This reflects a negative $20 million impact due to the delayed Viom closing. This is being more than offset however by a $10 million increase in cash EBITDA projected from our existing business as a result of better cost performance as well as an expected $35 million benefit from improving foreign currency exchange forecast and incremental net straight line impacts. As detailed on slide 11, we are also raising our outlook for AFFO by $20 million at the midpoint or nearly 1% versus our prior outlook, despite the negative $20 million impact of the delayed Viom close on cash adjusted EBITDA. The impact of the delay has been partially offset by $10 million increase and expected legacy cash EBITDA of $5 million decrease in the combination of cash interest, cash taxes and capital expenditures on an FX neutral basis as well as benefit of approximately $25 million resulting from the improvement in foreign currency forecast. As a result assuming a weighted average diluted share count of 429 million shares, the midpoint of our outlook now implies an AFFO per share of $5.65 representing year-over-year per share growth of over 11%. Turning to slide 12, we remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To this end, we declared over $240 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends and deployed nearly $160 million in CapEx in Q1. We believe that the combination of our growth and AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders to our REIT distributions will create meaningful value for our stockholders. In 2016 this includes expected growth in our REIT distribution subject to board approval of at least 20%. We are also committed to maintaining a substantial basic liquidity and a solid balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter our net leverage ratio stood at 5 times net debt to annualized Q1 adjusted EBITDA with liquidity of over $3 billion. We continue to expect to end the year with 5 times net debt or below and longer term our target leverage range remains between 3 and 5 times. As a result of our consistent capital deployment strategy, we expect to extend our track record of delivering strong financial results in 2016 as is detailed on slide 13. And even more importantly positioning ourselves for strong sustainable growth going forward. In fact, at the midpoint of our outlook we will have grown property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO at a mid teen percentage clip since 2007 while at the same time maintaining return on invested capital between 9% and 10%, despite adding over 25,000 new sites since the beginning of 2015. We expect these new sites will enhance our future growth trajectory over the long term while enhancing total returns. Turning to slide 14 and in summary we started 2016 with a strong operational quarter, announced our entry into Tanzania built nearly 500 sites and closed our acquisition of controlling stake in Viom networks just last week. Our top priority remains driving continued operational excellence while focusing on the integration of our recently acquired portfolios. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to sustain strong growth in all of our key metrics in margin performance and are raising our 2016 outlook for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Similar to last year we expect core growth in all three to be above our long term targets. By year end we expect to have nearly 150,000 sites worldwide with a solid balance sheet, ample liquidity and leverage back within our target range. Due to our disciplined consistent global capital allocation program, we continue to generate strong organic core revenue growth supported by a high quality asset base diversified across geographies, carriers and network technologies with a global portfolio more than triple the size of our closest US public traded peers. Our significant exposure to high growth market in our carefully cultivated assets base positions us to not only benefit from significant near term network investments, but to also deliver strong and steady growth over the long term. As a result, we expect to continue to generate consistent recurring growth in AFFO per share in a highly compelling total return to stockholders. And with that I will turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim? James Taiclet : Thanks Tom and good morning to everyone on the call. The first quarter results we have just reported today again demonstrates continued solid demand for Tower space both in the US and in our diversified international markets. In the United States consumers ever increasing appetite from mobile bandwidth has supported cumulative wireless carrier CapEx of nearly $180 billion over just the last five years with approximately another $95 billion in spectrum auction spending as well. The deployment of 4G technology at higher spectrum bands has driven significant collocation during this period due to the need from more dense network array. In addition each new spectrum band acquired and deployed into the network has driven additional amendment activity in the form of more antennas and remote radio heads on our towers. In the United States the four major wireless carriers are at or close to the completion of their phase one coverage deployment of 4G technology. So what does this mean for the level of demand for tower space going forward domestically? The primary message of my remarks today is that we expect demand from macro tower space to remain robust as mobile operators progress through their subsequent deployment phases for 4G and then onto 5G deployments thereafter. Our conclusions are based on a combination of internal and external analysis that we have conducted over the past two years. Now in the past you have heard us describe many of the technical and economic factors that support the continued use of towers as the optimal citing solution for mobile transmitter especially in suburban and rural environments and a long transportation corridor such as highways. Today I would like to focus the discussion at a much more personal level. The factors that drive a satisfying user experience on are mobile devices. Each of us is very familiar with these performance factors as we use our smart phone every day. These factors are first coverage, second capacity and third and more importantly as time goes on peak speed. So coverage, capacity and peak speed. So let's say you are taking the metro North train for your commute for ride to grand central station, a ride of about 45 minutes or so along that route most of your trip would be served by wireless transmission sites on macro tower including our towers in [Arizona], the Meronek and in the Bronx. While on the train you want to watch CNN.com video clips for the day's news on your phone. Coverage would be represented by the number of signals bars you see in the upper left hand corner of your screen and by the way it's just coverage. Capacity meanwhile would determine how many people on the train could watch streaming video at the same time as you. If capacity isn't sufficient even if the coverage bar is there then many of viewers will experience buffering, they will start to see the spinning wheels that we all dread instead of the video we want to watch. And finally peak speed will determine the quality of that video experience. Does it come across crisp or is it grainy choppy and pretty much unwatchable. So coverage, capacity, and speed all need to be there to give you a good user experience. Based on the level of investment by your particular wireless service provider, your experience could vary drastically on each of these dimensions as you progress along your commute. We are now at the stage where most US wireless carriers have deployed the majority of their 4G coverage sites so in practice the vast majority of US mobile subscribers have access to 4G bars when we look at our phone. The anticipated six times increase in mobile traffic from 2015 to 2020, however, can't just be solved through these phase one coverage sites. Wireless carriers are continuing to make significant investments in their networks to increase capacity across most of their sites including in suburban and rural areas and also along those transportation corridors. This capacity augmentation happens in two ways. First, carriers can add new spectrum bands often resulting in amendment on our sites through new or larger modest frequency antennas. We are seeing this with band such as AWS 3, WCS and 2.5 Ghtz already and second wireless carriers are actively re-farming 2G and 3G spectrum into 4G to gain better spectra efficiency across all of their spectrum. This is currently being implemented across the sale of 800 Mhtz band by some carriers as well as PCS bands and also drives amendment on our towers as other antennas are typically swapped up for larger more advanced antennas when the re-farming of spectrum occurs. In addition to their focus on coveraging capacity, you have been seeing in their advertisements that carriers have also now started to shift their marketing towards an emphasis on peak speed. This shift drives further investment into cell sites through technologies such as carrier aggregation as well as adding new cell sites to reduce the transmission radius and therefore the quality improvement for each signal. This increase in cell site density is expected to drive incremental collocation opportunities on macro towers as customers like us demand higher and higher peak speeds to enhance our user experience. All these points to not only significant continuing 4G LTE investments, but also to the subsequent deployment of 5G, which is not expected to be wirely available until at least 2020 time frame those some free standard or trial deployments are possible over the intervening next few years. So similar to 3G and 4G deployments in the past 5G is likely to start in those dense urban environments in which capacity and signal strength challenges are the greatest and then spread to suburban rural locations overtime. While very high frequency bands of spectrum such as millimeter wave might be effective for 5G and dense urban mobile environments and maybe is a fiber to home substitute it's our view that lower band spectrum will continue to be used for mobile 5G service in suburban and rural areas where our towers are located given the need for broader coverage and the requirement for point capacity. Coincidentally the 600 MHz spectrum currently being auctioned should be cleared in the same general 2020 time frame as the commencement of large scale 5G deployment. The newly available 600 MHz spectrum could be used for 5G rollouts outside of dense urban locations without disrupting 4G spectrum bands already in use are causing significant interference. As a result carriers will once again need to install additional or larger multiband antennas on towers which we would expect to result in incremental revenue growth for us. Even that more than 80% of the US population resides outside of urban areas, we view this as a long term opportunity for our 5G prior portfolio as 5G gets implemented down the road. So to summarize even in 5G world we believe that macro towers will continue to be a foundational building block for mobile network deployment in the US and globally. Consequently we are confident that the demand for tower space will continue to remain robust for many years to come. So thanks again for joining us this morning and Tony you can open the line for questions now. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks good morning guys. James Taiclet : Good morning Rick. Ric Prentiss : Lots of puts and takes in the quarter, so I just want to make sure I understood everything you laid out for us there. In the first quarter the $31 million of decom revenue how is that compared to what you expect for the year in decom revenue I think last quarter you mentioned you might have been $37 million for the year and was that expected in guidance? Thomas Bartlett : No Ric, 37 is exactly as you stated we expect that for the full year, we don't give quarterly guidance so as last year we also recognized $36 million or $37 million we had about 17 in the first quarter. This year we recognized more but the balance we recognized throughout the rest of the year and year-over-year of the relatively flat just as we expected in guidance. Ric Prentiss : Got you. So in the quarter was high was already expected in guidance for the year? Thomas Bartlett : Yes, exactly. Ric Prentiss : Okay. And then, on the puts and takes on the AFFO increased in revenue it looks like the revenue increase was really straight line impact so it\u2019s not really any pace business. EBITDA was cost cutting of about 10 million plus some straight line and on the AFFO, the straight line of the cost cutting continues and then there was 5 million for was it the cash tax and the interest just trying to understand what that extra AFFO benefit was? Thomas Bartlett : Yes, that's exactly right some lower interest expense some lower cash taxes than previous thought and the services is down a little bit and so we have a couple of million dollars less of services AFFO there as well. Ric Prentiss : And just the clear Tanzania is not in the guidance yet? Thomas Bartlett : Yes, we expect to close that probably then hopefully by the end of the second quarter. Ric Prentiss : Great, okay that helps to clear a lot. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question in queue comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys, thanks a lot. Tom I think you pointed in this closure so organic growth rate domestically in the US was 5.9% and then in the prepared remarks I think you said that by the end of the year you expected the run rate existing near to be 6% any update guide for the full year as 5.5%. Could you kind of bridge how we get down to 5.5% rate with those kind of two end points in the chain and then just second I understand that you are consolidating Viom for purposes of the AFFO presentation could you kind of comment on its contribution for instance we back out for the 49% that's not yours what that would be and kind of what your strategy is for bringing the rest of it in-house? Thanks. Thomas Bartlett : Sure David, on the first question two different metrics the kind of the run rate metric that Leah talked about in her opening remarks is a new metric that we are adding we talked about it last time we were together but it isolates just the kind of recurring lease base run rate revenue that we generate on an FX neutral basis and we think it provides more transparency into the components which really drive the tenant run rate growth. And so, that's what is driving the 5.9%, so it excludes the decommissioning revenues and those types of things back billing amortization, revenue those types of things and we think it gives more clarity in terms of what really is the run rate growth in the business. The 5.5% is our traditional core organic growth which is the one which we have historically talked about which represents the kind of the same tower store growth on those assets that we have owned for at least 12 months. And so that's what\u2019s really driving the difference between the two metrics. And on the Viom piece in 2016, we now expect to generate about $555 million revenue from Viom about $245 million in gross margin contribution I think around $215 million in EBITDA and that represents the closing as of the April 21. Going forward over the next 12 to 18 months we will look to merge our existing legacy business which is our 15,000 sites that we have within ATC India generates couple hundred million dollars a year with the Viom business. And then, overtime and that will take our ownership interest up from the current 51% to the mid 60s and then following that period of time we will look at whether how financially what makes sense in terms of bringing the rest of the business in. I mean, it's our objective that we would want to own 100% of the business with some very strong partners within the business including the TATA as in Macquarie and so we are really excited about controlling the business running the business with that kind of participation and so I would expect over the next three to four years we will have more clarity in terms of just what we ultimately end up with from the ownership perspective of the business but our immediate goal is to merge the two business where then we can really start to recognize what we believe in some synergies. James Taiclet : And David I think the first step of this to summarize is we will go from 51% to the mid 60s or high 60% just by merging the existing asset and Viom together. And then that's sort of incremental piece will be implemented via more traditional investment process over number of years actually. David Barden : Got it, okay thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question in queue comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much. Just telling on my prior question sort of US growth there has been some discussion earlier this year with select carrier looking to perhaps save some money with respect to some of their tower leases. I was wondering if you could give us any clarity in terms of what you are hearing from the operators at the moment because we are seeing some tampered CapEx trends coming out o the operators than similarly some of the component suppliers at the macro site are talking up sort of the demand environment so some mix data points there I would love to hear your thoughts on sort of overall US trends from that perspective? James Taiclet : So, Amir first of all this is Jim. First of all, the overall CapEx from year to year in the wireless industries are expected to be flat around $30 billion, so if there are moderated ups and downs in individual carriers that total is looking to be about the same which means our aggregate new business opportunity among that major tower operators looks similar from 2015 to 2016. That\u2019s how we introduced our guidance and informed our guidance and at the end of the day we\u2019re looking more at the overall markets now, especially with the segment reporting we\u2019ve moved. And so, the US run rate leasing metric that Tom talked about, we expect 6% of sell in United States which is very solid. The other thing I would like to say about the run rate metric, we\u2019re giving you yet another lens to look at the business. I think, it\u2019s a good lens because it actually, it is very similar to the way lot of real estate investors look at the assets which is what are your rate increases and rent pricing overtime and what your occupancy increases overtime. And that really just encapsulate solid bet in the run rate and it takes out some of these amortized contributions and other one-times settlements and things like that, that pause you to have to pull them apart to figure what the real run rate is, so we\u2019re just going to give that to you. So, when you take the US 6% run rate and then the other part of our strategy is diversification across carriers, technologies, continents etcetera and our international run rate leasing is 14% this year. So, the weighted average is about 8% and this is what we\u2019re trying to preserve over many, many years which is a weighted average smooth raising curve of revenue growth which then drives the double digit expectation and objective we have as a way for share growth. So, individual carriers within the US are really important, but we\u2019re looking at more to market level now and when you look at the aggregates we still got $30 billion spending and 6% of run rate growth out of domestic business. And then, the last thing I\u2019d say and Tom referred to it a couple of times is, we\u2019re really starting to focus on efficiency especially in the domestic business to get cost of out it, performance to be out or above as far as revenue and top line growth and that\u2019s going to help us with the AFFO per share contribution from the US overtime as well. So, I really think it\u2019s important if you want to understand the carriers individual plans to refer to their public statements specifically you\u2019ll talk to them individually, but we\u2019re really going to be looking at market level and region level trends from this point on. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much for your additional color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Mike Bowen with Pacific Crest, please go ahead. Michael Bowen : Yes, thank you very much. I was interested in the chart that you had in your supplemental going to the international portfolio and I was wondering if you could just walk us through a few of the examples. If I\u2019m reading this correctly few of the examples would have literally, even over 100% gross margin, maybe that\u2019s what showing in the chart if I\u2019m reading it right in Mexico. And beyond that if you could give us a little bit of your thoughts as to which of these countries do you think these metrics are going to move the most going forward? And thanks for the chart, but I want to make sure we understand it. Thanks. Thomas Bartlett : Yes Mike, I\u2019m not sure exactly which chart you\u2019re referring to, I think you might be talking to the conversion rates. So, it\u2019s the percentage of that incremental revenue that\u2019s actually coming down to the margins. But, I\u2019ll highlight though that the margins in our international business, particularly in those that we\u2019ve had some history, Mexico and as well as in Brazil, where we\u2019re passing through the land cost in the business, the margins there are actually higher than that of the United States. So, we\u2019re achieving higher margins there than as I said, than the States because of some of the incremental pass-through. I don\u2019t know specific chart, maybe after the call you can just give Leah call, just in case I\u2019ve misstated that. But, my sense is that you might be talking about those conversion ratios which is the ratio of revenue that we\u2019re bringing back down to margin. Michael Bowen : Yes, I think that\u2019s right, alright thank you very much. Thomas Bartlett : Okay, sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Yes, good morning. So kind of keeping things at a market level for the US at this point, if you see any interest in removing or entering into spending holistic NOIs and probably related to that on the international, I wondered if you could talk about the in-building a little bit more, do you have exclusivity, what are some of the main markets, do you face a lot of competition that will be my question? Thanks. Thomas Bartlett : Jon, you little garbled on it, but let me just repeat what I think you\u2019re asking. On the US side, getting a little bit more color in terms of what\u2019s going on from a market perspective and specially \u2013 Jonathan Atkin : No, for the US I wondered if you\u2019re seeing interest on the part of the carriers or entering into holistic NOIs? Thomas Bartlett : Okay. And what was the second part again please? Jonathan Atkin : And the second one related to in-building internationally and what are some of the most target rich markets, do you have that exclusivity that face a lot of competition, just a little bit more color on that in-building international where there seems to be \u2013 you\u2019re focusing more on in-building international rather than US? Thomas Bartlett : Sure. Jon, if I think, we don\u2019t speak the individual contract negotiations or even outcomes with the mobile operators relay anywhere. We have described that we have offered holistic type of agreement when mobile operators are in server ramp up or high spend mode and that just helps them in a couple of ways one is to budget more accurately and understand what their cost will be going forward. And secondly, it reduces the cycle time and therefore increases the security of when their deployment will be implemented as far as schedule perspective. So those benefits are still there some of the mobile operators are taking advantage of those now some of them have decided to either stay on or move toward or away from a more retail type of operations so without specifying any of those that those are the range of options and carriers move among those options based on their investment cycles which again speaks of the benefit diversification when you can do those multiple type contracts. So secondly, on in building side I would like to think we are bit of pioneer in a way especially in Latin America introduces technology it will come into EMEA and especially African next on our part. But Mexico and Brazil have been really strong for us in building and Viom to its credit is more of a pioneer in in-building in India market where the couple of hundred venues are much actually than we even have so it's actually very good match on the small sell size as well as Viom and ATC India but those are probably the three places with the most opportunity right now Mexico, Brazil and India. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue come from Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore, please go ahead. Jonathan Schildkraut : Great. You got a lot of the key issues already but I would love to say you can spend just a few extra minutes talking about the Mexico market it does seem like that's one that which seems really acceleration and investment seems to be broadening out in terms of the carriers there? Thanks. James Taiclet : Sure Jonathan its Jim. What\u2019s happening in Mexico right now is something again it's happened in the US and other markets ahead earlier and that is the rate of 4G job adaption can be sort of governed if you will by two things in any market. One is service pricing and the other one is handset pricing. So the lower the handset pricing and lower the service pricing the more people can afford it will sign up and start using it and grow overtime in their usage. So in Mexico the government successfully increased the level of competition in that country service pricing moved in a constructive way for the population we\u2019re able to adapt their service more rapidly than they could before. And globally, handset pricing for 4G is also reducing at the same time so you have these two complementary cost reductions in handset and service pricing and people in Mexico are signing up so that then is as we by seen every other case increase smart phone penetration 3G usage and ultimately 4G drives gigabytes from month on a network and that network demand needs to be serviced and large part often buy adding equipment to real estate including towers. So it's the typical cycle we have seen but I would say the two drivers are reduced handset pricing reduce service pricing for data. Jonathan Schildkraut : Thanks Jim. James Taiclet : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company, please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Hi, two questions, one is on escalators so historically we have thought about escalators as being something north of 3% for your business particularly in United States. But escalators as we all know is supposed to be tied to inflation that's essentially the whole purpose of why they are designed. And inflation as we all know, both when we look backwards and I think when you look forward is much left in that right now. And I am curious if because of that you are starting to see some push back on the escalators on new deals you are signing in the United States and if you are still able to achieve the 3 plus percent that actually now something closer to example 2%? And then, my second question goes back to some of the comments Jim made talking about the U.S. market. I think one of the things that's going to be different with the built out of 5G relative to previous generation builds is the use of outdoor small cells. And it looks like from the topology perspective particularly when you think some of the higher band frequencies are going to be used small cells are going to command the great portion of the overall investment dollars for network built out and stand out to historically happened. And I am curious if you think that that's going to win the level of macro tower growth you are going to see any United States tied to 5G versus the growth rate we have seen in previous generation built out? Thanks. James Taiclet : So, let me start with the escalators the traditional service 3plus percent escalators really not as solely tied inflation in the US, it's tied to real estate rent increases overtime, which have sort of been around the 3% level when it come to land rents upon which towers are built. So there of course, is an inflation kind of concept second order behind that but land rent cost are the largest cost of volume going tower operations and ground less source have been able to secure 3 plus percent escalators off and out of ground. So those are mirrored in the tower list. Moving to the outdoors small cell 5G issue I would invite to get a hold of Leah separately because we have got some pretty in depth technical assessments on how this works whether it's 3G, 4G or 5G. And yes in dense urban networks, dense urban environments networks do have to have much shorter transmission rate, small cell makes sense for them for 3G, 4G and ultimately they will it makes sense for 5G. But what we serve is the suburban rural and transportation corridor market not urban or dense urban. 97.5% of our towers are in non-dense urban environments and the reason that carrier use tower predominately in those environments because that is the optimal height power setting and transmission radius for suburban rural and transportation corridor use cases. The proportion of small cell spending, our projection is that yes as a percentage of CapEx we will double over the next five years from 5% to approximately 10% that's our estimate therefore we think 90% of the spend rate is or so is going to continue to be on macro sites mainly towers and also rooftops and more of an environment so that's how we see going forward again if you want more depth in some of the detail we can even provide a separate session for anybody that wants that just contact Leah. Colby Synesael : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Hey guys thank you taking the questions. Two if I could, one on Viom, how soon do you sense you can integrate these assets with the existing ATC India portfolio and just wondering really where the margins on the Viom portfolio can go from the roughly 40% that's in tied by the current guide and then just secondly on the Verizon portfolio of towers can you just give us an update on what you are seeing on the demand front and latest expectations for list of activity in 2016? Thanks. James Taiclet : So this is Jim. I will speak to the Viom integration the most important part of the integration from the commercial standpoint is one sales force face to the customer which is in the process of being implemented right now and that's on a fast track. The second largest piece from a again customer and revenue point of view will be the integration of multiple master lease agreements between the two portfolios among many customers that's going to take probably 12 to 18 months to really get those consolidated but those things have already started. As far as the lease ability of the sites Viom has been run as a independent third party tower company already and therefore the documentation the system as the data to be able to quickly release sites is largely already there that's a difference then say carrier portfolio like Verizon where at least collect the lot of that from the field officers as such. So the Viom integration from an effective feasibility standpoint is going to be I think on a very fast track this entire portfolio this combined portfolio is going to be jointly marketed to our customer base early on and we are already in discussion volume discussions with many of them as to how they can take advantage of the now number one independent tower company in India along with our traditional sub-operating capabilities that they come to service back. So I think the Viom integration takes 12 to 18 months to get it completely renegotiated around the master contract and have some of the field work done in some of the organizational alignments fully completed. As to Verizon we have said just recently in our last call and it's still the case we have 9% to 10% long term sort of cumulative average growth rate expectation over ten years for that portfolio and we still do so every month or two it's not going to change I can imagine materially. We are seeing new business on the sites. And really great shape as far as the carrier portfolio for capacity ground space the documentation I referred to earlier so we are progressing through our plan and expect to be able to deliver what we have stated in the past. Matthew Niknam : Thank you Operator : Thank you. The next question will comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead. Brett Feldman : Thanks and just going back to Colby\u2019s question about network design even before we get the 5G one of the things that's happening now and this is something Verizon discussed when it met with analyst earlier week is that carriers are moving to a centralized win designs so they are taking some of the equipment that has historically been at tower locations and moving them to central locations. However, Verizon also said that in many cases those central locations are other macro sites and so since this is happening now and I imagine you seen some of it going on your site how does this affect your business I mean are you seeing some reduction of footprints in other place, but meaningful increases in a carrier footprint in other locations and on net what does this mean for you? Thomas Bartlett : So, the net effect is changes in ground equipment and installation and locations spread is not material. There are some offsets like you said but generally the way our contracts are structured the vast majority of the lease rate if you will and none of it is separable or severable if you will. But the vast majority of the pricing calculation is really what goes on the tower not necessarily on the ground again none of it severable, so because you took one cabinet off of your ground space you are still paying for the square foot footprint of that ground space. And you can put whatever you want or not on it so we don't tend to reduce prices because someone moved the cabinet from one place to another took it off the site. One of the benefits of central ran or cloud ran in our view is that it frees up more resources for the radio access network that transmission equipment that goes up on the tower, which again we charge for and that's what most of the amendments have to do with. So over the long term it we think it's ran centralization or cloud ran is going to be constructive for our lease growth on our sites because if much less and I think a couple of mobile operators have said this is reducing their core network cost fairly significantly that more resources could then be potentially voted to the radio access network which again 90% of what we of that we think will spend on tower and related rooftops sites. Brett Feldman : Yes, and this is a quick follow-up since they are using carriers are using certain macro locations to be the centralized hubs are finding that towers sites to happen to have a lot of ground space all of the sudden maybe have more revenue potential than they would have because that place is useful for the data centers that they are running? Thomas Bartlett : I think the margin conceptually that would be right Brett, but again our sites tend to have substantial ground space what\u2019s been helpful for example is [indiscernible] from having essentially a tractor trailer full of equipment on the site down to today's Sprint two cabinets and much smaller footprint. The miniaturization of the base station electrics has actually helped us free up more ground space overtime now there are cases where we need to get more because we have multiple customers now which is great but yes, I think that we are going to be in good shape to be able to host not only serve extra cloud ran equipment on sites which are closer to the edge of the network but also distributed some day we think we could be an opportunity for distributed storage caching specially entertainment type volumes of data at the tower site to reduce the latency of transmission of content. That's something down the road there are ground space could be useful and we have some examples of this in our international markets where we are doing fiber docs and other sort of very closely related and solar uses of the ground space for incremental amendments. So we will get every dollar we can on every square foot of ground we can, but I think it's bit of a long cycle again kind of therapeutic trend. Brett Feldman : Got it. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : Hey guys thanks for getting me in. So, the first our peer sponsors are doing a month can you give us any flavor of conversations you are having with the potential bidders for this? James Taiclet : Our interaction with the mobile operators on this is that we will support you set you have a part in first and they know that we will, we are not a sort of designated sub-contractor in a bid to any particular mobile operators so our view of first that is there is spectrum to be put to work there is a national security or homeland security need to be filled. It's very unclear as to how that's going to be filled but at the end of the day they are going to need to transmit off of largely towers and we will be there to serve that need depending on who wins how they are structured if it's take wise versus national etcetera. So, we are going to have our real estate asset ready and by having good operational practices and good structural capacity on the sites available for these kind of things that's the best we can do right now and just get ready for this wave if and when it hits the lease on to our towers. Philip Cusick : I think, a bidder will have to have some idea of what he is going to pay for towers. Do you have some levels of view on what those amendments might cost if a carrier were to add like that capacity? James Taiclet : We don't know the bill of material as yet first of all what equipment will go on we don't know the redundancy and hardening factors it might need to be put in place for example, what is the generator dedicated to this need at every site so until we know the bill of materials and the specifications of the loading and the ground requirements we can't price it. Now I think you are absolutely right that bidders are going to have to make estimates of this but there is market pricing out there for them to draw from today and imagining that's how people are doing it but we are not committing pricing because we don't we can't do it until we have a bill of materials. Philip Cusick : And what about the fact that the carrier want actually own the spectrum does that change the way you expect to price it or you think it will be sort of similar to an owned band? James Taiclet : We will have to see what the legal relationship is between the government and entities whoever they maybe and operators whoever they maybe and then compare those two existing agreements that may or may not apply to this type of service depending on who the operator is so it's all going to be very case specific but we will again deal with it specially if it's one of our current customers in the constructive way as we try to always do. Philip Cusick : Good thanks Jim. James Taiclet : Yes. Operator : Thank you. We do have time for one last question that will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great, thanks a lot. You just comment James on the M&A environment, you obviously done that a couple of big deals here and obviously try to get your leverage down we have seen some transactions going for sale in Europe and I think you talked in December about a lot of markets in Asia opening up so how are you thinking about the deal activity and what are you seeing out there at the moment? Thanks. James Taiclet : Sure, we have since 2007 position business development teams very skilled ones in Asia and Latin America to always be ready when and if mobile operators or others were willing to divest their sites or engage in some kind of a merger with us. So referring to some successes we had in Brazil, India and Nigeria recently. We are still pursuing those. We are pursuing them in light and full understanding of what our leverage targets are and Tom keeps very close triangulation on all that with EVPs that run the region, so everybody is well aware of what the parameters are here. In Europe specifically the team in that region is carefully evaluating the situation right now where there has been some movements either privately held companies or third party tower companies or carrier portfolios being separated and spun out etc. But their evaluating it carefully in the context of our discipline kind of approach that Tom referred to already and the perhaps the biggest factor in any of these deals whether it's in Asia, the US or Europe or elsewhere is the asset pricing at that moment versus the expected revenue and EBITDA growth rates through the medium and long term and when there is a dislocation between asset pricing and those long term prospect you do not see us act any major investment for us specially given us the scale we are at today and diversification we have today, actually Simon needs to enhance the expected performance of our existing asset portfolio. So something we do on top of the transactions and organic growth we have already done has to make the whole cash flow to occur better overtime and so those deals are difficult to find specially when you impart the discipline and patience that are hallmarks of our investment committee which is me, Tom and our general counsel add here. So this one process and this is one example not try to make any kind of prediction for any other reason, but you will recall that we entered the India market in 2007 and we kind of deliberately built the business a piece a time increase of increasing size over a nine year period before securing a leading position in the market with Viom. So if that's what takes us we will do on the other hand if opportunities emerge quickly like in Nigeria there were three heads within 9 to 12 months, we were very active in those as well. So it's hard to predict the environment, the M&A environment is not such by the seller but also by the buyer community and if the asset prices are too high you are not going to see us active if asset prices are within our investment criteria you will see us move very quickly to move forward so really not much specific to say that we are out there we are active and we still use the same process and asset pricing reported to us. Simon Flannery : Okay. Thank you. James Taiclet : Thanks Simon. Leah Stearns : Great. Thank you everyone for joining us today and if you have any follow-up questions on the results please feel free to reach out myself or another member of our IR team and we are here to help. Thanks.

Welcome to the American Tower's Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Leah Stearns, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Leah Stearns : Thank you. Good morning and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter earnings. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows : First, I will provide some brief highlights from our financial results. Next, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO will provide a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the second quarter 2016, as well as our full-year outlook for the full-year 2016. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO will provide a brief update on our international business and strategy. After these comments, we will open up the call for your question. Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations for future growth including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates and future operating performance, technology and industry trends and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2015 and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. In addition to this morning's press release, we have posted a presentation, which we will reference throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab on our website. I'd like to note that we have updated the name of our run rate revenue metric to tenant billings. As we highlighted for you last quarter when we introduced this metric, it reflects the current tenant billings which are generated by our global portfolio of communications real estate. In addition, and in response to recently issued disclosure guidance by the SEC, after today we will no longer reference our core growth metrics. So with that, please turn to slide four of the presentation, which highlights our financial results. During the quarter, property revenue grew approximately 24% to nearly $1.43 billion. Total revenues grew approximately 23% to over $1.44 billion and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by over 24% to $161 million or $0.37 per diluted common share. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was over 18% and included an income tax reserve related to the Viom transaction. For the year, we now expect our effective tax rate will be in the low-double digits. Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter grew 14% to approximately $869 million and consolidated adjusted funds from operations increased by over 10% to approximately $592 million or $1.38 per diluted share. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Bartlett : Hey, thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and good margin performance across our global asset base. We also declared a common stock dividend of $0.53 a share, which was up over 20% from the prior-year period. And given the close of our Viom transaction in late April, our teams in India are now working hard to seamlessly integrate the more than 42,000 towers we added to our portfolio with that acquisition. If you please turn to slide six, let's take a look at our quarterly results. You can see that we generated strong performance with total reported property revenue growth of about 24%. This included total tenant billings growth of over 23%, of which about 8% was organic, driven by consistent demand levels throughout our global footprint. Our total property revenue growth this quarter included a negative 60-basis point impact from a $7 million revenue reserve related to the receivables associated with a tenant in Brazil which were outstanding at the time of their judicial reorganization filing. Based on our prior experiences with carrier bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings, we expect to pursue the full amount owed to us. Additionally, I would note that this tenant has resumed payments to us for amounts owed subsequent to their judicial reorganization filing date. Our U.S. property segment generated total reported revenue growth of about 3%, including a negative 1.4% impact from straight-line revenue recognition. We did not book any decommissioning revenue this quarter as compared to about $8 million recorded in Q2 of last year and $31 million or so booked in Q1. This negatively impacted our U.S. property revenue growth, by an additional 1.1%. U.S. organic tenant billings growth for the quarter was 5.6%, which again reflects organic build recurring revenue and was right in line with our expectations. Demand trends in the U.S. remain very steady with carriers actively spending to augment their 4G networks. Our international markets generated organic tenant billings growth of 13.7% or 800 basis points higher than that of the U.S. Escalators associated with rising local market inflation contributed about 7% to that growth, while organic new business commencements were even larger a component of the growth at about 7.6%. These were partially offset by some churn of just over 1%. There was broad strength across our international property segments with all three posting double-digit organic tenant billings growth rates, including 12% in Latin America, 20% in EMEA and over 10% in Asia. Our multinational tenant base in these markets continue to make significant investments in their networks as more and more of their customers gain access to advanced handsets, handsets at lower per unit costs and begin to use exponentially more data on those handsets. The benefits of the geographic tenant and technological diversification built into our business model continues to be evidenced by the strong growth rates we're generating in our international markets. Finally, on a total property basis, the day one revenue associated with the nearly 57,000 sites we have added since the second quarter of last year including the Viom, Airtel Nigeria and TIM Brasil portfolios and roughly 3,400 new bills contributed another 15% to our total tenant billings growth in Q2, bringing the total growth to the nearly 23%. Our new build program remains active and we constructed nearly 400 towers this quarter, with an average day one NOI yield of over 10%. Moving onto slide seven, the combination of solid revenue growth and tight cost controls led to strong margin performance across our business. Gross margin in the quarter remained strong at over 68%, despite a negative impact of over 10% from pass-through and a negative impact of 4.6%, due to the addition of new sites, which have lower initial tenancies and margins. This was supported by strong conversion of revenue to gross margin on legacy sites during the quarter, while our reported conversion of revenue to gross margin was around 49% as a result of the previously mentioned negative impacts of pass-through revenue and lower tenancy new sites, which on a combined basis negatively impacted the reported conversion ratio by about 50%. Our ability to convert revenue to gross margin on our pre-existing sites remains strong and in line with historical norms of well over 90%. Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 60% for the quarter, which includes a negative impact from pass-through of about 9%. This also includes about 4.3% of margin dilution associated with new sites brought into the portfolio since the start of the second quarter of last year, including Viom. Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue was about 8.1% in the quarter and is expected to be right around 8% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter is detailed on slide eight. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% to about $869 million as a result of our top-line growth coupled with the diligent operational expense management. Our solid adjusted EBITDA performance drove growth in consolidated AFFO, as did slightly lower than expected capital improvement, capital expenditures. This led to growth in consolidated AFFO of over 10% and growth in consolidated AFFO per share of nearly 10%. The global operational efficiency initiatives that we put into place continue to result in strong profitability for the business. Moving on to slide nine, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with financial policies designed to support this objective by managing risk across the capital structure in support of our investment grade rating. In the second quarter, we pursued several financing initiatives directly supporting these policies. First, we raised $1 billion in 10-year senior unsecured notes at an historically low coupon rate for ATC of 3.375%. This opportunistic transaction increased our liquidity and turned out a significant portion of our floating rate debt. Next, we assumed nearly $800 million of rupee denominated debt in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in Viom. We immediately commenced a multi-year process to refinance the existing loans locally at more attractive rates than the initial 11% average coupon, and have already decreased the average cost to about 10.3%. These actions highlight our excellent access to diversified funding sources, including the investment grade bond market, as well as an ability to maintain a substantial base of liquidity to support our solid balance sheet. As a result, as of the end of the second quarter, our net leverage ratio was 5.3 times net debt to annualized Q2 adjusted EBITDA, with liquidity of over $3 billion. We continue to expect to end the year at 5 times net debt or below, and longer-term our target leverage range remains between 3 times and 5 times. Turning to slide 10, given our solid performance in the first half of the year, continued improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecasts and underlying trends that are consistent with our previous assumptions, we are raising our full-year guidance for 2016. At the midpoint of our outlook, we're increasing our expectations for property revenue by $10 million, or about 0.2%, resulting in projected reported growth of 21% or so. The increase is being driven by a $14 million increase in straight-line revenue and $7 million in favorability in organic tenant billing revenue across our property segment. This favorability is being partially offset by about $7 million from the reserve book this quarter in Brazil as well as about $4 million associated with lower expected pass-through revenue. The positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations versus our prior outlook for revenue is just about $1 million, given that the devaluation of the naira is offsetting the strengthening of the majority of our other currencies. Also, our revised outlook does not contemplate impacts from any of our pending transactions that have yet to close. Within our total revenue projections, we expect, in the U.S., organic tenant billings growth of about 5.5% to 6% for the year. This reflects a steady demand environment similar to what we have seen year-to-date and anticipated acceleration in our growth rate in the second half of the year as a result of a more even spread of new business commencements compared to the prior-year period. Internationally, we expect organic tenant billings growth of nearly 14%, supported by especially strong trends in markets like Mexico, Nigeria, and Uganda, where new business commencement activity is incredibly strong. At a consolidated level, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be nearly 8%. Newly acquired and built sites are expected to contribute the balance of our anticipated tenant billings growth for the year, or just over 14%. This growth has resulted in the continued expansion of our base of non-cancelable tenant lease revenue which now, on a consolidated basis, stands at nearly $32 billion with an average remaining lease term of about 5.6 years. We're also raising the midpoint of our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $15 million. This reflects cash SG&A as a percent of total revenue of right around 8%. Our increased adjusted EBITDA outlook is driven by an $8 million benefit associated with increased net straight-line, $17 million in FX favorability, and about $6 million in outperformance in the underlying property business relative to our previous expectations. This is being partially offset by a $7 million receivable reserve booked in Q2 and about $9 million in lower expected contribution from our services segment versus our prior outlook, where the pipeline of project-based activity has slowed. Given that substantially all of our Nigerian OpEx and SG&A expenses are denominated in local currency, and that over half of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, the impact of the Nigerian naira devaluation I referenced earlier to EBITDA is minimal. Finally, we're raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $15 million at the midpoint, or about 0.6%. This is being driven primarily by the $7 million increase in cash EBITDA just discussed, plus roughly $13 million due to lower net cash interest expense expectations. This increase of $20 million is being partially offset by about $5 million resulting from higher expectations for corporate capital expenditures, primarily associated with IT spending to support our global operations. Assuming an average diluted share count of 429 million shares, this implies consolidated AFFO per share of $5.69 at the midpoint, reflecting a per share growth rate of about 12%. Before we move on, I'd also like to note that factoring in the July month to-date actual FX rates and holding current spot rates constant for the rest of the year would result in additional upside of about $33 million for property revenue, $18 million for adjusted EBITDA, and $14 million for consolidated AFFO, or about $0.03 per share relative to the midpoints of our current outlook. Turning to slide 11, we remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and continue to focus on our goal of simultaneously funding growth, returning cash to our stockholders, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To this end, we've declared nearly $500 million in common and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends, spent approximately $1.2 billion on accretive acquisitions, and deployed nearly $330 million in CapEx so far this year, which includes nearly $76 million spent on ground lease purchases. In fact, since 2011, we've deployed over $500 million for ground lease purchases in the U.S., while increasing the percentage of towers on land we owned or controlled for over 20 years from about 55% in 2011 to nearly 67% today, and extending the average remaining term on our leased land from just under 22 years to nearly 25 years. This activity further secures our long-term recurring cash flows, while generating margin improvement and enhancing the operating leverage of our business through land rent expense reduction. We expect to continue to pull in capital for land purchases over the long-term and are targeting to have 80% of our towers in the U.S. on land that is either owned or leased for more than 20 years by 2020. We believe that our disciplined capital allocation strategy will enable us to deliver the combination of growth in consolidated AFFO per share and consistent return of capital to stockholders through our REIT distributions and drive compelling total returns for many years to come. In 2016, this includes expected growth in our dividend, subject to board approval of at least 20%. Turning to slide 12, and in summary, we've enhanced our strategic positioning so far in 2016 by continuing to employ a comprehensive multi-pronged strategy. First, we further diversified our international presence by acquiring a controlling stake in Viom Networks in India. We believe mobile networks there are poised for significant 4G investments in urban metros, and for continuing deployment of coverage in initial data services in the suburban and rural areas where over two-thirds of Indians live. Second, we've continued to drive operational excellence through our business, while focusing on the integration of our recently acquired portfolios in several key markets. And third, we've remained focused on strengthening our balance sheet through opportunistic refinancing and selective debt repayments. And fourth, we've simultaneously maintained strong growth in our common stock dividend. As a result, we're well positioned to finish this year strong, driving compelling growth in revenue, net income, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO, while returning significant cash to our shareholders through our common stock dividend. This is all made possible by our unmatched global scale, experienced regional leadership teams, and disciplined capital allocation strategy, which we expect to remain consistent for the rest of this year and well into the future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim? James Taiclet : Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, similar to prior second quarter earnings calls, my comments will focus on American Tower's international operations. As you just heard, our Asia, EMEA, and Latin America segments all generated another strong quarter of operating results in Q2, once again serving as a turbocharger for our market-leading domestic business. Beginning with American Tower's first international investment in Mexico in 1999, we've methodically expanded our geographic scope and scale based on the set of fundamental tenants. First, we recognized that the power of the Tower business model that has first been developed in the United States should equally apply in additional countries that presented the right operating conditions. It is our experience that due to a number of common factors the fundamental drivers of Tower demand are consistent across our selected geographies. First, consumers everywhere have a huge appetite for mobile technology and service and moreover the underlying physics of radio wave propagation, useable spectrum bands, and the 2G, 3G and 4G technology standards all apply globally, plus the network equipment OEMs, the handset manufacturers such as Apple and the chipset developers like QUALCOMM sell their products all over the world. Second, we understood from our U.S. experience that by buying towers from mobile operators, we could transform single-use non-performing cost center assets into high-performing multi-use commercial real estate. Consequently, sale-leaseback transactions for these assets provided an additional source of capital to mobile operators so they could more rapidly deploy their active networks and grow their core business. Again, since these common sense economics apply across multiple countries, we've been able to pursue the same strategy successfully to-date in Latin America, Africa, Germany and India. And third we recognize that we can dramatically increase our growth opportunities while at the same time benefiting from the diversity across various markets. Using standard portfolio theory, we expected that by selectively diversifying our asset base, we could also reduce fluctuations in our cash flows, thereby delivering an elevated, extended and more stable growth trajectory over a very long period of time. The results we have generated in our international markets confirm these principles. For example, on sites outside of the U.S. that we've owned since the beginning of 2010, our U.S. dollar equivalent NOI yield as of the end of the second quarter was more than 30%, as compared to around 18% on that vintage in the U.S. These results include both sites that we have acquired as part of our disciplined asset acquisition strategy and sites that we've constructed for our carrier customers. Meanwhile, international sites added between 2010 and 2013 are already yielding around 12% today with sites added over the last two years already yielding an average of about 10%. While the yields on our younger international assets are solid, we believe the real opportunity is to make value on these newer assets lies ahead. Our two decades of experience in the tower business have clearly illustrated that the longer we have assets in our portfolio, the more revenue and cash flow they generate. This is especially true outside the U.S. where most of our newly-added sites have been single tenant at the time of acquisition or construction. Given that we have generated double-digit international organic tenant billings growth on average over the last three years and expect to continue to drive these types of solid growth rates going forward, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity to drive significant NOI yield accretion on our international assets over time. Consequently, we have positioned the company for continuing long-term success with our combined domestic U.S. and global asset base. MIT researchers Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have identified three key elements to building competitive advantage in the digital age - physical capital, intellectual capital and organizational capital. On all three of these dimensions, American Tower now has built a sustainable global competitive advantage in telecommunications real estate, which we believe would be difficult to replicate. First is our physical capital. The 140,000 plus towers and small cell systems that we've constructed and acquired. They're high structural capacity, premier locations and existing and future cash flow generation potential. The depth, diversity and global reach of this physical capital are in our view unmatched and we believe that replicating our portfolio while achieving similar economics in the future would be a very formidable task. Second is intellectual capital we have cultivated at American Tower since the mid-1990s. The systems and processes that we've developed refined and optimized to be able to support tens of thousands of properties spanning five continents, and that positions the company for further asset growth in the future. I actually believe that ATC is world class in the most critical operational skills in this business, formulating highly complex master lease agreements tailored to our customers' needs, coupled with the ability to manage literally hundreds of thousands of individual tenant and ground leases every month. And third is the organizational capital that has been nurtured and developed at all levels in this company. I believe we have the most capable senior management team in the industry, who've in turn built high-performance organizations in our key functions across all of our geographies. Our retention of highly-skilled executives, managers and employees has been excellent, resulting in an experienced work force today. Additionally, as a recognized global leader, American Tower's brand enables us to recruit outstanding talent to support the rapid growth of the business. We've also developed comprehensive training and development programs, targeted to continuously improve our capabilities and proprietary skills such as structural engineering and lease contracting. So as a result of building our physical, intellectual and organizational capital methodically over the past 20 years, we've attained a leadership position among fully independent tower companies in each of the leading three market democracies on the five most populous continents in the world, while creating a cash flow engine that continues to gather momentum. With our unique and dynamic position in the telecommunications real estate business, we expect to provide an attractive combination of growth and yield to our investors for many, many years to come. Thank you for joining our call this morning, and operator, please open it up now for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] And first from the line of Amir Rozwadowski, your line is open, please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much and good morning, folks. I was wondering if we could dig a bit deeper into U.S. properties a bit here. As you mentioned, Tom, your guidance factors in what I believe you characterize is anticipated acceleration of new business. While I realize giving carrier specific detail isn't where you may want to go, perhaps you can give us color on what initiatives you're seeing and how you think the trajectory of the business should pan out over the next 12 months. And then, I guess, within that, during the quarter I feel like there has been a lot of questions or conversations about how to think about future escalator rates in the U.S. with perhaps some of the carriers expressing some consternation about how the compounding growth outlook of that cost structure would be for them. Maybe you can provide us with some insight on what you're hearing from your conversations with carriers and whether you believe there is either a risk or perhaps a middle ground going forward. Thanks a lot. James Taiclet : Amir, this is Jim. Why don't I take the second part of your question and Tom can go to the more quantitative side after that. As you know, and as you've said, we do not comment on specific customer negotiations, discussions, or their plans. But what we can do is provide you facts for the big four U.S. national carriers in aggregate, and these are average remaining term and domestic churn, excluding our non-national customers. Now we can sort of see the trend of the business as far as duration and fall off. So for 2016, our expected remaining term for the four nationals is 6.6 years and the churn is only approximately 0.2%. So we feel very confident about the stability of our U.S. domestic sort of big four asset base or revenue base right now. And the other piece of that is the escalator, which across the U.S. on average is still above 3%. So I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Bartlett : Yeah, and Amir, I think, kind of coupling what Jim had just said, if you take a look at what our pipelines support, we've talked about this momentum kicking into the second half and we also, as a result, see that about 47% of our total organic business generated in the first half with 53% in the second half. So I think that that also kind of reflects my remarks and Jim's remarks that we continually see this growing pipeline of co-location amendments. In the United States, I think you're well aware that over the last three quarters, it's been a large piece of amendment activity, continually to filling in and meeting that capacity, and so as we've always talked about we see this amendment in co-lo activity in the form of sine waves and so we fully believe that all of the carriers are generating their own sine wave in terms of new business, grooming, co-los amendments. And I think as I mentioned we see a more momentum coming even to the second half of the year, which we think will position us well then for going into 2017. Amir Rozwadowski : Thank you very much for the additional color. Thomas Bartlett : Sure. Operator : And our next question is from Batya Levi. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great, thanks. Question on Brazil. Can you remind us what your outlook for growth in Brazil is for this year? There've been dramatic changes in carriers' CapEx guidance that were laid out in the most recent earnings. Can you talk a little bit about if you're seeing any slowdown in the level of carrier activity and how should we think about growth in that region? Thank you. Thomas Bartlett : Yeah, sure, overall for the region I think I mentioned in my remarks I'm going to say it's in that kind of that 12% kind of range. In that particular market, it's been pretty steady. But it's really interesting with all of the issues that they have in the marketplace, we've seen quite steady performance this year. It's down from where it was last year clearly, and in addition, as I mentioned, we took that additional reserve this particular quarter just from a total revenue perspective. But the level of activity in the market has actually been quite steady and we expect to see that same level of activity for the balance of the year. Batya Levi : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And the next question from David Barden, please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could, just maybe this is for you, Jim, or Tom. Just following up on the earlier question, the T-Mobile and AT&T I think have pretty explicitly gone out there and tried to solicit alternatives for microcell sites that have been compounding for maybe 10 years or even 20 years, and there is conceivably a window for economic substitution for new tower builds. Could you talk about what you see is the vulnerability of AT&T's domestic portfolio in terms of long-term leases that have compounded with terms of leases that are expiring with alternative sightings that might nearby? It doesn't seem like it could be very big but I'm wondering if you see it at all as a potential vulnerability at this stage. And then second in India, obviously Bharti Infratel has been talking about the potential for resetting lease - pricing lower at the end of the term of some of their main shareholder leases. Obviously, with Viom you're going to have a larger overlap with them. I was wondering if you could talk about kind of the outlook for market lease pricing in India going forward. Thanks. James Taiclet : Sure, David. It's Jim. What I would say about potential substitution anywhere for towers is that - just to remind you, you've all heard this the functional inputs of the franchise value of the tower. And so, first of all, any change of equipment from one tower to another one, assuming you could even build it nearby is fairly costly for any operator. So that's something they would have to put into their equation. Also, the longer the site has been up, the more equipment tends to be on it, et cetera, and the more embedded it is in the network. So there are some network difficulties and economic cost to doing a switch. But as you know the other part of the franchise value is that most municipalities try to manage the number of structures in their jurisdiction, and would take that into account. And then thirdly, we continually try to reach mutually beneficial arrangements with our customers that can ameliorate the impact of specific high price sites as far as the contracts. So we'll continue to help them as we can in that way as well. So I do think that having some metrics for you to track over the years will be a useful way to keep track of all of this, and that's why I wanted to put out to you what our average remaining term is for the big four in aggregate and also what the churn rate for the non-national sort of assets of the big four, excluding the non-national, the assets of the big four are. And as I just said it's 0.2%. And so, again so far with the industry conditions we expect to continue it's very, very low as far as actual churn off, but we'll keep providing you those metrics as we go forward in time. David Barden : Great. James Taiclet : Secondly, on the Indian market, it's a critical difference to be a truly independent provider of siting in any country versus a captive provider of siting. In other words, you're a subsidiary or an affiliate of the mobile operator itself. Those contracts I don't want to speak to, but I can speak to our contracts with all mobile operators in India as being market based and therefore arm's length and certain provisions that may apply to captive contracts may or may not apply to ours. I guess I would set the foundation there, because again we don't talk about specific contracts or discussions or negotiations in any of our markets. So that's - I think a fundamental way to look at it is how do independents deal with mobile operators and how do captives deal with mobile operators and again you can track our metrics over time in that regard. David Barden : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Next question from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut, please go ahead. Jonathan Schildkraut : Great, thanks for taking the question. I just was hoping that maybe you could provide a little color, Tom, and sort of understanding the change in the organic growth metrics that you delivered and help sort of bridge the gap. I know when I look back at the first quarter numbers, the total organic growth was 7.9%. This quarter it's 7% and I know that those may actually be very close to the same numbers, just based on differences in calculations and so if you could give us a little bit of a look under the hood it might be helpful. Thanks. Thomas Bartlett : Yeah, I mean the definitions are, Jon, in the release and in the back of the slides that we have here. But I mean the fundamental difference in the organic, we're really trying to - as we talked about last quarter, we're really trying to give a true run rate, a recurring run rate of build revenue. And so the tenant billings if you will, is that recurring revenue that is constantly being invoiced to customers. Outside of that which then gets you to the reported are things like pass-through and straight-line and all of those other elements, which had a lot of volatility from quarter-to-quarter. And then on an organic basis, what we're really trying to do is again give you that recurring revenue that we have from co-los amendments plus escalators, less churn to give you a true view in terms of what additional activity is happening on all of the sites that we have. So if you take a look at, for example, the U.S. in this particular quarter, if you exclude again the decommissioning revenue, which again was kind of that - again that volatile, you're right, for the U.S. it's in the mid-5%s. Right at about that 5.5% and versus the organic number that we talked about now under the tenant billings methodology of 5.6%. So it's very, very similar in terms of what the rates were that we talked about last quarter and that we would see in Q2. Similarly for international, if you looked at the core organic growth we're talking about 13.7% on the tenant billings organic basis which is the number we just referred to. On the international side, again if you backed out the impact of OI we would be right at 13.5%. So again, what we're trying to do is we're trying to just reflect what that real run rate recurring billings stream would be. So very, very similar, just a couple of nuances in terms of the differences between the organic core growth and the tenant billings. The real difference is being that decommissioning revenue in the U.S. which would be the kind of the major element to reconcile it to, and the reserve that we took on the OI or on the Brazilian business in Brazil. Jonathan Schildkraut : Okay, thanks, Tom. Thomas Bartlett : Yes. Operator : Next question is from the line of Simon Flannery. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you very much. Tom, you talked about the capital allocation portion a couple of times. I remember when you became a REIT, you set a fairly low payout reflecting in part the NOLs. Can you just update us on the NOL status, the AFFO payout, and how should we think about dividend growth at some point the 20% number is going to come down to more match your overall growth, so what should we be thinking about there? And then there has been a lot of comments over the last little while about various outdoor small cell strategies and municipal pushback and so forth. Just wanted to get your perspective on that market at this point. Thanks. Thomas Bartlett : Sure. Simon, I'll take the first part and Jim take the second part. On the dividends, you're absolutely accurate. We started out being a REIT, we had a sizeable amount of NOLs at that time and we've utilized those largely over the last, three, four years, and so we have $50 million of NOLs or so. And as a result, our payout has been down in the 30%, 35% range, which is where it exists today. We fully expect that as a result of no longer having those NOLs and having assets that are further being depreciated, that over the next couple of years, we would start to see payouts in the 45% to 50% range of AFFOs. So there is no doubt that we're going to be paying a larger piece of that AFFO and then clearly as a result of not having those NOLs available. Simon Flannery : So does that allow you to keep the 20% for a couple of more years? Thomas Bartlett : Well, again, it's all subject to board approval. Really looking at - we'll take a year at a time, but we would expect that the - I would expect with that growth rate we'd be able to continue for the next - yes, couple of years. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you. James Taiclet : And, Simon, it's Jim. Regarding our small cell strategy overall, we've chosen to focus on indoor data systems and ultimately indoor small cell systems as where we think the best returns have and can be attained. We're also actively exploring innovative ways to achieve tower-like returns on other what we call macro supplement types of assets, and that could be outdoor small cells and other technologies that can better serve the high density venues. I think the classic tower, the macro tower is going to serve its purpose for the foreseeable future, because we are really in the business of in the macro tower world is providing mobile service in suburban largely and corridor - transportation corridor and rural environments. And where a lot of the small cell demand is coming, as you hear from the carriers and others, is in the really high density locations, such as urban centers where towers don't have a role - much of a role to play anyhow. So this would be a complementary business for us if we could figure out how to scale it, but importantly, how to scale it with tower-like returns. And that's what we're really aggressively exploring today, although I have to admit we haven't solved the problem quite yet. And I think already you're seeing that part of the issue with urban small cell deployments is the municipalities, again, have a big role in what gets built on their jurisdiction and how it gets built and if it's shared or single use. And so there are some municipal delays on some of the projects going on by all of the industry today and we want to continue to work out all those issues as time goes on and figure out if we can get tower-like returns from these kinds of projects. So it's going to be a long cycle approach, 5G, even a standard won't be set till probably 2019, 2020 and then that will start being deployed in some of these dense venues. In the meantime, 4G is the go-to technology for at least the next four or five years, and then another five years to ten years beyond it as you migrate to 5G. So I know we have some time to figure this out, but it is a knotty problem and we hope we can figure out a way to get tower-like returns on a complementary asset someday. Operator : Next from the line of Ric Prentiss. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Good morning, guys. James Taiclet : Hey, Ric. Ric Prentiss : Hey. First, appreciate you guys providing AFFO, both on a consolidated and a proportionate basis for the quarter. [indiscernible] several earnings already this morning. Did you provide that AFFO proportionate or to common shareholders for guidance? Thomas Bartlett : Yeah. I mean, Ric, what we're guiding to is that consolidated AFFO, that's always been - our guidance has been based on. I mean, as you well know, over the next several years we have the opportunity to be able to secure more ownership of that Viom asset. And we fully expect that the incremental dollars associated with obtaining that and the cost thereof will be offset by incremental synergies as we're able to secure and merge more of our businesses together in that business and so that's why I continue to look at the consolidated AFFO, because I think that's the better benchmark for us going forward. And so that's what 2016, based upon what the numbers that I just talked about a few minutes ago, that's what our outlook is based on. Ric Prentiss : Okay. In the quarter was there about a $0.05 difference between consolidated and proportionate? Thomas Bartlett : Yes, that's right. Ric Prentiss : And is that something we should assume could be extrapolated out over the year, that same kind of level? Thomas Bartlett : Yeah, it's fair. Ric Prentiss : Okay. Second question is, getting into the weeds a little bit here. There was a fairly noticeable change in your straight-line adjustment for 2016 guidance from the previous guidance to now. I think now you're looking for maybe $124 million of straight-line adjustment versus what was more like $109 million-$110 million previously. What happened there? Is it new contracts or what would cause it to swing that much on an annual guidance. Thomas Bartlett : There're two things really. One is the addition of Viom, in terms of fine-tuning that outlook and understanding again the specific terms underneath those specific leases in terms of what would be straight-lineable or not. So that's the most significant difference between the two. And then ongoing, Ric, there are certain elements that in contracts that when you actually - when the site comes up for renewal it automatically extends for a longer period of time and so that also becomes straight-lineable. But the most significant piece was the Viom transaction. Ric Prentiss : Great. So it's not really any new MLAs or anything like that in the U.S.? Thomas Bartlett : That's right. Ric Prentiss : Okay. Thanks, guys. James Taiclet : Sure. Operator : And the next question is from the line of Tim Horan. Please go ahead. Timothy Horan : Thanks. Jim, could you give us a little more color on India, kind of what's going on from a technology perspective, buying perspective and pricing. It sounds like your pricing is kind of well below the captive kind of tower companies. Any color there would be great. James Taiclet : Sure, Tim. First of all, I'll speak to technology and volume and pricing last. But the technology deployment in India is [indiscernible]. We've got a new entrant just on the cusp of launching national 4G network, which is going to in some ways leapfrog what's available today and also motivating the other market leaders to invest in 4G as well. So we see as Tom said sort of an upcycle in technology investment in India at a scale that may have never been done before given the population in that country. Now that will be over a few years, which has positioned us I think really well with the Viom acquisition as we kind of tuck it in now to ride that wave of technology investment, and there is some great companies involved here. These are significant multinationals like Vodafone as well as Bharti Airtel, as I mentioned Reliance Industries, there is also Reliance Telecom. There is going to be some real competition from really moving quickly through 3G into 4G sort of technology territory. And as we all know, densification and siting equipment needs go up as you go into that higher technology stack. So we're very optimistic about the technology kind of road map for the country. As far as volume, what was interesting about the Viom merger with ATC India was that our major customers happen to be the partners at Indus. So again Airtel, Vodafone, Idea are very large customers of ATC, proportionally not so much actually of Viom where, of course, Tata was the core customer there. So you've got very complementary opportunity when we put these two assets together to drive volume in both directions, which I think is really going to be great for leasing for our market again over the next number of years it'll play out. And then finally pricing, I think it's a miscasting that our pricing is lower than the cap. With our pricing we tend to drive as high as we can without being tethered to the parent and that's been a - I think a fairly successful endeavor. But we do have to stay in the context of the overall market and certainly don't overprice. But I would say that we're probably on the upper-end of pricing, given our independence and the quality of our assets, and finally our ability to do construction jobs quickly and in difficult places. Timothy Horan : I know, historically, in India as you've added more cell sites prices have come down. Do you think overall prices can be stable or growing or shrinking? Just some color on that. James Taiclet : Well, we've talked already probably enough about pricing. Those are individual negotiations ultimately with carriers, but there is going to be more equipment on towers. There is going to be more of them and the outsourced model, I think, with our Viom acquisition. And actually the increasing independence of the captives over some period of time as they go public or float more shares and get more mature will probably be ultimately constructive to that. Timothy Horan : Thank you. Operator : And the next question from the line of Spencer Kurn, please go ahead. Spencer Kurn : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. You've had your perch in Europe for quite a while and we've been seeing tower M&A activity increasing. It doesn't seem like you've been very involved. I would love to understand why you haven't been very active and if there are any specific reasons why European tower assets haven't been appealing to you. Thanks. James Taiclet : Sure, it's Jim. We've been extremely active in business development in Europe for probably 10 years. What hasn't occurred is the asset trading price meeting our investment criteria. It happened once in Germany where we do have a really great base with the KPN assets, now part of Telef\u00f3nica. So we think we're firmly positioned with a great beachhead in the continent and continually strive to work negotiations so that we can get our investment criteria met and invest more in the region. And so far that combination just we have not been able to secure. And that mainly has to do with asset pricing and the characteristics of the market and the returns you will get. So we are poised to, just like with small cells, aggressively pursue assets that meet our investment criteria. If we can locate or determine those, we will act quickly and decisively. When we don't, we will avoid investing in what we would consider at the time to be lower return opportunities, frankly. Spencer Kurn : Great, thank you. Operator : And now to the line of Michael Rollins, please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little about as you look at the industry and see more small cell activity, whether it's your in-building DAS or outside small cells new DAS, there seems to be a more upfront revenue component, which then converts into deferred revenues, some call it prepaid rent. And so how do you look at this category in terms of the impact to revenue, how it affects cash flow, and how you would think about the valuation of assets and a return on your assets between the cash versus some of the non-cash contributions to the income statement? Thanks. Thomas Bartlett : On a pure ROI basis, Michael, in terms of just the economics of whether a project makes sense or not, capital coming in from a customer is clearly going to have an impact in terms of what that ROI is ultimately going to be. Right? I mean, that's just a discounted cash flow. From a P&L perspective, I think you can see from the release and from - of our supplemental that you can - you recognize just how that revenue is being recognized and it's being recognized over the balance of the lease. And you can see that even on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I think the number is around $20 million, it was almost identical to what it was the same quarter of last year. So that number continues to be fairly consistent on an annual basis. There is not a lot of volatility, not a lot of growth, not a lot of decline in it as we continue to invest in those types of systems where we're actually getting capital contributions. So I look at it from two perspectives. One is just from the ROI whether the transaction makes sense, it just goes into the math to determine whether a particular project meets our internal thresholds to be able to move forward with it, and then the recognition of that particular revenue is done over the remaining balance of their lease term. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Thomas Bartlett : Operator, any more calls? Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Leah Stearns : Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're here to help. If you have any further questions you can reach out to myself or the Investor Relations team. And with that, operator, you can close the call.

Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the American Tower Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Leah Stearns. Please go ahead. Leah C. Stearns - American Tower Corp.: Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining American Tower's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I will provide some brief highlights from our financial results. Next, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide a more detailed review of our financial and operational performance for the third quarter as well as our full year outlook for 2016. And finally, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO, will provide a brief update on technology trends and how they impact our business and strategies. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before I begin, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include those regarding our expectations for future growth, including our 2016 outlook, foreign currency exchange rates, dividend growth, leverage and future operating performance, as well as technology and industry trends and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the Risk Factors set forth in this morning's press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. In addition to this morning's press release, we have posted a presentation, which we will reference throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab on our website. So turning to slide 4 of our presentation, I'll provide a few highlights from the third quarter. During the quarter, total property revenue grew approximately 24% to nearly $1.5 billion. Total revenue grew approximately 22% to over $1.51 billion, and net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by approximately 212% to $238 million or $0.55 per diluted common share. Further, adjusted EBITDA grew by more than 17% to approximately $915 million. And consolidated adjusted funds from operations increased by nearly 15% to approximately $641 million or $1.49 per diluted share. And with that I would like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Hey, thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. Hey, we had another quarter of strong organic tenant billings growth and margin performance across our global asset base, in fact, achieving record levels of new business commencements in the quarter. Once again we achieved double-digit growth rates across all of our key metrics. During the period, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.55 per share, which for 2016 we are targeting to grow over 20% from the prior year. Simultaneously, we continued to diligently integrate the Viom assets, while focusing on driving organic growth and scaling our business worldwide. We also achieved our year end leverage target about 3 months ahead of schedule. If you please turn to slide 6, let's take a look at our quarterly results. Total reported property revenue growth was nearly 24%. This included total tenant billings growth of over 21%, of which about 8% was organic, driven by consistent wireless customer demand for our real estate throughout our global footprint. And as I mentioned, organic commenced new business in the quarter was at record levels, about 23% higher than the Q3 of last year, split almost evenly between our U.S. and international businesses. Our U.S. property segment revenue growth was about 3.6%, factoring in a negative 1.7% impact from straight-line revenue recognition. In addition, we booked about $0.5 million in decommissioning revenue this quarter, as compared to about $4 million recorded in Q3 of last year, resulting in an additional 50 basis point negative impact to the growth rate. For the quarter U.S. organic tenant billings growth was right in line with our expectations at 5.7%, reflecting a slight acceleration from Q2. Volume growth from colocations and amendments contributed about 4.4%, while pricing escalators contributed 2.8% and other run-rate items contributed about 30 basis points. This was partially offset by churn of about 1.8%, of which the vast majority was associated with smaller, non-Big Four tenants. And as we disclosed last quarter, operational churn from the Big Four wireless carriers, what we call core networks in the U.S., which is defined as excluding activity on the former Clearwire network, has remained at about 30 basis points. Demand trends in the U.S. remain steady, with carriers actively spending to augment the coverage and capacity of their 4G networks. Our international organic tenant billings growth was 13%, about 725 basis points higher than of that the U.S. While pricing escalators driven by local CPI indices contributed about 7% to that growth, volumes from colocations and amendments were an even larger component, at about 7.3%. Other run-rate items contributed an additional 40 basis points. These all were partially offset by churn of about 1.6%. There was broad strength across our international property segment, with all three achieving double-digit organic tenant billings growth rates for the sixth quarter in a row. Organic tenant buildings growth was almost 14% in Latin America, 12% in EMEA, and over 11% in Asia. Our large, multinational tenants in all these markets continue to make significant investments in their networks, as more and more of their customers gain access to affordable advanced handsets and begin to use significantly more data on those handsets. And these network investments appear to be catalyzing incremental usage as the mobile experience gets better and better. For example, a carrier deploying a new greenfield 4G wireless broadband network in India has reported that its customers on average are already using well over a gig of data per day on that network. Along with trends like this, we expect the geographic tenant and technological diversification built into our business model to continue to drive strong growth rates for our international portfolio. Further, day one revenue associated with the nearly 46,000 sites we've added since the third quarter of last year, which includes the Viom portfolio and about 2,100 new builds, contributed another 13% to our global tenant billings growth in Q3. Our new build program remains active, and we constructed over 350 towers globally this quarter. While this level of build activity was a bit lower than historical levels, we would expect this trend to reverse and build activity to pick up again in Q4. Our newly built sites averaged an NOI yield of over 10% this quarter on a consolidated basis. Moving on to slide 7, gross margin in the quarter was nearly 68%, which was negatively impacted by pass-through revenue and the addition of nearly 46,000 new lower initial margin sites. In the quarter, adjusting for the impact of pass-through, we converted more than 90% of revenue to gross margin on sites that we've owned for more than a year. This strong conversion performance generated rising NOI yields across our portfolio. The average NOI yield on international sites built or acquired up to and including 2009, for example, rose to 32%, while the NOI yield on sites added between 2010 and 2013 improved to 13%. And even on sites added in 2014 and later, including Viom, NOI yields are rising, improving sequentially to about 10%. We think we have a tremendous opportunity to increase these NOI yields over time, particularly on our younger assets. Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was about 60.4% for the quarter, which was similarly impacted by pass-through and new sites. Cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined to 7.4% in the quarter and is expected to be under 8% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter is detailed on slide 8. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 17% to approximately $915 million. And consolidated AFFO grew by nearly 15%, driven by a combination of the solid adjusted EBITDA growth I just mentioned and seasonally lower than expected capital improvement CapEx. We do expect higher levels of capital improvement CapEx in fourth quarter due to the underspend this quarter. Consolidated AFFO per share growth in the quarter was almost 14%, resulting in year-to-date AFFO per share growth of over 12%. Moving on to slide 9, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit rating. In late September, for example, we raised a total of $1 billion in unsecured senior notes with a weighted average maturity of over 7 years at historically low coupon rates for ATC. This transaction increased our average debt tenor to 5.3 years, increased our proportion of fixed rate debt, which is now 76% overall, and even higher for U.S. funded debt at 80%. This transaction also allowed us to continue our long-held strategy of paying down our outstanding bank debt, which has primarily been used to support past acquisitions. This allows us to maximize our financial flexibility. In addition, as of the end of the third quarter, we achieved our goal of reducing our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA to 5 times, 3 months ahead of schedule. Longer term, our target leverage remains between 3 and 5 times. In addition, we continue to be well protected from the impacts of potentially rising interest rates. In fact, a 25 basis point increase in LIBOR would result in just in a $9 million in impact to AFFO on an annualized basis. Turning to slide 10, given our solid year-to-date performance, continued improvements in foreign currency exchange rate forecasts, and Q4 growth expectations that are broadly consistent with our previous assumptions, we are raising our full year guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of our outlook for property revenue by $50 million or about 0.9%, resulting in projected full year growth of almost 22% or just over $1 billion. The increase is being driven by about a $25 million increase in pass-through revenue and a $5 million increase in straight-line revenue on an FX-neutral basis, with the remaining upside being driven by favorability from foreign exchange rate trends, principally those generated in Q3. As in the past, our revised outlook does not contemplate impacts from pending transactions. Within our total revenue projections, we continue to expect U.S. organic tenant billings growth of about 5.8% for the year, which reflects a steady demand environment. Internationally, we expect organic tenant billings growth of over 13%, supported by strong trends in markets like Mexico and Ghana. We do expect slightly lower full year tenant billings growth in India as compared to our prior outlook, primarily due to carriers temporarily pausing some of their activities as they're waiting for the recent spectrum auction to conclude. However, we anticipate that organic tenant billings growth in Asia will increase to the mid-teens level during Q4. At a consolidated level, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be nearly 8%. Day one revenue from sites added in the last year is expected to contribute the balance of our anticipated tenant billings growth through the year or just about 15%. The growth outlined above has resulted in the continued expansion of our base of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue, which now stands at around $32.5 billion, with an average remaining lease term of 5.7 years on a consolidated basis and at about 6.4 years for our Big Four wireless customers in the U.S. We are also raising the midpoint of our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $25 million, resulting in expected full year growth of about 16%, or roughly $500 million. The $25 million increase is being driven by a slight increase in net straight-line, $15 million in FX favorability, and roughly $10 million in expense management outperformance relative to our previous expectations for the property segment. This is being partially offset by a slightly lower expected contribution from our services segment versus our prior outlook, as a result of lower activity levels. Finally, we are raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $30 million or by over 1% at the midpoint, resulting in expected full year growth of about 15% or about $320 million. This $30 million increase is being driven primarily by about a $20 million increase in cash EBITDA and roughly $10 million in lower net interest expense. Assuming an average diluted share count of 429.5 million shares, this implies consolidated AFFO per share of $5.75 at the midpoint, reflecting a per share growth rate of over 13%. Before we move on, I'd also note that factoring in October month-to-date actual FX rates and holding current spot rates constant for the rest of the year would result in additional upside of over $20 million for property revenue, $10 million for adjusted EBITDA and about $5 million of consolidated AFFO relative to the midpoints of our revised outlook. Turning to slide 11, so far in 2016 we have demonstrated an ability to simultaneously de-lever the balance sheet, deploy meaningful capital to both our CapEx and acquisition programs, and continue to fund a common stock dividend, which is expected to grow over 20% versus the prior year. Much of this is attributable to the significant internal cash flow generation capacity of our business, which is illustrated on this slide. As you can see, on a full year basis our projected cash from operations of around $2.5 billion allows us to fully fund over $900 million in expected common stock dividends and more than $700 million in anticipated total capital expenditures, while at the same time leaving us around $1 billion of additional discretionary investment capacity. As a result, we've been able to close significant transactions like Viom as well as other smaller deals for a total of around $2.1 billion year to date and still reach our leverage target of 5 times a full quarter earlier. This leaves us with around $300 million in incremental capacity for the fourth quarter. This estimate doesn't include any of the anticipated proceeds from our European JV transaction, which we announced earlier today. Going forward, we would expect the internal cash flow generation capacity of our business to expand further, as we continue to drive the high-margin conversion ratios on our organic revenue growth throughout our global footprint. In combination with being able to lever our incremental adjusted EBITDA growth, we would expect to have significant recurring investment capacity going forward. In addition, as we announced this morning, we've signed an agreement to form a strategic joint venture in Europe with PGGM. The formation of this joint venture, in addition to aligning us with a high-quality partner, will free up even more cash for us to deploy throughout our higher growth markets. In addition, the JV has been established to explore, evaluate, and potentially invest in new market opportunities in Europe. At closing we will contribute our German assets into ATC Europe, and PGGM will acquire a 49% interest in this entity. American Tower will retain operational control and day-to-day oversight of the business. Turning to slide 12, and in summary, we are well-positioned for a strong finish to the year, as our global business continues to generate solid growth across all of our key metrics. Our outlook now reflects consolidated AFFO per share growth of 13%, up from around 10% in our initial guidance provided in February. And we continue to expect dividend growth of over 20%. Looking forward, we believe we are poised to continue generating meaningful returns for investors for several key reasons. First, we're able to tap into the secular growth trend in mobile on a global scale, which we believe, when combined with our operational execution, will lead to strong recurring growth across our existing asset base. Second, given our proven approach to capital allocation, a solid balance sheet with a capital structure within our targeted range, and healthy free cash flow generation, we will have significant capacity to either invest in our business or return directly back to stockholders. And lastly, we believe we will continue to be able to generate strong growth in our common stock dividend. Putting this all together, we believe that we have built a dynamic, sustainable, long-term model for generating meaningful growth. And with that I'll turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks before we take some Q&A. Jim? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Thanks, Tom. As is our tradition for third quarter calls, I'll focus today's remarks on wireless trends and technology. While the emphasis this morning is on the U.S., we expect similar trends to follow in our other served markets. Mobile data usage continues to escalate rapidly. According to Cisco, the average U.S. smartphone now consumes more than 1.4 gigabits of data per month or a 1,700% increase from just 5 years ago. Video continues to power a significant portion of that usage with advanced devices like the iPhone 7 and services like go90, YouTube, and Netflix. Consequently, total mobile data usage in the U.S. is now at more than 500 terabytes per month. Despite this, 4G penetration is estimated at only 60% to 65% in the U.S. today, indicating that there is still significant growth to come simply from the device upgrade cycle, as subscribers acquire more advanced handsets. So to keep pace with the strain these trends create on mobile networks, the Big Four U.S. wireless carriers have consistently spent about $30 billion per year in CapEx since 2010, or roughly 15% of their total revenue in aggregate. And while the total spend has remained consistent, the per-gigabit cost for wireless carriers has dropped by more than 99% since 2005. This dramatic drop in expenses per-gigabit has been supported through a combination of new spectrum, technology advancements and radio access network investments in new sites. We continue to believe that this level of capital intensity, which has been maintained over the last 10 years and has supported strong organic tenant billings growth for our business, is sustainable over the long term. In addition, over the past 5 years the U.S. government has auctioned or otherwise made available close to 300 megahertz of new spectrum. We expect incremental spectrum assets like AWS-3 and the WCS bands, as well as the 700 megahertz spectrum that's been committed for the forthcoming public safety build-out, to be employed over the next several years. As in the past, to fully capitalize on the availability of this spectrum we anticipate that new antennas and radios will be placed on our towers, which should continue to help support healthy levels of growth for us in the U.S. We also expect the vast majority of these deployments in the near to medium term will take place on 4G macro tower networks, particularly given that the 5G standard isn't expected to be formalized until 2019. Meanwhile, technological advancements such as software defined networks, self-optimizing networks, and Cloud-RAN, among others, continue to focus primarily on the mobile core network. These advancements have enabled mobile carriers to achieve significant savings on their core network operations, freeing up more resources for the radio access network that we support. At the same time, macro towers remain the most cost and technologically efficient solution for radio signal propagation in the vast majority of areas across our country. Looking forward, we expect that improved devices, greater 4G penetration, more and better applications, and consumers' behavior will continue to drive mobile data usage at a 30% to 40% annual growth rate. In addition, the expanding role of the Internet of Things, or IoT, will add further demands on mobile networks. In the near to mid-term this network burden will be shouldered by 4G technology. We expect that any near term 5G deployments will be extremely short range, essentially used for fixed wireless solutions. And furthermore, we expect that many early deployments of 5G will actually be indoors, where ATC is already a leading provider of indoor small cell networks today. Eventually, after the year 2020 we do think 5G technology will be widely applied for mobile applications, beginning first in dense urban areas, then spreading to suburban and rural areas predominantly served by macro towers. This timeline also coincides with the clearing process of the 600 megahertz spectrum that's currently being auctioned. To the extent that this spectrum is in fact used for a broad 5G coverage build-out, we believe it could be a significant benefit for our tower business, given the large size and substantial weight of the antennas required for optimal use of low-band spectrum like 600 megahertz. To the extent you'd like some additional information on the evolution of 4G and the potential impacts of 5G on our business, I'd encourage all of you to reference the presentation we have posted on the Company and Industry Resources section of the American Tower Investor Relations website. So to summarize, we believe that the U.S. is still probably in the fifth or sixth inning of 4G deployments. And that further 4G equipment installations will still be largely on macro towers. And 5G, while initially a primarily fixed wireless broadband technology to compete with the likes of cable, is likely to eventually be deployed for mobile services across our macro tower infrastructure that mainly serves suburban and rural areas, where most Americans live and commute. As a result, we expect to generate solid growth in the U.S. market for years to come. So with that, operator, please open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Phil Cusick. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. I wanted to ask about India and Mexico. It looks like India was a big driver of strength this quarter, but you're guiding to a pause given the auction. Can you talk about what you're seeing lately and what you've seen from the Viom assets? And in Mexico, what does the runway look like there? It seems like two of the three carriers are spending aggressively to deploy LTE. Is that still accelerating? And what do you see from the third carrier? Thanks. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Sure, Phil. It's Jim. On India, there is, now that the auctions are completed, an expectation on our part that we're going to see continued solid growth on our assets. And as far as performance between Viom and legacy ATC India, they're trending just about the same. So we've got solid growth on both sets of assets. And in India there's going to be a significant 4G build-out led by R-Jio, Reliance Jio. And we did recently sign a significant contract with one of the 4G players that's going to drive substantial new business for us starting in the fourth quarter and beyond. So we're really quite confident that India is going to meet our investment objectives. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So is the slow down there sort of a quick planning slow down? And you expect a re-acceleration early next year? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Yeah. I think now that mobile operators understand their spectrum position and the resources, financial resources it took to achieve those, they're now going to be able to make solid plans for their next fiscal year, which, for them, ends in March for this year and begins in April for their next fiscal year. So it should set up for a strong 2017 for us. Then in Mexico... Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And on Mexico? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Yeah. Then in Mexico, there is heightened competition. There's extensive deployment of 4G networks. Service pricing for subscribers has come down due to the competitive, increasingly competitive, wireless environment in the country. That's driving usage, just as it's done in the United States. And so we have really solid growth in Mexico. Our organic tenant billings growth there was more than 13% last quarter. And it'll be at least 11%, maybe more, over the course of this full year. So Mexico is moving towards 4G. The obvious three major players there are AT&T, Telef\u00f3nica, and Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil. I think you'd have to refer to their own statements as to their exact schedules of deployment and pacing. But in our business, we're seeing really solid growth from the whole industry. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, Jim. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you folks could talk a bit more about the prospect for new spectrum deployment in the U.S. You did mention in your prepared remarks your expectations for new spectrum deployment, such as AWS-3, WCS, and FirstNet over the next few years. But it does seem like that we are close to the start date of deploying that spectrum than we have been in the past. Any chance you can provide us with any additional insight here? And then I've got a quick follow-up. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Sure, Amir. Again, it's Jim. On AWS-3, those deployments are beginning. They're going to, we think, be much more robust through 2017 again and similarly, and maybe even a little bit beyond that, for WCS. I'll pause on those two for a second because they're relatively high-band spectrum to be augmenting what's out there today. Ultimately, that means that in addition to, on many sites, not necessarily all sites, but many sites, there will be amendments. There will also need to be eventually a closer and more numerous array of transmission points to get the same signal quality from higher-band spectrum such as this, versus what's out there again deployed today in the 700, 800 [MHz] band. So we expect amendments and a mix of colocations going forward based on that new high-band spectrum being put into place. As to FirstNet's 700 megahertz spectrum, there is scheduled to be a winner of the competition with the government selecting that next month, in November, we are led to understand. But based on the schedule that's out there today, that would infer a probably mid-2017 and beyond deployment of actual equipment. And depending on the winner of the architecture and the roll-out plan, we'd be able to comment further in the next few months on any impacts to our business. But we'd expect them to be in a positive direction. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much. And then on your European JV, what has changed in terms of the market in terms of your interests in that market? I mean clearly, you had assets in the region for some time. We've seen some of the other companies spin out some of their tower assets, the operators spin out some of their tower assets. How are you thinking about that opportunity over the longer term? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: We're thinking about it today similarly as we have over the last 7 or 8 years, which is we're eager to get a strategic position of size in the European market, but we've only found one opportunity in Germany with KPN a few years ago, where we could meet our investment criteria as far as asset pricing and then the characteristics that we thought the business would evolve to over time. It's a relatively lower growth market. Our price points need to reflect that when we do asset purchases and hope that there will be more opportunities to achieve that over the next few years, Amir. What this joint venture sets us up to do is should we and our partners at PGGM believe that we have a good opportunity, we'll be able to finance it much more efficiently. We could, in theory, do a large-scale move in Europe with our partner with much less strain on our own balance sheet potentially. And PGGM is very attractive to us, because not only have they been a long-term investor across many industries in Europe, so we get the benefit of their insights of the region, they've also been very active in the tower space over the years. And we've dealt with them before. So we think we've got the best partner to ride along with us as we continue to evaluate and hope to find some European investments over the next few years that meet our investment criteria. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for very much for the incremental color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan. Please go ahead. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks a lot, guys. Maybe at a broad level, Jim, we added a lot of LTE coverage and capacity a few years ago. Where are the carriers at a high level in terms of adding capacity? And what's the breakdown look like in terms of amendments and maybe new cell sites? And then just also a clarification on India, I think you said next quarter it's going to go to the mid-teens. From everything you know on India at this point, do you think this is kind of sustainable for a few years? Thanks. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: So sure. Just start with the U.S., and I'll begin with coverage and capacity for LTE. Most of the country, per their public announcements, has reasonably solid coverage across all four of the major U.S. national carriers. And there's a lot of capacity work that still needs to be done, though. And the other piece of this, as I said, is we've got higher band spectrum and much more video content being run across the network, which indicates that you're going to have to have cell sites closer together for the high-band spectrum, simply because when you do carrier aggregation, you're ultimately going to have to solve for the lowest common denominator of spectrum, meaning the shortest transmission range. And as you get into 1.9, 2.1, 2.5 [GHz] types of spectrum, you're going to have to have more numerous cell sites frankly over time. So that's still going to have to happen both for a capacity need, which is more bits of throughput, as we've talked about, going through that network. And also the higher signal to noise quality that you need, because your spectrum doesn't travel as robustly. And secondly, you've got video, which requires much more powerful signals to be usable. So we still think there's again three or four good solid innings, if not more, of 4G capacity and edge coverage deployment in front of us in the United States. The amendments and co-locations, Tom, you can give the latest number on that. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Yeah. I mean in the \u2013 hey, Tim. In the U.S. we've been roughly 70%/30% kind of amendment to co-lo. And interestingly enough, international, it's been almost exactly the flip of that. It's been about 70% co-lo, 30% amendments. And I would expect that typical type of trend to occur over the next 6 to 12 months. We'll see what kind of impacts the \u2013 some of the spectrum being deployed that Jim mentioned before. And with regards to India, we do expect a heightened activity in Q4. If you take a look at over the last six to eight quarters in Asia, Tim, we've been in kind of that 10% to 13% kind of growth range on a organic tenant billings basis. My sense is that that's probably a fair range looking forward in that market. With the $10 billion that the carriers just spent on spectrum in the market, we know that they're going to want to get that deployed. And so we see 4G activity going on in the market. So a lot of good things are happening in India. But I don't think the mid-teens type of a rate that we're going to see in Q4 is something that we'll see long term. I think it'll revert back to some of the more traditional kind of 10% to 12% kind of growth rates. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Yeah. And I think to support those kind of 10% to 12% growth rates in a market like India, if you look some of the real fundamentals there, first of all, the industry structure is rationalizing and becoming sustainable for long-term investment. Right? So you're going to have probably half a dozen at least well-financed, scaled operators that can actually effectively and profitably deploy 4G across that vast country. So you've got an industry structure that's rationalizing. Secondly, spectrum and narrow bands and also very sort of fractionalized deployment of spectrum has been a limiting factor on mobile data deployment in India. That's been essentially cleaned up, if you will, or again rationalized with this latest auction and some of the smaller players either exiting, et cetera, giving those bigger players not only the financial capacity to do 4G but now the spectrum position to do it effectively as well. So as a platform, you've got the industry and the spectrum in place to do it. And you've got a pattern of investments already by the carriers there that look a lot like those in the U.S. They're spending 15% to 20% of their revenue on capital expenditures, similar to as the U.S. did during its growth phase. There's $4.5 billion to $5 billion a year being spent in India by these carriers now. And they've got so much work to do, because far below 25% of the subscribers have 3G or 4G. 75% to 85% of people in India are still literally on 2G, texting and talking on their phones. There's incredible opportunity there. And then on top of everything else, you've got this catalyst of Reliance Jio out there sort of leading the market. So this low double-digit growth rate, as Tom suggested, we think can be sustained for quite some time. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Barden. Please go ahead. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess the first one would be, Tom, can you just put some numbers around this European JV? Specifically, how much money are you getting? How does it value the portfolio? And kind of compare and contrast the cost of funding that you think you can generate there versus in the U.S. And then second, just on the ForEx. Obviously it's not a huge issue this quarter because it's working for us. But historically you've had a approach to picking the guidance numbers for FX. I think it was the trailing 30 days or the consensus average forecast. And given for instance in the real how big the delta is between your guidance and the spot rate, I was wondering if you'd kind of inform where that number comes from. And then lastly just as a housekeeping item, I think you'd said something about maintenance CapEx being deferred in the quarter. I was wondering if you could size that for us. Thanks. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Yeah, sure, Dave. First of all, just on the European joint venture, we're looking to secure about $250 million \u2013 or \u20ac250 million on the transaction. So that gives you a sense of the \u2013 kind of the sizing of it. And then as Jim and I both had mentioned, we'll be using, pushing our assets into a European JV. We own and we operate it and control it. But we're really excited about having PGGM in the operation. And we'll look to bring that cash back and reinvest it as we talked about it in some other high-growth opportunities. We'll have additional capacity, as I also mentioned, because we've achieved our target leverage kind of 90 days before we had thought. So that will leave us with roughly $300 million of capacity. And then we'll have this additional \u20ac250 million. So we feel good about how we're ending the year, where we are from the balance sheet perspective. On the FX side, you're right. As I've always kind of said, we know we're going to be wrong in terms of how we look at FX, but we're consistent. And so the forecast that we've used for the balance of the year is exactly as you laid out. It's the more conservative of what the year-end forecast would be that we find on \u2013 that we see that the banks put out on Bloomberg or the last 90 days of an average spot rate. And so we've been very consistent with that. So the upside that we have included now in our outlook really includes the FX benefits that we generated versus our previous outlook in Q3. And so there were very little incremental Q4 FX upside at you look at it in our outlook. So as I say, it's \u2013 we just want to be very consistent and very transparent in terms of how we look at FX. It's well documented in our disclosures. And that's why then even in the remarks that I made, we talked about some of the additional upside, Dave, that we might have relative to a \u2013 the rates continuing for the \u2013 as they are, the spot rates for the balance of the year. And that was that $20 million I think upside of revenue, which is principally coming from the real. You're right. It's significantly \u2013 the spot is significantly below where the forecasted rate is. And it has been all year. And that's provided us less headwinds, if you will, for the year and perhaps some upside for Q4. And then the \u2013 you asked so many questions, Dave. What was the last one? David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I'm sorry. It was the maintenance CapEx deferral I think you referred to in the script. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Yeah. The maintenance CapEx, it is seasonal. I mean if you go back and you look at the trends for last several years, we do generally have a pick up into Q4. And that's usually \u2013 that's largely being driven by some of the carriers themselves, but also just our own ability to kind of close out the year. So we're probably looking at about a $10 million increment in Q4 versus Q3. At least that's what would be in the outlook. David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. All right. Thanks, Tom. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins. Please go ahead, sir. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious if you just look at the newer presentation that you're doing for organic revenue growth. Within the U.S., I think in the old disclosures you used to look for a 6% to 8% long-term growth of site leasing. How should we think about the longer-term growth for site leasing under the new set of disclosures and under current market conditions? Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: I mean, really, virtually it's kind of the same, Michael. I mean there are some nuances in how we're looking at billings growth. We think it's a better representation of what's really being built. It excludes some of the volatility of some of those items that we've talked in the past, like decommissioning revenue and some of those types of things. In the 5.7%, 5.8% growth this year is what we consider real growth in the sustainable recurring growth going in the business. So I think the definitions are actually very similar, candidly. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: And, Michael, it's Jim. Good morning. We're going to really stick to annual guidance, so we explain where each piece part comes from. We've become such a diversified company now that we think we can hit long-term double-digit AFFO per share growth using all of the mechanisms in all of the markets that we have to work with going forward. And so therefore, we're going to stick more to letting you know when we have timely information from the carriers and a pipeline what the annual growth rates look like in each market. And sort of eschew sort of these long-term aspirational objectives, given we're going to be transitioning from 4G to 5G and operating now in 13 markets. So we'll do that on a annual basis going forward. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And if I could just follow up. Given some of the comments that you've made on timing for spectrum deployment and some of the higher-level themes that you see impacting site leasing revenues over the next few years, what should investors' expectations be around the timing of new MLA opportunities with some of your large customers? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Michael, again, it's Jim. Those are really specific to the situation with the carrier. What's the existing agreement? How long does it last? Do they have a new build plan coming upon them that they want to talk about, a longer-term rearrangement of the contracts? So there's really no way to predict when a mobile operator is going to want to renegotiate an MLA. And what I think you can expect from us is consistent communication with the mobile operators. Our goal, as I've said, is to achieve the most value for our assets and for our investors, while also providing a path to the mobile operator for the most efficient life-cycle costs for the deployment of the infrastructure that they expect they're going to need and try to find that common ground. And so that's what we'll always continue to do. And it'll take different forms of agreement, and it'll take different timing of agreement based on the specific carriers' interest and needs. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Two questions, if I may. First, on U.S. churn, if I look at 2016 year-to-date versus 2015, we've seen that moderate. And I'm just curious if your expectation will be that that should continue. I guess more specifically if there's any other consolidation or iDEN churn out there that we should be still thinking about, just a reminder on that, if we're going to get back to normal levels. And then, it's been touched on a little bit already on the call, but this thought around amendments versus new co-lo opportunity, and I appreciate that it's been largely amendments last year, it's been largely amendments this year, it's expected to be largely amendments next year. But as I'm sure you can appreciate, investors are debating if that's a structural change or if that is something that's simply timing. And part of that is around small cells. And while I appreciate that small cells are more expensive to build, and it's more efficient to deploy a macro, the carriers to some degree are capital constrained. And if they do need to be building out small cells and something else has to go in terms of where they're making the investment, one could argue that it seems to be cell splitting. And I'm just curious where the confidence comes from that you think that at some point we will see the cell splitting aspect kind of come back into vogue? Thanks. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Hey, Colby. Let me first, on the churn side. In 2015, as I recall, we had some smaller customers churn off. And so our churn rates are in that 1.5% to 1.8%, 2% kind of range. So I would expect that kind of churn rate to continue. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: So on the whole equation, if you will, of amendments co-locations, small cells. The amendment and co-location percentages has drifted and varied over time, depending again on what the carriers are doing with their networks. And the reality of how regional real estate managers and the mobile operators or regional network managers operate is that they get a budget every year. And they're going to use that budget, whether it's $5 million or $10 million or $50 million for their region for that period, they're going to use that budget in the most efficient way they can determine to solve the network issues that they have in front of them. And we've got pretty close experience with a lot of these folks. And their list of things to do seems to always exceed the budget they have awarded to them for that year. So there's always network needs to either increase capacity, improve coverage, limit their own churn off to meet growing demand, et cetera. And the list exceeds the budget. So the shake out of amendments versus co-los, it's really what solves the most problems in that given year. And there's always more amendments and more co-los than they can actually do. When it comes to small cells, you just indicated that's probably the least efficient, especially outdoor small cells, are the least efficient option of these individuals to spend their budget. And so they spend that budget in the places only and at the times only on small cells, is our experience, when they have to do so. And so our experience on the total spend going to macro site-type deployments versus small cell site deployments, we've said in the past is about 5% of what we can see right now going to small cells. And perhaps over the next 5 years, that could go as high as 10% of the total, with the total itself growing because of the percentage of revenue and revenue growing. So we really don't see wholesale shifts in the spending pattern or the habits of the people that we deal with in the field on the front line of the mobile operators. And hopefully, that addresses your question. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. I just wanted to get some clarification around your full-year guidance. And just to make sure I get this right, you increased the midpoint of your property revenue guidance by $50 million. All of that appears to be an improvement in your outlook for your international segment. We know that about $23 million of that is currency, so the rest of it would be unrelated to currency. But you actually lowered your outlook for organic tenant billings growth in the international segment. So I was hoping you could just kind of close that gap for us. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Yeah. I mean, it's small. It's really immaterial, Brett. But really it's pass-through I think is really making up the delta. So you're right. It's just over $20 million in FX and $25 million or so in pass-through and there's a little bit of straight line. And some of that is actually occurring in our U.S. business, which gets you to the $50 million. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to go back to the JV really quickly so I understand what you're doing. Are you effectively selling 49% of the business that you have right now in Europe? Meaning all of that cash will be coming back to you or are you actually planning on leaving some of that to fund the JV? And then regardless, if the JV finds investment opportunities going forward, is that going to be funded kind of on an as needed basis? Meaning that there will be a call on your capital and would you strive to maintain at least a 51% ownership as you do more deals? Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Yeah. It's not a sale, Brett. I mean, we're contributing the assets, and PGGM is going to be our investing partner in that new joint venture. And yes, the cash that we are going to be receiving for that 49% is going to be reinvested in other parts of the business coming back to the U.S. We'll determine where we're going to put it. But yes, that is leaving the JV. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Yeah. Brett, just to give you a little bit of background of why we're going forward with this, first of all, it really is an initiative that achieves objectives in all three of our sort of strategic pillars that we've had in place for the last 15 years since I've been CEO here. The first of those pillars is to put ourselves in a situation where we can achieve strategic positioning in a leadership rank of independent tower companies or mobile infrastructure companies in all the most populous regions of the world. All right? And we have that in the U.S. We have that in Latin America. We have that in India. We have that in Africa. And in Europe we'd like to pursue other avenues to achieve that, as long as they meet our investment criteria. So for strategic positioning PGGM is an excellent partner for us in the region to give us a wider window for potential expansion into the market if we \u2013 again, if and only if we can meet our ATC investment criteria, which as you know is pretty strict. The second of our strategic pillars is to be, in our aspiration, the top execution, experience, and operator in this space in the world. Right? And I think PGGM has stepped up and validated with us that we are that operating partner of choice. And that we can then team up with others with regional experience or regional positioning to try to achieve that growth aspiration. And thirdly, it's therapeutic to our balance sheet. We've always wanted a strong balance sheet along the way over the last 15 years. We've maintained investment grade for many, many years in spite of growing the business very dramatically, as you've seen us do. And we are going to give proceeds from this that will both help our leverage position in the short term and allow us to redeploy it into newer growth opportunities in the mid to long term. So I think that really this arrangement hits all three of our strategic pillars, strategic positioning, validates our operational expertise, and is conductive to our balance sheet strategy. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And is this an exclusive JV? Meaning anything that you're doing or anything that they're going to be doing in Europe will be done through this JV? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Yes. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. Good morning. I wondered if you can talk a little bit about your broadcast business in North America. And any change that you maybe foresee given the broadcast auctions and maybe the change in the configurations on your broadcast towers. And then on Africa, if you could maybe just give us an update? I think there's been some tuck-in acquisitions in some of the smaller markets. And then with Nigeria and maybe some of your \u2013 the trends that you're seeing with respect to MTN and Vodacom and CapEx trends in that market and across the continent. Thank you. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Sure, Jonathan. It's Jim. As far as our broadcast business, it's mid-single digit percent of our revenue; a really solid piece of our business, which has very long-term contracts as you know in the TV and radio space. And with the incentive auctions going on now, there are going to be a few moving parts that we think we're in a really excellent position to sort of address and take advantage of. You may recall 3 or 4 years ago, we acquired Richland Towers, which was I guess the second-largest independent in the space, and so we have a really solid position to help the broadcasters that either retain or divest some of their spectrum to stay on-air. Right? So they're going to have to have sites that are both simultaneously transmitting in a market while equipment is being taken down or put up. So we will have plenty of sites for them to move to in the process. And we'll be able to be we think the real estate provider of choice, as this TV station shuffle of spectrum and channels goes through. So we think it's going to be a nice, solid growth business that's going to contribute to our U.S. operations for many years here. As far as the small deals that we're doing, it's the same disciplined investment process that we've had in place for years and years. We've got these very highly qualified teams, I would describe them as, across all the continents globally that are continuing to always look for opportunities for us to invest and meet our criteria of those investments and get AFFO accretive deals for us. And sometimes those are big like in Viom or Verizon or GTP. And sometimes those are modest sized, like in South Africa, we are acquiring the Eaton Towers, adding about 300 sites to our portfolio. It makes a ton of sense for us tactically and strategically. And we'll go ahead and do those smaller deals. Now Africa, as you saw from Tom's presentation, is one of our fastest-growing regions. Much like India, there's incredible need and demand not only currently, but far into the future for mobile service there. There are very low-cost handsets that are going to accelerate the adoption of 3G and 4G for people in those countries that really, really need it. And we've got kind of a pole position there. Certainly in South Africa, we're the independent leader. In Nigeria, we're one of the top two. In Ghana, in Uganda, we are also the clear leader as independents, we feel. So we've got a really good strategic positioning in the countries that we think we need to be in there. And the trends are going to be very similar for the mid- to long-term in Africa as they will be in India, where we think we can sustain double-digit growth rates. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: And I also just want to further clarify and provide some color on Brett's question on the JV. I mean we expect this JV to be a platform for us to be able to expand in the region. And I'm not going to get into any of the details relative to the JV agreement. But there's always a process within the agreement to the extent that the carriers aren't able to or don't desire to for one to be able to expand in the market without the other. So just wanted to make sure that, Brett, I gave that additional color to you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss. Please go ahead. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Morning, guys. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Hi, Ric. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for getting me in there. Busy earnings day. I'd like to ask one on the joint venture again. I think it's very creative, nice way to monetize it. But like Tommy just pointed out, you get to stay in the region. Can you give us any color on kind of how the value was arrived at or what kind of multiple the valuation you achieved at? And Dutch pension money, a lot of times very patient long-term money. Is there a possibility to maybe increase the in-country debt funding or in-continent debt funding with that vehicle? Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Yeah. I mean, Ric, the answer is yeah. I mean to the extent that there is more euros being generated in the market, there's definitely going to be more opportunity to be able to raise capital on that in the market. So the business itself in Germany, as you know, is not a significant business for us overall from a consolidated perspective. So we don't have significant amounts of euros being generated. We have been able to candidly pull out a fair amount of cash from the business over the last 3 or 4 years since we've owned it. But we're hopeful that to the extent that this platform proves successful, and as Jim said, we have deals over there that make sense for us, that we would be able to increase our exposure into the marketplace. And relative to multiples and things like that, we're really under engaged (1:00:07) to be able to disclose any of those. I think we feel really good about the values that have been ascribed to this business. And I think we have, as Jim said, just a really solid platform to be able to look at other opportunities, therapeutic to the \u2013 all of the things that Jim mentioned in terms of supporting our strategic goals in the business. We're really excited about this opportunity. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That makes sense. And then you mentioned the $300 million capacity in the U.S. and the \u20ac250 million coming back to you. How should we think about stock buybacks versus transactions given the current environment out there? Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Well there is a \u2013 the transaction deal pipeline has increased around the globe in all of the regions, really absent the U.S. So there is opportunity there. But we don't have any plans to remark on at this point in time to invest in some of those transactions. Our business development teams continue to look at opportunities as I mentioned. And relative to the buy back I think, as Jim mentioned, when we come back in February and talk about our goals and plans for 2017, we can get in a little bit more specific. And we'll have 3, 4 months of more knowledge in terms of just what the activity might look like for the year. We expect to be at that 5 times or below, clearly with this kind of cash that we're going to be getting from the JV and the additional capacity we have. So we feel really good in terms of ability to hit our targets that we laid out at the beginning of the year. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: One final quick one. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: And positioned as well for next year. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: One final quick one. Do you have in the U.S. any towers that have just CPI escalators? We noticed that one of the other tower companies had their escalators come in lower than we would have thought, and that's because they had a chunk of towers that had CPI in the U.S. base, which in essence have almost been zero escalator. So any significant magnitude of U.S. towers that have CPI based that would be fairly low escalators versus the traditional more like 3%-ish? Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Less than 5%, Ric. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks so much for getting me in on the questions. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: You bet. Leah C. Stearns - American Tower Corp.: Well thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And to the extent you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. We're here to help. Have a great day.

And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning and thank you for taking the time to join us today. I\u2019m glad to be here to share our fourth quarter financial and operational results with you as well as some highlights regarding our full-year 2016 performance. We finished the year strongly reporting record levels of fourth quarter revenues, FFO per share and cash flow while continuing to grow, expand and improve across the organization. We also executed well on our strategic priorities in Q4 completing the development of our largest multi-tenant data center, acquiring extensive capacity for future growth and attracting numerous key customers to our data center communities. Compared to Q4 2015, we reported 33% growth in FFO per share driven by 22% growth in revenue and 27% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Since CoreSite\u2019s IPO in 2010, we have been on a journey to profitably expand and deepen our footprint in the essential data center markets we serve across the nation. We believe that this strategy and its execution, has enabled us to create sustainable value for our customers and shareholders. With that in mind, I want to share some highlights of our performance since our IPO. Based on Q4 annualized amounts, we have nearly tripled total operating revenues to a run rate of approximately $440 million exiting 2016. Both FFO per share and adjusted EBITDA have increased at a compound annual rate of 27% while our adjusted EBITDA margin has expanded nearly 1,600 basis points from 37% to 53%. We have increased our dividend annually and the current level reflects a compound annual growth rate of 35%. We have also increased the size of our operating data center portfolio at a 12% compound annual growth rate almost all of which has been organic growth. And we ended 2016 with almost 1,100 customers compared to approximately 630 at the end of 2010. We have been able to achieve these results due to our unwavering focus on the execution of our business strategy based on the needs of our customers and our financial discipline. An important piece of our strategy has been to deepen our presence in existing markets, to increase our operational scale and strengthen our competitive positioning within these markets. Our data center campuses are thoughtfully located and designed to provide the greatest possible appeal to and flexibility for our diverse customer base. CoreSite\u2019s eight markets are centers of population density, business activity and economic health and currently comprised 20% of the U.S. population and 27% of U.S. GDP. We believe these markets contain a large and diverse pool of customer prospects which require access to network dense data center facilities, to support their performance sensitive applications and to interconnect securely and reliably with their business partners. Additionally, our markets contain a large and generally growing list of enterprises with increasing data center demands and increasing sophistication about outsourcing their IT architecture. Our industry is fortunate to be exposed to very strong underlying demand trends which we believe should sustain double-digit growth for a number of years. Our full-year 2016 performance demonstrates consistent execution and efficient go-to-market strategy and the robust customer communities we have built across our platform as evidenced by the strong sales results for the year with 579 new and expansion leases executed totaling $49 million in annualized GAAP rent, a 6% increase over 2015. In addition, we commenced a record 443,000 square feet of data center space in 2016 due in part to better than expected leasing performance at SV7. This translates to $59 million in annualized GAAP rent commenced during the year, a 37% year-over-year increase. We continue to see consistent demand across our markets from customers requiring high-performance, low-latency co-location solutions which, is well distributed across each of our key verticals of network providers, cloud service providers and enterprises. Supply and demand seemed generally in balance on the wholesale side in most of our markets. However, we are mindful of reports of increased appetite from privately funded developers. As it relates to our largest markets, we\u2019re seeing steady demand and a consistent balance with supply in Los Angeles. In the Bay area, capacity across the market remains relatively lean while demand remains quite healthy, with pricing remaining firm. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 80,000 unoccupied square feet available across the Silicon Valley market, and we continue to explore opportunities for expansion in this market. Regarding Northern Virginia and DC, we continue to see robust demand particularly from the enterprise vertical. Although supply appears to be increasing, the current environment remains well balanced and our leasing pipeline is healthy. We\u2019re looking forward to commencing construction on our Reston campus expansion this year. Lastly, we have seen some positive momentum in the New York, New Jersey market with an increase in the pace of leasing in Q4. Demand continues to be concentrated among smaller customer requirements with very good traction among enterprises and more specifically the financial services industry. While the sales cycle remains somewhat extended relative to other markets, we\u2019re optimistic about the recent moment and our funnel. In summary, 2016 was another solid year of growth and investment as we continue to enhance our platform and customer experience. We remain focused on executing this business model which has served our customers and shareholders well. As you will hear from Jeff later in the call, we continue to expect solid growth this year and are optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith : Thanks Paul. I will begin by reviewing our overall new and expansion sales activities during the fourth quarter, and then I discuss in more detail our vertical and geographic results. Our Q4 new and expansion sales totaled $7.4 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 35,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $212 per square foot. These results completed a record sales year of $49 million in annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases, comprised of 246,000 square feet at a weighted average GAAP rental rate of $198 per square foot. Regarding the composition of our new and expansion leasing by deployment size, leased signed of 5,000 square feet or less totaled $5.8 million in annualized GAAP rent and accounted for 126 of the 127 transactions signed in Q4. During the fourth quarter we signed one lease greater than 5,000 square feet, which was an expansion of the existing multi-site customer. For the full year, we signed 579 new and expansion leases, a record level and an increase of 10% compared to 2015. As we continue to refine our efforts to attract performances that require us to our data centers, we also continue to enhance the already thriving customer communities across our footprint. And therefore, our attractiveness to cloud, network and other service providers will collectively benefit from this diverse customer base. Further to that point, we had another successful quarter attracting new logos to our four largest data center campuses, where 91% of our new logos in Q4 distributed across these markets. As it relates to our vertical distribution, 64% of our new logos were in the enterprise vertical. This group of new enterprise customers includes a cutting edge technology company, specializing and designing and developing high-performance electric vehicles for large international law firm, a leading accounting and management consulting firm and the largest graduate school of education in the United States. The net of customer churn, we added 30 net new logos in Q4 and 83 net new logos in 2016. Beyond our new and expansion leasing, our renewal activity in Q4 resulted in renewals totaling approximately 52,000 square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $183 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 2.9% on a cash basis and 5.5% on a GAAP basis. For the full-year, our cash rent growth is 3.9% in-line with the mid-point of our guidance. Churn in the fourth quarter was 1.9% which included approximately 135 basis points of churn related to the previously announced multi-site customer that vacated certain elements of these deployments across our platform. For the full-year, churn was 7.8% and in-line with our guidance. Turning to interconnection performance, Q4 interconnection revenue increased 16% over the prior year fourth quarter. For the full-year, interconnection revenue is up 20% year-over-year, slightly ahead of the high-end of guidance. Q4, total interconnection volume growth of 11.6% was comprised of 16% growth in fiber cross-connects and 11% growth in logical interconnection services, which includes CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange and our Any2 Exchange for Internet peering. Before diving into our vertical performance, I wanted to point out that in Q4 and moving forward, we have simplified how we report on our vertical classifications. As such, we will now report on only three verticals, network, cloud and enterprise. Visual content providers, system integrators and managed service providers remain under the enterprise umbrella but will no longer be independently broken out. With respect to our vertical mix, during Q4, network and cloud customers accounted for 34% of annualized GAAP rents signed. Within our cloud vertical, we had strong positive activity correlating to a number of new logos, including multi-site public on-ramps with a leading cloud provider that signed with us in two markets. In addition, during the quarter, we signed expansions with software driven cloud networking solutions provider and additional public cloud on-ramp in Los Angeles and a hosted global cloud provider of business applications. In the network vertical, we continue to see expansions with existing customers as well as new logos joining the thriving carrier community. Notably, we recently announced the CoreSite\u2019s Los Angeles campus would be the North American access point for the CUS Transpacific Cable System which should begin operating in Q2 2017. This will be sixth sub-sea cable to offer direct access from our Los Angeles campus, augmenting the importance of CoreSite\u2019s data center platform and providing transpacific connectivity to the Indonesian and Asian markets. As it relates to our enterprise vertical, we continue to see good momentum with this vertical accounting for 66% of annualized GAAP rent. Specifically in Q4, we signed a sizeable expansion of a large global financial services organization as well as a new mobile content customer that moved from its existing third party data center in Los Angeles to support the launch of a new product. In addition, we signed leases with a leading interactive entertainment company, a large international bank and an international ad exchange. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases during Q4 were Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and Northern Virginia DC, collectively representing nearly 80% of annualized GAAP rents signed in the quarter. Demand remains very consistent in our Los Angeles market, with a good pace of leasing amongst small to mid-size customer requirements. Related, we continue to see a healthy amount of leasing at our LA2 facility. In Q4, signings of that facility accounted for 66% of annualized GAAP rents signed in Los Angeles markets, as many customers are seeking to cost effective option in that market that will allow them to scale their deployments while still easily accessing the strong distributor networks made of LA1. In terms of verticals, enterprise was the strongest in this market, followed by network and cloud. Stabilized occupancy in the Los Angeles campus was 92.6% at the end of Q4, up 250 basis points compared to Q3 while pre-stabilized occupancy increased to 24.3% from 15.6% last quarter. Leasing on the Bay Area continues to be dynamic, where lease is executed across all of our multi-tenant data centers in this market, and especially strong demand for our new facility at SV7. As you know, we saw strong pre-leasing at SV7 during construction and opened the facility at 62% leased. Including incremental leasing in Q4, we ended the quarter at 75% leased. Stabilized occupancy across the Silicon Valley market increased 110 basis points to 96.7%.In terms of verticals, Q4 lease executions in this market were weighted towards cloud deployments followed by enterprise deployments. Northern Virginia DC, transaction volume remains healthy with good demand among smaller and mid-size requirements. Enterprise demand remained strong with these customers accounting for 50% of our new logos signed in the Northern Virginia DC market. Stabilized occupancy across the market now stands at 96.1%, a decrease of 10 basis points on a sequential basis. We have been successful, in fact filling two thirds of the space with churned out view one in the Q3 and remain optimistic about our ability to re-lease the remainder of that space at favorable economics. 2016 was a strong year for leasing activity at CoreSite. We will continue to focus on driving increased diversity across our footprint and work to deliver value and addressing the growing needs of our customers. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. My remarks today will begin with a review of our Q4 financial results followed by an updated of our development CapEx and our leverage and liquidity capacity. I will then conclude my remarks with an overview of our 2017 guidance. Q4 financial results resulted in total operating revenues of $110.5 million, a 9.1% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 21.5% increase over the prior year period. Q4 operating revenue consisted of $91.8 million in rental and power revenue from data center space, up 10.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 22.9% year-over-year. Interconnection services revenue contributed $14 million to operating revenues in Q4, an increase of 4.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 16.3% year-over-year. And tenant reimbursement and other revenues were $2.1 million. Office and light industrial revenue was $2.6 million, which includes revenue associated with our recently closed acquisition of the light industrial office park in Reston Virginia. Q4 FFO was $1.06 per diluted share in unit, an increase of 17.8% on a sequential quarter basis and 32.5% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $16.6 million increased 16.3% on a sequential quarter basis and 27.1% over the same quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 240 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter to a record level of 54.9% and expanded 200 basis points to 53% for the full-year 2016. Related, for the full-year, our revenue flow-through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO was 63% and 61% respectively. As it relates to our reported AFFO results in the quarter, we had a significant increase in straight-line rent which was $5.4 million in Q4. This increase relates to contractual rent relief adjustments resulting from the modestly delayed delivery of SV7. We expect straight-line rent to return to normalized levels in the first quarter. Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter totaled $4.3 million or 3.9% of total operating revenues. For the full-year sales and marketing expenses correlated to 4.4% of total operating revenues, 40 basis points below the 2015 level as we continue to focus on increasing efficiency and productivity across the sales and marketing organization. General and administrative expenses were $8.4 million in Q4 correlating to 7.6% of total operating revenues. For the full-year, G&A expenses correlated to 8.8% of total operating revenues, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to 2015 and slightly below our guidance. Regarding our same-store metrics, Q4 same-store turnkey data center occupancy increased 140 basis points to 90% from 88.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 7.5% year-over-year and 0.7% sequentially to $1,529. Similar to what we saw last quarter, on a per unit basis growth in our interconnection and power revenues are driving the solid year-over-year increase in MRR per cab-E. In Q4, we completed construction of SV7 and placed into service 227,000 net rentable square feet across three floors. Two of the three floors are 100% leased and occupied and therefore are reflected on our stabilized operating portfolio. The third floor consisting of 77,000 square feet is reflected in our pre-stabilized pool and is 26% occupied. As we have discussed previously, we define stabilization as the earlier to occur of 85% occupancy or 24 months after we place an asset into service. Lastly, we commenced 189,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $185 per square foot which represents $34.9 million of annualized GAAP rent. This record level of commencements reflects the previously discussed backlog of leases at SV7, which account for approximately 80% of the annualized GAAP rent commenced in Q4. We ended the fourth quarter with our stabilized data center occupancy at 94.5% an increase of 80 basis points compared to the third quarter, and an increase of 200 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Turning now to backlog. Projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $5.7 million as of December 31, 2016, or $15 million on a cash basis. We expect almost the entire GAAP backlog to commence during the first quarter. Turning to our development activity, we had a total of 27,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity under construction as of December 31, 2016, with expansion projects in Los Angeles, Denver and Boston. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we have spent $7.7 million of the estimated $22.3 million required to complete the expansions. As shown on Page 21 of the supplemental, the percentage of interest capitalized in Q4 was 11%, and for the full-year it was 24.6% in line with our guidance. For 2017, we expect a percent of interest capitalized to be in the range of 10% to 15% reflecting the lower level of development relative to increases in interest expense. Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2016, our ratio of net principal debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.8 times including preferred stock, the ratio was 3.3 times, in line with the Q3 level and still below our stated target ratio of approximately 4 times. Including preferred stock, the year-end level correlates to incremental debt capacity of approximately $165 million at December 31 based upon Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA. As you can see from our guidance, for capital expenditures in the supplemental, we expect to deploy capital of $257 million in 2017 with $220 million associated with data center expansion projects. As a result, we expect to add incremental debt financing during the first half of 2017 to increase liquidity and extend term on existing debt drawn on our credit facility. Timing, pricing and the type of debt are dependent on market conditions and we\u2019ve targeted a total issuance amount of $150 million to $250 million which will be used to pay down our credit facility and fund development, with the intent of maintaining a healthy balance between our fixed and variable price debt. This anticipated debt issuance is included in our guidance, which I will discuss in more detail later. As it relates to our dividend, during the fourth quarter we announced an increase in our dividend to $0.80 per share on a quarterly basis or $3.20 per share on an annual basis. This correlates to a 51% increase over the prior year dividend rate and is in line with our AFFO growth of 46% in 2016. We modestly increased our dividend payout ratio to 74% of FFO based on the mid-point of our 2017 guidance. We believe this aligns us with the best performing REITs historically and reflects our cumulative growth in cash flow, scale and operating effectiveness since our IPO. Now in closing, I would like to address guidance for 2017. I will remind you that our guidance reflects our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our market as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor any changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions, or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. As detailed on Page 23 of our Q4 earnings supplemental, our guidance for 2017 is as follows. Total operating revenue is estimated to be $470 million to $480 million. Based on the mid-point of guidance, this implies 18.6% year-over-year revenue growth. As it relates to interconnection revenue growth, we expect the 2017 growth rate to be between 13% and 16% which at the lower end is generally in line with overall projected volume growth. General and administrative expenses are estimated to be $37 million to $39 million or approximately 8% of total operating revenue. This correlates to a 7% increase in G&A expenses over 2016, reflecting our ongoing focus on increasing productivity and efficiency across the organization. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $253 million to $258 million, this correlates to 20% year-over-year growth based on the mid-point of the range and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 53.8% and revenue flow-through to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 58%. FFO per share in OP unit is estimated to be $4.25 to $4.35. This implies 16% year-over-year FFO growth based on the mid-point of the range and the $3.71 per share we reported in 2016. As a reminder, the FFO per share guidance includes the debt financing that we expect to complete in the first half of the year. In addition, due to the expected timing and amount of the financing, we expect FFO per share results to be fairly balanced in the first and second halves of the year. And therefore, FFO growth to be weighted towards the first half of the year. This is due to the anticipated incremental interest expense resulting from higher priced fixed debt as compared to current variable price debt. We also anticipate this to result in a decreased revenue flow-through to FFO, which we estimate at approximately 40% based on the mid-point of 2017 FFO guidance. The significant drivers of this guidance are as follows. Estimated annual churn rate of 6% to 8% for 2017, keep in mind, that we expect an elevated level of churn in the second quarter of 2017 due to the final portion of rent associated with the original full-building customer at SV3. The amount is equal to $4.2 million in annualized rent or an incremental 180 basis points of churn. Cash rent growth on our data center renewals is estimated to be 2% to 4% for the full year. We expect cash rent growth to be weighted towards the second half of the year due to expected renewals of strategic deployments resulting in lower mark-to-market rent increases in the first half of the year. Total capital expenditures are expected to be $243 million to $271 million. The components are comprised of data center expansion cost, estimated to be $212 million to $228 million, this includes the expansion capital related to the first phase of the Reston campus expansion, the previously mentioned expansion projects in Los Angeles, Denver and Boston as well as incremental turnkey data center expansions across the portfolio as needed based on demand. Non-recurring investments are estimated to be $14 million to $18 million and include amounts related to investments in our IT architecture, facilities upgrades and other capital expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures are estimated to be $13 million to $17 million, and tenant improvements are estimated to be $4 million to $8 million. Now, we\u2019d like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, and good morning. Can you elaborate a little bit on I guess, Paul, your opening remarks you talked about strength you\u2019re starting to see in financial services. But it sounded like the lead time was not exactly short. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how that may have changed sequentially if these are new requirements that have popped up? And if lead times are consistent or if you\u2019re saying that there is lengthening out? Paul Szurek : Thanks for giving an opportunity to clarify. I don\u2019t think and we\u2019re specifically talking about the New York market. I don\u2019t think that there has been any change in the lead times relates to these financial services types of deployments. They just continue to be longer than lead times for typical lease negotiations. I think what we\u2019re seeing is consistent with what we\u2019re seeing in other segments of the enterprise vertical which is an increased interest in outsourcing elements of the IT architectures for these organizations, specifically to improve cost performance and to provide more efficient access to cloud services. Steve, would you add anything to that? Steve Smith : No, I think exactly Paul. I think the one thing that I would add is that we have seen a bit of an uptick as far as overall interest from the financial services community. And the New York area obviously there is a large density of those types of customers there. And I think that they are getting more sophisticated and really reaching a critical point in their internal architecture that is having them look to alternatives, part of that is cloud, part of that is outsourcing to co-location providers and really segmenting how they divide that architecture across different co-location facilities in its own right, whether it\u2019s high frequency trading or internal IT requirements, but we\u2019re seeing a lot more I guess a measured amount of more interest from that sector. Jordan Sadler : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, I had a question regarding sort of expansion - capital expansion opportunity. I heard obviously of the $212 million to $228 million Jeff that you touched on, you\u2019ve, got Reston campus expansion and some others in there. But I also figured based on prior discussions that you guys would continue to look to for opportunities in some of your core markets to court for, including Chicago, Santa Clara, as you\u2019re running out of capacity in those? Can you maybe talk about the progress there or the plans? Jeff Finnin : Yes, let me just touch on what leads, what\u2019s on our balance sheet and then Paul can touch on a little bit more broad in terms of where we\u2019re looking to add incremental capacity. But in general, we\u2019re looking at various components of our portfolio in terms of where we need to add incremental capacity. We don\u2019t have a lot of it put into development as we ended the year and largely because of the amount of development we had being finalized and finishing up in Q4. Having said that, I think when you look across the portfolio beyond what we\u2019ve talked about with Denver, Boston, and LA, in construction we\u2019ve also mentioned the Reston campus. And there are a couple other markets that we\u2019re closely looking at based on our visibility in terms of the sales funnel. And we\u2019ll continue to evaluate those options and then ultimately put things into construction as we see fit. Beyond that maybe Paul can comment on just more broadly what we\u2019re looking at in terms of other markets based on the need for just added capacity. Paul Szurek : Jordan, I touched on this in my comments. We\u2019re looking at additional capacity in the other big four markets. We\u2019ve got Northern Virginia taken care of pretty well. Historically we follow the discipline of not announcing anything until we actually have a specific contract or similar development to announce. I think generally you can that we\u2019re always making progress but we\u2019ll announce it when we have something firm. Steve Smith : Jordan, the only other thing I was going to add just to give you some numbers, just a quantification standpoint. Our estimate for what we think we might spend in Reston for 2017, it\u2019s about $100 million, that\u2019s largely going to be dependent on when we take that under full construction. But that gives you some idea about where we\u2019re thinking in terms of heading into the year. Jordan Sadler : That\u2019s helpful. And then lastly if I may, just a point of clarification on the straight-line rent number in the quarter. So, was that an abatement that was given for the delay and can you quantify the amount of the abatement and then sequentially I guess we\u2019d get the change from that? Jeff Finnin : Yes, Jordan, you\u2019re correct. The increase in that straight-line rent, on average in any given quarter our straight-line rent amounts usually somewhere between $1 million to $2 million. So you can take the delta of that mid-point of that number and you can see that the overall increase was about $4 million. And that was largely attributed to the delay in delivering SV7 and an abatement that we gave as a result of that delay. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Colby Synesael : Okay, thank you. You mentioned you were going to, you\u2019re intending to raise $150 million to $250 million in debt. I\u2019m just curious what interest rate you assumed in the guidance that you\u2019ve provided today. Obviously I think your revolver is something just above 2%, it\u2019s going to be something higher than that. Anyway, to kind of frame out how we should think about that potential rate to kind of work into our model? And then secondly, when I look at your EBITDA guidance margin the 53.8%, excuse me - that\u2019s up about 80 basis points I think versus the last two years it\u2019s been up roughly 200 basis points. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense, if there are any of the items that go into that that could be changing in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about that. Is it sales or marketing or maybe we\u2019ll see a bump relative to percentage of revenue? Is it something perhaps in the property of rent, just any color that helps us back into the slowdown in the contribution margin? Thanks. Jeff Finnin : Yes, Colby, let me address to your first question as it relates to interest rates. Today if you look at our pricing on our revolving credit facility we\u2019re paying about 230 basis points on our debt. Based upon the debt we placed last year and based on where market sit today, I think largely we will expect to pay about 250 basis points higher than 230, call it somewhere around 475, 480 if you went with a pure fixed price instrument. I\u2019d give a term somewhere around 7 or 8 eight years for that level of pricing. As it relates to the second question, as it relates to our EBITDA margins, I think if you look at over the last couple of years, I do think looking at a 12-year period of time in terms of what improvement we\u2019re making in our EBITDA margins is a good way to look at it. We increase those spread by about 200 basis points, \u201816 over \u201815 and we\u2019re guiding to about 80 basis points increase in \u201817 over \u201816. We\u2019re trying to continue to manage as I mentioned in our comments around our expense growth and that\u2019s something that Paul, Steve and I and the entire management work closely around just to manage and continue to scale the business. And hopefully we can outperform but that is largely driven by continuing to manage our expense growth and leverage as much as profitability as we can to the bottom line. Colby Synesael : As it relates to sales and marketing in particular, any reason to think that, as a percentage of revenue, that might be different in 2017 versus 2016? Paul Szurek : No, I think we\u2019ve typically guided to right around 4% of revenue and I think that\u2019s fairly consistent with where we think we\u2019ll end up in 2017 as well. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Paul Szurek : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Schildkraut : Great. Thanks for taking the questions this afternoon. So I just wanted to ask a couple on the enterprise side. Paul, Steve, you guys were talking about the strength there, and even in one of the earlier questions you came, sort of referenced back to that. And I just wanted to understand the dynamic of what these enterprises are doing inside your data center. And I guess it would be helpful maybe to layer in sort of two, sort of ideas as you go through that. One is when I look at the interconnect growth projection for the year, it\u2019s actually slower than your top line growth projection for the year, so implies a mild reduction as a percent of revenue coming from interconnect. And I guess that would have sort of been intuitively the opposite of what I\u2019d expect in accelerating enterprise cloud adoption scenario. And then secondly, you guys added PacketFabric to, I think, 11 of your data centers in the quarter, and I\u2019m just wondering about how that helps in terms of driving that enterprise demand over time? Thanks. Steve Smith : Sure, hi Jonathan, this is Steve. I\u2019ll start off and then let Paul fill in some color there. I guess, the first thing relative to the cross-connect growth and the pacing versus top-line, part of that I think is attributable to some of the larger leases that we closed over time. And as you look at the size of those leases and relative cross-connects that connect those spaces it gets a bit diluted there. So, I think that\u2019s part of the driver. Overall, as far as the enterprise is concerned, we do see them, it\u2019s connecting more and more to networks and clouds. And how they do that is a bit variable, whether they do it through physical cross connects or through Oracle cloud exchange and some of the other types of services that are available there. But overall I would say that that\u2019s the primary contributor there, just the mix of leasing that we\u2019ve seen over time. As you look at some of the other providers that have come into the building, you mentioned PacketFabric, we have a couple of others in the form of Megaport and a few others as well as some of the larger carriers that provide similar type of SDN services. Overall, we feel like that\u2019s a positive thing for our customer base, it gives them better connectivity options. And frankly, we\u2019ll attract more customers and more cloud and content providers to want to come to our data centers. So, on balance, yes, there may-be some interconnection services that use that SDN type of offering in order to connect to multiple other services whether its cloud or other networks. But on balance we feel like it\u2019s overall a positive thing for us. Jonathan Schildkraut : Awesome. If I could ask just one more follow-up. I was just wondering what the impact from the Reston acquisition was to the top line in the fourth quarter and whether we should think about that revenue as we look into \u201817 sort of going away as you guys re-purpose the asset for data center space and maybe away from office? Thanks. Jeff Finnin : Jonathan, as it relates to the fourth quarter, just based on the timing on which we acquire that, you can see on the property table. The annualized rent associated with that particular development at 12/31 is $4 million, we closed it mid-November. So the top-line growth was about $600,000. Important, as you look at your models going forward, there is a certain element of that particular rent that will be terminating at March 31, it\u2019s about $800,000. I mean, that\u2019s going to be terminating so that we can commence development on the first phase of that particular development. Jonathan Schildkraut : Awesome. Thanks, Jeff. Paul Szurek : Hi Jonathan, this is Paul. You did raise a couple of questions in your research note a day or two ago that, if you don\u2019t mind I thought I\u2019d clarify so that you can go away from this call with that answered. Jonathan Schildkraut : Thank you. Paul Szurek : You quoted Jones Lang LaSalle report about One Wilshire. And I can only surmise that that report related to the landlord\u2019s ability to develop and lease new data center space in the building and provide conduit and fiber to our meet-me room. I do want to make sure that you\u2019re aware however that once the fiber gets to our meet-me room, we have the ability to economically benefit from any connection by charging fees for cross-connects. More precisely, in order to access the meet-me, room ecosystem, the landlord\u2019s tenants must enter into a separate agreement with CoreSite governing our provision of, meet-me room services to that tenant. We also have the ability to protect ourselves against any free riding or other behavior that would be detrimental to the value we created in that interconnection node in the meet-me room. And furthermore we also have right to first offer on much of the space, in fact probably most of the space that the landlord could potentially develop to supply additional power and cooling. I just want to finish the same, we have a great relationship with both the owner and the management company at One Wilshire. We worked together really well over the years to create an outstanding data center ecosystem there. And we feel very good about our ability to continue to enjoy the mutual benefits of that relationship while providing a very valuable co-location and interconnection platform for our customers there. And I hope that kind of covers all the questions you had on that subject? Jonathan Schildkraut : Thanks a lot, Paul. That\u2019s super helpful. I didn\u2019t think I could ask four questions, so that was really good. Paul Szurek : I think Jeff\u2019s kind of already covered the question you raised with the dividend. REITs have historically financed expansion opportunities with outside financing. The tax structure we have requires us and investor expectations encourage us to dividend out as much as we safely can, what is defined as kind of true operating cash flow. And I know people take different measures. But we kind of look at something we call cash available for distribution to common equity which is basically AFFO minus non-recurring capital expenditures. We have raised our dividend payout ratio to kind of catch up with the growth in our performance over the years. But we still retain a cash cushion between that measure of operating cash flow and what our dividend is. So, technically we will not be borrowing to pay the dividend as you questioned in your report. I know that there are different ways that different analysts look at it, I just wanted to clarify the math. Jonathan Schildkraut : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. So, a couple of quick ones. I wanted to find out about your interconnect growth expectations for 2017, and of that growth, if you can describe how much in your guidance is predicated on bilateral fiber cross-connects versus exchange port type connections - the logical connections, kind of the composition of that or how much each of those accelerates. And then related to that, on Slide 14 the MRR per cabinet - I wondered if you could provide a little bit more detail. You have a little bit in the script, but maybe quantify how much of the growth that you saw in 4Q was from interconnect versus tower versus escalator? Thanks. Jeff Finnin : Hello Jonathan, let me see if I can hit both of those for you. As it relates to the interconnection business, if you just look at full-year \u201816 over \u201815, I think Steve commented on his script that our overall volume growth was just shy of 12% for the full-year. And as I said in my script, our guidance is somewhere between 13% to 16% of overall revenue but we\u2019d expect volume to be on the lower end of that. So, just call it an implied volume growth of about 13%. As it relates to fiber versus other, fiber generated overall increases in \u201816 over \u201815 of 16.4%. And we would expect that number to be fairly consistent as we go into \u201817 as well. So maybe give up just a little bit but overall we would expect it to be right around that 16% maybe just north of 16%. As it relates to your second question on the MRR per cab-E. If you look at the overall year-over-year growth of 7.5% and the components, the overall increase from an, interconnect and power is really what drove the increases. And my recollection is on interconnection that year-over-year growth is about 11%, maybe just slightly ahead of 11%. And the power increases were about 9%. And then the remainder was the rent component. Jonathan Atkin : Okay. And then interested, you talk a lot about enterprise, and I\u2019m interested in the indirect channel and the contribution of that to your new leasing, because you have a lot of retail big prototype leases. And how much of that funnel is coming from indirect, and is that changing at all? Steve Smith : Yes, I can probably take that for you, this is Steve. From an overall transaction perspective, it ranges anywhere from about 13% to about 20% as far as the overall indirect channel and the amount of contributions they bring to us. So that\u2019s remained fairly consistent over time and we haven\u2019t seen a dramatic change in that over the 12 months I would say. Jonathan Atkin : Okay. And then finally, of your incremental leases, how much involve metered power versus circuit-based? I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s mostly the latter, but just wanted to make sure I\u2019m, understanding that correctly. Paul Szurek : Hi, Jon, I apologize, I was writing something can you repeat what the question was? Jonathan Atkin : Right. So, the incremental leases that you saw during the quarter, how much of that involved - I\u2019m asking about the power pricing model, right? So how much of the incremental leasing is involving metered power versus circuit-based power? Paul Szurek : Yes, I\u2019m sorry, I got you. I would say overall a majority of the leases will contain a breaker powered model and less than majority would be on a metered basis. To give you some idea, if you look at just our overall power revenue we\u2019ve been anywhere between 55% and 60% of our power revenue is earned on a breaker basis. And therefore the remaining portion is earned on a metered basis. And that is consistent with where we ended 2016 as well. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Heinz with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Matt Heinz : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to hit on a couple of the guidance items. I think Jonathan hit a little bit on this with the Reston question. But how much of the incremental of $75 million of implied revenue growth is attributable to existing rents on the Reston campus? It sounds like you\u2019re terminating some of that OLI revenue in the first quarter, but if you could just provide kind of the magnitude of rents on the existing leases that\u2019s in the guidance. Jeff Finnin : Yes, I think it\u2019s about, we got like I said it was an annualized amount of $4 million resulting from that new campus. And that will be in place through $3.31 million and then it will drop down to $3.2 million for the last nine months ballpark. Matt Heinz : Okay. That\u2019s perfect. Thanks. And then any color you could provide on leasing assumptions that are baked into the revenue in terms of volumes you\u2019re expecting relative to last year and the mix of leasing by deal size? Jeff Finnin : Great question Matt. I think as Paul alluded to and I think Steve might have alluded to this a little bit as it relates to our commencements for 2016. We had the largest amount of commencements we\u2019ve had as an organization, I think that total $59 million ballpark for the full year of 2016, which as you know, largely led to the 50% cash growth \u201816 over \u201815. I think if you look at where we have been historically and if you look at over the last 4 to 5 years, taking out a couple of large wholesale deals that we\u2019ve done over that period of time, I would say on average, our lease commencements in any given has averaged over that 4-year period, about $26 million in total. We believe we can exceed that in 2017. And we\u2019re estimating somewhere around $30 million of annualized commencements for rent in 2017 to give you an idea. Matt Heinz : That\u2019s awesome. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up on the - your relationship with the switch fabric, kind of cloud fabric providers, I\u2019m just wondering kind of what\u2019s the economic relationship there? Are you charging them rent or do you see them as a magnet that is bringing in, is helping to bring in incremental customers? And you talked about the value proposition of how you see that as being net accretive of to your business, but with a lot of those cloud providers already in the buildings and on many of your campuses, I\u2019m just wondering why isn\u2019t that a solution that you can provide directly for your customers, and where does a Megaport kind of fit into that equation? Steve Smith : So, I guess, I can kind of start with - answer that question and then I\u2019ll let Paul or Jeff kind of fill-in there. Overall as far as the likes of SDN providers in our buildings and the value that they bring there, I guess first question I guess is, relatively economic relationship we have there. I don\u2019t think I can really get into too much detail there other than just letting you know that\u2019s similar to other providers and carriers that are in our facilities. And we\u2019re continuing to evolve that relationship. But it\u2019s very important to us to maintain the strategy that we\u2019ve had going forward which is really to provide a carrier neutral type of facility that provides our customers choice and flexibility as to how they interconnect to other networks as well as other cloud providers. And we look at those SDN providers as an extension of that. As to the value that they provide in our data centers, while we do have many of our direct on-ramps from many of the big cloud providers made up in our data centers feel like that brings significant value and differentiation in the marketplace. Having other connectivity options, we feel like it also benefits not only in providing access to those clouds and other networks but from campus to campus and just to other facilities around the world. So, it really just gives them more choice and more flexibility. And we feel like that\u2019s a positive thing in just providing them more attractive options for those customers. Paul Szurek : I would only add to what Steve said, reiterate our strategy of having ecosystems that provide all the options, all the business partners, all the various ways of interconnecting and getting around the world that our customers might conceivably need that openness has benefited us strategically. And we believe it will continue to do so going forward. Matt Heinz : Okay. Thank you very much. Steve Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. Some of your peers have discussed some business opportunities they continue to see in Europe and potentially there. What is your thinking as far as outside of the U.S. or see geographical needs, and at what point do you think that becomes more of a necessity for you? Paul Szurek : To the extent we\u2019re involved in international activities already, we\u2019ve seen a large number of non-U.S. companies coming into our data centers. We do have a small percentage of our customers that like our platform, like our service levels and agreements and have asked us to look outside the U.S. But they also have a very cost conscious approach to it. So, we tried to address that with a curetted referral program and we continue to evolve and improve that. And that seems to be going well and seems to have an opportunity for improvement going forward. Perhaps more importantly we\u2019re seeing an increasing volume of our customers who are going global via cloud or content providers or similar companies that are in our data centers that already have a global platform. And so we focus tremendously on making sure that they have the facilities and business partners they need in our data centers to go global, do that methodology. Frank Louthan : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just quick follow-up. You mentioned the enterprise demand. When you\u2019re looking at your pipeline, any particular verticals that you\u2019re seeing more or less activity that we would expect if we look a year from now on this call that might have expanded as far as your exposure to any particular industries? Steve Smith : Hi Frank, this is Steve, I\u2019ll try to answer that for you. Just to kind of piggy-back on what Paul had just mentioned regarding whether it\u2019s international expansion, or even domestic expansion. I think what we\u2019re seeing is that customers are getting more and more sophisticated on how they evaluate and select a data center provider. And as such, as long as they\u2019re looking for a deployment in our markets, we feel like we stand a very competitive opportunity to win that business and not being in more markets where even international business seems to be slowing us down winning those deployments. So just to give you a little bit of color there. Relative to industries and vertical strength across the board, I would say it\u2019s very market-driven. As you look at industries that are most interested in New York are very different than they might be in LA versus the Bay Area versus even Virginia. So, we try to take a very pointed approach to ensure that we have a geographical focus into those markets trying to ensure that our data center as well as our operating there resonates well with the key industries that happen to be present there. And we continue to refine those efforts. But it\u2019s just different from market to market. Frank Louthan : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rollins : Hi, good morning, and thanks. A couple if I could. First, as you\u2019re looking at the development activity particularly in the newer campuses like Reston, how are you thinking about the interest to push in another strategic anchor tenant versus just building around the communities that you already have in the market? And then secondly, just from an M&A context, with the activity that\u2019s been in the marketplace globally over the last year, are there any new thoughts in terms of what your aspirations are to participate in M&A to accelerate scale or accelerate the strategy, either as a buyer or a seller? Thanks. Paul Szurek : Thanks. Let me try to address those. The first question, I think as you saw both our VA2 expansion and our SV7 expansion, we have moved to a model of pre-leasing of new developments and new construction. And our preference for that type of pre-leasing is to find and sign out strategic anchors for those new developments, it\u2019s worked very well in both of those cases. And we expect to continue to follow that model going forward including for the Reston expansion. As it relates to M&A, we believe we have a business model and a platform that has consistently delivered opportunities for attractive organic growth. And that\u2019s how we design the company. And I think that\u2019s consistent with how most studies have companies have guided for the best long-term shareholder value. I think this approach also enables us to provide more value to our customers because we deploy our capital where there are, growth and expansion needs are consistent with the scale that we have. Having said that we recognize that there are occasionally opportunities when M&A or other inorganic growth avenues can be very attractive. So, we study the vast majority of the opportunities that are out there with an open mind. We\u2019re trying to discover opportunities to accelerate our ability to deliver value to customers and shareholders. Any transaction however would have to make sense strategically, culturally and mathematically, meaning, it would be good for our customers and would most likely be accretive to share value on a risk adjusted basis. I think I\u2019ve kind of just restated what we\u2019ve said at every quarterly call for the last couple of years. So I don\u2019t think that indicates any real change in our approach. But I did want to make sure the philosophy behind it was well understood. And assure you that we don\u2019t, we do look at this stuff and if good opportunities out there, we wouldn\u2019t be averse to taking advantage of it. Michael Rollins : Is, there any expectations that with some of the activity to date that that might help or hurt your sales funnel and ability to close deals? Paul Szurek : Nothing that we have seen so far appears to be any threat to our sales funnel or our ability to close deals. Please remember we are focused our scale and our strength in these eight very strong markets. And we provide a fairly unique value proposition as well as kind of the hybrid flexibility for customers that need to scale in those markets. And we don\u2019t see that changing with the M&A activity we\u2019ve seen out there. Michael Rollins : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Lukas Hartwich : My first question relates to the same-property results. I\u2019m just looking at sequential MRR and occupancy growth, and it looked like it slowed down a little bit from the recent pace. And I\u2019m just curious, is that noise, or are you running into a ceiling, particularly on the occupancy side of things, or what\u2019s going on there? Jeff Finnin : Hi Lukas, it\u2019s Jeff. I would say that I don\u2019t think we see anything that would prohibit us from continuing to lease up our same-store to beyond the 90% that we\u2019re at today. There is nothing that physically limits us, the space is still there power and cooling capabilities are still there. So, there is nothing there that limits us from an infrastructure standpoint to continue to increase that leasing. As it relates to the overall growth on call it MRR per cab-E basis, you can see that overall based on the same-store pool we had an effect for 2016, produced very good results, increasing call it, 6% to 8% on average year-over-year. I think as you look forward, we would expect that MRR per cab-E growth to moderate a little bit just based upon the type of sales activity we had in the previous 12 months. But still healthy somewhere between 5% to 7% year-over-year, growth as we look forward just to give you some idea where we think it\u2019s headed. Lukas Hartwich : That\u2019s really helpful. And then secondly, the development funding, the roughly $200 million there, is that going to come from additional debt issuance or how do you plan on funding that development? Jeff Finnin : Yes, it\u2019s just right in line with our prepared remarks. We\u2019ve had about $165 million of debt capacity today and about $150 million of liquidity as we sit here at year-end. And so, obviously it will fund the development needed in the near term but we\u2019re going to have to term-out some level of our credit facility. And we\u2019ve guided to $150 million to $250 million of additional debt sometime here in the first half of 2017. Lukas Hartwich : Right. So there\u2019s like roughly a $200 million balance in the line right now. So the future debt issuance, I was thinking, was terming out that, and then you would add an additional $200 million. So is it basically there will still be I guess, yearend 2017 there will be a $200 million roughly balance on the line? Jeff Finnin : Yes, ballpark just depending upon the pace of development. And you could see our CapEx that would give you some idea about where we would end up, that\u2019s correct. Lukas Hartwich : Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Jon Petersen : Great. Thanks. A lot of people asked about M&A and your acquisition appetite. But I\u2019m just kind of curious, whether it\u2019s big deals or whether it\u2019s just growing organically, your thoughts on being in Tier 2 markets versus Tier 1 markets. I think you\u2019re generally kind of in the major markets. You are in Denver and Boston, you\u2019ve had success there, and those are probably characterized as Tier 2 markets. How do you guys think about those markets within your portfolio and your appetite to further expand into other markets similar to like Denver and Boston? Paul Szurek : I don\u2019t know that I can add much to what I said earlier. The size of the market is important because of the scale that you can achieve. And also the resilience that you have going forward via diversity of customer base and kind of how tech reliant and data reliant the economy in a particular market is. Boston and Denver are both very strong tech and data economies. And because of their proximity to headquarters, in one case and our northeastern operations in the other case, we\u2019re able to have a chief scale about the sales and the operating organizations in those markets. And we expect good growth in them in the future. Probably as important we were able to enter those markets at very attractive price points and begin the scale accordingly. So, when you think about scale and data dependence in the economy and the ability to have economies of scale in a market, Tier 2 markets are just harder to make the numbers work. And as you go down in the tiers, it gets progressively harder. Jon Petersen : Okay, all right. Thank you. Steve Smith : I would just add Jon is, if you look at our strategy around really the three pillars of enterprise, cloud and network, having a heavy density of all three of those factors is important. And as Paul mentioned in Denver and Boston, those are hi-tech centric and fast growing markets already. So, we see good growth there. But also interconnection is critical too and Denver specifically being the intersection of fiber back-bone that crisscrosses the country speaks to that well as far as the attractiveness to cloud and network providers providing services here as well as Boston. So, they\u2019re a bit unique in that regard. Jon Petersen : Okay. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard you guys talk about this, but your recurring CapEx mid-point is $15 million this year. That\u2019s more than double what it was in 2016 or kind of higher than it\u2019s ever been. What\u2019s the driver for that in 2017? Jeff Finnin : Yes, Jon this is Jeff. It\u2019s one of those areas where we just believe as the number of kilowatts that we have in our portfolio increase, it is going to drive an increased level of recurring CapEx, that\u2019s just the expectation that we have. And that\u2019s kind of how we manage and model it. But it\u2019s slowly driven on the number of kilowatts we have deployed out through our portfolio. When you look at how much of those kilowatts commenced during 2016, we\u2019re just expecting to have some recurring CapEx increase over prior years. Jon Petersen : Okay. And then just one more. I think you guys talked about this, but I just want to make sure I understand it. So, last quarter on the call you talked about how there would be 125 basis points of churn in the fourth quarter. I think in your prepared remarks you talked about how there would be some in early 2017. I\u2019m trying to figure out, did the 125 basis points you talked about last quarter - did that actually occur this quarter? Is it part of the 1.9%, or did it get pushed to next year? Jeff Finnin : It did occur and Steve alluded to it in his prepared remarks. We actually ended up having a total on that particular customer of 135 basis points. So just slightly higher than what we had anticipated. But that did actually occur in Q4. So absent that customer, actually churn results were fairly good in Q4 when you look at our long-term average to somewhere between 1% to 2%. The other component that you\u2019re probably referring to and I alluded to, it some elevated churn in Q2, which is about an incremental 180 basis points which is the last component of our original customer at SV3 that will burn off. And that is about $4.2 million of annualized rent that will terminate in the second quarter of \u201817. Paul Szurek : And that\u2019s not new churn. We preannounced that churn in other calls. Jeff Finnin : Yes. Jon Petersen : Right, okay. Got it. All right, thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Jeff Finnin : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is a follow-up from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Finnin : Hi Jordan, we can\u2019t hear you. If you\u2019re talking you might check your mute button. Jordan Sadler : Sorry about that. I tried to queue out. But while I\u2019m here, you guys mentioned, I think, $30 million of commencements are basically what\u2019s budgeted into the guidance for next year. Is that the right number? Jeff Finnin : That\u2019s accurate. Jordan Sadler : And so I guess the right way to think about that from a modeling perspective is a ratable commencement schedule throughout the year with that 40% flow-through that you guys mentioned to FFO? Jeff Finnin : Yes, I think that\u2019s fair Jordan. The only real visibility we have as we sit here today, as we mentioned. When we look at our backlog, GAAP backlog of $5 million at the end of the year, and we expect substantially all of that to commence in the first half - the first quarter of the year. So, then everything else would commence subsequent to that. Jordan Sadler : Okay. I guess the one I was curious about the delta between the cash and the GAAP this quarter. It seems pretty significant. The cash is an extra $10 million. And then separately I thought it was a little bit striking, $35 million of commencements this quarter alone, and for the full year next year you\u2019re modeling $30 million in commencements. I know SV7 was a huge part of that. You don\u2019t have another one of those in the till. But I guess the question really is, is there another CSP out there potentially that you\u2019re not baking into the number but certainly could hit this year? Jeff Finnin : Yes, I think the number, the decrease in the number, just look back at our backlog and just go back to where we started 2016. And as we migrated through the year those backlog numbers were very substantial and that\u2019s largely due to the fact of the preleasing that occurred at SV7 and some of our other developments and as Paul alluded to earlier. As we sit here today, you just look at what we have under development. We just don\u2019t have enormous amount of space under development right now. We\u2019re obviously planning things as it relates to Reston and as Paul and Steve both, alluded to we would look to try and drive some anchor customer there to help kick-start the cash flow soon upon completion of that construction. So, I just think as we sit here today I can\u2019t give you that golden, we\u2019re looking forward but we hope to find it somewhere as we migrate through the year and we\u2019ll see how we operate here. Paul Szurek : Jordan I\u2019m glad you asked that question because it\u2019s probably worth reminding everybody. I know that it\u2019s real important the way most of you look at companies and do your job. And we, as we see reporting we all have to report quarter-by-quarter. And in those results are important. But this business doesn\u2019t really run on a quarter-to-quarter cycle. I mean the transaction engine does and that stays pretty consistent from quarter-to-quarter and it\u2019s generally been on an upward trend for the last three years. But other parts of the business, the hybrid part of our business where we take on larger deployments is lumpy and also less predictable. So as you look at the business going forward, I think Jeff\u2019s given you the best guidance we can give. And we continue to believe that there will be good opportunities that may enable us to outperform. But we can\u2019t predict those. Jordan Sadler : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Jeff Finnin : Thanks Jordan. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time I will now turn the floor back to Mr. Paul Szurek for closing comments. Paul Szurek : First I\u2019d like to thank all of you for your interest in the company and participating in this call. And we appreciate it very much. Steve and Jeff and I would like to thank our colleague for a great 2016 and congratulate them on an excellent year. We\u2019re looking forward to the rest of 2017. We have many opportunities and a lot of work ahead of us. And again, thank you for your interest. And have a great rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning and thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm glad to share our first quarter financial and operational results with you as well as to update you on our markets and our outlook on supply and demand. Our momentum from the fourth quarter continued and we started the year strongly. Financial results for the quarter reflect continued steady growth with year-over-year increases of revenue of 24% while adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share grew 33% and 31% year-over-year respectively. Importantly in Q1 we continue to execute our business objectives and we were able to further increase efficiency and effectiveness across our organization. Leasing activity was very solid in the first quarter with new and expansion sales of nearly $10 million which was well distributed across each of our network, cloud service and enterprise verticals. Steve will provide greater detail around the compositions of our new and expansion leasing. We are pleased with the pace, pricing in terms of our sales in Q1. As we have said in previous communications, our business model is dedicated on the strength and attractiveness of our markets and the quality of our assets in those markets. The eight large cities in which we operate represent approximately 20% of U.S. population, 27% of GDP and the lion's share of data intensive business and consumer needs generating exceptional demand for performance and proximity sensitive co-location requirements. Our assets in these large edged markets are tailored for these high value data needs. They are all well positioned at key intersection of the Internet, our network and interconnection dense [ph] and have large customer ecosystems including native access to strategic public cloud on ramps. We continue to benefit from our considerable scale in each of our markets affording us the ability to deploy exceptional local go-to-market teams that provide a hands-on service intense customer experience. Our scale in each market also supports strong local facilities management leadership infrastructure capabilities. Our campuses provide scalable and flexible solutions that allow us to accommodate a great diversity of increasingly sophisticated and dynamic customer needs as our [ph] network architecture continues to evolve and require compute, storage, caching and interconnection at the edge. Our existing customer ecosystems are thriving and generating new demand; we see this most clearly by looking at new logo growth as we work to identify and to track new customers that can add value to the ecosystem. In the first quarter we added 32 new logos, 84% of which were enterprises which are attracted to the established network and cloud density available across our portfolio. As a result of these market and scale dynamics, we continue to see considerable growth opportunities within our existing markets and campuses. We have in-flight $84.6 billion of new computer room construction. We have also commenced construction on the first phase of our rest in campus expansion. In order to keep up with a strong sales funnel in that market we are building a 25,000 square foot three megawatt computer room in one of the existing buildings on our new property at a budgeted cost of $22 million which we expect to complete early in the fourth quarter. We will also commence construction in the middle of the year on a central infrastructure building and a new six megawatt data center building which collectively are budgeted to cost $85 million and be completed in the second quarter of 2018. Please remember that all these buildings are in very close proximity and connected by diverse fiber pass to our existing rest and data centers and interconnection node and our public cloud on ramps. We have expansion capacity in almost all of our other markets; including Virginia we have entitled capacity to expand our portfolio square footage by 65% and we also have additional land which we believe can be entitled for expansion. We will continue our ongoing program to identify and acquire more expansion that's in our markets to keep abreast of demand. As part of that initiative we recently signed a contract to acquire a two acre land parcel with a 30,000 square foot industrial building we will raise immediately adjacent to our existing Santa Clara campus. The purchase is subject to customary due diligence, much of which we've enabled to complete prior to signing. We estimate that we could build approximately 160,000 square feet of new data center capacity on this partial comprising 18 megawatts at full build out. We currently anticipate closing on the land in the third quarter of 2017. We estimate the cost of the land, building, and first phase of computer rooms including cost associated with design entitlement and permitting to be approximately $118 million. We are pleased to have this path towards expanding our very successful Santa Clara campus and the customer ecosystem thereon where approximately 81,000 square feet remains in our current inventory. Across our markets demand remains healthy for high performance low latency co-location solutions while supply remains generally consistent with demand. We are seeing consistent demand and a healthy balance with supply in Los Angeles as minimal new supply has been brought online over the last two years and churn at other data center operators has only modestly increased supply. The steady pace of absorption in this market supports the growth of our L.A. two facility with an additional 41,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity now under construction. This incremental inventory will ensure we are well positioned to keep pace with demand in the market and what we view as a solid funnel and favorable pricing dynamics. In the Bay area, similar to last quarter, inventory across the market remains constrained and pricing remains positive. New capacity is coming online though a substantial amount of it appears to be preleased and targeted to large wholesale. Despite the new supply, we expect the market to continue to be supply constrained in 2017, particularly as it relates to requirements for scalable network and interconnection dense deployments. Regarding Northern Virginia and D.C. demand continues to be strong following a record year of absorption in 2016. Occupancy rates remain high in this market and new and potential supply seems concentrated on the large wholesale market and it appears that a good amount of the new supply is pre-leased. We are excited about our opportunities in this market and in the downtown Washington D.C. market due to the strong demand and a more limited supply for small, medium-sized and scalable performance and interconnection sensitive requirements, especially those seeking diversity from Ashburton [ph]. Finally in the New York/New Jersey market, we are encouraged by another sequential uptick in the face of leasing with 20 new and expansion leases signed in Q1, more than 60% above the trailing 12-month average. Leasing at NY-2 was quite robust accounting for two-thirds of leases executed, and the majority of new logo signed in this market. As we continue to support a growing community of enterprises, domestic and international carriers, and leading cloud providers; we see a steady stream of leasing activity amongst smaller customer deployments which is weighted toward the enterprise vertical including financial services and healthcare organization. We continue to feel good about the funnel in the New York/New Jersey market. To wrap up, the first quarter again demonstrated our consistent execution, both financially and operationally. We will continue to differentiate core site with our large edge market focus and our hybrid approach providing both scalability and flexibility to our customers based on their changing needs. We will remain focused on bringing additional capacity online in our markets to meet customer demand and accommodate ecosystem growth. As we look ahead, we believe that we have a compelling opportunity to continue to drive strong internal growth from our existing assets and to effectively develop new asset to meet growing demand or generating attractive returns for our shareholders. With that I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith : Thanks Paul. I will begin by reviewing our overall new and expansion sales activity during the first quarter, and then discuss in more detail our vertical and geographic results. Our Q1 new and expansion sales totaled $9.7 million in annualized GAAP comprised of 46,500 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $209 per square foot. This rate is 5.5% above the trailing 12-month average, primarily due to higher deployment signed during the quarter. We have seen a modest uptick in the average density over the past three quarters and we normalized for density, the Q1 rate was in-line with the trailing 12-month average. Regarding the composition of our new and expansion leasing by size of deployment, leases signed at 5,000 square feet or less totaled $6.3 million at annualized effort signed in Q1. During the first quarter was signed two leases greater than 5,000 square feet each which included net expansion of existing strategic customer. We continue to be encouraged by strong network and cloud service provider demand which we believe create stability and long-term attractiveness for our ecosystem and is synergistic with enterprises looking to either outsource their IT infrastructure or support a hybrid multi-cloud deployment. Since our view that these diverse and highly interconnected customer communities across our platform continue to attract new logos to our data centers. When looking at geographic distribution, 88% of the new logo sold in Q1 were deployed across our four largest markets. As it relates to our vertical distribution, 84% of those new logos were in the enterprise vertical. This group of new enterprise customers includes a multi-site gaming platform, a multinational mass media corporation, a multinational law firm, and a British visual effects company. Net of customer churn, we added 60 new logos in Q1. In addition to our solid new and expansion leasing, renewals in Q1 resulted in approximately 95,000 total square feet renewing at an annualized GAAP rate of $146 per square foot, 6% below the trailing 12-month average primarily due to a specific low density customer renewing in the Los Angeles market. Our renewal pricing reflects mark to market growth of 1.9% on a cash basis and 5.5% on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, we expect cash rent growth of approximately 3% for 2017 to be modestly weighted towards the second half of the year. Churn in the first quarter was 1.1%, in-line with the lower end of our historical quarterly average of 1% to 2%. Supported by our success with the small to medium-sized transactions I discussed earlier; interconnection revenue grew 14% year-over-year in Q1 reflecting total volume growth of 10%. Volume was comprised of a 15% increase in cyber cost-connect [ph]. We remain encouraged by the demand outlook for interconnection services and the value they bring to our customers. These services enable customers to provide a low latency performance, needless to support a multi-cloud, IT architecture is required to better serve their own customers, suppliers and employees in this increasingly performance sensitive digital economy. As such we continue to enhance our go-to-market strategy to drive awareness of the unique value that our customer ecosystem delivers within our data centers. Enabled by the course community which provides dynamic web-enabled interface, customers can learn of other service providers; how they can benefit from one another and engage easily just for their IT strategy. These services include number providers, thought on [ph] ramps, maintenance service providers, and software providers; just to name a few. With respect to vertical mix with our ecosystem, during Q1 networking cloud customers accounted for 9% and 36% of annualized signed respectively. Specific to the cloud vertical, we continue to see strong momentum with three new logos including the cloud-based on-demand platform serving the financial services industry, as well as a cyber-security managed services organization. In addition, during the quarter we signed an expansion with a strategic customer in Northern Virginia and a software-driven cloud networking solutions provider expanded its footprint with us to the point of private [indiscernible]. The network vertical had a strong first quarter driven primarily by expansions of existing customers. Networks are continuing to grow and expand within existing building and deploying that the new buildings with us. So they see an increase in end-customer requirements from our growing ecosystem. Demand was broad based as we start, network providers expand with us in nearly every market in which we operate. As it relates to our enterprise vertical, this vertical accounted for 54% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the first quarter. Performance was driven by expansions with managed service providers and digital media companies with several new logos and the media and entertainment space. We signed a sizable expansion with a global content delivery network for live streaming and other web-based content, and expansion with a leading online video game platform and an expansion with a global systems integrator supporting a critical public sector service. We're pleased to see continued momentum and diversity within the enterprise vertical as these companies look to rearchitect their IT requirements around hybrid cloud deployment. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed and new and expansion leases during Q1 with Northern Virginia D.C., Los Angeles, Silicon Valley collectively representing 87% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the quarter. In Northern Virginia D.C., the pace of leasing remains robust with continued strong demand from smaller requirements and one large lease signed in Q1. As we have seen in recent quarters, [indiscernible] remains strong with these customers accounting for nearly 60% of leases executed and substantially all of the new logos signed in Northern Virginia D.C. Stabilizes occupancy in this market now stands at 96.4%, an increase of 30 basis points on a sequential basis given the number of commitments occurring across the campus during Q1. Demand in our Los Angeles market continues to be steady driven by demand from smaller customer requirements, as well as expansions of existing customers. Demand in L.A. was skewed towards our LA-2 facility with leases signed at this building accounting for 77% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the market. The strength of our sales pacing at LA-2 reflects the success of our overarching baseline strategy which is to leverage the value of our legacy, low latency and network dense facilities such as LA-1 that are then redundantly connected by high account dark fiber providing not only high performance but also increased flexibility and scalability to support the higher density requirements of today's workloads. In terms of verticals, enterprise was our strongest in this market followed by network and cloud. Stabilized occupancy in the Los Angeles campus was 92.5% at the end of Q1 down 10 basis points from Q4. Activity in the Bay Area was strong with leases executed at all of our available multi-tenant data centers in the market. Demand for our new turnkey data center tested as we said and was particularly strong, the leasing of this building accounting for approximately 90% of annualized GAAP rent started in the Bay Area in Q1, as customers take advantage of the low latency, high performance access to the network and cloud in enterprise community, we have developed on static their campus and across the Silicon Valley market. In terms of verticals Q1 lease executions in this market were again weighted towards cloud followed by enterprise appointments [ph]. Stabilized occupancy across our Silicon Valley campuses decrease 40 basis point to 96.3% due to some modest churn in Q1 and Q2. In summary, 2017 is up to a solid start in terms of leasing activity and the continued maturation of our customer ecosystem. We believe we are well positioned to continue to gain market share on the performance sensitive side of the market given our scalable, flexible mix of available capacity, significant network and cloud density and a differentiated customer experience. I will now turning the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thank Steve, and hello everyone. My remarks today will begin with a review of our Q1 financial results followed by an update on our development CapEx and our leverage in liquidity capacity. I will then conclude my remarks with an update on our 2017 guidance. Q1 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues $114.9 million a 4% increase on the sequential quarter basis and 24.3% increase year-over-year. Q1 operating revenue consisted of $95.1 million in rental and power revenue from data center space up 3.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 25.2% year-over-year. In our connection services revenue contributed $14.5 million to operating revenues in Q1 an increase of 3.8% on a sequential quarter basis and 13.9% year-over-year, in tenant reimbursement and other revenues were $2.3 million. Office and light industrial revenue was $3 million, which includes revenue associated with the rest and campus expansion. Q1 FFO was a $1.13 per diluted share in unit, an increase of 6.6% on a sequential quarter basis and a 31.4% increase year-over-year. The strength in FFO was due in part to better than expected rental revenue following a year of record commencements in 2016 and better than expected flow through to adjusted EBITDA resulting in better margins. Adjusted EBITDA $64.4 million increase to 6.2% on a sequential quarter basis and 32.8% over the same quarter last year. We continue to expand our margins with our adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 54% measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q1 2017. This represents an increase of 260 basis points over the comparable year ago period. Related trailing 12 months revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO was 67% and 60% respectively. Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter totaled $4.5 million or 3.9% of total operating revenues down 70 basis points year-over-year. In general and administrative expenses were $8.1 million in Q1 correlating to 7.1 % of total operating revenues, a decrease of 230 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a benefit of approximately $0.01 per share related to annual compensation true ups [ph]. Now turning to our same store metrics. Q1 same store turnkey data center occupancy increased 430 basis points to 90.9% from 86.6% in the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, same store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 7.3% year-over-year and 0.5% sequentially to $1,439. On a per unit basis, the largest contributor to the year-over-year growth in our MRR per cabinet growth in power revenue, followed by interconnection and rent growth. Keep in mind that our same store pool is redefined annually in the first quarter, and the 2017 pool only includes turnkey datacenter space that was leased or available to be leased to our co-location customers as of December 31, 2015, at each of our properties and excludes powered shell datacenter space. We commence a 37,000 net rental square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $244 per square foot, which represents $9.1 million of annualized GAAP rent. We ended the first quarter with our stabilized data center occupancy at 94.7% an increase of 20 basis points compared to the fourth quarter and an increase of 410 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016, reflecting the record level of leases that commenced during 2016. Turning now the backlog. Projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was 5.6 million as of March 31, 2017 fairly consistent with where we ended the year and $15.7 million on a cash basis. We expect substantially all of the GAAP backlog to commence during the remainder of 2017. Turning to our development activity. We had a total of 116,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity under construction as of March 31, 2017. With development and expansion projects Northern Virginia, Washington D.C, Los Angeles, Denver and Boston. As of the end of the first quarter, we had spent $16.9 million of the estimated $106.9 million required to complete the project. As shown on Page 21 of the supplemental, the percentage of interest capitalized in Q1 was 9.9%, for 2017, we continue to expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 10% to 15%. Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2017 our ratio of net principal debt to Q1 analyze adjusted EBITDA was 2.8 times, including preferred stock the ratio was 3.2 times slightly below where we ended the year. Including preferred stock the Q1 leverage in adjusted EBITDA levels provide capacity for an additional $195 million of debt assuming a four times debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. With that in mind, last week we closed two separate financing transactions, resulting in additional liquidity of $275 million modestly above the amount we targeted given the lender demand in economics. The first transaction results in an incremental $100 million of liquidity by expanding in existing senior unsecured term loans, originally scheduled to mature in 2019 to a total of $200 million. The expanded term loan has a new five-year term maturing in April of 2022. In addition, we successfully raised $175 million through a private placement bond offering, priced with a 3.91% coupon. The execution of the expanded term loan and private placement offering allows us to improve our overall liquidity position, manage our debt maturity profile and maintain both financial flexibility and a balance between fixed and variable price instruments in our capital structure. The proceeds of both transactions were used to pay down all outstanding amounts on the revolving portion of our existing credit facility providing approximately $362 million of available liquidity to fund our growth and development plan. Now in closing, I would like to address our updated guidance for 2017. I would remind you that our guidance reflects our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. As detailed on Page 23 of our Q1 earning supplemental, our guidance for 2017 is as followed. Total operating revenue is now estimated to be $472 million to $482 million, compared to the previous range of $470 to $480mmillion based on the midpoint of guidance this implies 90.1% year-over-year revenue growth. Keep in mind that our revenue guidance is dependent upon the power product composition of deployments within our portfolio, and how quickly the larger, metered power deployments install their infrastructure and ramp into their associated power requirements. As relates to interconnection revenue growth, we continue to expect the 2017 revenue growth rate to be between 13% and 16%. General and administrative expenses are now expected to be $35 million to $37 million or approximately 7.5% of total operating revenue. This correlates to an approximate 2% increase in G&A expenses over 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to be $256.5 million to $260.5 million up from the prior range of $253 million to $258 million. This correlates to 22% year-over-year growth based on the midpoint of the range and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 54.3% and revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 61%. FFO was estimated to be $4.35 to $4.45 per share and OP unit compared to the previous guidance of $4.25 to $4.35 per share, an increase of 2.3% at the midpoint. This implies 18.6% year-over-year FFO growth, based on the midpoint of the range and the $3.71 per share we reported in 2016. In addition, due to the completed financings we expect FFO per share result to be fairly balanced in the first and second halves of the year, and therefore FFO growth to be weighted toward the first half of the year. We also anticipate this to result in a decreased revenue flow through to FFO, which we estimate at approximately 45% based on the midpoint of our updated 2017 FFO guidance. As relates to our guidance for capital expenditures in 2017. We are increasing the total expected investment to a range of $280 million to $310 million from the previous range of $243 to $271 million, the biggest drivers of this increase are increased data center expansion investment, which we now anticipate to be $241 million to $259 million, compared to the prior range of $212 to 228 million. As Paul mentioned this updated range includes the first two phases of expansion in Reston, additional turnkey data center capacity at L.A-2 to support demand in that market and the acquisition costs associated with the land under contract in Santa Clara for our build out of S.B8. In addition, we are increasing our expected investment in recurring capital expenditures to a range of $21 million to $25 million from the prior range of $13 million to $17 million, this represents a significant increase from the 2016 level and a substantially higher level than we expect to spend in subsequent years on average. The increase in 2017 is largely driven by the opportunity we had to replace our chiller plant that existed when we originally purchased L.A2 upon deciding to commence the build out of incremental capacity on our fourth floor. The new equipment is more energy efficient and with the economies of scale from the new construction, it made sense to combine the replacement of the older equipment in this project. The older equipment was originally scheduled to be replaced in 2019, and was accelerated due to the cost savings and our continuing pursuit of improved PUE. This incremental capital investment will also provide a return on investment that is substantially higher than our overall stated return objectives in criteria. Now we'd like to open the call to questions, operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Paul Szurek : While Audrey is pulling for questions, I just wanted to comment very quickly on the fact that we issued a corrected and replaced earnings release this morning, shortly after our initial release, that was done, as we needed to correct some prior period financial information specifically related to Q4 and Q1, 2016-income statement. The initial release included in reflected some incorrect information, I just wanted to mention that before we get into Q&A in case there was some remaining questions from that. Audrey? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets, please state your question. Jordan Sadler : Thank you and good morning out there. Wanted to follow up on guidance. The increase it makes sense given the quarter's results, I'm curious what might be the drag as we look at the run rate you are able to achieve in 1Q. What the offsets are as we look forward to the rest of the year, outside of obviously the financing you discussed and the churn event you have coming in 2Q. Jeff Finnin : Good morning, thanks Jordan. I think you touch on two critical elements, first, as you discussed the interest expense associated with the incremental finances, if you just think about for instance Q2 we think about Q2 is that in subsequent quarters the interest expense have been about a $0.02 per share drag on earnings per quarter. In addition, as you mentioned we do have our last churn event from our customer out in the Bay Area, and that churn event also will be contributing a decrease of about $0.02 per share in the quarter - in the second quarter think about that. One other item we did mention in the call or on my prepared remarks, was the fact that we did get about a penny per share benefit in our G&A during the first quarter associated with some true-ups [ph] we made on our compensation year in compensation true-ups [ph]. So that give you some idea how we've been looking at it at least pacifically for the second quarter. And then beyond I would say it's largely going to be attributable to the timing of our commencements, and at the end - at the end of the day it's going to be driven by the timing associated with that and ultimately have a sales continued to generate and reflected for the rest of the year. Paul Szurek : But Jordan, to that we obviously saw a lot of commitments up in Q4 which are growth significant revenue growth that we're seeing in early - earlier in the year so that's hoping to see the growth earlier we plan to see that moderate as we go forward in our traditional year. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And this $30 million commencement guidance obviously looks like a new statistic you'd be providing which should be helpful, but relative to historical commencements, it feels like it's a little bit light and is that - would you say that's a function of just available inventory today. Jeff Finnin : Yes, I think you know in our call last quarter we gave some commentary around historical commencements and my recollection if you just look at the past several years, our commencements have averaged somewhere around $26 million to $27 million per year just depending upon the year. So it's up slightly from the pace which we've seen historically, and so that's where we're patient to and hopefully to execute. If you just look at what we did commence in the first quarter we were at $9.1 million. Our backlog that were exit in the quarter at is $5.6 million and we've said that that will all commence at various times during the rest of this year. So we're at slightly less than $50 million, we're at about 50% of the way there, we feel good where we are and Steven and his team continues to work to try and hit and or outperform. Jordan Sadler : Okay, there was a news report recently of a competitor taking some space in L.A1 and I had a curiosity as to what the impact of that might be on the dynamic in that market, meaning would you view that as more competition for L.A2. Or how we should be thinking about that. Paul Szurek : Jordan, this is Paul, thanks for that question. We view that as kind of business as usual, one will sure --there has always been an ecosystem there that included space that we didn't control. As it relates to that particular space, the anchor tenant for that space which takes up most of that space just wasn't a deployment that required the value that we provide in our - in our particular solutions and in fact it's not even going to be connected directly to the meet-me room. So it just wasn't in the fairway for the sort of things that we do. The tenet that has the space overall, we have a good working relationship with them and as we said on prior calls, we have a - we have a unique for care - historic care hotels we have a unique set of rights to preserve the value of our meet-me room experience of our meet-me room composition, and we have been able to work very successfully with the other people in the building to make that work for everybody. So you know, long story short we don't view this as a meaningful change in [indiscernible]. Jordan Sadler : Okay, just - that is helpful. One last clarification and I noticed that the MRR per CABI reported went to 40, 39 I think in the quarter. And it looks like either of the change in disclosure that I made to maybe I missed something, my last quarter supplement I had 15, 29 I don't know if there was change I missed. Jeff Finnin : Yes, no - we - that same store pool gets updated in the first quarter of every year, Jordan, just because we then add an incremental level of real estate so that it's just a defined new pool. And that happens every year in the first quarter. Jordan Sadler : Okay, that is helpful, thank you guys. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Please state your question. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning guys. I guess you've been doing a large number in a fairly consistent number of smaller deals the average size has been largely the same last couple of quarters, in the number of deals as well. I think one of the things that maybe caught us off guard in the power revenue did slow and if you mentioned in your primary comment I didn't hear it, but it is the slowdown in sequential growth in power revenues a function of just maybe the deal just kind of just above the threshold for recognizing power revenue. Is there anything that happened in the first quarter we should be thinking about. Jeff Finnin : Yes. Steve? Steve Smith : I provided a little bit of color commentary on that as it relates to guidance, and it really simply relates to if you look at our historical leasing over the last call it two to four quarters, we have been leasing and specifically SV7 had some larger metered power deployments that ultimately commenced in early on in the fourth quarter of 2016. Ultimately the power revenue associated with those will be dependent upon when those customers ultimately deploy all of their architecture, and then ultimately begin drawing on a metered basis. And those are large supplement just take some little bit of time to get that ultimately installed and before they're ultimately drawn into power levels that we've expected. Unidentified Analyst : And is that in 2017. Steve Smith : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : I guess as we think maybe moving forward with regard to some of the new development whether it's on Santa Clara or Reston or we've get a quite a bit of capital going to go out the door, should we expect to see you maybe anchor some of those developments as they start to come on line as we think about maybe late 2017 or early 2018 doing some larger deals and transactions at those - at those parcels. Paul Szurek : We do as you as you know follow a policy we started a couple years ago of seeking strategic tenants to pre lease space in newly developed data centers and will continue that would be new developments as well. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, no real change I guess on the policy there is what you are saying. Paul Szurek : No change. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful, alright thanks. Paul Szurek : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets, please state your question. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. So on that last question maybe just to push back on the pulse that is if the site is across the street and immediately adjacent what - why wouldn't you want it just to immediately kind of continue the kind of that retail progress that you see in SV7, and not necessarily seek a larger anchor. Paul Szurek : Well, we have other places in the Santa Clara campus to accommodate the retail demand. And we just find their tremendous synergies both with enterprise and retail demand going forward and having the right strategic tenants in place, during the - during the pre-leasing process. On top of which as you guys know developing in Santa Clara does take some time for entitlements, so there's plenty of time during the entitlement and pre-construction process to seek those kind of anchor tenants without really slowing down the realistic schedule of construction. Jonathan Atkin : The 118 million. How many - What's kind of your baseline assumption on megawatts of critical load and is that [indiscernible] what can you share on that in terms of your baseline assumptions. Paul Szurek : You know, that's for - that's to bring the first third of capacity into the data centers, so it's about six megawatts, it will eventually expand 18 megawatts our best guess is that cost per kilowatts about 10,500 to 11,000 per kilowatt. And that will provide the same mix we provide today which is 2 and plus 1 to accommodate customers that have differing needs. Jonathan Atkin : And then maybe for Steve or you Paul, but I'm just interested in kind of the interconnection revenues and the ecosystems that are driving that, is it just the traditional ones that are continuing to grow or is there emerging one that you're seeing their starting to gain share within the revenue mix interconnects. Steve Smith : This is Steve, we are seeing continued growth just on a broad base level but we're really seeing accelerated growth is really around the enterprise connected to the cloud. We've seen over 14% growth year-over-year, so that continues to be a healthy market for us and I think just speaks to overall strategy of trying to drive on ramps available in those markets and that versus of cloud networking enterprise. Jonathan Atkin : Is there anything around advertising or Internet of things or any at anything else worth call it out as a driver in interconnects. Steve Smith : Sure, and I think the Internet of Things going to ply do a lot of things, so we do see that across the board and whatever business you happen to be and typically the Internet is involved, so we do see a lot of different enterprises really requiring those hybrid multi-cloud type of deployments as well as just using their infrastructure to do commerce over the Internet. We feel that customers are continuing to see value in that within our data centers and the overall legal system that brings all the - those things together helps them drive more of their business and that's where we've seen a lot of growth. Jonathan Atkin : And then just real quick two more on Chicago I think 95% utilization and as you think about expansion in that market is it is it down town, is it suburbs where it would be kind of your thoughts there. And then on the new logo capture I am just interested in whether the majority of those are taking occupancy at one of your sites or multiple sites, thank you. Paul Szurek : Just so you know, the start off with as far Chicago is concerned we continue look at markets and the opportunity there that to grow, a lot of it comes down to where we have capital already deployed where we see the maximum return for our shareholders in each given market, and what the absorption looks like there as well as the competitive dynamics. And Chicago definitely one of those that we continue to look at, we do have an opportunity to better efficiencies out of the facility that we have there today, but we continue to look at new opportunities to expand the Chicago market that continues to remain attractive for us. Jonathan Atkin : For the new logos 6 single site or multi-site mostly. Paul Szurek : We're seeing an increase in multi sites, our customers start to deploy in more markets but for the majority of our new logos that we find that typically come in as a single market. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from a line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and company, please state your question. Colby Synesael : Thank you. You talked in your prepared remarks about improvement in profitability in Presley, you talked about increasing efficiency, I was wondering if you dive a little bit further into what you might be doing and how that might be different that in quarter's past. And then also just as a point of clarification the Phase 1 of the - for the new facility to be built on the land that you're - that you're acquiring. Recognizing that can take some time and you talked about having to take a building down first, how quickly do you think you could actually get that out to market. Thank you. Paul Szurek : Thanks Colby. Good questions. First on the - on the latter question. My guess is that building would come online probably about 18 to 22 months after we close on the land purchase, could be - could be faster depending upon how quickly the entitlements process goes, and as you know that's always the hardest thing to predict in some jurisdictions more so than others. Efficiency and effectiveness, we are continuing programs we started a couple of years ago to re=architect our own IT systems, to provide our people in the field and our construction and development teams with better tools to manage and take care of the plants and the facilities and to do new development, reduce the amount of time they have to spend on tasks that the systems can do for them. And not only to gain more efficiency from each person, but also to be able to be more proactive in how we take care of plant and equipment, just so you know, we have a great record for reliability. Sometimes that involves more unscheduled time than is necessary and these systems give us greater visibility and the ability to be more proactive. And that's really going on across the organization, and that's just part of the maturation of the company, and the benefits of our increasing scale. Colby Synesael : And was there anything that happened I guess in the in the first quarter in particular that allowed you see any step improvement and profitability that the products may have completed. Paul Szurek : No single thing in particular, just a number of small things that together add up to incremental efficiency and that's probably going to be our pace for the next few quarters. Jeff Finnin : Additional commentary I would add, this isn't specifically related to efficiencies but first quarter while we did highlight you know we had a benefit of about a penny associate with some annual comps ups, and we also benefited we think from having some lower bad debt expense the first quarter, we hope that continues but obviously that's a hard one to predict, and again it is something to watch closely, but all signs in the first quarter looks very good. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Partners, please state your question. Robert Gutman : Hi, thanks for taking the question. So I was hoping you could provide a little more color on network demand. Is it being driven by the deployment of content delivery infrastructures support of OTT offerings, is it unify communications and what are some of the underlying drivers there? Steve Smith : Hi Robert, this is Steve. We are really seeing it across the board, I mean as enterprises interconnect more between their locations as well as with our customers and suppliers are driving more and more demand just in general. We do see - depends on the market I guess a previous way to look at it so as we talked about in the earlier remarks the L.A. market is obviously very entertained in kind of delivery focus as far as the general market is concerned, so we see greater demand there and with that comes greater demand for the network that goes along with it. But overall, between cloud come to delivery just the proliferation of enterprise and how they connect to their suppliers and employees across the globe, frankly, that just requires more and more network to do so. Robert Gutman : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please state your question. Michael Rollins : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Look like most of your net leasing growth in terms of number leases came from the point under 5,000 square feet. I'm wondering if as you unpack performance of that segment or category versus the others, what are you seeing in terms of new customer interest versus lease from existing. And are there certain markets that you find are doing better than others on the smaller co-location side of the deployment game, thanks. Steve Smith : Hi Michael, this is Steve. I'll give you a little bit of color on just the overall approach and where we're seeing demand and try to give you a little more from the financial perspective. From an overall lease perspective as we talked about in the earlier comments, we do see a vast majority of the transactions being created in that less than 5,000 square foot space and that's really a reflection of our go to market strategy, which is that three pronged [ph] approach between enterprise, network and cloud but a lot of effort and focus is around driving enterprise into our data centers, that then those cloud and networks want to connect to and those enterprises obviously want to see the value from. So it's a lot of work, a lot of effort to bring those type of customers in, but that's the vast majority of the new logos that we saw in the first quarter, and frankly every quarter is through the enterprise, and as we see that market continue to mature my expectation is that we would continue to see that proliferate across our ecosystem. That answer's your broader base question, but in general across each of our markets that is where the focus is, is driving enterprise which of those less than 5,000 square foot deployments typically sometimes are networks as well, but for the most part those are just the traditional enterprise in the larger over 5,000 square foot type of deployments are either large fortune 1,000 type of deployments or cloud content type of delivery. Paul Szurek : I would just add to what Steve said, going back to the introductory comments about our business model and the importance of being scalable and flexible for your costumers. Adding new logos has long been a part of a consistent strategy, providing - bringing new companies customers in and that will then subsequently expand and also providing expansion business for the customers that we have in place that provide network and cloud and other services. And there is a lot of synergy between those communities and that's why the ecosystems seem to keep throwing up the value that they throw, and why it's important for us to continue to be able to provide that scalability, flexibility because we see an enormous amount of growth from the customers that we bring into the ecosystem, and the growth they drop to other people that are already in the ecosystem. Michael Rollins : And one another follow up on the numbers. Is there any reason why that growth the power in the quarter sequentially significantly [56:50] in the quarter. Jeff Finnin : Yes, Mike this is Jeff. I've mentioned earlier it really relates to some of our larger wholesale deployments specifically at SV7 that deployed and those deals commenced I guess in early Q4 of 2016. Those customers are deploying gear at this time and it really just ultimately the power generally might lag the increase in rent associated with those deployments, because it takes a little while to get their gear deployed and ultimately start power - power that those deployments are going to need and that we sold into those particular customers. Paul Szurek : The other qualifier I would add there or beyond just to the revenue portion is the margin that goes along with that power obviously those larger deployments typically those are metered type of deployments which are traditionally pass through power and not necessarily bring a lot margin to us as far as the power margins associated with it. So just to provide some clarity there. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Paul Szurek : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Matt Heinz with Stifel, please state your question. Matt Heinz : Thanks. You highlighted particular strengths in demand from the network vertical - I was hoping maybe you could highlight any specific region where you're seeing that strength, is it kind of [indiscernible]. Steve Smith : Hi, Matt, this is Steve. I would say it's really varies from network provider to network provider and really region to region, so it's hard to give you some general around where we are seeing more strength from a network perspective, a lot of it just depends on the maturity of the facility. And how we see the - eventually choose to build natively into those buildings. L.A2 probably a great example of that where our initial strategy which is still work very well for us, has been leveraging the dark fiber tether [ph] between LA1 and LA2 is still a great way for us to provide customers the scalability and performance that they see at LA1 but in a more scalable campus in LA2. At the same time, that building has matured and we've seen more customers deploy their - networks have also chosen to deploy their natively as well to be more efficient for them they see the same benefits and so you see that happen as we - you see buildings mature over time and we're seeing the same thing in NY2 as well as that as it matures over time. I think you just see that across the markets as we start to get better synergies in our ecosystem in each of our facilities. But overall, networks tend to coalesce around one another and we see that continue to mature as we experience our strategy. Matt Heinz : Okay, thank you. And there is a follow up to that, I think you mentioned fiber volume growth outpaced [indiscernible] by about 100 basis point per quarter, I guess that flattening - I was wondering if you could add some color to that - and I also missed the growth in the logical - interconnect. Jeff Finnin : Hi Matt, this is Jeff. Let me give you some color. Steve gave a little bit of this on his script but overall cross connect volume growth for the quarter was 10.3%. The fiber as you just alluded to was 15% of that so blended - I'm sorry a 10.3% volume growth overall, and as you just alluded to overall revenue growth was about 13.9 %. So I still think there is some pricing strength there, it has not decreased but that 10.3 was overall volume growth. Steve Smith : Then just to give you a bit more color around the overall growth numbers. The fiber cross connects the traditional go to for customers are looking to do approximates with their facilities. Some of the decrease that you see is really related to the mix that we've seen over the past several quarters, we look at to larger wholesale deployments versus smaller retailed deployments, and the larger deployments obviously get little bit more diluted because they're leveraging more square footage for maybe a smaller number cross connects than a traditional enterprise might for the same sized footprint. So that's just why you see it a little bit of a decline in that regard. I do think that some customers the networks are starting to explore a bit around 100 gig which they get a bit more efficiencies around but at the same time a connection is the connection they need to - where they need to connect a cloud provider or a network that's still a physical connection or in some cases a logical one. Matt Heinz : Are you still disclosing the growth in last quarter connection services [indiscernible]? Jeff Finnin : My apologies Matt, overall volume growth on the logical interconnection this quarter year-over-year was 6.5% I think that's actually deceleration from where we were in a previous two quarters and that's largely attributable to a couple of customers where we had some churn in those particular abundance but overall this quarter was 6.5% year-over-year. Matt Heinz : Okay, thanks very much guys. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please state your question. Lukas Hartwich : Thank you. I know you guys don't play a lot in the wholesale arena, but I'm just curious what are your thoughts on the supply and demand dynamics there? Steve Smith : Hey, this sis Steve, I can give you my sense on it and I'm sure Paul and Jeff would chime in as well. Wholesale can [ph] in a lot of different ways and as we stated in our strategy it's really opportunistic as far as CoreSite is concerned and that opportunity comes with not only new builds that we may be doing in the market, but also how they fit into our ecosystem and our overall strategy relative to those three pillars around enterprise, cloud and network. So in the typically the wholesale deal that we've been engaged in, we do have a new bill that's going on but they will also contribute to that overarching strategy. We have typically now participated in the hyper-scale type of deployments that you see in less interconnect sense of type of markets, we don't see a dramatic change in that strategy. Paul Szurek : We do in that market see the same things that we've commented on by some of the analysts that that hyper-scale market does tend to be somewhat lumpy, a lot of procurement and then growing into procurement. But then there will be another stage of procurement expected down the road, and we think that's going to continue for some period of years as far as we can see. Consistent with the overall growth in data and data traffic and all the different things people do with data right now. Steve Smith : I would say one of the areas that we have seen an increase in what you would probably traditionally call wholesale is published early in his remarks around the edge and how those edge type of deployments may be sizable in some cases but are still very performance sensitive, the reason why they need to be close to the edge in order to provide a very performance sensitive type of response back to their customers or other applications that they may be delivering service to. So those are a bit unique in their deployments but we are seeing a bit of an uptick there. Lukas Hartwich : That's helpful. And then my last questions around New York and the improvement there. Is that market related or is that more company just better company execution, what is kind of driving the uptick there. Steve Smith : I think it's kind of a combination of both frankly. The team there is matured over time and we're seeing better results out of the team as we build there. I think the ecosystem there has strengthened over time so we've seen that in various markets as we get customers then ecosystems established there that they as Paul mentioned earlier, they start to throw up more value to other participants there, they continue to grow and that that helps drive more revenue, the market starts to find out more and more about the value that we provide in that space. So I think it's a combination of a lot of that and I think them overall the market is maturing there as well. We are optimistic about the outlook and we continue to work hard every day to keep it going. Lukas Hartwich : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you that does conclude our question and answer session. At this time I will now turn it back Mr. Paul Szurek for closing comments. Paul Szurek : Thanks everybody on the call for your interest in the company. We are - as we mentioned we're very pleased with this quarter and pleased with what we see going forward, I would like to thank all of our colleagues at CoreSite to work really hard every day to take good care of their customers and try to stay ahead of costumer demand and we look forward to the rest of the year, thanks very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

Baird Colby Synesael - Cowen & Company Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities Frank Louthan - Raymond James Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital Michael Rollins - Citi Research Matt Heinz - Stifel Nicolaus Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the CoreSite Realty Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And a directive question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Greer Aviv. Thank you. You may begin. Greer Aviv : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I'm joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Federal Securities Laws, including statements addressing projections, plans, or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our 2016 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our Web site at coresite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning. And thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm glad to share our second quarter financial and operating results, as well as update you on our markets and our outlook on supply and demand. Financial results for the second quarter were strong again with year-over-year increases in revenue of 23%, while adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share grew 27% and 24% year-over-year, respectively. Very strong leasing volume of $11.9 million in annualized GAAP rent signed in Q2 included a significant expansion with the Fortune 500 customer in the Los Angeles market and several other key deployments. Overall, it was an unusual quarter for leasing with existing customers representing 95% of new and expansion sales, reflecting the organic growth needs of customers in our markets and an increase in the percentage of sales in funnel related to larger deployments. Correspondently, retail collocation sales were $4.9 million, 18% below the trailing 24 month average. We saw a similar pattern in Q1 2016 when we had another surge in sales of larger deployments. Going forward, we believe these scale deployments and the services they represent are key components of our cloud enabled data center product. They will continue to increase the attraction of our data centers to enterprises and networks, and lay the foundation for continued successful campus expansions. These deployments illustrate the importance of network density plus scalable solutions in large edge markets, which characterizes our national data center platform. We also continue to see a steady influx of new logos joining the CoreSite ecosystem each quarter with 31 new logos entering our customer base in Q2. Net of customer churn, we added 18 new logos. Across our markets, demand remains consistent and absorption, over the last two years, has exceeded our forecast; while supply remains generally in balance or in a couple of markets constrained. Given the strong demand and the organic growth inherent in our existing customer base, we currently have a number of projects under construction to enable us to continue to meet customer demand across our markets, as well as working through the process of planning new data centers in markets that are most inventory constrained. In Los Angeles, the 47,000 square-feet that we commenced construction on during the first quarter, is now 62% preleased as a result of Q2 leasing. In order to maintain available capacity in the market and keep up with overall strong demand, we have commenced construction of an incremental 39,000 square-feet of turnkey datacenter space at LA2. Consistent with what I mentioned earlier, we are accelerating the initial development plans for LA3. On land, we already owned, adjacent to LA2, but which is not yet entitled and permitted for construction. We have commenced the permitting and entitlement process for this asset. In the Bay Area, absorption continues to outpace historical levels while supply remains limited across the market, and occupancy levels are elevated. We are optimistic about the funnel in this market for both larger footprint requirements that need the performance and connectivity to support edge notes and for performance and geographic sensitive retail collocations. As it relates to the land on a contract for SBA, we are substantially complete with our due diligence and anticipate closing in mid Q3. Please keep in mind that we currently estimate the first phase of capacity of SBA would come online approximately 18 to 22 months after we close on the land purchase based on our expectations around timing for permitting and entitlements. Regarding Northern Virginia and DC, demand and absorption continue to be strong. Occupancy rates remain high in this market and a number of datacenter providers have land to develop new capacity, primarily for wholesale deployments and some had commenced construction. Although, we believe the majority of the new construction is preleased. We are under construction on a total of 53,000 square feet across the market with development in Downtown DC, expansion of VA1 and initial development at VA3. We see good activity in the sales pipeline, and continue to have discussions with customers for preleasing opportunities at VA3, where we expect to deliver 25,000 square feet or 3 megawatts of turnkey datacenter capacity in the fourth quarter. We also expect to commence construction in the third quarter on Phase 1B, a 58,000 square-foot building of 6 megawatts plus a centralized infrastructure building to serve the entire VA3 property at an estimated cost of $85 million. In Denver, we are nearing completion on the first phase of expansion of DE1 and expect to place into service 8,200 square feet of turnkey capacity in Q3. Supply across this market remains limited, and we see good opportunities to support customer demand. During the second quarter, we signed a midsize prelease with a company that will be a valuable addition to our ecosystem. Finally, in the New York New Jersey market, we saw an uptick in both square footage and annualized GAAP rent signed in Q2. This March, the third straight quarter of increasing sales in this market and that trend should continue a bit longer. NY2 again accounted for the majority of new and expansion leasing in this market, as well as all of the new logo growth in the quarter. Enterprise activity was strong, accounting for 88% of the annualized GAAP rent signed here. While all of the new logo signed in the quarter within this vertical. In closing, we are pleased with our financial performance and sales results in the second quarter, especially our securing of key ecosystem building blocks, which provide a strong impetus for growth in 2018 and beyond. We continue to believe the flexibility of our platform, our network density and cloud on ramps and our vibrant ecosystem, make CoreSite uniquely positioned to capture demand in a world of increasingly data intensive applications. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. Paul Szurek : Thanks, Paul. I'll begin by reviewing our overall new and expansion sales activity during the second quarter, and then discuss in more detail, our vertical and geographic results. In Q2, we signed 119 new and expansion leases, totaling $11.9 million in annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 52,000 net rentable square-feet at an average GAAP rate of $208 per square-foot. Note that this rate excludes revenue associated with contractually reserved data center space across our platform. Our ability to support evolving customer IT workloads from tradition enterprises with hybrid and multi cloud requirements to high density large scale deployments coupled with access to hundreds of network and cloud service providers, continues to differentiate CoreSite. We are encouraged with the increasing value of this ecosystem as we add more new customers that contribute to the overall attractiveness of our platform. As Paul noted, new logo growth was strong again in Q2, and we continue to be pleased with the quality of applications and customers that are coming to CoreSite datacenters. Included in this quarter's new enterprise logos is a consulting and technology services company, two financial services organizations, our retail ecommerce site, an international consultancy specializing for inter-accounting and data analytics and an international online commerce and payments ecosystem. Additionally, existing customer expansions, which have historically accounted for 70% to 80% of sales on a quarterly basis, continue to be a strong source of growth. This includes customers that either increase their current deployment or expand through additional markets. During the second quarter, we have some powerful examples of customers expanding their applications and/or infrastructure closer to the edge. First, a large public cloud customer expanded with us in New York, and is deploying infrastructure to establish a metro ring around the New York New Jersey market, so that customers can distribute traffic more efficiently to and from their edge sites. The same customer will be deploying a number of applications in our Denver market, representing their first deployment in this area of the U.S. Second a large content company expanded its existing environment with us in Los Angeles, as well as established a new deployment with CoreSite in Northern Virginia. Both expansions were part of this customer's ongoing efforts to increase capacity at the edge to support existing customers and new initiatives, such as streaming video and TV applications. Lastly, a digital media company expanded with us in New York to support high performance video streaming of sporting events. Overall, we continue to see growth in cloud deployments throughout the portfolio as data intensive use cases appear to be increasing. With the expansions of existing customers and the new customer activity contribute to the vibrant interconnection density of our datacenters. In Q2, interconnection revenue grew 18% year-over-year, reflecting total volume growth of 12%, including 16% growth in fiber cross connects. With respect to the vertical mix within our ecosystem, during Q2, net work and cloud customers each accounted for 9% of annualized GAAP rent signed. Specific to the cloud vertical, we continue to see good traction with four new logos, including an international infrastructure as a service provider and a global provider of online business solutions. Additionally, we signed an expansion with a cloud contact center provider, as well as an expansion within edge cloud platform serving digital businesses. The network vertical saw a strong activity during the quarter, which was the result of both new customer growth, as well as expansions. We had five new logos join our ecosystem, including an international communication solution company and a global virtual phone number provider. Additionally, we signed expansions with six fortune 1000 network customers during the quarter. Network demand was broad based with new and expansion leases signed in every one of our markets. As it relates to our enterprise vertical, this vertical accounted for 82% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the second quarter. Our enterprise vertical, which represents approximately 50% of our embedded base, captures not only pure enterprise deployments but also includes cloud deployments that may reside within an enterprise company. Looking at Q2, performance across the vertical was strong, led by strategic content expansions for compute catching nodes at the edge, as well as expansions with six fortune 1000 companies. As Paul discussed, we executed a larger expansion with an existing Fortune 500 customer for their edge compute deployment at LA2. In addition, we signed an expansion of our strategic content customer\u2019s network PoP in Boston, and another strategic content customer\u2019s edge nodes in Los Angeles and northern Virginia. Lastly, we executed an expansion of Fortune 20 customer\u2019s online video streaming services in Silicon Valley. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases during Q2 were Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia DC. Collectively, representing 84% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the quarter. As I touched on earlier, demand in Los Angeles was impacted by the expansion of an existing Fortune 500 content company. Apart from that specific lease, demand was led by the enterprise vertical, followed by networks and cloud providers. Stabilized occupancy across the Los Angeles campus was 92.9% at the end of Q2, up 40 basis points from Q1. Activity across the Bay Area was strong led by the enterprise vertical or by cloud deployments. Our network dense access in the Silicon Valley market continues to be attractive for enterprises with two new logos signed this quarter. Stabilized occupancy across our Silicon Valley campuses decreased 50 basis points to 95.8% due to some modest churn at SE1 and SE4. In Northern Virginia DC, demand continues to be weighted toward smaller enterprise deployments from both existing customers and new logos. We saw good demand from cloud customers with three new logos in this market. Stabilized occupancy across northern Virginia DC now stands at 95.4%, a decrease of 100 basis points on a sequential basis, reflecting some customer churn at VA1. To wrap up, we continue to be pleased with the sale performance in the quarter, and we\u2019ll continue to focus on driving added value across our operating portfolio by attracting synergistic deployments to our datacenters. I will now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. My remarks today will begin with a review of our Q2 financial results, followed by an update on our development CapEx and our leverage and liquidity capacity. I will then conclude my remarks with an update on our 2017 guidance. Q2 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of $117.9 million, a 2.6% increase on a sequential quarter basis and 22.7% increase year-over-year. Q2 operating revenue consisted of $97.3 million in rental and power revenue from datacenter space, up 2.3% on a sequential quarter basis and 23.5% year-over-year. Interconnection services revenue contributed $15.3 million to operating revenues in Q2, an increase of 5.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 18.1% year-over-year. And tenant reimbursement and other revenues were $2.3 million. Office and light industrial revenue was $3 million. Q2 FFO was $1.10 per diluted share in unit, a decrease of 2.7% on a sequential quarter basis and an increase of 23.6% year-over-year. This sequential decline reflects the final expiration of our original full building customer's lease at SV3, as well as the financings executed in April. In addition, we saw an acceleration of decreased power margin in the quarter that we typically see in Q3. Q2 FFO also includes a benefit equal to approximately $0.01 per share related to a real estate tax accrual true up. Adjusted EBITDA of $64.8 million increased 0.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 26.7% over the same quarter last year. Our margins expanded again this quarter with our adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 54.4%, measured over the trailing four quarters ending with and including Q2 2017. This represents an increase of 220 basis points over the comparable year ago period. Related, trailing 12 months revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO was 65% and 56% respectively. Sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter totaled $4.4 million or 3.7% of total operating revenues, down 100 basis points year-over-year. General and administrative expenses were $9.5 million in Q2 or 8.1% of total operating revenues, a decrease of 110 basis points year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect G&A expense to be approximately 8% of total operating revenues, in line with the year-to-date level. Now, turning to our same store metrics. Q2 same store turnkey data center occupancy increased 320 basis points to 91.1% from 87.9% in the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, same store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 6.1% year-over-year and 2.1% sequentially to $1,470. Turning to renewals. In Q2, we renewed approximately 83,000 total square-feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $156 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 2.6% on a cash basis and 6.5% on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, we expect cash rent growth of approximately 3% for 2017. Churn in the second quarter was 2.6% and included 170 basis points of churn related to the final lease expiration of our original full building customer ion SV3. We commenced 26,000 net rentable square-feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $256 per square foot, which represents $6.6 million of annualized GAAP rent. We ended the second quarter with our stabilized datacenter occupancy at 93.8%, a decrease of 90 basis points compared to the first quarter, primarily due to 33,000 square-feet of turnkey capacity at NY2 that moved into the stabilized operating portfolio from pre-stabilized at 51% occupancy. Year-over-year, stabilized datacenter occupancy increased 180 basis points. Turning now to backlog. Projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $11.6 million as of June 30, 2017 and $20.2 million on a cash basis. We expect approximately 40% of the GAAP backlog to commence during the second half of 2017 with the remainder expected to commence in the first quarter of 2018. Turning to our development activity. As Paul mentioned, we had a number of projects under development at the end of Q2 with a total of 162,000 square-feet of turnkey datacenter capacity under construction as of June 30, 2017. This includes development and expansion projects in Northern Virginia, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Denver and Boston. As of the end of the second quarter, we had spent $31.3 million of the estimated $121.9 million required to complete these projects. The percentage of interest capitalized in Q2 was 12.3% and the year-to-date amount is 11.2%. For 2017, we expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 10% to 15%. Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2017, our ratio of net principle debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 2.9 times, including preferred stock, the ratio was 3.3 times. As if the end of the second quarter, we had $368 million of total liquidity, consisting of available cash and capacity on our revolving credit facility. This increased level of liquidity reflects the two financing transactions completed in April, resulting in an incremental $275 million in available liquidity, as well as the fact that we had no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility at the end of the second quarter. As it relates to our dividend, during the second quarter, we announced an increase in our dividend to $0.90 per share on a quarterly basis. At this level for the remainder of the year, we would pay a dividend of $3.40 per share equal to approximately 77% of FFO based on the current midpoint of guidance. The $0.90 per share quarterly dividend represents $0.10 or 12.5% increase over the prior quarterly dividend. We took the opportunity to raise the dividend again six months after the last increase to more accurately reflect the recent performance of the Company and our sustainable cash flow levels. In addition, over the last 6.5 years as a public company, we have grown more comfortable with our visibility into the business, allowing us to increase the FFO payout ratio from the historical level of 60% to 62% to approximately 75%, which is more in line with the REIT industry average payout. Now in closing, I would like to address our updated guidance for 2017. I would remind you that our guidance reflects our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. As detailed on page 23 of our Q2 earnings supplemental, our guidance for 2017 is as follows. Total operating revenue is now estimated to be $473.5 million to $483.5 million compared to the previous range of $472 to $482 million. Based on the midpoint of guidance, this implies 19.5% year-over-year revenue growth. Keep in mind that our revenue guidance is dependent upon the power product composition of deployments within our portfolio, and how quickly the larger metered power deployments install their infrastructure and ramp into their associated power requirements. As it relates to interconnection revenue growth, we now expect the 2017 revenue growth to be in line with the higher end of the range of 13% to 16%. Adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to be $257.5 million to $262.5 million, an increase of $1 million based on the midpoint of current and previous guidance. This correlates to 22.4% year-over-year growth based on the midpoint of the range and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 54.3%, and revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 61%. FFO is estimated to be $4.39 to $4.47 per share and OP unit. This midpoint of $4.43 per share represents an increase of $0.03 per share and implies 19.4% year-over-year FFO growth compared to the $3.71 per share we reported in 2016. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect the first half and second half FFO per share to be generally balanced based on our expectation of relatively flat sequential growth until Q4 with growth resuming that quarter and into 2018, reflecting the full contribution from the cumulative effect of new and expansion leasing. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, in Q3 we have historically seen a seasonal impact related to higher power costs, amounting to approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share. As it relates to our guidance for capital expenditures in 2017, we are decreasing the total expected investment to a range of $250 million to $290 million, from the previous range of $280 million to $310 million. The decrease is based on our outlook for the timing around datacenter expansion investment related to some of the larger development projects across our portfolio. We now expect datacenter expansion investment of $211 million to $239 million compared to the prior range of $241 million to $259 million. Additionally, as we discussed last quarter, we commence spending on the project to replace our chiller plant at LA2, which is recorded as recurring capital and deducted from AFFO. While this impacts sequential AFFO growth, we continue to expect this investment to generate a return on investment that is substantially higher than our overall stated return objectives. Now, we\u2019d like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : First question regarding the funnel, it sounded like, Paul in your opening remarks, you talked about an increase and that related to some larger scale deals. Can you maybe offer a little bit more insight in terms of the flavor, the nature of the requirements that you\u2019re seeing out there? Paul Szurek : Jordan putting it as simply as possible these are higher density requirements but the lot of data in them and a lot of data being either exchanged or pushed out of the network. So there is obviously tremendous operational and cost advantage for processing that much data moving that much data through interconnection as opposed to other ways of doing it from further out datacenters. Jordan Sadler : Are these cloud service provider oriented or is it just more enterprise? Paul Szurek : I think it\u2019s a mix. And Steve can shed some more color on it, primarily cloud and content and to a lesser extent, enterprise. Steve Smith : I would say that cloud content and even enterprise are becoming more and more susceptible to the tolerance of latency, which is becoming less and less by consumers, suppliers and customers, in general. So as that expectation of the general consumer there is more real time, companies are having to solve for that and that involves moving computing data closer to the edge. Jordan Sadler : Just thoughts on some of the competition that you\u2019re seeing from, if at all, and it may actually be complimentary based on what you\u2019re seeing of the FDNs? I mean, is that helping facilitate some of these lower latency requirements or are they, I guess, complimenting your efforts or are they intersecting it another way? Paul Szurek : I think they\u2019re generally complimentary to our efforts. Again, the types of deployments that have to go to the edge really have volumes of data that they\u2019re exchanging at much quicker pace that require that close that interconnection as opposed to having to go through different forms of networks, whether their FDN, metro fiber or other ways of moving traffic around between datacenters. Steve, anything you'd add to that? Steve Smith : No, I'd just echo that, as far as being complementary, I think anytime you give customers choice an ability to access other environments within our data center, that's a good things for those customers. It's good thing for the end customer. And ultimately, that ends up being a good thing for us, because we typically have that compute within our datacenters. So we have many of those SDN providers that have built into our datacenters. And that gives not only customers with their access to those deployments that are there, but also customers that are introduced that may want to access in environments that maybe other places that gives them choice and flexibility as well. So, so far, we've seen it to be very complementary. Jordan Sadler : And then lastly, on SV8. How do you expect that product to orient itself and be presented to the market? Will that be an opportunity to sign another larger scale deal, do you think? And is there an opportunity to prelease that so far in advance, or will that be more of an extension in the campus and you'd look to build that out a bit more gradually, and just be a source of inventory? Paul Szurek : Well, predicting that far out is never precise. So I think the simple way to answer it is, it's going to be an extension of a campus. If you look at that campus, historically, it has periodically had opportunities for preleases and there's every reason to believe that that activity maybe available when we bring SV8 to market. Otherwise, we'll continue the mix of scale deployments and transactional deployments that have characterized that campus so far. Operator : Our next question is from Dave Rogers from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Rogers : One of the follow-up, obviously, a lot of questions or comments this quarter around enterprise and the strength in enterprise; and I just wanted to maybe understand better if there was a shift in terms of how you're thinking about it internally from enterprise as a cloud customer or cloud being categorized now under enterprise in the sense of what the customer is doing in that space. And I guess maybe the broader question is are you seeing a slowdown in the cloud activity and enterprise is taking over, or is it one quarter doesn't make a trend? Just any color there would be helpful. Paul Szurek : Just to give you a bit of clarity there and maybe just doesn't help on the clarity, because I think what you're seeing is that many content customers are also cloud customers and many cloud customers are also content customers; and that leaves open to tradition enterprise even. So what you're seeing is a lot of customers leveraging technology differently that bleeds those verticals a bit. So I think that's part of what you're seeing as far as how we categorize them. But as far as overall demand in the marketplace, we're still seeing very strong demand from the traditional enterprise, it's collocating. We do see greater adoption as you've seen from the cloud providers and those enterprises going to the cloud, but we still see plenty of run way for those enterprises to come into our data centers. And especially as you like to medium to large enterprise, there'll be plenty of opportunity ahead of us that\u2019s not necessarily a feasible or a very quick journey for them to move entirely through that model. Dave Rogers : With regard to revenues and maybe a follow-up on the prior question. Paul, you talked in the prepared comments I think as well as in that answer about higher density. Are we seeing that come through the average rate, has it being masked in any way? And maybe second revenue question for Jeff. How much of that was reserved capacity that you recorded in the quarter in terms of signings? Paul Szurek : The reserve capacity was not material. And obviously for accurate disclosure, we\u2019ve excluded that from the rate category. Density does have some impact on rate per square foot and we like and have set ourselves up to accommodate higher density requirements for that purpose. We tend to look at pricing overall on quarter-to-quarter on an apples-to-apples basis, we breakout by categories of deployment size and markets and density. And when you look at all of that together, the net pricing seem to be about 11% quarter-over-quarter. So there is more than just increased density that\u2019s driving the price increases. Jeff Finnin : Dave, just to clarify, as Paul just related to that 11% increase would strip out some of the wholesale deals we did. Because those just aren\u2019t comparatively quarter-to-quarter and that 11% is on a trailing -- compared to the trailing 12 months basis. Dave Rogers : Maybe last from me I think the one market you didn\u2019t talk about Paul in the comments, if I missed it, was Chicago. Is it just that you\u2019re not seeing the opportunity, the ability to get into more land there? Or are the opportunities just in LA with the resurgence there just taking precedence in your mind? Paul Szurek : No, we continue to look for expansion capacity. In Chicago, we expect that over the next couple of three years, our customers in our existing Chicago facility are going to need that and will drive other opportunities. We continue to work on some opportunities there and we just don\u2019t have anything that is ready to announce. But that\u2019s a good market and we\u2019ve got a good data centre that\u2019s performing well in that market. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : It looks like there is a variety of projects that got pushed out of quarter, so whether those were -- some of those are supposed to open up in the 2017 period or some in late \u201917 that are now opening up in \u201918. I\u2019m curious if what\u2019s behind is, is it simply just coincidental that there is so many of them this particular quarter that got pushed out. And when you look at the amount of money you\u2019re spending in terms of CapEx for the projects that are anticipated to open up in 2018. Well, I appreciate it\u2019s still early. Any thoughts on what CapEx could look like next year? It seems like it could be down again next year versus 2017. And then also on rest and I think everybody is looking to see when you guys signed in anchor tenant deal, that\u2019s expected to open up in the fourth quarter this year. You mentioned I think that the funnel is pretty strong. Is it fair to assume that we\u2019ll most likely see something in the third quarter? Thank you. Paul Szurek : I think it\u2019s mostly coincidental that some projects got pushed back quarter, and I think it\u2019s partly coincidental that we had so many projects going on at the same time. One of the attractions of our markets is that the regulatory and entitlement process create barriers to entry. And although that\u2019s a pain in the neck in the short-term that sometime it takes longer to get permits and entitlements than it does in other markets. We\u2019ve all seen that in every real estate product that creates value for the long term, because the local government provides one of those barriers to entry to new product. So that\u2019s mostly what we have seen with these deployments. I don\u2019t view it as a big deal, but we just try to keep everybody informed about it. Jeff Finnin : The other question was related to 2018 CapEx. And Colby, I guess the thing that I would think about, as you think about CapEx levels for 2018, is just take a look at the more recent three year trend in terms of what our annual CapEx has been, that\u2019s going to give you some level of inside into what that might possibly be for 2018. But at this point, we\u2019re just not ready to give any specific guidance on 2018 CapEx. Paul Szurek : And I wouldn\u2019t draw too many conclusions though. We do have, as you know, a couple of larger projects that depending on when permitting and entitlement is completed could start construction in 2018 at some point as well that we mentioned in both the press release and in our scripts. Jeff Finnin : And then Colby if I wrote down your question correctly your third question was related to VA3 and how are we doing in terms of progress for lease up for developments coming online there. And Paul and Steve could probably give you some color on that. Paul Szurek : So I do want to point out that we\u2019ve got two components to VA3. We\u2019ve got the 3 megawatt build out of an existing computer room that we\u2019re really targeting to be more for the transactional and smaller deployments and then the larger 6 megawatt building that would cover more scale deployments. We can't provide -- I don\u2019t want to predict the future with any grade certainly. But yes, we\u2019ve got a lot of good discussions going on and I would expect some announcement some time later this year if those discussions continue to proceed at pace. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : So couple of questions, one on markets that you\u2019re in that a lot of your peers are, Dallas and Portland and just kind of an update on how you view the pros and cons of inorganic growth, maybe greenfield to brownfield developments in those metros. Secondly, probably for Steve but just maybe an update on sales headcount trends and how much of your leasing recently has been due to direct versus indirect sales channel contributions? And then I was curious about SV3 in the backfill, the prospects of backfill. Is that going to be scale deployments retail and how the technical attributes to that site compare to SV7? Paul Szurek : Let me take the first and the last question and then Steve will address the second one. We look at every opportunity that makes at the triage to expand into other big markets. Now the thing that we repeated in the past and is worth completing here is that we really like big markets with a lot of business activity. Our current eight markets are 20% of the U.S. population, 27% of U.S. GDP and have a much higher level of business activity and data intensive activity than the typical market. There are other markets that meet those categories. Our business model, as you know is successful, primarily because we're able to merry up a network dense node with scalable interconnection ability within the campus or building environment. And that makes the screen a little bit finer for new opportunities, but those are the opportunities that, like our current portfolio, create the best long term sustainable value. And so that's what we look for. And so far we've seen only Denver work is expanded into or have that opportunity, but we continue to look for that in other areas. I do think we can bring some tools to the tables that are not generally out there. We have in a couple of three instances been able to create network dense nodes where they did not exist before. And so that's an opportunity we might bring to bear in another market if we can find the right price point and size to enter and have visibility to scale at attractive returns. So I hope that helps answer that question. On SV3, I just want to remind you that we didn't actually have a tenant move out of SV3 that is the payments from the original tenant at SV3 that they paid out as part of their moving out of that space. SV3 is pretty fully occupied right now. Technologically, it's in the same category as everything else on the Santa Clara campus. Steve Smith : Thanks, Paul. And Jonathan just to answer your question and relative to sales headcount and trending and so forth, we've been roughly at the same headcount, little bit of fluctuation throughout the year and for the last year and a half, I guess. But overall, we haven't had any major changes as far as headcount is concerned, a few changes here and there as you would expect in any sales organization. But overall, we've been fairly stable and really just working towards getting our talent better-and-better every year, our skill level better every year and just get better utilization out of the people that we do have, which kind of leans through the second part of your question, which I think was around direct versus indirect and channel. And that ratio typically is up 10% to 20% of our overall sales as far as the indirect channel is concerned. We do look to try to leverage that and getting additional value and getting deeper and wider within our accounts and markets. And we'll continue to do that. But that's strictly opportunistic and that's off pay our resources that we try to leverage and represent itself, and as the value presents itself. So continues to be a focus and we\u2019ll leverage it as best we can. Jonathan Atkin : And then last question is on artificial intelligence. And I don't know if this ties into the power density comments earlier or not. But to what extent are you seeing that as a current absorber of market capacity overall for the industry, or driving RFP activity or is that kind of more on the come. And do you see that as from what you understand that AI. Is that performance sensitive, meaning that it needs house in major metros, or is it may be less performance sensitive, more computing sensitive in secondary markets? Thanks. Paul Szurek : Jonathan I\u2019ll start with that and then Steve can chime in, if he has anything to add. I think that product category is in early stages, but there is definitely elements of it that are data and compute and performance sensitive, where the insides generated from the AI algorithms lose value if there is too much latency and are responding and reacting to so much data exchange that interconnection is valuable. At this point, I can't really predict how large that opportunity becomes, but it does seem promising at this point for the future. Steve Smith : And I would agree with you Paul. And depending upon how AI is a pretty broad bucket and how it's defined. But I think if you look at some of the most obvious examples of that and the terms of automated vehicles and so forth, that obviously is very latency sensitive, and these make decisions quickly and react quickly. So we\u2019ve had several examples of startups and so forth that our deployment in our datacenters because of need for latency as well as scalability. And I think you just have to look deeper as to the use case and the need for that latency. But I think inherently as you look at intelligence and being able to make smarter decisions quicker, that brings with it the need for low latency and speed. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Gutman from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Robert Gutman : In light of the high growth in interconnection year-over-year, I was wondering if you could provide some incremental color on some of the applications that are driving that. And just some greater detail on whether true sustainable at this level as its really above our guidance range for the year? Jeff Finnin : Rob, it's Jeff. Let me just give you some commentary around that as you probably saw. Obviously, the revenue this report this quarter was up 18.1% year-over-year. If you look at the underlying volumes where we\u2019re seeing particular strength are those deployments where people want to be connected to the cloud environments. And if you just look at the overall volume increase going to and connecting with our cloud customers, it's probably 3x what it is in general of the portfolio overall. It gives some idea of what's going on there. Obviously, in some of the commentary I gave around guidance, our initial guidance range of 13% to 16% for the year given that we\u2019re year-to-date at 16%. And we expect that to be at the upper end of that range. But we\u2019ll see how the second half of the year migrates here. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : You mentioned a couple of markets you said were seemed a bit constrained even. What are the pricing trends there? And do you expect that -- how long do you expect that to be the case? And are you seeing anyone acting irrationally in any of your markets. How would you characterize the mindset of some of your competitors you see in the markets? Thanks. Paul Szurek : Let me address the second question first. We have not seen any irrational behavior. Just to give an example of market, Northern Virginia has seen the most development activity. As I mentioned in my remarks, there is significant new development going on there. But most of it, to our knowledge, is preleased. And I suspect there is probably some leases out there that we\u2019re not aware of that takes the member up higher. But even if, if you look out going forward, if the only amounts in that market that are under construction that are preleased or what we think we know about that might move the vacancy rate. And there is no other change in absorption that might move the vacancy rate by the end of the year, early next year from like maybe 8% to 11%, so not a huge move. But given our own funnel in that area, my guess is there is probably more leasing going on and we are aware of in other areas with other companies. So not seeing any place in any of our markets where development behavior concerns me. In the constrained markets, there has been some pricing uplift. I think that\u2019s reflected in our overall number of 11% that Jeff and I sighted to you earlier. But the pricing uplift is, I would say, measured as opposed to dramatic. There is this one phenomenon that goes into the datacenter industry that we see from time to time, which is that sometimes markets have to have a little bit of supply or latent supply in order to attract more demand. And so constrained markets tend to see things balanced out a little bit more than you would than you would see in other real estate markets where people just don\u2019t have any choice about when they move into something. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Andrew DeGasperi : I'm not sure if you already touched on this. But you mentioned the $30 million guidance on lease commencements for this year. If my guess is correct, you are about 22 if include the backlog that you expect to realize. Is that a conservative number? And then secondly, can you just let us know what the timing is around the LA3 property and when you\u2019re going to bring that online? Thank you. Jeff Finnin : Andy, let me take the first part of that question and then Paul can add some commentary on the second one. But you\u2019re right. We have given some earlier guidance around commencements for the year of about $30 million. And you can look at where we are year-to-date at 15.7 and we said that the backlog about 40% of that would commence. So you\u2019re directionally you\u2019re fairly close in terms of where we expect or at least what we have visibility into. We\u2019re right around 20, just north of $20 million. And so while we believe, obviously, we\u2019ve got the second half of the year, we\u2019ve got some visibility in what we think that will be if I had to even amount I would say would be at or slightly ahead of the $30 million guidance we gave earlier this year. Hopefully, that helps. Paul Szurek : Andrew, in terms of the next building in LA, little bit hard to predict just because again that\u2019s one of those infill markets where the path of entitlements and permitting is not clearly definable. But I would say that best case it would be first quarter of 2019. And then when it actually comes on board in 2019 and when we actually start it, depends on that permitting process. And frankly, the continuation of strong demand in the Los Angeles market. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi Research. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Just have couple of questions, if I could. First, when you look at the cost of building out new datacenter development. Over the last few years, do you see that as inflationary in terms of the component cost versus technology, which is generally deflationary? Just want to get a sense of how do you look at those build costs overtime? And then secondly, if you could just talk a little bit further about what you described as demand closer to the edge. And so what's that doing to demand for market away from the edge? And how does that affect pricing and value for those types of markets versus the ones that you're seeing more favorable demand? Thanks. Paul Szurek : The cost of building generally has been stable, modest inflation, components, not as much. Like everyone in construction, labor has been where you've seen the biggest inflation. The component of that relative to overall cost is much more percentage in datacenters, which are very equipment intensive than it is in other product. So we haven't seen that turn into a real problem. At the same time, we continue to do it all our peers do, and I give Brian Warren, our SVP of Engineering, Construction and his team a lot of credit for continuing to develop improvements in our processes and our designs, in the way we do our construction to deliver, to keep our price per kilowatt at a very good level. So don't see any big area of concern there. The things that are driving demand closer to the edge and there're a couple of good articles out there and that summarizes and it\u2019s supplemented extensively by what we see in our own deployments and the companies that come to us for the space. We've always -- performance, latency has always been an issue for many. I mean some products, especially if they\u2019re going to consumers and businesses. They have to have very good latency in order to be successful; think about ecommerce, video streaming, video on demand all those sort of things. And frankly more-and-more cloud -- some cloud development compute platforms and others, the customers they're serving are latency sensitive. But there's another factor that has emerged that I think is gaining an importance and maybe becoming as important as latency. And that's just the sheer volume of data for particular applications that need to be crunched very quickly and exchanged with customers and other peers pretty quickly. And that just creates engineering challenges for doing that thing further away from the edge, further away from the network node and in an environment where you\u2019ve got to go, worse case over the Internet, best case over some type of WAN process. But we're even like 10 milliseconds of delay and how these thousands of transactions get processed or data exchanges get processed can really clog that performance. And that data intensity is what's driving more -- has driven some of the good traffic we've seen in these larger scale deployments at the edge nodes lately, as much as -- may be as much as the performance sensitivity. And we have seen we have customers that have moved deployments from lower cost places further away into our datacenters in order to overcome both the cost and the operating inefficiencies of exchanging that data outside an interconnected environment. Steve Smith : I would agree with that Paul. And I think the only thing I would add to that is mobile traffic is also a huge contributor to that as you see more and more mobile device and doesn\u2019t where you walk down the street or airplanes or anywhere else, everyone\u2019s got a mobile device. And you see a lot of video streaming that\u2019s happening on those, which drives this huge amount of data. And so having that data and throughput closer to where those mobile networks interconnect is also critical in order to get that performance level up, whether it's a content provider or cloud provider, or even an enterprise. There is a balance that they work and it\u2019s a math equation on their end to figure out latency relative to constants and support to that deployment. So you have seen, even in some cases, some of these other providers moving into secondary markets and where it justifies that cost and expense. But in the markets that we're in, it\u2019s a fairly easy math problem to compute, given the number of eyeballs and networks and demand that\u2019s there for them to establish those points of presence. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Heinz from Stifel. Please go ahead. Matthew Heinz : I'm curious just about the engineering challenges. May be for some of the order or more highly connected edge co-lo sites as you're referring to the power density requirements going up. Do you feel that some of these order buildings are properly equipped to handle denser requirements not only now but where you anticipate they could go? And I guess what impact did this have the economics generally across the industry, because we see upward pressure on maintenance or upgrade expenditures for new power and cooling systems as this trend potentially continues and accelerates. Paul Szurek : Well, I think the old carrier tells and the traditional network dense nodes and office buildings are always going to have their core and faithful customers who will deploy in those environments, equipment of density that those environments can handle. But they are constrained that\u2019s why we develop the campus model to interconnect with some of our network nodes directly. For loading requirements in some of those older office building don\u2019t allow for as much density, the heavier racks, heavier servers. There are also harder to cool efficiently. They are not raised for environments, so you\u2019re flooding the computer rooms with cold there generally. There is not as much as you can do with hot and cold aisle containment; although, we do as much as we can in our facilities like that. So as the actual data intensely and the amount of cash of storage and compute that you need at the edge that goes along with those network nodes grows and requires more density. The scalable options that we provide in our campus environments where they are purpose built, they are raised for environments, you can put -- it's easier to put in cold aisle containment, we can drive PUV down. And the fur loading is not an issue they serve a real purpose million that\u2019s -- we tried to explain and maybe haven\u2019t done a good job. But that\u2019s driven a lot of our growth is our ability to provide that type of more efficient more dense environment close to these traditional network nodes where target create that kind of density and that kind of power and cooling efficiency. But I still think, we still continue to see strong demand for deployments of smaller types of broader enterprise and networks, and then some of the companies that use networks extensively in those network nodes, in those traditional carrier hotel buildings. Steve Smith : Matt, in regards to the second part of your question, in terms of capital cost for recurring maintenance. I think the important aspect to think about, if you just look at us historically, we\u2019ve been -- our recurring CapEx has been anywhere between 1.5% to 2% of revenues. While that\u2019s all, you and the street have visibility until we continue to think about the best way to think of that is on a per kilowatt basis. Having said that, we don\u2019t give visibility into that, so it's hard really for you guys to gauge what that\u2019s going to be. But I would think, as we look forward and based on some of the experience we\u2019ve seen for 2017, a range as a percentage of revenue of 1.5% to 2.5% is probably reasonable range to think about for CoreSite. I don\u2019t think that helps meaningfully but it is something that we think about in terms of the go forward modeling, et cetera. So hopefully that helps. Paul Szurek : I would like to add on that, because as Steve mentioned of the core chiller replacement in some reports. And again, put the blame on us for not explaining that more carefully. We did not have to replace all those chillers that we\u2019re replacing this year. Those are multiple units of chillers that could have been replaced over the next two to four years and what kept our CapEx expenditures in line with historical averages. However, we had the opportunity to do something totally different, which was combined all of them instead of replacing them with more small chillers combine all of them in a single large chiller plant that serves other space as well; and is so much more power efficient that the return on investment on just rolling these into this bigger project is probably higher than anything else in our portfolio. Whereas if we just follow the traditional method of replacing them, each of them as they got to end of life, we would not have that opportunity to achieve that power efficiency, because there's still physical limitations on how power efficient a smaller chiller can be. So I know that to be pure on the AFFO count and we put that in the right bucket for recurring CapEx. But it has a tremendous return associated with it, and continues our path that we pursue aggressively towards more power efficiency. Matthew Heinz : Do you think they're ahead of your peers on replacing some of the equipment or upgrading some of the equipment that you think will drive added advantage? Paul Szurek : Honestly, I can't say anything about that because I don't really have visibility into what they're doing. I'm guessing that part of the reason our release results are so good is that our PUE is at least viewed as not a negative, maybe it's viewed as a positive. But I just really don\u2019t know how to compare with peers on that point. Operator : Our next question comes from Lukas Hartwich from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Lukas Hartwich : Net neutrality seems like its back in the public debate again. I'm just curious what CorSite's stance is on that issue? Paul Szurek : From which perspective, Lukas? Lukas Hartwich : I guess are you on the side of the more of the tech industry and pushing for the net neutrality provisions, or are you more on the side of the, sounds like the current Chairman of the FCC pushing to revoke those -- I think entitled to? Paul Szurek : So the last time I've actually spoken to a politician or a federal regulator might have been a decade and a half ago. So I think that the simple answer is that there're a lot of people working through this. However, it turns out its probably fine for us either way. We didn't see a big change when net neutrality was implemented by the prior FCC Chairman and I don't expect we'll see a big change if that gets unwound in the current or is being unwound in the current administration. So I hope that's -- that\u2019s as response that I can give to your question. Lukas Hartwich : And then another just kind of housekeeping question, the new development in LA2. The cost basis looks pretty low, 376 square foot. I'm just curious what's going on there? Paul Szurek : Well, because we've got a lot of core and sell in other system is already in place. Lukas Hartwich : Is that in incremental CapEx? Steve Smith : Yes, that's correct. That's just in the incremental component and obviously leveraging off of the investment we made several years ago there as well, Lukas. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Paul Szurek for any closing comments. Paul Szurek : I just like to close, thanking my colleagues for another good quarter. All, Steven and Jeff and I know we're very fortunate to have an outstanding team that works hard every day to take the care of our customers and create value for our shareholders. And I'd like to thank all of you that are on this call for your interest in the Company and thank you, especially to those who asked questions so that we have the opportunity to answer them. I hope you all have a great rest of your day. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning, and thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm glad to share our third quarter results and to update you on our near-term plans and the current state of our market. CoreSite delivered strong third quarter results. Revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO grew 22%, 25% and 22% year-over-year, respectively, driven by continued customer expansion across the portfolio and a focus on good execution throughout the organization. Last month marked the seventh anniversary of our IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, and I couldn't be more pleased with the CoreSite team and its accomplishment since then. We have remained committed to a focused strategy and have distinguished our hybrid model, expanding our network and cloud-anchored campus model to a substantial majority of our market. We are generally best positioned to provide our customers with access to low latency interconnection-rich network node complemented by flexible and scalable purpose-built data centers that can accommodate both higher density workloads and the customer ecosystem emerging in major metro market. Since IPO, we have more than tripled revenues almost entirely through organic growth while prudently deploying capital at a pace and at return that have allowed us remain one of the lowest levered REIT. We continue to believe our business model will support future growth and create a compelling value proposition for our current and future customers.  Moving on to third quarter sales performance. We signed new and expansion leases of $10.1 million in annualized GAAP rent. Q3 leasing volume included an incremental expansion of a strategic customer at LA2. This customer is utilizing its collocation space with us to support multiple applications that require low latency and interconnection density combined with a reasonable total cost of ownership. This deployment illustrates how the value of our campus model continues to drive strong expansion demand from existing customers both in their current CoreSite facilities and in our other market. These organic customer expansions accounted for approximately 94% of annualized GAAP rent signed in Q3 and 85% of GAAP rent signed since December 31, 2014. In addition to this organic growth, in the third quarter, we added 24 new logos to our customer base. We have been redirecting our new logo efforts consistent with the market turn towards hybrid cloud and multi-cloud architecture focusing on the enterprises and enablers most attracted to that model and most likely to contribute to the customer ecosystem. We are pleased with these efforts so far. These types of customers generally increase their requirements over time becoming additional contributors to our organic growth. I expect our new logo generation to increase as our modified sales and marketing efforts gain additional traction. We believe our markets are generally in balance or close to it in terms of supply and demand. We are therefore focused on ensuring we have adequate capacity in key markets to continue to meet customer needs for differentiated turnkey data center capacity. We currently have a solid pipeline of projects in planning, entitlement and construction with nearly 220,000 square feet of capacity in various stages of development across the portfolio. We look forward to 2018 during which we expect to set up our company for its next phase of growth, including expected construction commencement on SV8 and LA3 and our ongoing expansion in Reston. These 3 projects, cumulatively representing nearly 415,000 square feet of incremental TKD capacity, provides significant runway as we look to 2019 and beyond in 3 of our largest markets. In addition, we are opportunistically looking for additional land and/or capacity in Denver and Chicago.  Looking more specifically at our individual markets. In Los Angeles, we are on track with our development projects at LA2 and expect to deliver 87,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity in the first quarter of 2018. Due to existing customer growth and new customers, the total expansion capacity under construction at LA2 is now 43% preleased. We continue to work through entitlement, permitting and design work for LA3. Pending any unforeseen delays, we expect to commence construction in the first half of 2018. In terms of the market overall, pricing has softened slightly due to additional capacity created by churn at sites owned by others, but we view that as temporary. In the Bay Area, occupancy levels remain elevated across the market, while pricing is moderately down due to incremental supply from other developers but still ahead of historical norms. Across our Santa Clara campus, we have approximately 56,000 square feet available at the end of Q3. We are in the design process for SV8 and anticipate filing for permits in the coming weeks, which should enable us to start construction in the first half of 2018. Northern Virginia and DC still see strong demand though the market remains competitive with new supply primarily in Loudoun County and Manassas. Occupancy rates are high, but the amount of new supply has resulted in modestly more competitive pricing in this market. We anticipate delivering 3,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity at VA1 in the fourth quarter as well as a 25,000 square foot first phase of turnkey capacity at VA3. We have begun site work at VA3 for an 80,000 square foot data center building, which, at full build out, will have capacity of 12 megawatts plus a 77,000 square foot centralized infrastructure building to serve the entire VA3 property. We will build out the first 50% of this new data center building as Phase 1B. Other site work ongoing will enable an ultimate VA3 capacity of 611,000 to 897,000 square feet of new data center space, depending on final zoning rules. We continue to have good discussions with current and prospective customers in this market regarding their growth needs and remain encouraged by the pipeline for pre-leasing opportunities at VA3. In Denver, we completed the first phase of expansion at DE1 and placed into service 8,200 square feet of turnkey capacity, which was 42% leased and 35% occupied. We continue to enhance the value of the ecosystem as our Denver campus is now the site of the first native on-ramp for a leading public cloud provider serving the U.S. Mountain region. With supply across the market still constrained, in Q3, we began construction of the final phase of expansion at DE1 with 15,600 square feet of turnkey capacity, which we estimate completing in the third quarter of 2018.  In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter results, our development activities supporting future growth and our efforts to increase market share in the hybrid and multi-cloud space. We believe that our differentiated business model and ownership strategy focusing on scalable, flexible, network and cloud dense data centers in infill locations of large-edge markets where the data community has a high level of interaction and interdependence will enable us to continue to prosper on behalf of our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steven Smith : Thanks, Paul. I'll begin by reviewing our overall new and expansion sales activity during the third quarter and then discuss in more detail our vertical and geographic results. During the quarter, we signed 103 new and expansion leases, totaling $10.1 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 41,000 net rentable square feet and average GAAP rate of $247 per square foot. There are a few dynamics impacting the Q3 rate, including higher average density, which was almost 40% above the trailing 12-month average. Related, we had somewhat of a unique situation with a full room enterprise customer in Santa Clara that contracted for additional power without adding incremental square footage, resulting in the above average density. We saw good traction this quarter as it relates to new logo signed with enterprise customers accounting for 75% of annualized GAAP rent signed for new logos. These customers included a regional credit union, which deployed with us in 2 markets; a network pop with the largest social media provider in China; a Fortune Global 500 Japanese information technology equipment and services company; and a provider of hardware and cloud-based CDN and caching solutions. As Paul mentioned, Q3 leasing was again heavily weighted towards expansions of existing customers, which continues to be a strong source of organic growth for us in existing deployments and in new markets or facilities. During the third quarter, a large public cloud provider expanded with us in New York supporting its dipole node and access to its cloud onramp. Second, a large cloud application and platform services company expanded with us in Chicago with a new backbone pop deployed to support its cloud computing services. Lastly, a leading enterprise cloud -- private cloud and backup infrastructure provider expanded with us in Northern Virginia to support multi-cloud service offerings to its customers. Both the organic growth from our embedded base and the incremental growth from our new logos that are attracted to the high level of interaction with our ecosystem continue to drive better-than-expected performance for our interconnection products and services. In Q3, interconnection revenue grew 21% year-over-year, reflecting total volume growth of 13%, including 70% from fiber cross connects. Year-to-date, interconnection revenue increased 18%. With respect to the vertical mix within our ecosystem, during Q3, network and cloud customers accounted for 12% and 14%, respectively, of annualized GAAP rent sign. The network vertical continued to perform well in Q3 with solid growth from existing customers driving activity in the quarter. We signed 4 new network logos in Q3, including a global satellite connectivity solutions provider and an international fiber to the home network developer. Network demand from existing customers remains healthy with a number of expansions across nearly all of our markets, including the sizable expansion of a subsidiary of an international telecom provider in the Bay Area to support its end customers growth in the U.S. Turning to the cloud vertical. As I mentioned previously, we saw good growth from existing cloud customers that are expanding with us in Q3 to support growth in their respective products and services. We signed 5 new logos, including a global cloud hosting provider, a leader in software defined infrastructure and a network visibility and traffic monitoring technology provider. As it relates to our enterprise vertical, this vertical accounted for 74% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the third quarter. Looking more specifically at Q3. In addition to the expansion with our strategic digital content enterprise customer in Los Angeles, we signed expansions with a leading e-commerce retail of home goods, a leading e-health care provider, a multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate and a sports broadcasting organization. We continue to believe our highly interconnected network-dense data center campuses provide the optimal mix of connectivity, low latency and scalability to attract this key customer demographic. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases during Q3 were Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and New York, New Jersey, collectively representing 85% of annualized GAAP rent signed in the quarter. Strength in Bay Area leasing was led by the power expansion in Santa Clara, which I discussed earlier. Above and beyond that specific lease, performance was driven by the cloud and enterprise verticals followed by network service providers. We have also seen increasing interest from the autonomous vehicle sector in the Bay Area market and continue to see the enterprise vertical representing the demand for larger requirements. Demand in Los Angeles was again impact by the expansion of a strategic content customer, which Paul highlighted earlier. Apart from that specific lease, digital media entertainment continues to be a reliable source of demand for us, where we continue to see steady network growth with 3 new networks added to the Los Angeles ecosystem. The positive trajectory continued in the New York, New Jersey market in Q3 with performance led by cloud growth. In addition, we see increasing activity among the financial services vertical while the health care vertical is also increasingly common in the funnel. Sales of square footage sold both increased again this quarter with leasing at NY1 the main driver. New logo growth was weighted towards the enterprise vertical at both NY1 and NY2. In October, we received notification from the Virginia Economic Development Partnership authority that CoreSite successfully achieved the targets set forth for capital investment and new jobs creation in order to qualify for the sales and use tax exemption for the purchase or lease of qualifying computer equipment and enabling software by data centers and their customers. CoreSite is the first and only data center provider to qualify in Fairfax County, and we believe this is an important differentiator and benefit to our customers. We can continue to include additional current and future CoreSite data center customers as participants in the programs, sales and use tax savings program through June 30, 2035. Over the last 6 quarters, a significant amount of our leasing activity has been focused on the necessary building blocks to support our customer ecosystem and future growth by attracting key networks, cloud service providers and enterprises with similar anchor tenant characteristics, which promote the robust exchange of traffic within our facilities and interdependence among our customers. As we build critical mass of such customers, we will focus more sales resources towards attracting new logos that complement and exchange data with these core customers.  In summary, the third quarter sales results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and business model, and we will continue to work to attract valuable new customers and applications to our data centers. I will now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Finnin : Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. My remarks today will begin with a review of our Q3 financial results followed by an update of our development CapEx and our leverage and liquidity capacity. Q3 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of $123.1 million, a 4.4% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 21.5% increase year-over-year. Operating revenue consisted of $101.8 million in rental and power revenue from data center operations, up 4.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 22.5% year-over-year. Interconnection services revenue contributed $16.2 million to operating revenues, an increase of 5.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 21.1% year-over-year. And tenant reimbursement and other revenues were $2.2 million.  Office and light industrial revenue was $2.9 million. Q3 FFO was $1.10 per diluted share and unit, flat on a sequential quarter basis and an increase of 22.2% year-over-year. The quarter included a couple of items worth highlighting and the first is a benefit of approximately $0.03 per share related to real estate tax true-ups at some of our facilities in the Bay Area. In addition, during the third quarter, we saw elevated repairs and maintenance expense across the portfolio primarily for chiller repairs and upgrades which amounted to approximately $0.02 per share. We also experienced increased expenses in Miami related to Hurricane Irma, which amounted to approximately $0.01 per share. Related to Hurricane Irma, we want to personally thank our team for their efforts in serving our customers and keeping our Miami data center up and running throughout the storm and its aftermath. Looking forward into Q4. I want to emphasize that we expect to invest approximately $8 million to $10 million of recurring capital associated with the chiller plant replacement and upgrade at LA2 and, therefore, we expect AFFO to decrease sequentially. Please remember that we expect a strong return subsequent to this investment with increased energy efficiency.  Returning to Q3. Adjusted EBITDA of $65.3 million increased 0.7% on a sequential quarter basis and 25.2% over the same quarter last year. We continued to expand our margins with our adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 54.7% as measured over the trailing 4 quarters ending with and including Q3 2017. This represents an increase of 230 basis points over the comparable year ago period. Related, trailing 12-month revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA and FFO was 65% and 54%, respectively. Sales and marketing expenses in Q3 totaled $4.6 million or 3.8% of total operating revenues, down 60 basis points year-over-year. General and administrative expenses were $9.8 million or 7.9% of total operating revenues, a decrease of 140 basis points year-over-year. For the full year, we expect G&A expense to be approximately 7.5% of total operating revenues, in line with the year-to-date level.  Now turning to our same-store metrics. Q3 same-store turnkey data center occupancy decreased 20 basis points to 90.3% compared to Q3 2016. Additionally, same store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 6.1% year-over-year and 2.2% sequentially to $1,503.  Turning to renewals. In Q3, we renewed approximately 81,000 total square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $178 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 5.5% on a cash basis and 10.9% on a GAAP basis. Churn in the third quarter was 1.4%. We commenced 22,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $410 per square foot, which represents $8.9 million of annualized GAAP rent. As previously mentioned, the density increase in the Bay Area elevated the commencement rate in Q3. We ended the quarter with our stabilized data center occupancy at 93.4%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to the prior quarter. We completed 8,300 square feet at DE1 and this capacity was placed into the pre-stabilized pool at 35.2% occupancy. Turning now to backlog. Projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $13.7 million as of September 30, 2017. On a cash basis, our backlog was $20.1 million. We expect approximately 35% of the GAAP backlog to commence during the remainder of 2017 with the balance expected to commence during the first half of 2018. As Paul mentioned, we have a total of nearly 220,000 square feet of turnkey data center capacity in various stages of development. This includes new construction and expansion projects in Northern Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles; Denver; and Boston. As of the end of the third quarter, we had invested $62.3 million of the estimated $217.1 million required to complete these projects. We have now included the expansion opportunities associated with the future development of both SV8 and LA3 to our held for development summary, which is reflected on Page 19 of the earnings supplemental. The percentage of interest capitalized in Q3 was 11.5% and the year-to-date amount is 11.3%. For 2017, we continue to expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 10% to 15%. Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2017, our ratio of net principle debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 3.0x. Including preferred stock, the ratio was 3.5x. As of the end of the third quarter, we had $332 million of total liquidity consisting of available cash and capacity on our revolving credit facility. As we announced on October 16, we intend to redeem all 4.6 million outstanding shares of our 7.25% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a redemption date on December 12, 2017, for a total of $116.3 million, including accrued dividends. We believe this transaction will result in significant savings and earnings accretion for shareholders of approximately $0.06 to $0.08 per share in 2018. We expect to utilize the credit facility to redeem the preferred shares and we anticipate the need for additional debt financing during the first half of 2018 to further increase our liquidity. Timing, pricing and the type of debt instrument are dependent on market conditions, and we've targeted a total issuance amount of $225 million to $300 million while maintaining a healthy balance between our fixed and variable price debt. This additional liquidity can be utilized to fund continued development across the portfolio. And looking into 2018, we currently expect our total capital investment to be between $250 million and $300 million. Finally, as you begin thinking about your models and 2018 estimates, keep in mind that we are planning to adopt 2 new accounting standards, revenue recognition and lease accounting, effective January 1, 2018. The adoption of these new standards predominantly impacts us in 3 ways, all of which have been disclosed in our previously filed financial statements in 2017. First, related to the balance sheet, it will require us to gross up our balance sheet by $100 million to $300 million to reflect the estimated lease liability for the properties we lease from third parties. Second, depending upon the quantification of the balance sheet impact, it may increase our rental expense to reflect increased levels of lease expense included in current lease terms. This will likely range from $0.00 to $0.07 per share. Third, we will no longer capitalize indirect sales and marketing payroll cost associated with successful leasing. This has a negative impact of $0.03 per share. All in, we anticipate this will have an impact of $0.03 to $0.10 per share and is more fully explained on our public filings with our Q3 Form 10-Q expected to be filed tomorrow.  Now we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. David Rodgers : Maybe, Steve, just wanted to start with the leasing activity in the quarter. It seems like it was maybe just a little bit slower than the pace you've been moving at, and I wanted to know if that ties in all your comments that you had made about setting the groundwork for the right tenants to come in. So I guess the 2 questions, to shorten it up, would be, did you see any kind of pull back in leasing in the quarter that worried you at all? And the second would be, do we expect leasing to accelerate now that the building blocks are in place or just kind of stay where it's at? Steven Smith : Yes. Thanks, Dave. I guess the short answer is it doesn't provide any concern as to where we are with any slowdown. I think we are being, and continue to be, disciplined about how we're first to marketplace in pricing. So that's a key aspect of this. But as we mentioned in the prerecorded remarks there, it's really around how do we target the right tenants, those that are going to value low latency and interconnection. And as we establish those building blocks, to your point, we continue to look to those right logos that will complement that as well as value that, and that continues to be our strategy. So as far as overall volume is concerned, we continue to drive more focus there, and we expect to see those results to increase. David Rodgers : Okay, great. And then, Jeff, you did mention on the balance sheet up to maybe $300 million of issuance in the first half of next year. Have you thought more about the public fund market in terms of that being an new option for you given the sizing of the transaction you talked about? Jeffrey Finnin : Obviously, the public bond market is always an option, and we watch that market and that pricing closely. Having said that, you saw the recent execution actually that was just priced yesterday by one of our peers in the public bond market. And I think that data point, together with some of the other data we see in terms of trading pricing of some of the other public bond issuers, is something we'll take into consideration. But I think we're able to get better pricing in the private market today. At least we were -- last April when we went out, last test of the market, we hope that's the same as we again look at trying to do something again the first half of '18 but is something we'll have to watch closely. David Rodgers : Lastly for me, you talked about added power revenues or added power density at existing leases in the quarter. One, do we see more of that coming in the future; but two, also, how much of an impact did that have in the third quarter, and is there any additional carryover into the fourth quarter as well? Steven Smith : Yes, as far as power densities are concerned, we do see some applications that are requiring higher density overall. We feel that that's fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter, though. So I think as equipment and customers get better utilizing their power as well as gear gets more efficient in using that power, you'll see that climb up a bit over time. But nothing dramatic that we've seen, just a continued march towards that better utilization. Jeffrey Finnin : And Dave, the only other data point I'd give you if you just take a longer look at what's happened to density, just call it, over maybe the last 2 years, you have seen an increase in overall power densities across at least our portfolio. But this quarter was even higher than what we've seen there. That's obviously why Steve wanted to point it out in the prepared remarks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Jordan Sadler : I wanted to follow up on the development and sort of the positioning again for '18 and the sort of next phase of growth. So you've added LA3 and SV8 to the new development schedule and, obviously, Reston is underway. Can you just talk a little bit about the return expectations there vis-\u00e0-vis sort of maybe commodity space versus what you've historically been able to generate on sort of more network dense facilities? Paul Szurek : Jordan, this is Paul. We view these investments as having the same potential returns that we have always historically targeted. And as you know, that is based upon the fact that our space is not commodity space but leverages off our network nodes and our model of providing scalable higher density capacity, more efficient capacity close to, i.e., interconnected to our network nodes. So I view these as continuations of our historical development strategy and return targets. Jordan Sadler : That's helpful. But I was also kind of -- I can't help but notice that the scale of some of these new investments, obviously, the function of you guys kind of leasing up a lot of the existing portfolio. You and I have talked about sort of avoiding the J curve a little bit and maybe signing big leases up front. And it seems to me that there is some real competition around courting those larger customers, those anchor customers that you guys have historically targeted. Is -- will you be able to maintain sort of price on those larger requirements still? Paul Szurek : Consistent with historical practice, I believe so. The preleasing activity really heats up right around the time that you break ground for your vertical buildings. We expect the same here. And historically, a lot of our pre-leasing is to just coming from customers who need to expand in place in our existing campuses, and we see a lot of those same trends continuing with these projects which is why we're excited about moving forward with them. Steven Smith : The only other thing I would add there, Jordan, is that as we've put together these projects not only to -- as we determine the scale of each individual project but also the underwriting of it, we factored in some of the pricing that's needed in order to get those off the ground in order to get the ultimate returns out of that project. So we feel like we're well positioned in order to compete and still drive the returns that we need to. Jordan Sadler : Last one. As we ramp these developments a little bit more, especially the initial phases, I think you talked about first half of '18 for SV8 and LA3, should we anticipate that the CapEx spend for next year would ramp up a bit above the levels we're seeing this year? Jeffrey Finnin : Yes, Jordan. I think today, we've got guidance out there for this year to be, I think, it's $250 million to $290 million range, so midpoint of 3 -- I'm sorry, midpoint of $270 million. In the prepared remarks, I actually highlighted that we would expect CapEx for 2018 to be about $250 million to $300 million. So at the midpoint, right on top of what we expect to ultimately spend in 2017. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Jonathan Atkin : So I was interested in the renewal spreads and maybe talk a little bit more about the positive spreads that you're seeing. Is that fairly broad-based? Does it vary? Is it shorter-term contracts? Are you also seeing a step up on the law of the longer-term full sale deals that come up for renewal? And then my second question is on interconnection and -- what types of scenarios are you seeing that's driving the growth there? Is it just more businesses connecting to each other within the same campus or data hall? Or is it cloud? Or more carriers popping your sites? Jeffrey Finnin : Jonathan, it's Jeff. I'm just going to add some commentary and I'll then turn it over to Steve to give you a little bit more details. But one thing I just wanted to make sure we recalled is when we gave guidance at the beginning of this year, we tried to highlight that we expected our cash mark-to-market to be fairly flat or at the lower end of our range in the first half and then to be elevated in the second half. And so based on the third quarter results, it's right in line with what we expected, and so we weren't surprised by it. But that's -- I just wanted to highlight that to make sure you guys were aware of what we expected to happen during the year. Steve can give you some additional commentary related to your other questions. Steven Smith : Yes, Jonathan. As far as renewal spreads are concerned, it is a cause and focus for us to ensure that we are maximizing the opportunity there but also being fair to our customers, and we feel like we strike that balance. We do have a fair amount of customers that came due this year that we were successful in marking to market, so we continue to look at those individually. And as we also have constrained space to make sure that we're getting the most return out of the space available. So that continues to be a focus for us. But overall, we seem to be in balance with where market conditions are. And also, as you look at the churn, we seem to be striking that balance fairly well. As far as interconnection growth is concerned, the primary factor that we've seen is really in the connection to cloud so we've highlighted that on prior calls and that continues to be the trajectory that we're seeing right now and we look to see that continue in the foreseeable future. Jonathan Atkin : Okay. And then Chicago, you mentioned that, I think, alongside Denver, is a place amongst you're looking for additional location. So in Chicago, is that kind of a campus situation or an additional site downtown? What are you thinking there? Paul Szurek : Like most of our peers, when it comes to that type of activity, it's better to talk less until you actually execute something. But I think we've been fairly clear that our business model is based on the campus model, and whatever we do in any city like Chicago or Denver will be consistent with that model. Jonathan Atkin : Okay. And then finally, I'm just interested that you called out the chiller plant investments at LA2. And just at a broader level, can you talk about how frequently one would see the sort of lumpier and more expensive maintenance activities going forward? Paul Szurek : I think that they're fairly rare. I mean this one came about because we were expanding LA2 anyway and needed to add additional chiller capacity, and that gave us the opportunity to actually upgrade all the chillers at the same time and achieve a much higher energy efficiency and significant savings. And so really -- it really is a great return on investment. So that doesn't happen very often where replacement calendars can be accelerated in conjunction with a new build. But in this case, it's very attractive. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim. Robert Gutman : So given year-to-date commencements and what's scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter from the backlog, I think we get pretty close to the $30 million that you estimated to be close to the year. So if we assume another consistent quarter of incremental deals signed and commenced, and without any meaningful change in power revenue and churn, is it a valid assumption to say that you're -- we're looking towards the high end of the revenue range? Jeffrey Finnin : Yes. Yes, let me talk a little bit about -- I think what you're looking at is probably guidance for 2017 that we have provided. I think as you think about the fourth quarter, we -- obviously, we chose not to change our guidance for the fourth quarter for the remainder of 2017 just given where we were in the year. Having said that, I think it's important to think about as you look at it for operating revenues, adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share that we would likely be at the upper end of our current guidance ranges. I just wanted to add that additional commentary just as you guys think about the fourth quarter. Robert Gutman : And just a quick follow-up. So I guess the same thought process applies to the interconnection guidance because it's 13% to 16% and you're already about 18% year-to-date. Jeffrey Finnin : Yes. I mean, I think we're just under 18% year-to-date, so we would agree we would be probably at the upper end, probably exceeding the upper end of our guidance range given what we've got out there today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. Colby Synesael : You've historically reviewed your dividend towards the end of the year. I realize you raised it, I guess, out of order in the second quarter. Is it fair to assume that you're going to still look at it again at year-end this time around? Or are you now in a new schedule for that? And then as it relates to the stabilized square feet, it looks like it was down quarter-over-quarter, I think, for the first time if not ever. I'm just trying to understand what would have been behind that. Paul Szurek : So thank you for the question. I believe we mentioned after the last dividend raise that we expected to review the dividend biannually, and I expect that our board will continue to follow that approach. Colby Synesael : And if that's the case, is it fair to -- we should still kind of think of the payout ratio being somewhat similar? So whatever we kind of all assume for our growth assumptions, it is what it is, but the payout should be most likely fairly similar? Paul Szurek : I mean, I guess that's a good way to look at it. It's ultimately a board decision, so I can't say any more than that. Jeffrey Finnin : And Colby, just related to your second question around the stabilized square feet, that decrease of about 9,000 square feet really just relates to some of the churn that we experienced in the quarter. And the churn that we experienced in that decrease was largely a result of some move-outs we had at Chicago. Colby Synesael : Okay. And did I also hear -- just as a quick follow-up, as relates to the guide, I appreciate that the recurring CapEx investment will impact AFFO, and I think you may have said you expect, I think, AFFO to be down quarter-over-quarter. Did you also say that because of that, it's going to impact FFO? And if so, what line item does that ultimately show up and to drive that since that's -- I think that excludes recurring CapEx. Jeffrey Finnin : Yes. No, Colby, the recurring CapEx that we expect to invest in the fourth quarter specifically related to that chiller plant is about, we said, $8 million to $10 million in the fourth quarter. And so that will only impact AFFO. That does not impact our -- I'm sorry, does not impact our FFO, just AFFO. Colby Synesael : Great. So AFFO down quarter-over-quarter but not necessarily the case with FFO? Jeffrey Finnin : That's correct. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ahmed Badri : Regarding the updated disclosed number of interconnections, the 25,000-plus in the supplemental disclosures, could you give us some color on the driving force behind the new cross-connects? And how come things like Megaport, PacketFabric and other software defined network companies are helping drive interconnection revenue for your company? Steven Smith : Yes, sure. As I mentioned earlier, the primary driver that we see, so far anyway and has been on the trail, has been related to those enterprises that are connecting the cloud as well as network to network. So a lot of enterprises that are connected to both networks and to cloud customers. We do have several SDN providers that are built out within our buildings. One of those is PacketFabric, another is Megaport, as you mentioned. And they are driving some of that interconnection as well. But so far, not a material amount. Jeffrey Finnin : And Sami, the only other commentary I would add, and we mentioned this on the last call, and it's fairly consistent again this quarter, Steve touched on this earlier in regards to the interconnections being driven by our cloud providers. That growth rate of those companies connected to cloud providers is probably 2 to 3 times higher than what we're seeing in the fiber cross connect volume, just from a volume perspective, just to give you some perspective on what we're seeing inside the vertical mix. Ahmed Badri : Got it, got it. And then on the 24 new logos added in the quarter, are these customers coming to collocation as a solution for the first time? Or are they -- do they already have collocation solutions deployed and we're just looking to expand with CoreSite? Steven Smith : It's really a mix of that. It is difficult, which is one of the great things about our model, to pull somebody out of an existing collocation provider. So winning those new logos especially as they transition to an outsourced model is a great opportunity for us, which seems to be the primary driver for those new logos but there is some that we win from other providers as well. But I would say, without having the exact numbers in front of me, the majority of those new logos are moving from an existing space that they may already operate to outsourcing to a collo provider for the first time. Ahmed Badri : Got it. And then I just have one more question regarding the Miami market. Can we just get an update on what's going on in specifically that part of the U.S.? And have Phoenix, Dallas or Oregon come up with opportunities that you guys are evaluating? Or you're just sticking to the same campus model that was already in place? Paul Szurek : The answer to your second question, we continue to look at other markets where we can deploy a campus model, but we're not looking to enter the race for undifferentiated collo in any other market. But we do continue to look for new market opportunities. Steven Smith : Yes. With respect to Miami, I do think that provides us an opportunity there. As we've mentioned in prior calls, we had some space that came back to us that gives us the opportunity to lease up again. And with some of the changes in the competitive landscape there, I think it actually gives us a greater opportunity to lease up there as well as access to Latin America and so forth. So we continue to drive more focus there. We're also looking to make some slight improvements to the site there that I think will make it more appealing for customers, so it is a focus for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : You were mentioning when you were discussing the Virginia Ashburn market just that there was some deployment and pricing may have gotten a little more competitive there. I was curious if you can just unpack you comment a bit more as to what you're seeing specifically in the competitive environment in that market. And are you starting to see any signals of incremental competition in some of the other major markets in which you operate? Paul Szurek : As I said in my remarks, we don't see any serious degradation in pricing. But it has been moderately impacted by the competition, the new development that's out there, I think, probably in the range of 5% to 10%. Although that's hard to estimate because products and solutions differ significantly. Having said that, it -- in line with right now the way Steve describe that we underwrite our new investments and our preleased economics. So we feel good about that. And a lot of the -- being the only network node in Reston, which provides diversity to the Ashburn route and Ashburn network node, we don't see quite as much of that. And so probably can't provide as much color as to what's going on in Ashburn and Manassas as some of the other companies can. Steven Smith : Yes. And Michael, this is Steve. I would just kind of reiterate that point that Virginia has always been very competitive. There's always been a lot of competitors in that market as well as inventory that comes online. The absorption still seems to be holding strong there. But as Paul mentioned, I do think we have a good story to tell there, being a strong interconnection story that's not in Ashburn but still within that net market that provides low latency, scalability but an alternative to Ashburn being in Reston. So we do see even some of the bigger cloud providers that have deployed in the Ashburn market that are looking for an alternative to provide redundancy and other on-ramps, and that's been a good story so far for us. Michael Rollins : And one other question. If you total up the development that's in your pipeline right now and measure that historically, how would the size of this development pipeline compare? And are there opportunities to get more aggressive and accelerate the pace of build over the next 12 to 18 months? Paul Szurek : I believe that we are significantly above average in total dollars in our development pipeline. But as a percentage of our total assets, probably similar or maybe even... Jeffrey Finnin : Slightly ahead than where we've been. Paul Szurek : Yes. But in terms of accelerating it, we've always been glad to accelerate when the market allowed that, and there is some possibility for that in all of these developments, but it's hard to predict the certainty at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Yong Choe : Following up on that, how should we think about the timing of the SV8 and L.A. developments along with Reston in terms of next year and the year after? Paul Szurek : So one of the difficulties in predicting precise timing relates to the advantages of developing in these markets. They're not easy to develop in, which creates natural barriers to entry. The regulatory scheme is part of that and it sometimes -- or always difficult to predict exactly when you will receive permits. In my comments, I gave you, and in our other materials, we've given you guidance as to when we think these projects will commence. Typically, once they are commenced and in our current construction model, it will take 9 to 12 months to completion and the commencement of revenue generation. And that's the best we can do in terms of predicting timing right now. Yong Choe : Great. And I guess to follow up on the pricing question earlier. It seems like there was a little bit more available space because of churn from competitors in L.A. and it seemed like you kind of held the line on price. Can you give us an idea of how the company thinks about what drives wanting to drive a higher deal versus a lower one versus, I guess, the space you have? Just kind of getting an update on that would be great. Paul Szurek : Typically, especially in markets where we -- are space constrained until new developments come up, we adhere to a very good discipline on pricing and also a customer discipline. So we target that space to those customers that we perceive as being healthier, long run for the ecosystem, stickier, more likely to grow, generate more cross connects and attract other customers to the ecosystem. Steven Smith : And the only other thing I would add is as we look at the overall absorption rate as well as the competitive dynamics in the market, just trying to align those things to obviously maximize return but also look at, as Paul mentioned, the overall value to the ecosystem, both in terms of rent and power margin but also interconnection and the overall attractiveness that they might bring to other entities that we would want to sell to. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Just wanted to unpack a little bit of the pricing commentary in this market. What do you think is sort of behind to the competitor pricing? Is it irrational behavior in your view? Or is it maybe just the benefit of some lower cost construction? Or how should we -- how do you view that in this market? Paul Szurek : I don't think it's irrational behavior so much. I think that people perceive these as good markets with good, long-term supply and demand characteristics. Demand is still growing right now. But there is a lot that's been started recently, maybe a slightly greater supply than demand growth relative to historical. And so -- and there are more participants doing that in some of these markets, and so that usually leads to more competitive pricing. Steven Smith : Just to give you a little bit more color there as well. I think it really depends on the market as to whether there's additional inventory that's being built there or in some cases, there's been some customer churn from some of our competitors that drives them to be more aggressive and try and back fill that space. So overall, to Paul's point, I think it's been very balanced. I don't see anything irrational in the market at this point. It just -- we just want to make sure that we stay to our strategy. We're disciplined about it and so far, that seems to be holding. Operator : Mr. Szurek, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. Paul Szurek : Thank you. Thanks to everybody on the call for their interest in the company and for the opportunity to answer your questions. I just like to close by thanking my colleagues throughout the company for their excellent efforts, another good quarter. And we very much look forward to the future. We love our business model. We love our team. Our customer communities are understanding and growing in the right way. And the future for us looks very promising. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Greer Aviv, Investor Relations and Corporate Communication for CoreSite. Thank you, Mr. Aviv. You may begin. Greer Aviv : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I'm joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Federal Securities Laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our website at coresite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter results. I will highlight our 2017 accomplishments, update you on our new developments and briefly comment on our markets. We finished out the year with solid fourth quarter financial results, highlighted by year-over-year revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO growth, of 14%, 13%, and 11% respectively, excluding the one-time preferred stock redemption charge. Organic growth was driven primarily by the continued expansion of existing customers and also by new logo growth. We continue to operate our facilities as carrier, cloud and manage services neutral facilities, which attract valuable deployments which drive commerce and interactions among our customers. We executed well on our strategic priorities in 2017 with full year organic revenue growth 20% and FFO growth of 22%. We took important steps to grow our differentiated scalable and flexible multi-tenant campus in key markets, including Santa Clara, Northern Virginia, Los Angeles, and most recently, Chicago. 2018 will be a relaunch year for CoreSite with the newest version of our enterprise class multi-tenant building coming online or commenced construction in several of our strongest and the most dynamic markets. These buildings together with computer room build outs in our other markets support the foundation for another extended phase of attractive organic growth over the next few years. Turning to sales performance; we signed $7.2 million in annualized GAAP rent in the fourth quarter. Retail signings were very strong reflecting the value of our ecosystem for applications, needed capacity and larger edge facilities that support latency sensitive, data intensive and hybrid cloud deployments. The amount in quality of new logos was also excellent with Steve comment on in more detail. We expect the rebound and retail leasing combined with a continuing strong funnel for larger deployments to support healthy pricing and the construction of additional leasable capacity. Supply and demand seems to be in an expectable balance in substantially all of our markets. We are keeping an eye on the amount of the development and potential development in Northern Virginia, particularly in Ashburn, but demand is also very strong in this market. As I mentioned earlier, campus expansion in four excellent markets is a great opportunity for us in 2018 and beyond. Despite record levels of absorption in 2016, 440,000 square feet followed by another strong year of commencements in 2017, we forecast demand for new product to continue at attractive levels for the foreseeable future. During 2017, we worked effectively to replenish our campus pipeline with new land in Santa Clara, Virginia and Chicago and the creation of an expansion opportunity on our LA2 side. We expect these projects to restore us to our historical model of having the ability to quickly bring new capacity to market in line with demand. As important, the leasing of this new capacity should deepen our campus ecosystems and increase their network effects and corresponding value. We are pleased to have acquired in downtown Chicago a two acre land parcel in late January. CH2 is one mile from our existing CH1 facility and network node and we plan to connect the two sites via diverse, high-count dark fiber to create the type of campus interconnectivity most valued by our scale customers. We expect to be able to build approximately 175,000 square feet, or 18 megawatts of turnkey capacity on this land. Along with restoring our development opportunities to more typical levels across the portfolio, we have taken steps to strengthen our development and construction team over the past year. We added some valuable new colleagues with extensive data center construction experience, made some productive internal transfers and have approved our design and contracting processes. We entered 2018 with 220,000 square feet of turnkey capacity under construction and we expect to break ground on SV8 and LA3 an additional 355,000 square feet of multi-tenant shell with a combined 12 megawatt of initial computer rooms at various stages in the year. And if the permitting process goes well, we may even be able to begin CH2 late in 2018. Our team is focused on ensuring our offering is providing desirable new technology and energy efficiency options for our customers as well as accommodating higher density deployments. As an example, in Q4, we took steps to improve energy efficiency by consolidating our cooling systems at LA2 into one massively efficient chiller plant for which we have been nominated for an energy efficiency award by the local power company. We also entered into a long-term power purchase agreement leveraging fuel cell technology in two of our markets, which significantly reduces related carbon emissions for that amount of power. Our expansion in Reston is progressing and we anticipate delivering 25,000 square feet of turnkey capacity at VA3 Phase IA around the end of the first quarter. We are making good progress on the overall site development for that campus designed to preserve our ability to increase buildable capacity in the future and on the ground-up construction at VA3 Phase 1B and expect to deliver that building in the fourth quarter of 2018. In Los Angeles, we are on track to deliver 87,000 square feet of multi-tenant data center capacity this quarter with the pre-leased space commencing in Q1 as well. Entitlement, permitting and design work for LA3 is ongoing and we expect to commence construction in the later half of 2018. As it relates to the Bay Area, we are targeting a mid-2018 construction start on SV8. In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we are making with our development program. In addition to adding another good campus expansion site in downtown Chicago, we've added expertise and experience to our staff and it laid the groundwork for developing high redundancy at lower cost, providing the flexibility to accommodate high density deployments, significantly increasing power efficiency and lowering ongoing maintenance and operating costs. I look forward to seeing this work bear fruit as we bring these developments online over the next couple of years. With that I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith : Thanks, Paul. Our new and expansion sales activity was solid reflecting a resurgence that we\u2019ve seen among the smaller deployments, which can be seen an increased transaction count, helping new logo growth and the pricing we achieved on signed leases. We signed a 128 new and expansion leases, totaling $7.2 million in annualized GAAP rent comprised of 42,000 net rentable square feet and average GAAP rate of $174 per square foot. Leasing results also reflected solid new logo activity across our platform with 30 new logos signed across substantially all of our markets and 117 signed during 2017. Enterprise customers continue to account for the majority of new logos as they look to optimize their IT architecture and leverage the key network and cloud providers across our platform. By deploying in our network DIPs and cloud connected facilities, they can reap the benefits of a strongly connected and synergistic ecosystem as well as extended geographic reach and that of their end customers globally. To that point Alibaba cloud joined our ecosystem, enabling international customers to expand their cloud based applications world-wide in an efficient and cost effective manner. Additional examples of new logos that were attracted to our ecosystem include one of the largest global post-production companies and a large television production organization expanding its content distribution capabilities. A key part of our organic growth strategies is a continued expansion of existing customers, which accounted for approximately 88% of annualized GAAP rent signed in Q4. We have seen that our differentiated campus strategy and strong market position leave us well aligned to meet our customers\u2019 increasing demand for compute and storage needs and close proximity to their other deployments as well as to enable them to scale and grow into additional CoreSite markets. A great example is a key enterprise customer that has continued to expand its footprint on our Santa Clara campus and just deployed at our Reston campus with a new application supporting research and development for self-driving technologies and mapping. The strength and leasing to smaller deployments combing with the organic expansion opportunities of our embedded base resulted in interconnection revenue growth of 16% year-over-year driven by total volume growth of 11% and fiber volume growth of 15%. For the full year, the interconnection revenue grew 17%, slightly ahead of the high-end of our expected range. Turning now to vertical mix, network and cloud customers accounted for 41% and 19% respectively of annualized GAAP rent signed. It was a great quarter for the network vertical with the highest level of new and expansion leases signed this year, driven by strong growth of existing customers and by six new logos. A large Chinese telecom expanding with us in the Bay Area and a leading global telecommunications provider deployed its \u2013 their latest SDN solution in four markets, providing additional connectivity options for enterprise customers. We also saw a solid expansion activity among network providers at our Denver campus further solidifying our leading interconnection position in this market. Turning to the cloud vertical, it was an exciting quarter with strong growth from existing customers and the addition of three new logos including a private cloud service provider. A large network solution and the cloud hosting provider expanded its footprint across the number of markets while one of our existing large public cloud partners expanded its reach and deploy natively in Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia. This expansion brings the total number of native on-ramps for this provider to four across our portfolio. Additionally, another leading public cloud company deployed a new on-ramp in Los Angeles. The cloud vertical continues to experience outpaced growth in terms of other customers interconnecting reinforcing the value of our highly interconnected platform. As it relates to our enterprise vertical, this vertical accounted for 40% of annualized GAAP rents signed. New logos also accounted for approximately 40% of the leases signed as enterprise customers continue to focus on robust connectivity solutions, diversity of providers and the performance and scalability needed to optimize their deployments. Additionally, a large global technology company expanded its gaming platform deploying in two new markets and a provider of digital services and content distribution expanded its footprint to support its rendering capabilities with both applications requiring a highly dense colocation solution. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases for Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Northern Virginia and New York, New Jersey; collectively representing 87% of annualized GAAP rent signed. Strength in Bay Area leasing was again led by growth from existing customers with the cloud vertical demonstrating a strongest performance followed by enterprise customers and network providers. Demand in Los Angeles remains steady with strength in the network vertical followed by enterprise and cloud deployment. Notably, network and cloud traction continues to gain momentum at LA2 as we signed a same number of network deals at LA2 this quarter as we did at LA1. Turning to Northern Virginia, leasing activity was lead by the enterprise vertical. Hybrid use cases leveraging multiple clouds are becoming more common among customer requirements and we remain well positioned in the market with strong relationships with leading public and private cloud providers, which should continue to drive incremental interconnection opportunities at the Reston campus. Finally, in New York, New Jersey demand is steady and slowly increasing specifically among financial and healthcare sectors, which is reflected in our solid enterprise leasing results. We continue to see cloud and network providers expanded in LA2 while large local enterprises continue to move towards leveraging hybrid cloud use cases. In summary, the fourth quarter results marked the end of another solid year for CoreSite with consistent execution, growth across our markets and ecosystems and continued investment as we set the stage for future growth. I will now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. My remarks today will begin with a review of our Q4 financial results followed by an update of our development CapEx and our leverage and liquidity capacity. Finally, I will discuss our outlook and guidance for 2018. Q4 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of $125.9 million, a 2.3% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 14% increase year-over-year. Operating revenue consisted of $104.9 million in data center revenue comprised of rent and power, an increase of 3.1% on a sequential quarter basis and 14.2% year-over-year. Interconnection services contributed $16.3 million to operating revenues, an increase of 0.3% on a sequential quarter basis and 16.2% year-over-year. FFO was $1.09 per diluted share in unit, down 0.9% on a sequential quarter basis and an increase of 2.8% year-over-year. FFO includes approximately $4.3 million of non-cash expense related to the original issuance cost of our redeemed preferred stock, which was previously not reflected in our guidance. Excluding this one-time amount, FFO as adjusted was $1.18 per share, or an increase of 7.3% and 11.3% sequentially and year-over-year respectively. For the full year excluding this expense, FFO was $4.52 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 21.8%. As it relates to the recurring capital, we spent $8.6 million in Q4 to substantially complete the chiller plant replacement at LA2, which resulted in a sequential decline in AFFO of 10% consistent with our expectations. Adjusting for this investment, AFFO would have been $52 million, or an increase of 8% and 29% sequentially and year-over-year respectively. For the full year, we invested $11.9 million on the chiller project. 2017 AFFO adjusted for this investment grew 25% year-over-year. Turning back to Q4 results, adjusted EBITDA of $68.8 million increased 5.4% sequentially and 13.4% over the same quarter of last year. We continue to drive margin expansion with our adjusted EBITDA margin increasing 160 basis points to 54.6% for the full year, slightly ahead of our expectations. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $4.6 million, or 3.7% of total operating revenues. For the full year, sales and marketing expenses were 3.8% down 60% basis points from the prior year. General and administrative expenses were $10.2 million, or 8.1% of total operating revenues. For the full year, G&A expense was 7.8% of total operating revenues, down 100 basis points year-over-year though slightly above our guidance. Q4 same-store turnkey data center occupancy increased 100 basis points to 91.8% compared to Q4 2016. Additionally, same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 5.3% year-over-year and was flat sequentially at $1,508. As you look at your models, keep in mind that we will redefine the same-store pool in Q1 as we do on an annual basis. We renewed approximately 79,000 total square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $142 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark to market growth of 3.5% on a cash basis and 6.2% on a GAAP basis. Churn in the fourth quarter was low coming in at 0.5%. We commenced 52,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $157 per square foot, which represents $8.2 million of annualized GAAP rent. We ended the quarter with our stabilized data center occupancy at 94.4%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the prior quarter. In Boston, a 14,000 square foot computer room was moved into the stabilized pool at 90% occupancy and 25,000 square feet at VA2 moved into the stabilized pool at 87% occupancy. We completed in additional 13,700 square feet of data center capacity at Boston and 3,000 at VA1, both of which were placed into the prestabilized pool. Turning to backlog, projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $13.2 million as of December 31, 2017. On a cash basis, our backlog was $21.7 million. We expect substantially all of the GAAP backlogs to commence during the first half of 2018. As Paul mentioned, we have a total of 220,000 square feet of data center capacity in various stages of development across the portfolio. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had invested $98.5 million of the estimated $213.6 million required to complete these projects. Keep in mind that the capacity currently under construction and the associated investment does not include forecasted investment for projects currently in permitting entitlement or design including SV8, LA3 and CH2. The percentage of interest capitalized in Q4 was 13.7% and the full year amount is 12%. For 2018, we expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 12% to 18% slightly elevated compared to the 2017 level based on our development pipeline. Turning to our balance sheet. Our ratio of net principal debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 3.4 times. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had $180.9 million of total equality consisting of available cash in capacity on our revolving credit facility. On December 12, 2017, we completed the redemption of all 4.6 million shares of our 7.25% Series A cumulative redeemed preferred stock, which was financed through the use of our credit facility. We expect to add incremental debt financing, the majority of which is expected to be completed during the first half of 2018 to fund our development pipeline. The related timing, pricing and type of debt instrument are dependant on market conditions and we expect a total issuance amount of $225 million to $300 million while maintaining a healthy balance between our fixed and variable price debt. During the fourth quarter, we announced an increase in our dividend to $0.98 per share on a quarterly basis, or $3.92 per share on an annual basis. This correlates to an 8.9% increase over the prior quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share that was established in May 2017 and a quarterly per share increase of $0.18 or 22.5% over the dividend rate set in December 2016. You should continue to expect the timing and amount of our future dividend increases to be closely aligned to financial performance and cash flow generation. Now, I would like to address guidance for 2018. Please remember that our guidance reflects our view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. As detailed on Page 23 of our Q4 earnings supplemental, our guidance for 2018 is as follows. Total operating revenue is estimated to be $535 million to $545 million. Based on the mid-point of guidance, this implies 12.1% year-over-year revenue growth, the estimated growth reflects the timing of our development pipeline as well as a reduced level of available sellable capacity as we enter 2018. For context, we enter 2018 with approximately 19% of our operating portfolio available that is either currently available or under construction compared to a historical average of 29% following a period of elevated absorption. We currently expect commencements of approximately $40 million in annualized GAAP rent in 2018 compared to $33 million in 2017, or an increase of 22%. We expect that 2018 interconnection revenue growth to be between 11% and 14% correlating to interconnection revenue in the range of $69 million to $71 million. General and administrative expenses are estimated to be $38 million to $40 million, or approximately 7% of total operating revenue. This correlates to a 4% increase in G&A expenses over 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $291 million to $296 million. This correlates to 11.5% year-over-year growth based on the mid-point of the range and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 54.4% and revenue flow through to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 52%. Our expectation for adjusted EBITDA margin is consistent with the 2017 level and reflects recent investments in our facilities and construction teams given the strong growth in absorption over the last two years. FFO per share in OP unit is estimated to be $4.92 to $5.04. This implies 10% year-over-year FFO growth based on the mid-point of the range and the $4.52 per share we reported in 2017 excluding the impact of the one-time non-cash expense related to the preferred redemption. As a reminder, the FFO per share guidance includes the debt financing that was mentioned earlier. As we discussed last quarter, our guidance of FFO per share reflects the adoption of two new accounting standards : revenue recognition and lease accounting, which are cumulatively expected to reduce FFO per share by approximately $0.06 inclusive of the impact from accelerated straight line rent expense. Absent these changes, our 2018 guidance mid-point would reflect 11.5% year-over-year growth. The significant drivers of this guidance are as follows, estimated annual churn rate of 6% to 8% for 2018. Cash rent growth on our data center renewals is estimated to be 3% to 5% for the full year. As we communicated last quarter, total capital expenditures are expected to be $250 million to $300 million. The components are comprised of data center expansion cost estimated to be $228 million to $263 million, non-recurring investments are estimated to be $7.5 million to $12.5 million and include amounts related to investments in our IT architecture, facilities upgrades and our capital expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures are estimated to be $12.5 million to $17.5 million down significantly from 2017 reflecting the completion of the chiller replacement and upgrade project at LA2 and tenant improvements are estimated to be $2 million to $7 million. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Dave Rodgers : Hey, guys. I wanted to start with some of the leasing details from the quarter. It looked like both leasing spreads as well as kind of the overall absolute level of pricing in the quarter both commencements and leasing trended lower. How much of that was the function of pressure in the market versus geographic mix versus density? Can you kind of break those thoughts out for us? Steve Smith : Yeah, sure. This is Steve. Thanks for the question. I would say overall it's just primarily a function of timing as to overall volume. So as far as the overall leasing activity is concerned, as I mentioned in my predetermined comments there, the overall volume is very strong and we were very encouraged with the total number of leases as well as the content of those leases, the network vertical obviously was very strong, a little bit lighter on the wholesale end of the things and that\u2019s primarily driven from timing and just availability of overall capacity, but the underlying current demand in the market is very strong. Jeff Finnin : Hey, Dave. This is Jeff. And let me just give you some additional commentary as it relates to \u2013 I think he also commented on commencements and renewals. If you look at it on a per square foot perspective, from a pricing perspective, that that is going to vary depending upon our density and the type of deployments that are being renewed and ultimately commencing. So, for example, when you look at the renewals, the composition of those renewals this quarter were \u2013 had a very low density. And as a result, you're seeing a price perspective being lower. When you take away and neutralize the density impact, you actually get to the point where that pricing for renewals, this quarter was flat to slightly ahead of where we were on the trailing twelve months. So hopefully that gives you some additional commentary around that. Paul Szurek : And Dave let me just follow up addressing both sales and maybe interconnection volumes as well. Historically, these have always varied quarter by quarter and we don't expect that to change. This is probably, as Steve mentioned, due to the timing of bringing on new capacity, but it's also attributable to the increase in scale leasing we began to experience in 2015 as edge needs in our markets rose to new levels. These deployments are lumpier and the sales cycles are longer. So while the pipeline for this type of demand is very robust, as Steve mentioned, the timing of concluding any particular sale is difficult to predict. And we do our pricing in this way by trying to jam these types of sales into any particular quarter. We see the same type of lumpiness in interconnection growth, which frequently follows to some extent scale deployments and enterprise additions, but not on a linear path. These are the reasons combined with the lumpiness of delivering new capacity that we've incurred to observers to focus more on annual trends as opposed to quarterly results. Steve Smith : And Dave just to kind of round that out with a bit more color there, if you look at the overall lease count, 127 of the 128 leases that were signed in the quarter were less than 5,000 square feet. And if you look at the revenue from leases that are less than 5,000 square feet, we're actually up 5% over the trailing 12-month average, so overall health in the pipeline as well as the results, we feel very positive. Dave Rodgers : Great, appreciate all the color from everybody, Paul maybe turning to you in terms of the volume. It sounded like based on your comments, you\u2019re pretty happy with the pipeline and the projects that you have in it, but it did sound like that you are maybe frustrated with the fact that you didn't have product to deliver to meet the outside demand that you continue to see in the industry. Are there one or two big things that you've kind of been addressing over the last whether six months a year or you plan to address that really kind of cause this maybe mistiming between development delivery and demand in the market? Paul Szurek : Well, I wouldn't say frustrated. It's almost all related to VA3 and as we've \u2013 in fact as far as I can tell it's all related to VA3. As we stated previously, we have a reasonable but ambitious plan to maximize the amount that we can build on that site that requires converting the low density office and light industrial development into a denser development with more interconnected buildings. Accomplishing this goal, requires a significant amount of moving underground utility infrastructure and creating new infrastructure. These are the tasks that have taken longer than expected partly due to unforeseen conditions like utilities that were not located on the survey more underground rock than the geotech studies indicated although to some extent rock is very seamy and that's not completely unexpected and frankly to some extent contractor performance. The good news is that these elements are almost entirely behind us. We have one more power line to move, so we can finish our new main entrance. And the better news is that the new colleagues we've added working with the team that has continued have really performed well to limit the delays caused by these elements. So I'd honestly say rather than frustrated, I'm just really excited about where we are right now and where we can take this forward. Dave Rodgers : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rollins : Hi. Good morning for you guys. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. First, you made a comment about the timing of dividends referring to it as following, I think, you mentioned the cash flow. Is that a change in the timing that we had last year where you had two division increases? So is this something that's just going to be on an ad hoc basis each quarter? Or should we expect the same kind of cadence for the company to revisit the dividend? You know I have an operational question if I could afterwards. Paul Szurek : Yeah, good morning, Mike. Yeah, I think, I wouldn't read too much into that in terms of a change. I think what we're trying to communicate is we do look at our level of growth in cash flow on a quarterly basis and obviously look at the dividend on a quarterly basis. But what we're trying to communicate is which is probably similar to what you saw last year which is to the extent you do see us or that we do see cash flow growing incrementally that we want to make sure we're more timely in paying that out to our shareholders. Last year, we did it on an every six month basis. And from our perspective I think that fits well into the way we anticipate to do things going forward, but it is something we look at on a quarterly basis. Michael Rollins : And the second things on the operational side, you mentioned the difference now versus in prior period in terms of the percentage of footprint of total that was available to sell whether it was in development or kind of ready to serve up. When you look at the development pipeline that you have for this year, does it get you back towards that historical percentage I think you mentioned it was 29%? Or is there more development that you would need to bring forward to get to that kind of available capacity level? Paul Szurek : Good question, Michel. I think with what we have in process we will actually be better and more consistent than historical norms, but we are going through a little bit of a valley. In fiscal year \u2013 in 2015, we added 15.3% to our leasable capacity through construction and development. That ballooned to 32.2% in 2016. In 2017, it was only 3.7% based on what we have in process today in LA and VA3 and other places. We'll add 10.5% this year and that's included in our 19% number. But that will be able to accelerate in future years up into the high teens to low 20% range as we build out the four projects that we've talked about. And quite honestly if demand continues as strong as it has been and we see as many or more demand drivers going forward as we've seen historically, we have the capacity to accelerate some of that development if we need to do. Michael Rollins : Thanks very much. Paul Szurek : Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions. Jordan Sadler : Hi, good morning. So I wanted to just come back to one of your answers in the Q&A here. I think you described leasing now a little bit more as lumpier and longer. And I guess it's a little bit new to me as it relates to CoreSite. I kind of think of you guys just being a little bit steadier and I recognize that you bring a bunch of product on. But can you maybe just give us a little bit of context for what you meant by that? Is that germane to Reston and that project? Or would you expect potentially to see larger, lumpier or longer sales cycle leases in some of these other more traditional markets as well like Chicago or Silicon Valley or LA? Paul Szurek : Jordan, it's a good question. And I think if you went back to these sessions over the last four or five quarters, you probably heard us mention on at least every quarterly call the lumpiness that has been introduced by these scale leases. And in fact I think if memory serves me correctly, Jeff our sales this quarter in terms of GAAP rent are pretty comparable to our sales in the fourth quarter of last year. And then we\u2019ve obviously had some accelerated quarters in between. So I'm sorry if we weren\u2019t more clear about that in the past, but that that is something that we've tried to make sure everybody was aware of. But you are correct the introduction of new capacity and the timing of bringing new capacity on adds an additional element of lumpiness, which we are expecting and hoping to reduce going forward with a more robust and proactive development platform as you see in the announcements that we've made over the last couple of quarters. Jeff? Jeff Finnin : And Jordan, the only other thing I'd complement with that is in order to give you some visibility into that lumpiness. As you\u2019ve probably seen and heard us in the past, we break up our sales in those two buckets : one that's less than 5,000, one is greater than 5,000, inside that supplemental if you haven\u2019t had a chance to look. It does give you some better insight. But as Steve was alluding to that less than 5,000 has been fairly steady and is actually up slightly as compared to the trailing 12 months. The lumpiness as Paul alluded to really does come from those larger than 5,000 square foot leases. And that's where you're seeing some of the \u2013 of what we\u2019re alluding to. Jordan Sadler : Okay. But so you would expect to see \u2013 it would be safe to assume that you\u2019d expect to see scale type leasing in markets outside of Northern Virginia for example over the next year. Steve Smith : Yeah, Jordan, this is Steve. I tell you that the pipeline overall looks very robust and the activity there looks very strong. It's a matter of timing when the customer requirements line up with available capacity and we work very hard to stay on top of that so far the overall pipeline looks healthy. Jordan Sadler : And Steve, while I have you, just sequentially this is about as flat as I've seen the interconnection revenue. I know that this business just as a function of the growing base and some of the other factors as you guys talked about regularly. The growth is moderating a bit, but was there anything going on in the fourth quarter at all that we should be looking at? Steve Smith : No, I think if you look at the underlying current there, the trend is still very healthy. We could have one customer that churned out of LA1 in Q4 that had pretty significant amount of interconnection and we have another customer that consolidated some of their deployments. So that drove part of the pressure there, but overall the trend for interconnection is still very healthy. There are some technology trends that are also out there relative to \u2013 customers able to get 100 gig out of a single interconnection versus 10 gig, but you still need a connection to a provider to get there. So you may see some efficiency come out of that as well as some of the capabilities from some of the big network providers as far as SDN capabilities, but overall we still see a very strong trajectory as far as health in interconnection. Jordan Sadler : Is that crapping \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Paul Szurek : I just would add to what Steve said. The ability to increase the amount you can move over those interconnections is one of the attractions to being able to interconnect within the data center. And you know while it may reduce the total cross-connects, it also increases the value of the space and the deployments in those data centers. Jordan Sadler : All right I think we\u2019ve talked about the same as it relates to SDNs. Are the SDNs crapping up a little bit more in terms of discussions with customers that using \u2013 are they using them to a greater extent a little bit more comfortable these days? Paul Szurek : Well, I think they're beginning to embrace it more as you talk to some of the carriers that are also partners of ours and our data centers that they seem to see a greater level of adoption. And I think that's actually helping us more as customers look to be closer to those interconnection points and leverage their hybrid architecture. So I think the starting number is that more. Jordan Sadler : Okay, thank you. Paul Szurek : Thanks, Jordan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. A couple of questions. Wondered about CH2, what was the thought process? Did it come from customers or just kind of your own preferences in terms of going downtown versus perhaps suburbs where you could have had maybe more of a campus environment? And then secondly, you mentioned chiller plant and it just kind of made me think about just the technical design above what you're delivering on your maybe current and prospective builds, power densities, are they going higher 2N versus N plus one if you could just sort of comment on the product that you're aiming for and where you see the sweet spot of the market? Thanks. Paul Szurek : I'll try to remember all those elements, Jonathan, but feel free to remind me if I leave something out. First of all both from a customer and product perspective, we were very heavily focused on downtown Chicago. And if you look at you know the president for our campus development, LA1 and LA2 are a great example of the tremendous synergies you can achieve by providing this enterprise class scalable you know more flexible for higher density product, more power efficient, new building or new \u2013 new space that that has this type of dark fiber connectivity back to your main network node. It really expands the use cases and the edge cases that can take place in the urban core where there is a much more enterprise rich target environment. And it's essentially our model. We use it at VA2 and 1 and 3. We use it at \u2013 in Santa Clara. And so, we were very, very focused on finding this type of opportunity in downtown Chicago and we're glad to do that. I would also add that as we've had ongoing conversations with customers about their needs and what they need and where they need it, this is exactly the type of product in Chicago that has received a lot of encouragement from that \u2013 on which we've received a lot of encouragement from our customers. Regarding the product overall and I've touched on this a little bit earlier in the answer. Brian Warren, our Senior Vice President of Construction and Engineering and his team, which I have a very high regard for, have really evolved our product over the last couple of years. It gets better with each iterations but figuring out how to achieve the appropriate levels of redundancy with more design efficiency and lower cost, how to improve our contracting processes to deliver better results and lower cost and how to design and setup the data center to where we have more flexibility within the same building to accommodate both high density and low density deployments and to get the best possible PUE outcome from the equipment we're deploying and to set it up and commissioned it and turn it over in such a way that we have significantly better operations results although we've always had outstanding operations result, but at a lower cost on an ongoing basis. So I'm really pleased with what he and his team have done in that regard and I think we're still in the fairly early innings of ongoing product evolution. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. And then just on kind of it just maybe relates to cross-connects and the Alibaba announcements that you had on both coasts and then I think bringing AWS Direct Connect into Denver. Can you talk about pull through of these cloud nodes? And does it drive \u2013 does it drive cabinet ads? Does it drive cross-connects? Or is it really depends on the particular situation? What trends have you seen over time? Steve Smith : Yeah, Jonathan, this is Steve. I would say it\u2019s all of the above. They do provide unique value not only in their own drive as far as interconnection and passing traffic to other providers, but also for those enterprises that are looking to gain close and immediate on-ramps to those facilities. So we feel like those are another key differentiator that are attractive to our sites because of our network density as well as our go to market model around the enterprise because enterprises are obviously attractive to those same sites because we have the network in those on-ramps. So it\u2019s really a synergistic type of environment that I think helps all three of those. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. Paul Szurek : Thanks, Jon. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman from Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question. Robert Gutman : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering against a backdrop of \u2013 well let's say in 2017, you\u2019ve finalized the year with $33 million dollars of commencements and came into the year with $5 million of backlog, so that was $28 million additional. And that was also in the context of 33,000 square feet I think of additional space added. And for 2018, you're going to $40 million in commencement of which there is $13 million in backlog which really implies the same amount of additional commencements through the year roughly $27 million, $28 million, but you\u2019ve got 220,000 square feet of space to be delivered. So how do we reconcile those two ideas and sort of what it means for the pace of leasing? Is there just an element of conservatism there or what is there to read into that? Paul Szurek : Hey, Rob, let me provide some commentary and then if Steve has some additional things to add he can do. So I think you're looking at it absolutely correct in that. When you look at the amount of commencements that need to be generated and ultimately signed from new sales activity in 2018 as compared to 2017, they're at equal and in par with each other going into 2018. The one thing that's different is when you look at the amount of commencements that we're projecting that ultimately need to be embedded into and filled with capacity that's under construction. As we head into 2018 that's about 50% of the estimated commencements have to come from new construction and that's higher than where it\u2019s typically been. And so that's where they're just provides some element of risk around and it's all tied to completion of the construction cycle, but that's what we're forecasting at this point in time. Steve Smith : Should add to that though that much of that new construction is the LA construction, which is \u2013 some of it's already complete and occupy, some of it is \u2013 will be completed this quarter. And the balance of it primarily is in multiple sides including VA3 and VA3 is the only new construction in that context. But in VA3, we only have about 25,000 square feet that we will have available early enough in the year to have commencements during the year. Most of the rest of \u2013 the rest of the new capacity coming online in VA3 is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter and that makes it more challenging to forecast any commencements for that capacity that would start in 2018 as opposed to 2019. Robert Gutman : Got it, thanks. And one additional question if I may. In the past several quarters, you reported some high price per square foot due to higher power density. And I was wondering if given some of the high power density quarters that you've reported does that imply going forward that metered power or the power pass through part of revenue could be a higher percentage than it's been in the past? Paul Szurek : Yeah, Rob, let me just give you some color as you're probably aware. If you look \u2013 if you go back maybe two or three years, our mix between our power products as we refer to them as call it breakered to metered going back two or three years it's been about 60 :40 breakered to metered. When if you look at 2017, we ended the year and it moved that down to 55 :45 right in line with what our expectations were and so we would expect that to be honest I think to be fairly consistent as we move forward here over 2018. I don't think that we'll see a significant movement on a go forward, but that gives you some relative idea where it is at the end of 2017 compared to where it was a couple years ago. Robert Gutman : Great, that helps. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Sami Badri : Thank you for the question. My question is a follow up on the Alibaba cloud announcement. And I just want to get an idea will Alibaba cloud or have their discussions if you already followed a little bit what some of the other cloud on-ramp providers have done? Are they potentially going to start expanding in some of your other facilities and kind of build their ecosystem? Have you already had those discussions? And then I have a follow up. Steve Smith : Yeah, thanks for the question. This is Steve. We would obviously love to see them expand consistently across our platform and we're always in active conversations with them. I wouldn\u2019t forecasting any of those kind of experiences at this point, but we are actively pursuing those. Sami Badri : Got it. Have other Chinese operators \u2013 Chinese cloud providers approached you as well for similar services or like are they just generally in the market in the U.S. right now? Steve Smith : Yeah, we do see a pretty strong activity from many of the Chinese providers, who are looking to expand in the U.S. So that is an active pipeline for us. Sami Badri : Right. And then my last question is just regarding the California market. Have you seen any recent market pressures in the market from specifically Nevada? Just trying to get an idea if customers are looking for lower power rates for new deployments, have you seen any opportunities missed because of pricing? Steve Smith : The Nevada, I guess, the aspect of overall supply and demand is not new. It\u2019s been out there for quite some time. And actually what we've seen more of as of late is some of those deployments that went to Nevada and other places that we\u2019re less latency driven and those are now coming back closer to markets that we serve for example in the Bay Area because they found that in order for their applications to be competitive if they need to be closer to customers. So it\u2019s really the factor. But we will actually see some benefits from it right now. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Frank Louthan : Great, thank you. Just looking at development yields, is there anything we should think about changing as you're building out looking at some of the new pricing that you've seen underwrite, should we expect development yields going forward to remain stable? Or is there anything to read through there from the change of the pricing? Thanks. Paul Szurek : Yeah, good morning, Frank. Yeah, I think as you know and as we've communicated historically as we underwrite our developments, we're always looking to achieve north of a 12% overall stabilized yield on cost. Obviously, when you do the math, you can see that we've exceeded that in terms of what is in our embedded base, but that's still our underwriting. As we sit here today, I don't think I would read anything into that near-term as it relates to the pricing aspects of what's occurring this quarter. Frank Louthan : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. All right, thank you very much. Paul Szurek : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with J.P Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Richard Choe : Great, one on CapEx and then another one on churn. In terms of CapEx, this looks like it's kind of a peak year and you're doing enough where it could come back a little bit going forward? Or is this a new level that we should be thinking about? Jeff Finnin : Yeah, you\u2019re talking total CapEx being deployed, Richard. Richard Choe : Correct. Jeff Finnin : As you saw we're guiding to $250 million to $300 million, I think as you think about CoreSite, any time we're coming out of the ground with more Greenfield developments. You're going to see that CapEx be elevated in that particular year. And so as you think about LA3, SV8, I mean those are going to cost some elevated CapEx deployment probably in 2018 and then in 2019 when those gets finished up. In addition to that I think as Paul alluded to we're deploying a little bit more right now just as we're trying to ramp up some of the capacity needed in our markets. And so, I want to say it's a new level, but any time to see Greenfield development, it is going to elevate that CapEx. Richard Choe : And then can we get a little bit more color on annual churn that came in below the low end of the range last year? How is this kind of \u2013 how do you drive it? Is it by facility? Is it by customer? How should we think about how our lease is expiring kind of how should we think about how it\u2019s built up to this 6% to 8% range? Jeff Finnin : Yeah, you bet. On an annual basis, generally in the fall, we go through and do a deep dive on our entire portfolio working with Steve and his team to better \u2013 have a better idea of where we expect churn to come in as we go out over the next couple of years. And I think just a couple comments as it relates to 2017. First you know came in at 5.5 for the full year, a little bit underneath our guidance, some of that relates to one or two deals that actually we had anticipated to churn in the fourth quarter. They didn't, and we think they'll come out in the first quarter of 2018. Those numbers are built into our guidance for 2018. And so, it is a matter of doing a deep dive and getting a sense for where we anticipate that churn to be. And hopefully, we can outperform again this year, but that 6% to 8% averaging, call it, 1% to 2% per quarter is what we've seen historically and I think it's fairly consistent in terms of way we look at the business going forward. Richard Choe : Great, thank you. Paul Szurek : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks, good morning guys. So occupancy was up a fair amount of SV1 and SV2, but the annualized rent didn't budge that much, so I was just curious is that a timing issue or what\u2019s going on there? Paul Szurek : Yeah, Lukas, a couple of things. We had some renewals that took place in each of those locations and so you will obviously \u2013 depending upon how those come out are going to impact that rent to some extent. But overall in addition on an annual basis, we do what we referred to as an update of our conversion factors from cage usable square feet to NRSF and on occasion that will drive occupancy up or down without moving the dollars. And we had a little bit of that noise at SV1 and SV2 this quarter. Lukas Hartwich : Well, great. And then lastly, so EBITDA margin has grown a fair amount in recent years. I am just curious do you guys have an internal expectation of where that will stabilize at? Jeff Finnin : Yeah, great question. We ended the year 2017 at 54.6% EBITDA margins. And as you see in our guidance, it gives you an implied margin of \u2013 right in line with that, two things to think about. Paul alluded to it as did I in terms of our commentary where we did make some investments in our team during 2017. And so, you're seeing some of that effect \u2013 the full year effect coming into 2018 and having an impact on those margins. Secondly is the accounting change due to the new accounting is compressing those margins by about 50 basis points as well. Having said all of that 2018 should be consistent or in line with 2017. Longer-term I could tell you that those are ultimately decisions that we got to see how we can figure out what is that right level on a go forward basis. And I think you've probably heard us before saying that we'd like to target something higher than \u2013 kind of call it at the high 50%, but we're working towards it. I don't know how quickly we\u2019ll get there, but it's something we're continuing to work as we think about investments in our team here in \u2013 at the CoreSite. Lukas Hartwich : That's great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to Paul for closing comments. Paul Szurek : I'd like to close by thanking the broader CoreSite team. Greer, Jeff, Steve and I are fortunate to work with outstanding colleagues, who enable us to consistently increase value for customers and shareholders while also making this a very good environment in which to work. I look forward to our ongoing achievements and I thank all of you who took the time to listen to us today. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Welcome to the American Tower first quarter 2018 earnings call. As a reminder today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Igor Khislavsky. Please go ahead sir. Igor Khislavsky - American Tower Corp.: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation which we'll refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website www.americantower.com. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows : First, I'll provide a few highlights from our financial results for the quarter. Next Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and CEO will share some brief thoughts on our U.S. business and recent developments in the industry. And finally, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer will provide a more detailed review of our first quarter results and updated full year outlook. After these comments we'll open the call up for your questions. Before I begin I'll remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth including our 2018 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; the pacing and magnitude of the Indian carrier consolidation process and its impact on American Tower; assumptions around our pending and recently closed acquisitions; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10K for the year-ended December 31, 2017 and in the other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now please turn to slide 4 of our presentation which highlights our financial results for the first quarter of 2018. During the quarter our property revenue grew 7.3% to $1.71 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew 6.5% to $1.06 billion. Our consolidated adjusted funds from operations grew nearly 12% to $807 million and consolidated AFFO per share increased by about 9.5% to $1.84. Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders decreased by about 4.7% to $276 million or $0.63 per diluted common share. This included an impairment charge of approximately $147 million, primarily driven by Aircel's recent bankruptcy in India, partially offset by tax benefits also associated with our India operations. About $59 million of these items were attributable to ATC common stockholders. And with that I'll turn the call over to Jim. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Thanks Igor and good morning to everyone on the call. For those of you who are long term investors of American Tower, you'll recall that our traditional first quarter earnings call theme is a review of the U.S. market. And given industry developments over the weekend, I'll first address the Sprint-T-Mobile announcement and our view of its ramifications for our company and then move on to overall current trends in the U.S. As for expectations regarding the announced merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, we remain highly confident that this transaction, as proposed, will be neutral to positive for American Tower's U.S. business. First, the disclosed plans for the combined entity to spend $40 billion in network and other capital investments over the next three years would represent a substantial increase in spending relative to the recent average annual combined spending of the two companies. And the other carriers, per their recent public statements, are already increasing their capital spend to meet the growing demand for data on their networks, while positioning themselves to take advantage of enhanced opportunities that may be offered by 5G. Second, aggregate network equipment deployment and therefore demand for tower space remains a function of the number of device units in service and the gigabits of data per unit per month. An accelerated 5G deployment schedule by the U.S. mobile industry should result in a more rapid escalation of both metrics. Handsets would expand from cell phones, in a fairly modest population of 4G-enabled tablets and laptops on to the Internet of Things, machine-to-machine mobile communications which should dramatically add to the number of connected devices well beyond traditional handsets. Moreover, even primarily on cellphones, the gigabits of data per month in the U.S. continues to expand at roughly 30% per year which would again be further augmented by new IoT data traffic. Third, our experience has been that past U.S. carrier mergers have historically led to a net positive impact to tower revenue growth for ATC. In this particular case, it's important to note that the merging companies have announced that their planned 5G network would be based on low-band spectrum in rural and suburban areas, mid-band spectrum in metro, and millimeter wave spectrum in dense urban. This is in line with ATC's prior expectations for actual operational 5G rollouts utilizing sub-6-gigahertz bands in the vast majority of U.S. geographies, fully preserving in those geographies the primacy of macro tower sites in the coming 5G technology upgrade cycle. Of specific potential relevance to ATC in this transaction is the merging companies' expectation of deploying 2.5 gigahertz on the bulk of T-Mobile's towers, which none of them have today. We also recognize that T-Mobile and Sprint have announced their intention to enhance the efficiency of their combined network by reducing total cell site count over time. However we expect that there will be a significant amendment opportunity that will run concurrently, as the merging companies have described plans to largely deploy all of their respective spectrum bands on all remaining sites. So while there may ultimately be less total transmission sites in the merged network, each site is likely to have more spectrum bands, more data traffic, and more equipment installed, which would result in offsetting amendment benefits for American Tower. In addition, we believe that our leading U.S. portfolio of over 40,000 sites and strong existing business and contractual relationships with both companies position us well to help facilitate their network strategy, while crafting a win-win solution for both the new T-Mobile and for ATC should the transaction proceed. To summarize, an enhanced amendment opportunity and densification need for 2.5G in a future merged T-Mobile network combined with the potential for an accelerated 5G deployment by the wider U.S. mobile industry, in our view, preserves the long arc of cash flow growth that we expect to generate over the current planning period for our U.S. business. Turning to current trends in our U.S. and international operations, we had a solid quarter across our global business in Q1, especially in the U.S., where our organic tenant billings growth accelerated to 6.3%. We continue to have a high level of visibility and confidence in activity levels across our U.S. operations. And as indicated in our press release and shown on our slide 6 in the presentation, we've raised our full-year 2018 U.S. organic tenant billings outlook to around 6.5%. The fundamental driver of these results remains consistent. More U.S. consumers are using more advanced devices for more bandwidth applications every month. And to keep pace, our wireless carrier tenants are expected to spend over $30 billion in CapEx this year. Taking into account other multiyear initiatives like FirstNet, we believe we are well positioned for a sustained period of attractive U.S. organic growth. The combination of accelerating consumer utilization of mobile devices to access video services via branded and social media, unlimited data plans offered by all the national carriers, and increasingly capable handsets are driving network traffic ever higher. As of the end of 2017, four out of five Americans were using a smartphone for an average of over 5 gigabytes per month. That's up more than 800% from just five years ago. And industry projections suggest that over the next five years, usage will go up another three to four times. Given the relentless strain on their networks, mobile operators are responding now by adding more equipment and additional spectrum bands to their network infrastructure, leading to strong amendment and colocation growth for ATC. Adding to our confidence and optimism surrounding our multiyear demand curve in the U.S. is the evolving deployment path of 5G. In an important development, the industry consortium 3GPP recently approved a 5G new radio standard last December that enable some elements of 5G to be used with an LTE core network. This has the potential to speed the deployment of mobile 5G in the U.S. beyond what we had expected to be an early fixed wireless cable substitution case. Already, several major wireless carriers have signaled their intention to commence mobile 5G service in select markets this year in the U.S. As a result, it seems more likely to us that the deployment of mobile 5G and the addition of associated transmission equipment on our tower sites will actually either coincide with or quickly follow millimeter wave rollouts in dense urban areas. In turn, that activity should help support strong organic growth rates for us, as 2G and 3G spectrum in suburban and rural and urban areas is refarmed and new spectrum assets are deployed. Increasingly, it appears to us that in addition to 600-megahertz and 2.5G spectrum, which companies have both been talking about as 5G mobile, there are other spectrum assets that are increasingly likely to also be used for mobile 5G deployments. Particularly of recent interest is spectrum in the 3.7 to 4.2-gigahertz range, which could offer an additional opportunity for the carriers to bring mobile 5G service outside of dense urban areas earlier in the cycle by utilizing our towers. Given the propagation characteristics of those spectrum assets and the coverage as well as capacity needs of an eventual 5G network, we believe that a substantial number of macro towers would be needed to support such a rollout. The third and final aspect of the evolving U.S. mobile industry landscape that has the potential to be a meaningful growth driver for our business over the longer term includes smart city technology, AR/VR, edge computing solutions, drone-controlled networks, autonomous cars, and other IoT applications. We continue to be active in dialogue with a variety of leading companies across numerous industries to ensure that we position American Tower as the provider of choice for these and other future products and services. Simultaneously, we're using our recently formalized innovation program to develop and trial a number of concepts, including ongoing efforts with ATSC 3.0 broadcast technology, urban smart poles through an alliance with Philips Lighting, and our participation in the CBRS Alliance through a strategic investment in Federated Wireless, among other projects. This focus on innovation has long been an integral part of American Tower's strategy and we believe has the potential to eventually contribute significantly to our growth on a global basis and specifically in the U.S. So as we did in 2007 for our nascent international business then, we've set an aspirational goal for innovation-related initiatives to be a driver of up to 25% of our run rate revenue 10 years out, with a return on investment profile comparable to that of our current business. We're already organizationally and systemically structured to address innovative investment opportunities, largely based on our existing macro towers and adjacent assets and targeting both existing and some new customers. We're already starting to gain some traction with our first deployment of smart poles later this year in Huntington Beach, California. And we have a number of other prototype deployments in our pipeline and mid-sized investments we've done in international markets as well. So in summary, we view the growth profile of the U.S., our largest market by far, our largest free cash flow generator, to be very attractive whether there are four or three national wireless carriers. In the near to medium term, we believe that our growth will be driven by the necessary strengthening and improvement of the domestic 4G network, augmented by early phases of 5G deployments. The massive increase in network speeds and greatly reduced latency of 5G will enable machine-to-machine connectivity through the cloud along with enhanced mobile entertainment and gaming capabilities for consumers. And with our focus on innovation, we seek to augment and extend our U.S. growth trajectory even further by collaborating with pioneers and building businesses based on the leapfrog from 4G to 5G technology. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to go through our results for the quarter and our updated outlook in detail. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Hey, thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. So as Igor highlighted earlier, we generated another quarter of strong results, posting solid growth in property revenue adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO. U.S. organic tenant billings growth accelerated sequentially to 6.3%, as Jim noted. We grew our common stock dividend by about 21% and demand trends across our global footprint were even better than our initial expectations. We also closed on our acquisition of the Vodafone tower portfolio in India, at the very end of the quarter, adding over 10,000 sites to our portfolio and further solidifying our position as a leading independent tower operator in the market. Given Aircel's recent bankruptcy announcement in India, we've raised our churn expectations for the market in 2018, accelerating the timing of certain churn we previously would have anticipated to occur over the next several years. For purposes of our results and outlook for the year, we've taken what we believe to be a prudent approach in providing for how we see the bankruptcy process working out. We expect 2018 to be the high watermark in terms of Indian carrier consolidation-driven churn by a fairly wide margin. With that let's dive into the details around our first quarter performance and updated outlook for the year. If you please turn to slide 8, during the first quarter we realized consolidated organic tenant billings growth of nearly 6%, with 5% attributable to volume growth from gross new business added throughout our geographic footprint. Our U.S. property segment revenue growth for the quarter was roughly 4.4% including a negative impact of over 3% associated with a $25 million decline in non-cash straight line revenue recognition versus the prior year. Volume growth from colocations and amendments contributed nearly 5% to our U.S. growth rate, supported by record levels of organic new business on both an aggregate and per tower basis. As compared to Q1 of last year, new business commencements were up over 40%. Pricing escalators contributed just over 3% and were partially offset by churn of just around 1.2%. Notably, our U.S. organic tenant billings growth accelerated nearly 50 basis points sequentially to 6.3% for the quarter. Network development efforts across our entire domestic customer base including FirstNet-focused activity helped drive that strong organic growth. New business commencements were once again heavily weighted towards amendments in the quarter and we continue to see amendment pricing at the high end of our historical range as significant equipment overlays are occurring on our sites. We continue to have solid visibility into growth in the U.S. and believe that we're in the midst of a multiyear period of elevated demand for our communications real estate, given the long-term nature of ongoing network initiatives and recent public commentary from our tenants in the marketplace. In our international markets, as a whole, organic tenant billings growth was nearly 5% in the quarter, including solid gross new business commencements, offset by the impacts of the higher levels of carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, particularly as a result of Aircel's recent filing for bankruptcy protection. On a total international basis, colocations and amendments drove nearly 6% of organic tenant billings growth, while escalators contributed another 4.2% and other run rate items added another 40 basis points. This was partially offset by churn of about 5.5% of which about 3% was related to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. Q1 gross organic growth in our international markets exceeded that of the year ago period by a few million dollars. As a result, adjusting for the impact of consolidation-driven churn in India, international organic tenant billings growth would have been around 8%. New business was particularly strong in Latin America, where the contribution from colocations and amendments grew nearly 40% over the prior year quarter. Mexico, our second largest market in the region, generated organic tenant billings growth of 17%, the highest level over the last five years. And this was driven by activity from multiple tenants including ALT\u00c1N. And finally on a total American Tower consolidated basis, the day-one revenue associated with the sites we've added over the course of the last year contributed another 1.6% to our global tenant billings growth. This was driven by acquisitions as well as the over 300 newly constructed sites built just this quarter, primarily in our international markets with average day one NOI yield of around 11%. Turning to slide 9, we also generated solid adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in the quarter, driven by strong top-line growth and diligent management of operating expenses, interest cost and maintenance CapEx. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by 6.5% and adjusted EBITDA margin rose about 0.5% sequentially to 61%, due primarily to revenue outperformance across the U.S., Latin America and EMEA markets as well as the continued cost controls throughout the business. We're able to generate solid margins despite the addition of a number of new initially lower tenancy assets, a negative impact of about 40 basis points from net straight line declines, elevated Indian carrier consolidated-churn rates and a negative impact of about 1.7% as a result of around $29 million of primarily Aircel driven bad debt expense that we recorded in India in the quarter. Meanwhile, both consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to common stockholders grew nearly 12% in the quarter. Similarly, on a per share basis both rose by around 9.5%. These growth rates reflect our high-quality global portfolio, significant diversification focused on operational efficiency and strong investment grade balance sheet. In addition, they're reflective of a conversion rate from adjusted EBITDA to consolidated AFFO of well over 100% and a consolidated property segment gross margin of nearly 71%. So turning to slide 10, let's now take a look at our updated expectations for 2018. At the midpoint of our revised outlook, we expect property revenue growth of over 6%, including a negative impact of over 2% from lower non-cash straight line revenue and another 3% or so from Indian carrier consolidation-driven churn, now projected to be higher than it was in our prior guidance, primarily as a result of Aircel's recently announced bankruptcy. We anticipate that consolidated tenant billings will increase to about 8%, including organic tenant billings growth of about 4% to 5% and a roughly 3% to 4% contribution from newly acquired or constructed assets. This is being supported by strong trends throughout our U.S., LatAm and EMEA regions where we are raising our expectations for organic tenant billings growth. In the U.S., we're raising our outlook for organic tenant billings growth to approximately 6.5%, supported by record levels of new business which is expected to be up more than 30% versus last year. And meanwhile in Latin America and EMEA, we now expect to generate organic tenant billings growth of approximately 10% and 7% respectively, also as a result of higher than anticipated levels of new business. And finally, our organic tenant billings in Asia are expected to contract by about 12%, representing an additional 4% or so decline versus our prior expectations. This primarily reflects an acceleration in consolidation-driven churn as a result of Aircel's bankruptcy filing. Normalized to exclude for the impacts of carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, we now anticipate consolidated organic tenant billings growth at the midpoint to be around 7% for the year. Turning to slide 11, at the midpoint of our outlook, we're reducing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $60 million, driven primarily by accelerated carrier consolidation-driven churn impacts in India and some unfavorable FX impacts. Excluding India, we expect to exceed our initial expectations with a combination of the U.S., Latin America and EMEA markets forecasted to generate $25 million in tenant billings outperformance and about $35 million in total property revenue out-performance relative to our prior outlook. Notably, the U.S. is expected to contribute around two-thirds of that total. Offsetting the strong expected revenue out-performance is just over $70 million of negative impacts associated with Aircel in India, inclusive around $20 million of lower expected FX neutral pass-through revenue. In addition and as you can see, we also anticipate about $24 million in unfavorable foreign exchange impacts as compared to our prior outlook. Turning to slide 12, before we move on to the other aspects of our updated outlook, as we did on our last earnings call, I'd like to quickly review our revised expectations for India. As we've communicated over the last year or so, we expect near-term churn in the market to be significantly above historical levels, driven by a carrier consolidation process through which we think the current eight or nine wireless carriers will consolidate down to three or four. We are reiterating our prior expectations for total carrier consolidation-driven churn in the market over the next several years of $150 million to $200 million, but now expect more of that run rate to churn off sooner. In 2008, specifically, we're increasing what we expect to realize in India for carrier consolidation-driven churn to around $120 million. The increase in churn is principally due to the Aircel bankruptcy. In addition, we also expect pass through revenue to decline by around $70 million. All of these impacts are included in our revised outlook. Net-net, we believe that these adjustments set us on an accelerated path to return to more normalized levels of organic tenant billings growth in India. Further, we do think that 2018 should represent by far the largest year of churn for us in India and that churn should begin to ease next year. I also want to note that we continue to benefit from incremental wireless carrier network investments being made in the marketplace and consistent with our prior outlook expect gross organic tenant billings growth of about 8% in India for the year. These investments are currently being led by Reliance Jio [R-Jio], who per their own public statements have been very aggressive in their 4G network rollout. Over the next few years, we believe, as the other carriers in the market have stated publicly that they will need to rapidly increase their network spending to keep up and we're all well-positioned to capture that incremental activity with our comprehensive India portfolio. And as we get to 2020 and beyond, we believe that this spending will lead to more normalized levels of organic tenant billings growth for us in India. Moving on to slide 13. We now expect our adjusted EBITDA to grow by about 5.5% for the year, down $35 million from our previous outlook. The combination of the U.S., LatAm and EMEA regions are expected to generate nearly $50 million of adjusted EBITDA out-performance, with the majority of this coming from our largest market, the U.S. We expect the out-performance to be more than offset by just over $70 million in lower adjusted EBITDA in India, driven primarily by the combination of the increased carrier consolidation-driven churn I just discussed and the higher bad debt expense we recorded in Q1, primarily associated with Aircel. The balance of our reduced outlook for adjusted EBITDA is attributable to about $10 million in unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. However, we are more than offsetting these items at the consolidated AFFO level and raising our expectations for consolidated AFFO by $20 million and maintaining our outlook for consolidated AFFO per share at $7.30 for the year. We now expect consolidated AFFO to grow by over 11%, up about 60 basis points from our prior outlook. The increase is being driven by $29 million in lower net cash interest, $10 million in reduced cash taxes, and about $10 million in reduced maintenance CapEx expectations, partially offset by around $21 million in lower cash adjusted EBITDA, and around $7 million of negative impact from FX fluctuations. As you can see from these compelling growth rates, we continue to translate solid organic performance across our footprint into strong AFFO growth. As you can see on slide 14, given our track record of delivering strong financial and operational results, we remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation program. During the first quarter, we continued to strategically augment our portfolio, spending nearly $700 million or over half of our capital deployed during the period to acquire nearly 10,600 sites, primarily in India. We expect that the attractive valuations of these assets will enable us to drive rapidly expanding returns once the market normalizes. Historically we found times of market volatility often present the best opportunity to add high return assets to our portfolio. We also spent about $170 million or about 14% of total capital deployed on discretionary capital projects, with about 70% of this for new site construction and site augmentation. We built over 300 new sites this quarter, primarily in our international markets where initial returns continue to be in the double digits and long-term returns also continue to be even more compelling. Our earliest vintage of new builds those built between 2000 and 2009 are now delivering returns of around 40%. Just 3% or under $40 million was spent on nondiscretionary CapEx in the period, primarily to maintain our high-quality asset base. Lastly, we deployed over $330 million for our common stock dividend, which grew by around 21% during the period. We've done all of this while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet, our investment grade credit rating and driving rising return on invested capital for our consolidated business. We ended the quarter at about 4.8 times net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, which is solidly within our long-term target range of 3 to 5 times. We've also continued to expand our return on invested capital, delivering an ROIC of 10.4%, which is up around 100 basis points over the last five years. We expect that over time, the current investment being made through our methodical capital allocation process will enable us to continue to deliver strong financial growth, rising returns and a consistently growing dividend well into the future. So turning to slide 15 and in summary, we kicked off 2018 with a strong start across our U.S., Latin America and EMEA segments. And while we are seeing elevated near-term cancellations in India, efficiencies and strong growth in other parts of our diversified business are expected to enable us to generate compelling growth and consolidated AFFO per share for the year. Additionally by accelerating some of the churn impacts that we'd previously assumed to occur more ratably over the next several years, we believe we're now better positioned for resumption growth in India sooner rather than later. We also continue to focus on taking steps to optimize the business to generate strong returns for our shareholders well into the future. Operational efficiency remains a key priority in all of our markets. And the maintenance of our investment grade balance sheet and strong liquidity position is also top of mind. Further, our innovation teams are busy conducting trials in a number of markets to pave the way for future growth, improve the efficiency of our existing operations and help us to minimize our environmental impact. The underlying trends for communication real estate continues to be strong throughout our global footprint. In the U.S., organic tenant billings growth continues to be well over 6%, supported by record levels of new business, as all major carriers in the marketplace invest in their various network initiatives. And in our international markets, we're seeing rapid growth in mobile usage, resulting in strong demand, particularly in key markets like Mexico and Brazil. We think we're well positioned to continue to deliver attractive total shareholder returns for the remainder of 2018, as we translate the secular growth in global wireless and through continued consolidated AFFO per share and dividend growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, so we can take some Q&A. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Phil Cusick. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. On the U.S., clearly momentum is building in the business. Can you talk about what's built into the guidance at this point? Does the guide assume a ramp in committed activity through the year? Or does today's guidance reflect really only the committed revenue pace today? Thanks. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Hey, Phil. No, it's a function of what we see in our backlog in terms of the application volumes that we have in place and based upon the discussions that our teams continually have with our customers at the local level. We're expecting to see these kinds of trends continue. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And so if we see continued ramp from some carriers through the year, would you anticipate guidance to go higher or is that again, that's already built-in? Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: No, I mean given that the existing levels that we have to the extent that we seek increases in those levels of activity, I would expect there to be an increase in the overall organic growth. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks, Tom. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks very much. Just continuing on from Phil's question there, do you have \u2013 I know it's very early, but is there any concern that Sprint or T-Mobile may moderate some of their activity this year as they wait for, to see how the regulators deal with the deal? And then on India, I think in the past you'd talked about 2020 being kind of your goal of when you return to a more normal activity. Perhaps you could just update us on your thought process around that? Thanks. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Simon, good morning, it's Jim. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Hey, Jim. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: It is too early to see any change in behavior, if it indeed will occur at all from either Sprint or T-Mobile on their current network plans. The public statement referred to them continuing with those plans. But if we see any adjustments that are significant enough to affect the guidance, we'll let you know, of course, next quarter. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Yes. And as I said, Simon, with regards to the levels of churn, given that this year will clearly be what we believe to be the high watermark for churn, we expect to reduce levels come next year. And so even in my comments, getting into 2020, we would expect to start to get back to more normal levels of organic growth. We're generating 8% of gross growth this year, and we would expect normal churn in that 3% to 4% range. And so that's why ex this churn, we would have probably in the 4%-ish range of organic growth, and then you have the incremental churn on top of that. And so we would expect the carriers, as they come out of this consolidation process, to continue to invest in their markets, some probably even more than others, to try to gain some level footing if you will in the marketplace. And so we would expect 2020-2021 to get back to more normal levels of organic growth that we've seen over the past several years. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. So on India, just bigger picture, I wondered if you can comment on the tower industry structure given some changes ongoing, how you see that further evolving and any implications you see for your business. And then on a more micro basis, I just wanted to confirm that Tata exposure is not in your churn guidance because of the duration of that lease. Thanks. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Sure, I'll take the first one, Jonathan. Good morning. As far as the tower industry evolution in India, it's exactly what we'd like to see, and very much we expect the outcome to look a lot like where the U.S. industry is. What I mean by that is, there were a number of and still are a number of captive, as they're called, tower cos in India, which are owned and controlled by mobile operators. The behavior of those companies is heavily influenced by the interest of the operators. And we've always had an expectation since our initial investment that over time those operators would monetize their towers, sell them off into independent companies like ours, and you'd have a rational tower market in addition to a rationalizing carrier market with three or four operators. So we expect at the end of the day three or four quite strong, well-capitalized mobile operators like we have in the U.S. Now we also expect two to three significant tower companies managing the bulk of those assets, again, like we have in the U.S. So the long-term industry evolution for India we think is going to end up very similar to the United States as they enter a very competitive 4G environment, which again is the same situation that happened here about 10 years ago when Alltel, Nextel, and AT&T Wireless merged into bigger carriers. So that's how we see the landscape playing out, and I think that would be very constructive for our already independent tower company, given our scale. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: And you're right, Jonathan, this does not include the impacts of the Tata settlement. We continue to work with our customer, our shareholder on what that settlement will look like. We would expect that that settlement will probably happen over a couple of year period. We're working through with the carriers to really assess just how many sites are going to be needed to be able to support their existing customer base and new hands. And we're also continuing to look at what additional costs will be needed in our own business given the lower levels of business. So a lot of ongoing activity with that relationship, but you are right, it is not included in those numbers. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then just a quick follow-up, Mexico strong growth there. Where are we in the cycle for ALT\u00c1N? And is this potentially a peak year for same-store growth in that market? Thanks. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: It's very difficult to say. They have their own regulatory requirements in terms of just how much of that network needs to be \u2013 how much of the population needs to be supported over the next couple of years. It will largely depend upon the demand on that network, I believe. And so, as I said, we're really pleased with the activity, and it's not just from ALT\u00c1N, but it's from the entire marketplace. So we would hope to see this kind of activity for many periods to come. But depending, as I said, I think to the success of ALT\u00c1N with leasing out its own network, I think will largely drive what that activity might look like over the next several years. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Matt Niknam. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Matt, are you there? Maybe next call operator. Operator : Just one second here. Matt, your line is open. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys, can you hear me okay? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Yes, we can. Thanks, Matt. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. So the question was strategy-wise, on the back of the Sprint/T-Mobile announcement this weekend, does that change at all your plans around international expansion and diversification? And then on the back of that, 5G was obviously at the core of the T-Mobile and Sprint plan in terms of technology rollout. Does that impact the way you think about fiber and small cells in the U.S.? Thanks. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: The Sprint/T-Mobile merger wouldn't affect our capital allocation process, which includes reviewing and acting on international opportunities that fall within our investment criteria, so that is not affected by the Sprint/T-Mobile merger. That process will remain in place. As far as the 5G plan announced by T-Mobile and Sprint, it again doesn't change our conviction on one thing that I tried \u2013 emphasized in the prepared remarks is the macro site role in the 5G network rollout in the U.S. I think is pretty clear now; that it's going to be a foundational role, most of the population, about 85% of it. And the vast, vast majority of the geographic coverage is outside of urban and dense urban areas. So we feel that this validates the hypothesis we've always had, which is those macro towers are going to be the foundational infrastructure for 5G. As to fiber and small cells in urban and dense urban areas, again, we have the same strategic view of this, which is location rights at scale on a franchised basis are the value-creating opportunity for us. We'll buy or lease or find fiber from the existing marketplace that's already there in the U.S. Multiple competitors in every urban market, lots of existing asset base, a competitive supply chain, we'll go buy fiber from the market to support the small cell franchise rights should we get them at scale. So it doesn't really change the strategy there either, frankly. Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, Jim. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Barden. Your line is open. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. I guess one for Tom just on the updated AFFO outlook. I understand the walk on the slide 13. I guess in the supplement on page 16 there's another walk. And if you compare them quarter-over-quarter, it looks like the big changes are deferred income taxes and other which includes some provision for India. Could you help us walk through the moving parts in that other \u2013 build up in taxes and other? And then, Jim, just you gave birth to this innovations initiative last quarter, laid out a bunch of priorities and targets that you wanted to get to work on. Could you talk to us about what actually is happening on that front right now and what the budget was for this past quarter and for the year? Thanks. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Sure. I'll start with the second question on innovation. Our biggest investments so far have been fiber-to-the-tower bases infrastructure opportunities in Latin America predominantly, right? So we have an investment in Mexico along those lines and one in Argentina. With those fiber-to-the-tower assets, they also come with the scale transmission rights based on utility poles that come with those particular companies and businesses. So that's the bulk of the actual capital investments so far or M&A investment if you will. Then we have some smaller very targeted investments and one is Federated Wireless, a reference I made earlier where we are working with them as a minority owner to help craft the CBRS spectrum utilization plan for small cells, predominantly in indoor venues is our main interest but outdoor as well. And hopefully, we will be able to help guide that process of utilizing that spectrum in a way where we can get franchise real estate rights, help deploy and get our carries a much cheaper access, especially to indoor opportunities in office buildings, apartments, et cetera. So that's one small investment we've made. Another one which is fairly modest under $10 million is with the Philips alliance, where we co-develop with them an actual product that is being deployed in California right now, to combine LED lighting system which reduces the cost of the municipality for lighting, plus the transmission system for 4G and 5G embedded in the pole. So again, that's another place we made a small investment. And it goes down the line. And we've got innovation teams, David, deployed around the world, very highly qualified people and a fantastic CTO in Ed Knapp that is managing all of this under my guidance. And we will methodically keep making these investments as we go forward. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: And, David, on your first question, maybe there are a number of events that are going on in India. We have the merger of our legacy businesses into our joint venture business that's, we believe, creating some opportunities and with the write-down that we recently took in the quarter. And then more broadly, I think that we have a number of initiatives that are going on around the world that our tax group is actively working on to be able to mitigate as much tax exposure as we possibly can. So I think among those three areas I think is really driving some of the improvement in overall cash taxes that you referred to. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And if I could just follow-up, Tom, is that legacy ATC merged into Viom, is that underway, the terms and everything being set in your \u2013 or is this negotiation with Tata regarding the legacy leases getting involved in that conversation? Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: No, no. David, that's done. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: That was an event that occurred in the quarter. So, yes \u2013 no, we do now have that legacy business now officially merged into the traditional Viom business. David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect. All right. Thanks. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Amy Yong. Please go ahead. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Maybe just elaborating on T-Mobile and Sprint, if you could talk about \u2013 I think a lot of investors are focused on the 35 sites that are going to get turned off and maybe the build of 10. Were you surprised by the numbers around that? Is that in line with your expectations? And then just secondly on India, if you can help us think through what a good base assumption for 2019 and maybe the shape of growth and churn for the back half of 2018 and 2019, that would be really helpful? Thank you. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: As far as T-Mobile and Sprint's network plans, they're not a surprise, the internal analysis done by the two companies. They also may well include sites from say Clearwire, MetroPCS et cetera that were likely to be reduced or decommissioned over time anyway by the independent companies. That could be a portion of them. But as I said in the remarks, I mean at the end of the day should this merger come to fruition and completion, there will be an intelligent rationalization of the 100,000 plus or minus cell sites that the companies have today into something that will give good coverage, but will need to be improved itself over time. And as I said, when you're starting to apply 2.5 gigahertz spectrum to cell sites that were designed for 800-900 megahertz spectrum, there's got to be a density need over time. There's also going to have to be significant, we think, amendment activity on the sites that are consolidated into that will offset some of the leases that sunset over the next few \u2013 many years actually is the way these usually turn out. So we're not surprised by any of it. One of our benefits as a company, we have the leading tower portfolio. We are a highly focused macro site company that doesn't need to necessarily feel that we have to make any tradeoffs elsewhere. And we've got great contractual relationships with both companies and really good business relationships. So we tend to be their network partner in evolving to the layout and infrastructure topology that they're going to need to grow from in the future. So we see this as a very constructive opportunity for us should it go through. And we'll work with them and I think will be a good outcome for ATC, as I said. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: And, Amy, just following up on your question with churn, as I mentioned, we're looking at the $110 million, $120 million of churn in 2018. Probably 60% of that will occur in the second half of the year given the assumptions that we've made relative to transactions getting approved and notifications coming in to when those leases will actually be canceled. As I mentioned it is the high watermark. We've talked about the $150 million to $200 million of total churn. And given the 120-ish in 2018 with the RCom and MTS churn of \u2013 in the fourth quarter in the $30 million to $40 million, you can back into what we would expect to be the 2019 related churn. Now, again, this can move around based upon what kinds of cancellation notices when in fact we do get these but this is our best estimate of when we think this churn will actually impact us between 2017 and 2019. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Amir Rozwadowski. Your line is open. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much and good morning folks. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Hey, Amir. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two questions if I may. First and foremost, if we think about sort of the demand environment in the U.S., are there any constraints that you're seeing from resources perhaps? Just given the amount of work that's being done on application activity level, are there any sort of limitations in terms of tower climbers or anything that you could see in the food chain that could be holding back some of the activity levels? And then, if we think about 5G over the longer term, one of your peers had mentioned that they're starting to see deployments taking place that could be a precursor to 5G or indicative of 5G in non-urban areas. Any comment you can provide to that effect? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: On our U.S. demand cycle resource constraints aren't a factor for what we do on our sites at all, Amir. So, I wouldn't look at that as any an obstacle or problem that we face. We have an outstanding supply chain. We've got great operational employees and a very tight organization in the U.S. So we don't face those constraints I believe in any material way. And secondly, as I described in the remarks, yeah, there are applications starting to coming in for certain types of antennas, trial sites, that three or four of the carriers have already announced that they are going to be in certain markets installing this equipment. So we're getting applications starting to come in for those projects. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So then just a quick follow-up on that. If we think about sort of either antenna designs or any other types of technology needed to enable that opportunity set, should we think about 5G as being an incremental add to your total addressable market, just given how networks are expected to be designed to utilize some of that spectrum? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: I'll give you one quick example, just the 600 megahertz antenna versus the 700 megahertz antenna, the optimal antenna height if you will is an extra foot, right? So that comes with weight. It comes with an up charge. So that's just one small example of when you get into more advanced technologies, whether it's lower band spectrums, which have bigger antennas or higher band spectrums, which have smaller antennas, but a lot more of them and a lot closer together, that the physics are hard to get around. You've got to \u2013 if you want to put that traffic out there using those frequencies, you're going to have to deploy the equipment at scale to meet that 30-plus percent increase in data demand. And whether you're using 600 or 2,500, the trade-offs and everywhere in between the trade-offs are based on physics, Amir. And there's an equipment set that comes with those. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Excellent. Thank you very much for the incremental color. Operator : Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Batya Levi. Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thank you. In the U.S., do you see any change in the competitive environment to attract new business from the carriers? And just a question on the guidance, looks like you're using a higher share count for the 2018 guide. Any implications for the buyback for the year? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Sure, Batya. I'll take the first one. And, Tom, you can speak to the share count. We don't see any change in the competitive environment in the U.S. On the major MLA front, we have no visibility first of all to anyone else's agreements or conversations with customers, but we as the market leader, we would envision ourselves not changing our approach at all. It's patient. It's agnostic in between, a holistic-type comprehensive wholesale deal and a set of retail transactions we'll work with the customer to get our best outcome and their best outcome should we find common ground. So agnostic on that, but we're basically looking for the highest level and most reliable cash flow with the least downside in every agreement we have. When it comes to new build opportunities, there's been a competitive tower build environment in the U.S., for the very few sites that do get built here from the ground up on a macro basis for many, many years since certainly I've been here. Some of the players and companies and names and promotional efforts change, but that market's always been there and when we can get our return we'll build towers and where we can't others will underbid us and they will get that opportunity. But with 40,000 plus I think we're in pretty good shape. So we don't really see any change from our perch in the competitive environment and whether it's new builds or existing infrastructure. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: And, Batya, with regards to your second question, you're right. We anticipate now slightly more M&A activity and capital dedicated to M&A. So that's one of the reasons as well as the timing of when the buybacks occur, so that impacts what the ultimate weighting would be. Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Tim Horan. Your line is open. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks guys. Jim, T-Mobile and Sprint are implying that over time wireless can supplant a lot of wireline broadband and 12% of households are wireless only now for their Internet access. Do you think we have the spectrum and the infrastructure to support a much larger percentage of households being wireless only? And I know India is largely wireless at this point, and I just had a quick follow-up on India also. Thanks. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Tim, I believe that many of the carriers, not just T-Mobile and/or Sprint, feel that this is a real business opportunity for them, cable substitution, fixed broadband to the home using a range of spectrum assets based on the topology and the population density of the homes. And of course, there is spectrum available for that, but it's limited. And therefore, if these projects actually get deployed at scale and they're beyond say millimeter wave spectrum, which will be effective for maybe a couple hundred yards or a few hundred yards, you're going to be into macro sites or mini-macro sites with mid-band spectrum. And if you're going to be again putting through the bandwidth gigabits per second type of speeds that is required to do fiber or cable-to-the-home type competition, you're going to have to have a lot of transmission sites. So the trade-offs are there, whether you want to dig a trench down the street and through everybody's yard or you want to deploy macro sites that have slave mini-macros and then last quarter-mile transmission to the home. There's going to be a cost to competing in either of those environments, but there are a number of mobile companies that have made public statements about their interest in competing on fixed wireless, and that's absolutely the way to do it. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And just an update on India; I think in the presentation you said 4% organic growth. When everything shakes out and the industry settles down, do you have any thoughts on what that market can grow at longer term? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Yes, Tim. Last year or the year before, we were up in the high single digits, low double-digit growth rate. Given the demand that we believe we're going to see in that marketplace, we believe that we're going to be getting back to those similar rates of growth. Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks. Just to start with a quick clarification, Tom, just so I'm doing this right, the churn you're expecting in India, the consolidation churn of $150 million to $200 million, that's property revenue, correct? We're comparing that to the $120 million you expect this year. It doesn't include pass-through? Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: That's right. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, and then just a follow-up question on India. You've noted that the new business you're getting exclusive of churn is at a lower level as well because there's a lot of focus on network integration. Part of the long-term thesis I believe you had around the Viom portfolio is that it did under-index to the bigger operators, but that you estimated that as consolidation played out, you'd be able to leverage some of the relationships you had in ATC India and bring that business onto Viom. So I guess I was hoping you can maybe just talk about the nature of the new leasing you are seeing in India, even if it is at a lower level to maybe help frame why you're constructive on where you're going to be once you get through the consolidation period. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: The large pieces of the existing business, Brett, is coming from R-Jio, as I mentioned. So they continue to expand. 80% \u2013 90% of the country's data traffic is now going over their network. And so they're continually having to invest heavily into that business and continually to expand the capacity of that network. We would expect that once we would get through the process that they're going through, which is probably another 18 months or so in the marketplace, that then all of the carriers, the remaining carriers will start to invest heavily into that market for both voice and data and continually building out their 4G. So we think that because R-Jio is not going through that same kind of consolidation process that the other carriers are going that they're able to maintain just more focus on building out their network, underlying what their foundational infrastructure looks like. And so they're just able to build on it and continue with it. And so we would hope and we would anticipate that we'd be able to continue with the R-Jio deployment, and then on top of that, be able to enjoy the growth coming from the other consolidated entities. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Is it fair to assume that once you get through this consolidation period, to the extent you're able to grow organically on your existing towers, that will be very capital efficient, meaning that there will actually be excess space on the towers, or is there anything you're going to have to do to recondition them to take on new tenants? James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: No, you're exactly right. We would anticipate, we have a lot of single-tenant towers in the marketplace, so we would expect to be able to really leverage that infrastructure to be able to enjoy that kind of growth going forward. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thank you for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Ric Prentiss. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in, a couple questions. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Absolutely. And I hope you are as pleased as we are with the outcome of the hockey playoffs there, Ric. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: 1-1, we'll see you in Boston, two questions if I could, one going back to little bit of what Phil asked. When we think about the U.S. momentum, what's the update as far as how long is it taking from executed lease to seeing the revenue show up on the tower in the U.S.? And then I've got a follow-up on India. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Ric, that depends on a couple things, whether it's amendment or colocation. The amendments tend to be quicker. And it also depends on the contractual arrangement with each carrier and their own internal approval process. But the lead times are still for amendments in weeks or a couple of months. And when it comes to colocations, it could be three to six months depending on the carrier. So those are the timeframes. So I'd say just to give it some shorthand; a quarter for an amendment, two quarters for a colocation. That's the visibility we have on average. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That makes sense. And in India, going back to something Brett was asking, obviously, it's excluding pass-throughs, the $150 million to $200 million. Last time the guidance I think assumed about $90 million would come in 2018, and now we're at $120 million coming in 2018, a difference of about $30 million, but slide 13 is talking about $71 million. I assume part of that is that bad debt write-off. I just want to understand the differences in those numbers, if I'm getting them right. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: No, you are, Ric. There's incremental churn, what we anticipate coming from Aircel which is driving it. There are some timing benefits as a result of some other churn that we assumed in the business is being pushed out later in the year. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And there was a bad debt in there, so was that \u2013 I missed the number. Was that $29 million? Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Yes, you're absolutely right. No, that's exactly right. And if you take a look at the impacts to EBITDA on top of the impacts of that revenue related largely driven by the churn from Aircel, there were some outstanding receivables that we needed to reserve against given the bankruptcy process. And that was what we booked, as I mentioned we booked in Q1. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And that's bad debt not in the churn number? Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: That's right. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And just one \u2013 I don't know if you've got the time there. What is the Tata timeframe? I think originally it was 2025 they were contractually obligated through. But you're maybe suggesting that you could negotiate the Viom stake versus maybe having churn come in earlier. Is that what we should think about? Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: So, Ric, everything's integrated here. Tata is a partner in ATC India now based on the overall legal entity consolidation. So they have a stake in the success of the business as well. They've got \u2013 and we have other partners in the JV. And so we're all working through the simultaneous equations that speak to the participation length of time in the JV, the exit from that, the run rate of revenue and potentially a settlement portion at some point in the future, so all those things are wrapped together. And it's a constructive process among the partners right now on all those dimensions. And once we conclude it, we'll be able to report out all of the specifics. Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, Let's Go Lightning! I'll see you guys. Have a good day. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: Thanks, Ric. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: Take care. Operator : Thank you. And speakers, I'll turn it back over to you for any closing remarks. James D. Taiclet, Jr. - American Tower Corp.: All righty. Thanks everyone for joining today. Have a great day. Thomas A. Bartlett - American Tower Corp.: All right. Bye, everybody. Operator : And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference Services. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Greer Aviv. Please go ahead. Greer Aviv : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I'm joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Federal Securities Laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our Web site at CoreSite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We continue to execute well, achieving another quarter of strong growth with revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and FFO per share, each increasing 16% year-over-year. Regarding our strong internal growth, we had solid performance on substantially all measurements, including solid cash rent growth on renewals, low churn, and 8% year-over-year growth in same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent. Our sales activity generated $10.4 million net of annualized GAAP rent signed in new and expansion leases. Our core retail co-location business was solid, and we had a good quarter in scale co-location leasing. Healthy organic growth is represented by 90% of GAAP rent side coming from the expansion of existing customers. New customers looking to optimize their IT architecture who are embarked on a digital transformation drove the 28 new logos we signed in Q2. More importantly, we believe we continue to see an increase in the quality of new logos. The annualized GAAP rents signed by them in Q2 increased 13% compared to the trailing 12 month average, while the number of kilowatts licensed increased 10%. Hybrid cloud architectures appeared to be gaining traction because they permit scaling, expansion, cost efficiencies, and adoption of new technology products, including the constantly-growing menu of cloud based applications. We believe most companies today can deploy valuable innovative applications even globally from a single well-connected datacenter with the right customer ecosystem and direct connect facilities. Our network in cloud-connected datacenters together with our customer communities can help businesses with this kind of rapid scaling and innovation while also generally lowering their cost per data center capacity. Our facilities continue to benefit from businesses requiring low latency and robust performance to serve many consumers and enterprises in our very large edge markets. We remain optimistic about the demand trends we are seeing in these markets, and supply is generally in balance with demand. Our Q2 pricing realized reflects the relatively stable pricing in the markets and segments we compete in. We also continue to make solid progress on the building blocks for future growth. In Los Angeles, we commenced construction on 28,000 square feet datacenter capacity at LA2, which is 100% pre-leased. Following the expansion signed by one of our strategic customers of LA2, we have approximately 65,000 square feet of remaining capacity at this building. Overall, we believe demand remains stead in LA and continues to outpace supply in the downtown market. With these dynamics in mind, we recently renewed our existing space in LA1 and expanded it to an additional 17,000 square feet. Importantly, this renewal and expansion extended the term of our lease by seven years to 2029, and extended our control over our space at One Wilshire to 2044. As it relates to LA3, we continue to progress through the permitting process and expect to break ground in the last quarter of 2018. Please bear in mind that the timing is almost entirely determined here in Santa Clara and Chicago by the municipal permitting process. In Reston, we remain on track with our current phase of development at VA3 Phase 1B scheduled for Q1 2019 delivery. In Santa Clara, we commenced demolition of the existing building on the SC8 site earlier this month. We expect to deliver Phase 1 consisting of 58,000 square feet of datacenter capacity during the third quarter of 2019. In Denver, we delivered 15,600 square feet of capacity in DE1 or capacity in the downtown area remains constrained. We have seen good demand in Denver. Finally, we completed 18,000 square feet of additional capacity in NY2 in Chicago. In summary, we are pleased with the quarter and we are grateful for the colleagues who drive our success. I remain optimistic about our future opportunity, reflecting our solid position in great markets with large numbers of dynamic enterprises, large populations of consumers of content, numerous sophisticated customers of cloud, analytics, and similar data products, and a good pipeline of capacity growth for the intermediate term. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith : Thanks, Paul. Our new and expansion leasing activity was again driven by our core retail co-location group, which accounted for approximately 95% of leases signed in the quarter. We also had a good quarter in the scale co-location category, including a sizable expansion of existing enterprise customer. In total, we executed 143 new and expansion leases, totaling $10.4 million in net annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 65,000 net rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $178 per square foot, offset by near-term reduction in reservation fees. As it relates to portfolio wide pricing, on a per kilowatt basis, Q2 new and expansion pricing was approximately 3% above the trailing 12-month average, with variation by market similar to what we saw in Q1. We continue to focus on attracting high-quality new logos to our portfolio, signing 28 this quarter, which accounted for 10% of net annualized GAAP rent signed. Our well-established campuses are cloud-enabled networked datacenters continue to be a magnet for enterprises, with this vertical representing 65% of annualized GAAP rents signed from new logos. Among our new enterprise logos, our next generation networking technologies company [indiscernible] solutions. We also signed two large West Coast based health and social services agencies, Lifelong Medical and the [technical difficulty]. In the education vertical, we signed St. Johns University and Udemy, a leading online college level learning platform. Further, we had five IT solutions and services companies joining our ecosystem, including Lighthouse [ph], a Fortune 500 information technology, engineering, and science solutions provider. Our strong organic growth reflects the continued expansion of existing customers across our portfolio, which accounted for 90% of annualized GAAP rents on Q2, including enterprise customer that expanded its corporate with us in Los Angeles, discussed earlier. In Denver, we also signed an expansion with a large social media company, who will be deploying its peering exchange serving in the Rocky Mountain region with us. Turning now to our vertical mix, networking cloud customers accounted for 17% and 19% of annualized GAAP rents signed respectively. The network vertical had a very strong quarter with a high overall transaction count and six new logos signed, including Pilot Fiber, an Internet service provider that will deploy with us in four markets to support its growing footprint. We signed six new deployments from international networks, reflecting the continued strength and value of our ecosystem, with two of those international providers deploying at our Reston campus. Additionally, one of the world's largest telecom companies selected CorSite in Virginia and Denver for significant deployment over its corporate infrastructure directly linking it to our cloud on rents, improving its performance as it moves to a hybrid cloud architecture for its internal IT needs. The cloud vertical continued to perform well, adding four new logos, including cybersecurity and intelligence provider. Additionally, a large data based cloud and content provider expanded its footprint in Santa Clara to support the growth of one of its existing customers. Our enterprise vertical accounted for 64% of annualized GAAP rents signed, driven by a Fortune 500 customer that exercised its expansion option in anticipation of demand for its cloud platform in Los Angeles. In addition, several other existing customers expanded, including the new deployment with one of the fastest-growing demand side platforms in digital advertising, which shows CoreSite's first production environment and data analytics platform due to the ability to achieve scalability, high density and performance. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases were Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Northern Virginia, and New York, New Jersey, collectively representing 89% of annualized GAAP rents signed. Leasing on the Bay area was weighted towards expansion of existing customers in terms of verticals, cloud customers, leasing activity including a new logo in Prismo Systems, which is a local provider of software for enterprise digital security operations. New enterprise deployments included the signing by Stamps.com. Demand in Los Angeles was solid, with strength in the enterprise vertical, followed by network and cloud deployments. New logo activity was well-distributed among the verticals, and includes a network from LiveCom Limited, a Chinese provider of satellite-based voice services. In Northern Virginia, leasing was driven by the network vertical with deployments across all of our buildings in the market, and two networks deposited VA3 Phase 1A. Lastly, in New York New Jersey, demand continue to by led by enterprise customers, including four new logos; healthcare and media/gaming remain the primary demand drivers in this market along with financial services. In addition, a leading public power provider expanded its footprint at NY1. In summary, we are pleased with Q2 sales. Going forward, we will continue to focus on generating profitable organic growth, attracting high-quality new logos to our portfolio, and delivering incremental value to our customers as we grow our ecosystem and footprint. I will now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. Our Q2 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of $136.4 million, a 5.3% increase on a sequential quarter basis, and a 15.7% increase year-over-year. Datacenter revenue consisting of rental revenue, power revenue, and tenant reimbursements contributed $116.1 million to operating revenues, an increase of 5.6% on the sequential quarter basis and 16.6% year-over-year. Interconnection services contributed $17.4 million to operating revenues, an increase of 5.2% on a sequential quarter basis, and 13.7% year-over-year. Excluding U.S. Colo interconnection revenue, Q2 interconnection revenue grew 3.5% sequentially and 11.8% year-over-year. Turning to FFO; we reported $1.28 per diluted share in unit, up 0.8% on a sequential quarter basis and 16.4% year-over-year. As you think about sequential FFO growth in Q3, there are a few moving pieces to keep in mind as it relates to your models. First, in Q3 we usually have seasonally higher power cost, amounting to approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share. Second, as a result of the renewal and expansion of our lease at LA1, we expect an increase of approximately a penny per share in our rent expense. And third, we anticipate increases in our property taxes of about a penny per share. AFFO declined 0.5% sequentially, primarily due to higher interest expense and capitalized leasing commissions, reflecting an increased mix of scale, co-location leasing in Q2. On a year-over-year basis, AFFO increased 30.5% reflecting the growth in the operating portfolio and lower levels of recurring capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA of $74.9 million increased 2.7% sequentially and 15.5% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the trailing 12 months ended Q2 2018 was 54.7%, and remains in line with our expectations and our guidance for the full-year. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $5.4 million or 3.9% of total operating revenues, up 20 basis points year-over-year. General and administration expenses were $10.3 million or 7.5% of total operating revenues, down 60 basis points year-over-year. Both amounts are in line as a percent of revenue to our expectations for the full-year. Q2 same-store turnkey datacenter occupancy increased 430 basis points to 89.9% from 85.6% in the second quarter of 2017. Sequentially same-store turnkey datacenter occupancy increased 80 basis points. Additionally, same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 1.7% sequentially, and 8.3% year-over-year to $1,483. We renewed approximately 140,000 total square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $137 per square foot. Our renewed pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 2.8% on a cash basis and 5.7% on a GAAP basis. Year-to-date, our cash mark-to-market growth of 4.2% is in line with our guidance for the full-year. Churn was 1.3% and we continue to expect churn for the year to be in the 6% to 8% range. As you may recall, within our annual churn guidance, we expected a 200 basis points impact related to a specific customer move out in Q4. With increased visibility related to this specific customer, we now expect approximately 70 basis points of churn in Q3 with the remainder in Q4. We commenced 34,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $192 per square foot, which represents $6.5 million of annualized GAAP rent. Turning to backlog, projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $9.9 million at June 30, 2018. On a cash basis, our backlog was $20.9 million. We expect approximately 42% of the GAAP backlog to commence during the second-half of 2018, with the remainder expected to commence during the first-half of 2019. We ended the quarter with our stabilized datacenter occupancy at 93%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to two computer rooms moving from the pre-stabilized pool to the stabilized pool. We have a total of 161,000 square feet of datacenter capacity and various stages of development across the portfolio. At the end of the second quarter, we had invested $56.3 million of the estimated $274.4 million required for these projects. Those buildings also include space for quick future construction of an additional 167,000 square feet of datacenter capacity. Turning to our balance sheet, our ratio of net principal debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 3.5 times, in line with the prior quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, we had $336 million of total liquidity consisting of available cash and capacity on our revolving credit facility. In closing, I would like to address our updated guidance for 2018. I would remind you that our guidance reflects our current view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factor in changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. As detailed on page 23 of our Q2 earnings supplemental, our guidance updated for 2018 is as follows : total operating revenue is now estimated to be $537 million to $547 million compared to the previous range of $535 million to $545 million. Based on our year-to-date commencements of $22.7 million and our expectation for timing of commencements in our backlog, we now expect commencements for the full-year to be closer to $36 million to $38 million in annualized GAAP rent, compared to our original guidance of $40 million. As Paul mentioned, keep in mind that the timing of future construction deliveries and related leasing is driven in large part by each locality's permitting process. While the lower level of commencements should not have a material impact on 2018 earnings, realization of incremental revenue in 2019 will depend on the timing of permitting and subsequent completion dates for SV8, LA3, and CH2. So far the municipal approval processes are tracking at the slower end of our estimates. Adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to be $293 million to $298 million, an increase of $2 million based on the midpoint of current and previous guidance. FFO is estimated to be $5 to $5.08 per share in OP unit. This midpoint of $5.04 per share represents an increase of $0.06 per share or 1.2% from the previous guidance. The increase in our FFO guidance also reflects lower than expected interest expense as a result of better-than-anticipated execution on the debt financing transactions completed in April. As it relates to our guidance for capital expenditures, we are increasing the total expected investment to a range of $280 million to $310 million, from the previous range of $250 million to $300 million. The increase is related to our outlook for datacenter expansion primarily related to commencement of construction at SV8 and LA2, which we now expect to be $258 million to $273 million compared to the prior range of $228 million to $253 million. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to first just clarify something, Jeff, if you could, in the guidance. Can you help me understand just the difference between the upward adjustment in the operating revenues in the context of the downward adjustment in the commencements? Jeff Finnin : You bet. Really, Jordan, it's the increase in revenues is really attributable to two things. And that's really related to the timing of the commencements, and it's also related to the product mix, predominantly power. So as you think about commencements, even though we've taken them down slightly for the full-year, the first-half we experienced slightly higher than what we anticipated in terms of those commencements, so it led to higher revenue that we're expecting for the rest of the year. And then in terms of the profitability of the dollars, our product mix also helped contribute to most of that increase in revenue basically flowing down through adjusted EBITDA and to FFO. And then the other item that I mentioned in my prepared remarks really relates to just interest expense, which is we're doing better than what we anticipated in our original guidance. So those are really the three pieces that drive the $0.06 increase, but the revenue is really driven by timing of commencements and the product mix. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then in terms of product mix, is it -- it sounds like you mentioned power revenues. You saw a greater mix of breakered-amp type requirements or\u2026 Jeff Finnin : That's exactly right. A greater proportion of the breakered product model than what we had anticipated. Jordan Sadler : And can you expand on that a little bit. It was sort of an area of questioning I was curious about in terms of what you're seeing. Maybe that's better for Steve, trend-wise in terms of customer requirements. Are they -- it seems like they're still receptive, obviously to the breakered-amp product, but are you seeing more pushback and are more people looking for metered power solutions today or no? Jeff Finnin : Let me just give you what the numbers are telling us historically and then Steve can give you a little commentary in terms of what the customers are seeing and saying. But if you just look at our product mix of power revenue today, that composition equals -- about 55% is on our breakered model and about 45% on our metered model. And that's been fairly consistent over the past several quarters. And so to date, we haven't seen a significant degradation of that breakered power model, but Steve can give you some commentary related to the conversations with customers. Steve Smith : Yes, sure, thanks, Jeff. Hey, Jordan. Yes. As it relates to the overall mix and the, I guess, adoption of the breakered model, the core retail co-location space is a big focus for us. So it has been and we talked about that in the prepared remarks as well. And the bulk of those customers are typically buying at the size level and in the markets and the buildings where breakered is the predominant product that those customers are buying. It gives them better predictability around their costs and also gives us a better view into how we distribute power across the buildings. So overall, that's -- I think, just speaks to the health of our business in that core area of retail collocation and those hybrid type of deployments that we're seeing from those enterprise customers. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then Steve, lastly, while I have you, yes, I was curious -- Jeff talked about, I guess, the pace of permitting and titling, or maybe you know planning, moving a little bit slower on some of the builds. I'm kind of curious if that is at all affecting your ability on the pre-leasing side or basically, you know, what you're seeing on that -- on the pipeline for people who are interested in a possible pre-lease for some of those developments? Steve Smith : Well from a overall pipeline perspective, if the pipeline continues to be healthy and you know, as you look at just the overall data growth in the market in general and just technology adoption, the pipeline does remain healthy. I think that the pre-leasing window is probably shorter than it's been historically, because there's more inventory that's available on the market. But at the same time you still see a healthy amount of pipeline that we feel like can time out well with when those commencements happen. So overall, it doesn't seem to be impacting us overall. Paul Szurek : Jordan, I just would add -- this is Paul. We are still in the window of expectations for receiving permits that we signaled previously, just at the slower end of that and that's 100% reflected on the fact that we're building an infill market much stricter permitting processes, generally understaffed government agencies. In the long-term that creates a lot of the value in these markets, but it does make the short-term permitting harder to predict. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Thank you. Paul Szurek : Thanks, Jordan. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Robert Gutman : Yes, thanks for taking the question. So it seems like the smaller footprint leasing under a 1,000 was accelerated a bit off of last quarter. Just wondering, you seeing any -- you know, what's underlying that in terms of market demand last quarter versus this quarter in that category? And was the scale stuff, did you say it was driven by one customer in particular, the rise there to $4.6 million from $2.6 million last quarter? Paul Szurek : Yes, I'll just speak to the overall demand aspects of the less than 1,000 square feet there first, I guess. I wouldn't say that I've seen any major shifts in that space, in that market. As I mentioned earlier, it's a continued focus for the company, our marketing team and our overall sales team to try to bring in those customers, the majority of which are enterprises that are looking to deploy and take advantage of the many networks and cloud on-ramps that we have in our datacenters. So overall, I'd say the trend is positive as more enterprises continue to adopt collocation in hybrid type of environments. But I wouldn't point to anything that says that anything dramatic has changed. As it relates to the larger scale leases, Jeff has probably more detail on the numbers there, but\u2026 Jeff Finnin : Yes. Yes, Rob, it was driven by -- there's a handful of customers in that second bucket and obviously one was a little bit on the larger side, but without going into any specifics around customer individual customer is about what we can tell you to. Robert Gutman : Okay, great. Thanks. Paul Szurek : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. The revenue per cabinet up I think it was up 8% pretty strong growth there just wondering if there's anything worth calling out in the sustainability of that going forward. And also just more broadly, Paul, just curious if you can give us your current thinking on the importance of market expansion having a global footprint, how that may or may not have changed in terms of your thinking over the last I guess since beginning of the year. Thanks. Paul Szurek : Colby, let me address your first question really when you look at that MRR per cabi growth, what we saw this quarter is very consistent with what we've seen in the past several quarters which is the interconnection revenue in the power revenue are really driving the majority of that increase, So for instance interconnection revenue in our same-store on a per cabi basis was up 10% and power was up 13%. Overall contributing to the 8.3% increase we saw year-over-year and as we look at the second-half of the year I would tell you that we would anticipate that MRR per cabi growth to be at the mid to higher single digits consistent with what we saw the first two quarters of 2018 to give you some idea of what we expect. Steve Smith : And then, Colby, expanding to new markets would be a nice to have not a need to have we have plenty of opportunity in the markets where we are and frankly building out the campuses in the scale, in the customer ecosystems is a really good way to drive value both for customers and for shareholders. We do continue to look at other markets. If we -- where we can enter and follow our existing business model. Internationally our views have not changed on that over the course of the year, we continue to have very good traction with non-U.S. customers attracted to our campus communities and increasing amount of our customers both new and old who are able to go international via other mechanisms than been established in their own data centers in other places. Cloud, content, delivery and things like that so I think we provide a very good service to those customers by making it easier for them to do that within our data centers that have all the companies in the utilities they need in order to do that. Colby Synesael : Okay, thank you. Paul Szurek : Thanks, Colby. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great, thank you. I want to dig into what factors inflation may be having in its potential impact on development yields what are you seeing your posts are in raw materials and labor and your outlook, you believe it kind of pass it along you did see that play into the increase CapEx for SB8 LA2? Thanks. Paul Szurek : Not really LA2, a little bit in SB8 labor costs in the North California market are have increased materials costs have increased a bit, I'm sure you all know what's going on in the background there. But with all that and as Steve mentioned in his prepared comments pricing continues to be pretty strong. We were actually 3% above our trailing 12 months average on a per kilowatt basis and so we still expect to achieve or exceed our targeted returns on investment that we've previously talked about, so yes you got to be you have to pay more attention to your development planning and design in cost Brian Warren and his team are doing a good job with that and we think everything will work out pretty well. Frank Louthan : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Nick Del Deo : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, the guidance clarification for Jeff that you mentioned the timing of commencements and product mix for the revenue guidance change, how much should be U.S. Colo acquisition plan to that if I remember correctly last quarter you didn't include it and it was going to be worth a couple million bucks this year? Jeff Finnin : Yes, Nick what we're seeing from U.S. Colo is obviously it's contributing some to our revenues and has played in part to some of what we're seeing with the results and ultimately guidance. To date, U.S Colo contributed about for the second quarter they contribute about a $1 million of revenue in the quarter and that gives you some idea in terms of its contribution. Nick Del Deo : Okay, then your maybe one bigger picture question, do you guys have any interest in developing your own SDN offering the way I can access or is that not something that makes sense for you? Paul Szurek : So there's lot of different flavors of how companies can service customer desire for more nimbleness and how they provision aspects of their network. We recently pushed through and upgrade our open cloud exchange which provides a lot of that functionality more options for customers a broader range of choices they can make a greater API integration to other platforms and that's a utility that we can continue to evolve to give customers more control and flexibility about have a provision both cloud and network. Nick Del Deo : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you for the question. Jeff, you made a comment earlier about 3Q, 2018 realizing higher power costs and I just want to understand what is driving that across your customer workloads and install bases like what is fundamentally happening around that time in the seasonality? Paul Szurek : It's really not attributable to our customer workload. Sami it's really attributable to the rates that we receive from our power providers that's is something that happens every year due to the increased volumes of power consumption throughout the markets not just from data centers obviously just from the U.S. consumption in general and that's just very common we see it every year and it's about $0.01 to $0.02 per share in the third quarter is what we would consider to see? Sami Badri : Got it and then the next question is more to do with how we should be thinking about modeling and the dividend and dividend growth rate over time and you've increased it now a couple times the last two years probably a little bit faster than what some people are already modeling should we think about modeling an adjustment like that payout ratio against the dividends like maybe like close maybe just give us an idea on how we should be doing is like how should we think about this in the next two years as far as like total dividend? Paul Szurek : Yes, I think that the best way to look at that Sami as if you look at our payout ratio and just take the second quarter of 2018 and this is provided on page nine of our supplemental You can see that our payout is about 82% of our trailing 12 month FFO and it's about 91% of our trailing 12 month AFFO. I don't anticipate those increasing meaningfully there already at the fairly at the high level if they move it would be very at the margin at best, so what really is going to drive that growth is really growth in our cash flow which as we've talked in the past is really driven by what we define as cash flow that is distributable to our common equity holders, which is AFFO last nonrecurring capital. All of that's disclosed in the way in our supplemental but that's really the way we manage around our dividend increases is to monitor increases and CFDCE today and what we think it will do prospectively. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Paul Szurek : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead. Eric Rasmussen : Yes, hi, thanks for taking the questions. So circling back with the permitting the patients seem to be slowing down but still kind of within the range but what has fundamentally changes it really just more of the supply and more deals kind of trying to be put through the system and then do you continue to see this as a headwind and are do you think that at some point things can free up a little bit and have a follow-up? Paul Szurek : So honestly, I don't think there's any new news here within the ranges of what we said before and it's pretty typical for these types of permitting environments in fact I again I want to give credit to our development and construction team for being very proactive and getting us within the ranges that we've originally set, just to give you some historical perspective if you go back to VA2 which we built on land that we already own before we started the special exception, design and construction process we started that in early 2011 we're not able to bring new capacity on until the first quarter of 2015 so about four years, every project that we've got going on right now is tracking to about 50% of that timeline, so again not an unusual situation in many of these markets it just is what it is and it makes the asset more viable going forward. Jeff Finnin : Eric, one thing that I will point out to just because I think it's important as you and others think about models for 2019 because obviously we've had three ground up developments that we're working as Paul alluded too another thing I think I would add as you saw we put us under construction this quarter and so we have better visibility into the timing we've disclosed that at this point as being sometime in Q3, 2019 as when we think will be completed with that first phase. As you think about the other two construction projects that we're working on LA3 and CH2 We've always said that we always thought LA3 would be expected to be completed by sometime in the back half of 2019. And we still expect it to be in late 2019 but as Paul alluded to subject to what happened on the permitting process as it relates to CH2 we've always been saying it sometime probably late 2019 early 2020 as we sit here today I think it's probably leaning towards more early 2020 before that would get completed again tracking towards the latter part of our original estimate, so just think about that fact of that and as you guys model 2019. Eric Rasmussen : Thanks. That's helpful and then just around easy seems to be a lot of variability on your larger Colo deals. The prior two quarters, numbers were either were down or lower but then you've seen a meaningful improvement this quarter it speak to maybe that is it just the nature of this business can explain the variances and maybe your expectations for these larger deals? Steve Smith : Yes, this is Steve that for you it is lumpy as you've seen in our results and I think we kind of call that out as the expectation both in prior calls as well as going forward. We do look to really be disciplined on how we approach that marketplace and make sure that those leases that we're signing on that larger scale are additive and complement our ecosystem, so there's a lot of hyperscale deals that are going on out there that are probably not a great fit for us. Given the economics that are associated with it and whether or not they value the ecosystem of our customers as well as networks and other on ramps and so making sure that we get those right customers and right deployments. Doesn't happen every day but there is still a good pipeline of those type of deployments that are out there. Eric Rasmussen : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from John Peterson which Jefferies and Company. Please go ahead. John Peterson : Great, thanks. So the pricing on new leases this quarter was a little below average from recent quarters but obviously you guys had one or two large scale deals I'm just kind of curious if you could break maybe out the different product types smaller leases, skill side leases. I mean how are rents trending and then maybe even a little more specifically on the scale side you seen rents trend on down like we're seeing with some of these like really huge hyper scale deals, how you guys usually plan? Paul Szurek : So John, let me let me take a stab at that and Steve and Jeff can jump in it if I omit anything. We tried to give both space and power pricing because both components play into our business and with higher density step the power side of it actually tends to be more meaningful and as you saw from Steve's comments on a per kilowatt basis our pricing was 3%, the trailing twelve months. We don't break out pricing by market and by product because quite honestly that just gives away too much competitive information. But we do look at that internally and we feel good about where the trends are as Steve said it's up in some markets down and some others but overall it's up and as it relates to scale leasing, we tend to focus on those scale leasing opportunities that need to retail co-location ecosystem or the network ecosystem. There's more value to those types of scale opportunities in our data centers and so far we're seeing that pricing hold up pretty well although that does vary by market. John Peterson : Okay, thank you. And then maybe a question for Jeff on the balance sheet, I mean, just thinking about your capital needs between now and the end of the year and maybe into 2019, I guess what sort of financing needs do you have I guess how does the preferred market look today versus maybe some unsecured debt and then also with the permit in process I guess slowing down some of these developments in LA, Santa Clara, and Chicago, does that kind of push out I guess your capital needs? And a little bit trying to think about how we should be modeling from that perspective? Jeff Finnin : Sure. Yes, John, I think when you look at the guidance, we updated related to our CapEx spend, you can see the midpoint went up by about $20 million so kind of $295 million is what we are currently guiding to in terms of total CapEx spend. We spend $120 million in the first-half, which means you will see some acceleration spend in the second-half of the year upwards around $175 million, just given what our total liquidity is, I don't think we need to do anything from a financing perspective through the end of this year and so there is no need to do it. Having said that, it is something we watch closely to see whether or not there is any type of movements or changes in the markets that we might want to take advantage of. But as we sit here today if I had to bend, I would say I can't imagine doing something by the end of the year, it's probably be more of a first quarter maybe early Q2 2019 type of event unless something changes significantly from a pricing perspective that we might want to capture before the end of the year. Paul Szurek : I would only add that given our low leverage, I don't think we would tap the preferred market. Jonathan Atkin : All right, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Choe with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Richard Choe : Hi, I wanted to ask about the churn event in 4Q, so far rental revenue has been growing on a dollar basis at a very nice rate, how should we think about the impact of that churn event and then going into '19, what the quarterly impact will be? Jeff Finnin : Richard, let me see if I can address that and add any additional commentary. So we updated our guidance this quarter related to that particular churn event and just given some incremental visibility we have, we know that that particular customer is going to churn about 70 basis points of their deployment in the third quarter and we are estimating the remaining 130 basis points of churn in the fourth quarter. So I'm not sure I could add any more commentary associated with it beyond that other than to say that it's obviously a customer we continue to have conversations with and we will ultimately what they end up during the fourth quarter but at this point we are modeling as if they churn but we don't have perfect visibility into that as we sit here today. Paul Szurek : And Richard that, even that it just puts our churn in our normal historical range year-b-year. Richard Choe : Yes, I appreciate that Paul, I think we typically expect as though we are continuing to expect 6% to 8% churn for the full year of 2018. Paul Szurek : And I guess just some added color I guess there relative to the churn of that customer. The churn that we do expect is on our stronger markets, so as far as the backfilling and more customers in there were bullish on that and optimistic. Richard Choe : So can I take away from that that if the customer didn't churn, churn would be probably lower and as probably could be quickly backfilled? Paul Szurek : I think that's a good way to look at it, yes. Richard Choe : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ari Klein from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ari Klein : Hi, thanks. Maybe just following up on that last question, what kind of interconnection footprint does that customer that's churning have? And then, maybe turning to the -- to the scale leasing opportunities, how does that compare to, how do the pipeline for that compare to maybe a year ago and do you expect that to continue to grow? Paul Szurek : Yes, as far as the interconnection footprint typically on those larger leases we eventually have interconnection as less than you would see on a couple of smaller deployments where you look at it on our either per square footage basis or on a per kilowatt basis. I don't have the specifics in front of me and so that's individual customer, I'm not sure we will disclose that anyway, but not a material amount I guess it's probably the easiest way to put it in this great scheme of things is it relates to our interconnection landscape. As you think about scale leasing, as I mentioned before it's -- it is lumpy as far as the deals that we write, the overall pipeline is still very healthy as I mentioned earlier and the forecast as we look towards it is optimistic, it's just a matter of aligning those key deployments that also again value our ecosystem or looking to take advantage of it but also are willing to essential pay for it. There are some lower cost providers out there that don't offer that same value and if they are looking for just space, power and cooling and don't value that, it's probably not a great fit for us. So there is a lot of kilowatts that are being sold out there that's probably on a great fit for us and how we align that and be disciplined around our pricing and outfits and our ecosystem is the game we play. So overall we are optimistic and it looks possible. Ari Klein : And regarding the extended development timelines, how should we think about CapEx into next year, can it be higher than 2018? Paul Szurek : Yes, Ari, as you think about it typically when we have ground up development starts like what we would expect to see what LA3 in 2019 that's typically going to drive CapEx at the higher [technical difficulty] than we would normally see. Without giving you some specific numbers, I would just anticipate it. I wouldn't see it decreasing meaningfully from what we expect for this year, let's just say that. I would expect it to be a little bit elevated like what we saw again this year. Ari Klein : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Lukas Hartwich : Hi, guys. Just one from me as computing seems to kind of continue with positive momentum, what sort of opportunity do you think that presents for CoreSite? Steve Smith : Yes, I will dive in on that one. This is Steve, I think it's a great opportunity for us and it continues to -- you continue to see innovation in the marketplace that just turn the new businesses into global players, traditional brick and mortar type of businesses are being put on their head and now being done in more electronic ways that require low latency and all those are being deployed at the edge, a lot of round artificial intelligence as well as the emergence of 5G on the mobile front all that leads to the critical need to improve speeds of the end-user which means edge computing. So we feel like we are well positioned for that because that requires interconnection and networks to make that happen and we feel like we have a great model and in terms of both the interconnection footprint that we have as well as the ability to support some of those kind of I would call like kind of mid scale type of deployments that are typically come along with us, those edge type of environments. Lukas Hartwich : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great, thanks. I will just ask one. I know you said last quarter you are operating it is slightly lower level of sellable inventory that you had historically, you could just update us on where you sit today, you inventory levels we look out towards the second-half to 2018 and whether I need potential capacity constraints could impact your ability to do continue your momentum with scale leasing over the course of the year? Thanks. Paul Szurek : So the good news is that we've restored our sellable inventory to more normal levels. I think we ended the quarter with about 265,000 square feet, a sellable inventory, we actually have -- we completed so far this year a 147,000 square feet. We actually have 161,000 square feet of the initial phases of development in various stages of construction or development and in those buildings we could very quickly have another 167,000 square feet of capacity and we still have some capacity in other markets for expansion. So we feel like we are in good shape when you look back over the last two years, we were. We have one building under construction in July of 2016 and no new land for development and now we've got four projects under construction or in development on new land and all of them are proceeding to pay, so we feel like we've rebuilt the pipeline and although the timing related to permitting is not greatly predictable, it's a matter of short timing and once we get through that the new capacity will come on in a very regular pace. Eric Luebchow : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would like to turn the floor over to Paul Szurek for closing comments. Paul Szurek : Thank you for joining us today. I do want to thank my colleagues for another solid quarter. We are all very fortunate to work with a talented group of people here at CoreSite. I also want to congratulate Steve and Maile Kaiser on their new roles of Chief Revenue Officer and Senior Vice President of Sales respectively, and thank them for taking all those larger roles. I look forward to seeing Steve and Maile can both further drive growth with their broader responsibilities. It is great that this exciting industry and our organizational ethos combine to enable us to provide these kinds of growth opportunities for our team. We look forward to the future. I hope you all have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Derek McCandless, General Counsel. Thank you. Please go ahead. Derek McCandless : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I am joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Federal Securities Laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our web site at CoreSite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I am glad to share our third quarter financial and operating results, as well as to update you on our markets and development activity. Financial results for the third quarter reflect revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and FFO per share each increasing 13% year-over-year. Regarding our internal growth, we had good performance across substantially all measurements, including solid cash rent growth on renewals and 7% year-over-year growth in same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent. Sales performance was mixed in the third quarter. Our core retail colocation sales were $5.1 million of annualized GAAP rent, consistent with our trailing 12-month average. Pricing overall for the quarter was up approximately 5% above average on a per kilowatt basis. Our consorted efforts to focus on quality deployments and strong pricing has paid off in this area. Scale coloation leasing was on the low end, resulting in total sales of retail and scale of $6.1 million. We believe scale leasing this quarter was primarily influenced by two factors we have mentioned before; smaller than normal inventory of contiguous space in our major markets, which is being remedied by the new buildings, we expect to bring on line beginning in 2019 and the normal lumpiness and scale leasing after which we are encouraged based on current pipeline and utilization trends we see in our data centers. During the quarter, we had a healthy balance of organic capacity expansions by existing customers coupled with our strong quarter in number and quality of new logo acquisitions. The annualized GAAP rent signed by the 27 new logos in Q3 increased 11.2% compared to the trailing 12-month average. The number of kilowatts licensed increase 15.4% and the average lease rent increased by 25.3%. We are optimistic about the demand trends we are seeing in our markets and believe supply is generally in balance with demand. We view Santa Clara as the most supply constrained and Northern Virginia as the least supply constrained. We still like the Northern Virginia market due to the overall high demand of our network and cloud dense campus, and the diversity we provide in Reston as compared to our peers in Ashburn. However, we believe pricing on undifferentiated or marginally differentiated large scale deployments have declined in Northern Virginia over the last 12 to 18 months, which will likely impact our pre-release economics to our new building at VA3 We continue to make good progress on construction of our new VA3 building and are likely to deliver an additional 6 megawatts of capacity in Q1 2019. In Santa Clara, construction on SV8 is progressing and we expect to deliver the 6 megawatts of Phase 1 during the third quarter of 2019. CH2 and LA3 are progressing through the permitting phases as expected consistent with our comments from last quarter we expect LA3 Phase 1 will be complete around year end 2019 and CH2 Phase 1 in early 2020, subject to the uncertain timing of the permitting process in these markets. Please keep in mind, all our projects are ground-up developments, which take longer to deploy the first phase of supply but allow us to build subsequent phases more quickly. As we've discussed on previous calls, we expect 2019 to be a transition year for us. We expect to enter the year with leasable capacity at a low level compared to our historical norms, and to end the year with leasable capacity, plus quickly developable incremental capacity consistent with the higher levels available to us at the end of 2015. This new capacity should enable us to reaccelerate growth moving from 2019 to 2020 and beyond. In summary, it was a solid transition quarter as we prepare for the new capacity in our construction pipeline, and we have an excellent group of colleagues to drive our success. Demand for and stickiness of data center requirements that are network and cloud-enabled in large metro edge markets continues to be strong. I remain optimistic about our future opportunities, reflecting our solid position in great markets with large numbers of dynamic enterprises, consumers of content and sophisticated customers of cloud, analytics and similar data products. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith : Thanks Paul. Our new and expansion leasing activity was again driven by our core retail colocation product, which accounted for approximately 84% of GAAP rent signed in the quarter. In total, we executed 120 new and expansion leases totaling $6.1 million in net annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 31,000 net rentable square feet and average GAAP rate of $193 per square foot. As Paul mentioned, portfolio-wide pricing on a per kilowatt basis was 5% above our trailing 12-month average. This is noteworthy considering Boston was among our top three markets in terms of annualized GAAP rent signed for the first time in several quarters. We saw good traction in attracting high quality new logos for our portfolio, signing 27 this quarter, which accounted for 19% of net annualized GAAP rent signed. Our well-established campuses or cloud enabled networked dense datacenters continues to be a magnet for enterprises, with this vertical representing 61% of the annualized GAAP rents signed from new logos. Among our new enterprise logos, our global leader in financial technology and payment processing, our leading network security provider, our top-tier member of the education vertical, a global provider of online games, and as American luxury retailer. In addition to new logo growth, we again experienced organic growth from our expansion of existing customers across our portfolio, which accounted for 81% of annualized GAAP rent signed in Q3. During the quarter, our major public cloud providers expanded it on-rents with us in both our Denver and Los Angeles markets. A global web conferencing provider expanded with us in the Bay area a [indiscernible] company expanded with us in two additional markets. Turning to our vertical mix, networking cloud customers accounted for 25% and 35% of annualized GAAP rents signed respectively. The network vertical had a very good quarter with high overall transaction count and seven new logos signed, including three international network nodes, which speaks to our continued appeal with the international environment. We also signed a subsea cable deployment, connecting the consortium of telecos and major content players between Los Angeles and Asia Pacific markets. The cloud vertical continued to perform well, adding four new logos, including an industry leading digital certificate provider, as well as the expansion of two public cloud-on rents in Denver and Los Angeles that were discussed earlier. Our enterprise vertical accounted for 40% of annualized GAAP rents signed, driven by a leading ERP as a service software provider, [indiscernible] on a global public cloud that expanded with us an existing site and into new market. In addition, several other existing customers expanded, including the member of the Fortune 500 seeking direct access to three other cloud on-rents we provide in the San Clara market and a bunch of ecommerce companies expansion in Boston. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed in new and expansion leases were Boston, Los Angeles, Northern Virginia, and Silicon Valley. Collectively new and expansion leases in these four markets represented 86% of annualized GAAP rents signed. Demand in Boston was elevated this quarter as couple of lease new capacity we brought to the market in the fourth quarter of 2017. A large ecommerce company chose to expand with us into this new capacity, provided flexibility and a clear path for us continued future growth and expansion in market. Demand in Los Angeles was solid, with strength in the network vertical, followed by enterprise and cloud deployments. New logo activity included seven new customers which are well distributed among the verticals. Northern Virginia continues to be our most competitive market with substantial amounts of undifferentiated offerings. However, this product typically does not impact our competitiveness relative to latency, network and cloud-oriented used cases. Hence lease in this market was led by enterprise customers with seven new logos. With regard to large scale leasing, we look forward to presenting to the market additional capacity become available in early 2019. Finally, leasing volume was low in the Bay Area as a result of our tense supply in this market. The cloud vertical led our other verticals with 81% of new and expansion GAAP rent signed in the market. In summary, we are encouraged by the execution of sales in our core retail colocation product during the third quarter. However, we look to improve our leasing of scale deployment as additional capacity becomes available. We are also pleased with the incremental changes we continue to make in our sales execution and product features as a result of the sales and revenue leadership changes we announced last quarter. Going forward, we will continue to focus on generating profitable organic growth, attracting high quality new logos for portfolio and delivering incremental value to our customers as we grow our ecosystem and footprint. I will now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Steve, and hello everyone. Our Q3 financial performance resulted in total operating revenues of $139.2 million, a 2% increase on a sequential quarter basis and a 13.1% increase year-over-year. Our rent, power and related revenue contributed $118.6 million to operating revenues, an increase of 2.1% on a sequential quarter basis and 14.1% year-over-year. And our connection services contributed $17.7 million to operating revenues, an increase of 1.6% on a sequential quarter basis and 9.3% year-over-year. Turning to FFO, we reported $1.25 per diluted share and unit, down 2.3% on a sequential quarter basis and up 13.6% year-over-year. As a reminder, last quarter we highlighted a couple items that would impact our sequential FFO growth in Q3. First was seasonally higher power costs, which amounted to $0.03 per share, and seconds primarily as a result of the renewal and expansion of our lease at LA1, rent expense increased by $800,000 or nearly $0.02. Partially offsetting these items were two items that provided a benefit of approximately $0.02 per share. The first being a lease termination fee and the second being incremental revenue related to the build out of a customer's deployment. AFFO increased 1.6% sequentially and 19.4% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the growth in the operating portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA of $73.8 million decreased 1.4% sequentially and increased 13.1% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the trailing 12 months ended Q3 2018 was 54.7% and remains in line with our expectations and our guidance for the full year. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $5.2 million or 3.7% of total operating revenues in line year-over-year. General and administrative expenses were $10.1 million or 7.2% of total operating revenues, down 70 basis points year-over-year. Both amounts are in line as a percentage of revenue with our expectations for the full year. Q3 same-store turnkey datacenter occupancy increased 490 basis points to 90.1% from 85.2% in the third quarter of 2017. Sequentially, same-store turnkey datacenter occupancy increased 20 basis points. Additionally, same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year to $1,513. We renewed approximately 98,000 total square feet at an annualized GAAP rate of $166 per square foot. Our renewal pricing reflects mark-to-market growth of 3.2% on a cash basis and 5.8% on a GAAP basis. Year-to-date, our cash mark-to-market growth of 3.9% is in line with our guidance for the full year. Churn with 2.5%, inclusive of 70 basis points of churn from the single customer we mentioned last quarter. We anticipate the same customer to churn up to a 100 basis points of additional capacity in Q4 2018, including churn from this specific customer and our year-to-date churn of 5.7%. We expect churn for the year to be at the higher end of the 6% to 8% guidance range. We commenced 37,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $160 per square foot, which represents $5.9 million of annualized GAAP rent. Turning to backlog, projected annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases was $10.2 million at September 30, 2018. On a cash basis, our backlog was $17.5 million. We expect approximately 35% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the fourth quarter, with the remainder expected to commence during the first half of 2019. We continue to have a total of 161,000 square feet of datacenter capacity in various stages of development across the portfolio. As of the end of the third quarter, we had invested $100.7 million of the estimated $281.8 million required to complete these projects, those buildings also includes space for future construction of an additional 167,000 square feet of datacenter capacity. Turning to our balance sheet, a ratio of net principal debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 3.6 times in line with the prior quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, we had $295.9 million of total liquidity, consisting of available cash and capacity on our revolving credit facility. I would now like to address update to 2018 guidance and growth drivers heading into 2019. We are maintaining 2018 guidance related to operating revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share and unit. However, we have updated our expectations together with some visibility into 2019 for the following items. Based on our 2018 year-to-date commencements of $28.6 million, in our expectation for timing of commencements in our backlog we are decreasing are expected commencements for the full year to a range of $33 million to $35 million in annualized GAAP rent compared to our most recent guidance of $36 million to $38 million. As you will recall, we expect Q4 2018 churn to be elevated in the range of 2% to 2.3% depending upon the resolution with our customer I mentioned earlier. Looking ahead into 2019, we also expect elevated churn in the first half of 2019 in the range of 2% to 2.5% in each quarter before returning to more normal levels. We expect 2019 cash rent growth on renewals to be in the range of 2% to 4%. As it relates to our capital expenditures, we expect to finish 2018 towards the low end of our guidance range. In addition, we anticipate an increase in 2019 capital expenditures to $400 million to $450 million depending upon the timing of final permits and approvals. Importantly and further to Paul's comments related to leasable capacity, we anticipate growth capacity in our five largest markets equal to approximately 15% of our total portfolio entering 2019 as compared to 19% when we entered 2018, and our longer term average of approximately 30%. The anticipated development in 2019 should increase this percentage of growth capacity to mid 20% by the beginning of 2020, depending upon future absorption. Due to our elevated capital expenditures in 2019, we anticipate accessing the debt markets for $350 million to $400 million to term out the balance on our credit facility. Given our history with the business and the leverage metrics across the datacenter landscape, we are comfortable modestly increasing our targeted debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 4.5 times. As a result of all of the above and a related timing, we anticipate directional financial results in 2019 and 2020 as follows; revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in the upper single digits for 2019 and low double digits for 2020; FFO per share in unit growth of mid-single digits in 2019 and accelerating into low double digits in 2020. All of these estimates are dependent upon completing in leasing our growth capacity and related capital financing, and our team will continue to work to achieve these growth estimates. We will provide our typical annual guidance related to 2019 in connection with our Q4 call in February. Now, we'd like to open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Jordan Sadler : Thank you, and good morning. I wanted to first take a stab at the pipeline, it sounds like you guys are encouraged by what you are seeing in scale pipeline, but I think you pointed out this quarter was a little bit light there. Is it just a function still of the availability, I think you touched on Paul in your prepared remarks. But just maybe a little bit of color around what you are seeing and why are encouraged? Steve Smith : Hi, Jordan, this is Steve. I think we did covered better enough in our prepared remarks there. We do see the overall pipeline remaining healthy, and I think if you look at the use cases in the marketplace that continue to drive more opportunity for that. And as we mentioned, there is a couple of things. One is, we like to do better in that space. I think we can do better on this thing that we are working on to just operate better there and sell better with the capacity that we do have, but we are a bit capacity constrained at this point and we are looking forward to bring that capacity back in line. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then is there any color around what you're seeing in terms of that pipeline that you talked about being encouraged about, anything either by market or nature and customers? Steve Smith : Well, I think it's more the nature of our strategy and how we are aligned around key metros or across the U.S. and the makeup of our overall strategy really focusing on those latency sensitive network dense type of applications that seem to be more and more prevalent regardless of the line of business, so you think about things like 5G that's rolling out in the market place, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, all of those kind of things drive to more and more edge computing and latency sensitive type of applications and I think we'll just continue to see more of that which fits very well with us. Jordan Sadler : Then, Jeff, could you clarify. I caught your guidance there in the end, was that FFO that you gave growth for 2019 and 2020, upper single and low double digits? Jeff Finnin : Good morning, Jordan. I gave revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for both 2019 and 2020 as well, so let me just clarify and repeat it. Jordan Sadler : Okay, I did hear this. Okay. Jeff Finnin : So, revenue and adjusted EBITDA for 2019 to be upper-single digits and for 2020 to be the low-double digits. For FFO per share and unit, for 2019 mid-single digits and low-double digits in 2020. Jordan Sadler :  Thank you for clarifying that and then just lastly, the churn that you are forecasting into the first half of next year, any additional insight on what's driving that elevation? Jeff Finnin : Yeah, Jordan, primarily it's some of the \u2013 what we typically see related to some of the M&A or end of life type of events you are seeing, some of that being a little bit elevated in the first half of next year. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. David Rodgers : Jeff wanted to follow-up on your comments about CapEx this year, it seems like it's getting pushed a little bit in the next year and thanks for the added color on 2019 CapEx, but without an execution problem in term of maybe not getting more money out this year, because clearly there has been a capacity issue for a while. You think you guys have been a little bit higher on that and pushed as hard you could to get that number as high as possible? Jeff Finnin : No, I wouldn't call it an execution problem Dave. I think Brian Warren in our construction team are pushing this hard as they can and our estimates obviously are dependent upon a lot of things going perfect on the construction side. And so, it's not uncommon to see as you get towards the end of the year, some of that capital spend ultimately moving from Q4 in Q1 just depending upon where they are in the construction cycle. So, that we do see that periodically and then obviously we provided some additional commentary around what we expect for 2019 again to be elevated largely due to the ground up development that we have in the queue and that we'll expect it to beached out on light this year or early next year. David Rodgers : Thanks for that. Paul, in your comments you talked about impacting a return at VA3, can you just dive a little bit further into that? Was that more a function of maybe how you know anticipate leasing that asset? Is that purely just a function of the market with no change in your view on what you want to do with VA3, but maybe some added color will be helpful. Paul Szurek : Yes, mostly just market and you know what pricing for scale leases has done is Northern Virginia, our best guess and again we don't have you know as markets don't have perfect transparency, is that it's about 10% to 15% over the last 12 to 18 months for scale leasing. You know we will still \u2013 we believe will still hit our targeted underwriting hurdles that we've \u2013 you know talked about in the past, but it does give us less cushion and room to outperform them as we frequently have in the past. David Rodgers : Okay, that's helpful. Then, I don't know for Steve or maybe like Jeff, in terms of kind of cross connect pricing and volume, you may have discussed this in the prepared comments and I just missed it, but can you kind of talk about that and then maybe what was in the quarter and then kind of how do you anticipate that impacting same store MRR going into 2019. Paul Szurek : Yeah, let me give you a volume growth on our fiber product Dave. Year-over-year that was up about 8.1%, so that gives you some idea on volume. What we also saw which is consistent with what we saw in the earlier parts of 2018 is some continued consolidation of customer deployments predominantly from some previous telecom and telco M&A activity where they are consolidating some of their pops which is leading to some increase in some of those disconnections. Jeff Finnin : And the other thing I would add there, Dave is, as you look at the overall mix and health of the interconnection business, you look at enterprises, connecting to clouds, we've seen that grow significantly in the 30% range, so overall connectivity continues to grow and I think really what you are seeing there predominantly is largely effect of just rationalization of telcos as they have gone through that M&A process. David Rodgers : And the 8.1% that's gross or net? Paul Szurek : That is net. David Rodgers : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Bora Lee : Hi, this is Bora Lee on for Jon. Thanks for taking the question. On the renewal spreads which were positive again on both a cash and GAAP basis, can you talk about the capital intensity associated with those renewal spreads? Jeff Finnin : I would say that in general if you are enquiring in terms of whether or not there is additional capital required upon those renewals, it's very minimal if any. And so there is not a lot of capital intensity on our typical renewals. Bora Lee : Got it. Thank you very much. Jeff Finnin : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Deo with MoffettNathanson. Nick Deo : Hi, thanks for taking my question. You are back to price in Virginia. Are the pricing pressures you talked about for scale deployments leading to pricing for small deployment as well? Are those sufficiently differentiated if they've been surely from those pressures? Steve Smith : Nick, this is Steve. I would say that it's not necessarily size, it's really the application that goes along with it and sometimes that can go alone with size. But you know it's really the use case that goes behind the actual application and how they tie back to either a hybrid multi-cloud type of environment or other network type of deployments that value that low latency connectivity. So, we feel like that gives us a competitive advantage and also gives us a bit more staying power on relative to pricing on the market place. Paul Szurek : Just to add to what Steve said Nick, as you can see from our overall pricing levels it's not affecting the pricing for our core relation colocation product. Nick Deo : Got it. Then maybe turning to development pipeline, what plans do you have currently for the space ultra-development in LA1 and how long would it take to turn that up once you decide to push the button? Paul Szurek : It's primarily there to accommodate the growth need of existing customers as well as additional customers we expect want to come into that ecosystem, and then as you know that's a very special facility. It is not an easy construction building something new in one of these old office building, telecom, hotels, but I believe we expect to be able to bring that online in the second half of next year possibly as early as late Q2. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Two if I may. First off, on the $400 million to $450 million CapEx next year, I assume that goes beyond the project which you \u2013 as you've discussed thus far. In terms of other projects which you have yet to announce, I'm just wondering are you intending to go outside your current markets, or do you think if there is still enough demand I should say in those markets to get you to the growth expectations that you are citing for 2019 and I guess even more so 2020? Then secondly, on leverage, you noted that you are comfortable taking that up to 4.5, would you be expecting to maintain that leverage on a go-forward basis, or if given the opportunity, you would look to potentially do an equity raise to get that back down or simply just deleverage back to your current levels over time? Thank you. Paul Szurek : Let me take the first half of your question Colby. All of the capital that's in our forecast is in our existing markets and projects. VA3, SV8, LA3 and CH2 as well as you know we from time to time we build additional computer rooms in our existing buildings that are already out there. None of that capital is targeted for any additional markets. Jeff Finnin : And Colby in terms of the second question, on the leverage, you know our leverage is something that we look at and have discussions with both internally and with our board, and I can't and I don't anticipate we'll continue to have those discussions, but I do not anticipate bringing that back down to our typical 4.0 level and it's something we'll continue to just monitor as we work through 2019 and 2020. Colby Synesael : Great. And then just, Paul, if I could just go back to the response to that question, when you think about getting back to double digit growth in your model which has historically been call it 50% retail oriented and 50% more scale oriented, when you look at the four or five markets to which you see majority of your growth coming from, is there enough growth in those markets the way that you guys build the way that your business is structured to achieve those or do you have to kind of get more aggressive and for example a scale product or is there another aspect of the story here that needs to get augmented over time? Paul Szurek : I think as we've shown historically and as we've forecast out demand trends, we could achieve those levels of growth we believe in our existing markets. And as you know, we've always been flexible around the scale versus retail dynamics along as we are focused on differentiated use cases that require that interconnected cloud-enabled campus dynamic and you know we try to make sure that we can accommodate higher density as well as low density applications within the same campus. That's really what makes the community of customers thrive. And again, most of the growth in edge use cases the vast majority of it is going to take place in the major metros of the type that we're in. And so, we do believe that's possible. Now, we always look to evaluate and enter different markets with the business model that we have, but those opportunities are few and fall between and really hard to forecast or incorporate into a model in anyway. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim. Robert Gutman : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering, looking at next year's interconnection growth year-over-year, if that will be impacted by the churn occurring in the second half of this year. And I was also wondering if in terms of the $40 million plus CapEx guide little more tangible indication in terms of the amount of capacity, net rentable square feet that you expect to add? Jeff Finnin : Rob, let me comment on the interconnection and we'll see if we can get you a number for the $400 million to $450 million. I would just say in general any time you some level of churn which we report on a rent perspective, you are going to get some additional churn associated with the interconnections, that's just very common just given the types of deployments. What we don't always know is the level of churn in the interconnection side of it and it's going to vary just depending on the cross connect density in each of those deployments. So, it will impact it to some extent, to what extent is uncertain and so we ultimately see which customer's churn and the timing of that event. And just to get back to your other \u2013 your second question, we've got about 160,000 square feet, it is under construction today and that complemented with what we have talked about related to LA3 and some of which is CH2 is going to be about 280,000 square feet that in total you would see under construction, some of which will be completed in 2019 \u2013 some \u2013 in late 2019 and then some of that will ultimately bleed into early 2020. Robert Gutman : Do you think that, let say is longer term beyond 2019 or is it \u2013 you are saying high-single digit growth 2019 beyond that and low-double digit in 2020, is that a \u2013 would you expect \u2013 is that long-term rate beyond that? Do you expect it to plateau around there? What's \u2013 just a longer-term view. Jeff Finnin : Yeah, I wish I could give you more color on that Rob, but you know lot of it as you've seen for 2018 and 2019 is really going to be dependent on the incremental capacity that we add to the market as well as performance on the sell-side. And so, I think we wanted to give some insight into 2019 into 2020, because we are going through this low from a capacity perspective, just to give better visibility into that. Beyond that, I'm hesitant to comment at this point in time. Paul Szurek : Well, let me just add to what Jeff said, you know ultimately it's dependent on sales which is primarily dependent upon demand, but bear in mind what I said in my comments that what we're building in this first phase are the corn shell of all these four new buildings out of which we're initially building only the first phase of capacity. So, we do in these buildings in our current footprint, plus what we can add in \u2013 you know in the land that we own down the road could \u2013 if the sales and demand are there, you know continue to maintain double digit growth beyond 2020. But that's going to be dependent upon sales execution and demand. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Thanks for taking my question. A couple if I could. First, is there a significance to the conversion from some of the operating unit into the common shares into the quarter? And second, can you talk about how your guidance may affect the dividend policy going forward in terms of what kind of growth investors should expect in 2019 and 2020 relative to what you've been delivering over the last few years? Jeff Finnin : Good morning Mike. Let me try to address your first question related to the conversion, so you probably saw in early August Carlyle chose to monetize some portion of their OP units and when that does occur, you just literally get a rotation out of what we refer to as our non-controlling interest into additional capital inside our equity statement. So, I think that's what you are referring to, does that answer your question on that? Michael Rollins : It does. Jeff Finnin : Okay and then secondly, the dividend policy, I think as you've seen historically and when you look at our dividend today as compared to AFFO, we have about a 90% payout and it's something we obviously address on a quarterly basis with our Board to evaluate what that dividend needs to be, but as we've said historically, those increases are largely going to be tied to our increases in cash flow. And we define that most relevant is common \u2013 is our cash flow that is distributable to our common equity shareholders which in a simplistic view from our perspective is AFFO less non-recurring capital that we spend inside our portfolio. So, I think that's the measurement you have to watch and that would largely give you some indication in terms of what that dividend increase could be relative to the growth in that cash flow number. Michael Rollins : And is there any thought to maybe holding back some dividend growth to use that internally generated cash, maybe flatten it out for a period of time, or any other alternatives just as you are thinking about financing for the business? Paul Szurek : So, given where we are on a leverage basis, you know we're low levered and as Jeff pointed out, we have the capacity to still be conservatively leveraged and fund our capital growth plans. Don't think we need to view any changes to the dividend policy as necessary in light of where we are leveraged. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. In regards to your transition year and your comments in 2019 and then the revenue acceleration into 2020, when considering your vertical revenue mix across cloud networks and enterprises, which tenant do you think is going to be driving the majority of the acceleration from 2019 to 2020 and the reason why I bring this up is, this quarter you reported 49.4% of annualized revenues from enterprises and this is coming during \u2013 this is a step-up for about 200 basis points versus the prior quarter, it is also during a time where almost every single public cloud is scaling. So, just want to get an understanding on where you guys see the acceleration occurring by vertical mix from 2019 into 2020. Steve Smith : Hi, this is Steve. I'll give you an answer to that. As this relates to our overall mix, I think it really points back to our overall strategy really keen around three aspects of the market, one being network, the other being cloud and the other being enterprise and how those are mutually attracted to one another and really ultimately drive their unique value that we have across our platform. So, all three are very important to us and if you look at the overall mix of our ecosystem about 50% of that is enterprise and then the other 50% is evenly divided between cloud and network. So, we see little bit of oscillation here and there between quarters. This quarter, enterprises was a bit elevated, primarily based off of the scale of the old socket than we would like, also the impact for the available capacity to sell that space, so overall we see a fairly consistent balance as we go forward. But all three aspects are very important to us. Sami Badri : Thank you. And then my last question is have to do with a potential investment grade rating and whether the company is deciding to pursue that after some of your peers have already achieved an investment grade rating and wanted to get some color on that given the interest in increasing the leverage ratio to 4.5 times EBITDA, so any color would be great? Jeff Finnin : You bet Sami. It is clearly something we watch and monitor closely not only what our peers are doing and what those rating agencies are doing, but also we have those conversations with the rating agencies that we meet with on a periodic basis and so, we obviously operate the business with that in mind and is something that we clearly have an eye on. I think it'd be premature to think about being in 2019, but we continue to operate in manner that ultimately we could do that in the public markets. Having said that, I would just comment on one of the areas of financing, we've tapped as you've seen is that private placement and those two issuances are rated what's referred to as NAIC 2 which is a surrogate for investment grade in the private market. And so \u2013 and we've been able to access that at the investment grade level, which continues to be a \u2013 I think an attractive source of capital for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. How should we think about the scale of deployments going forward? So, what percentage of your mix should we think about being deployed that way. And then, maybe I missed this, but talk a little bit about the current size of your sales force and how you are going to see that grow maybe over the next 12 months as the top-line is ramping? Thanks. Steve Smith : Sure. Well, this is Steve. As you think about the overall mix of our transactions have been pretty consistent with about \u2013 over 90% of our lease has been less than 5,000 square feet and I think that's really the meat and potatoes of our strategy and you will see that going forward, which is also one of the key attraction for why a lot of the cloud and content companies want to do business with us as well on the scale level. So, as far as number of transaction, I think you'll see that be fairly consistent. And as we've mentioned before, there is scale and hyperscale opportunities are more opportunistic they thought from those that \u2013 by that same ecosystem that can contribute to it and overall provide more value there. So, they are important to us and as I mentioned before, we do want to improve there and we feel like the additional capacity that we're bringing online will give us the opportunity to do that. And you'll probably see as you've seen in other quarters where when those events do happen and those leases do occur, that that will outweigh some of the smaller deployments in terms of just square feet and overall revenue, so again opportunistic, needs to provide value to the ecosystem as well as through returns that our shareholders are looking for. As far as the sales team is concerned, the overall expense structure we looked at \u2013 be very consistent to next year. We have done some things, we have some organizational changes last quarter and we are looking to drive better efficiencies that can better align to the markets as we have new capacity coming onboard and as we see just opportunities for improvement. So, across our sales, sales engineering and product mix, there is areas that we've already identified where we feel like we can make improvement there and we continue work there. Frank Louthan : And what percent of your sales are coming from the channel partners right now and where do you see that going forward? Steve Smith : Our channel business fluctuates a bit from quarter to quarter. It's anywhere from I'd say 8% to 15% depending upon the quarter. It is an important part of our business and will continue to be an important part for us as we go forward. There's essentially off tables resources that can get our brand up in the marketplace and really not only carry our value but other components that are important to customers as they evolve their IT strategies is key to us. So, we continue to focus there and expand that and I expect our focus to be even more strong as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk with Bank of America. Michael Funk : Yeah, thank you for taking the question. A couple if I may. I understood that leasing can be lumpy any given quarter based on supply constraints and then I mean scale lumpiness as well. You know where do you see leasing longer-term, as capacity comes online and maybe more on a normalized basis for the scale business. Steve Smith : I think you'll continue to see it be lumpy. There is \u2013 and the use cases that go into that scale leasing, again I think you need to look at what the deployment is within those larger scale leases and how they either value or don't value. The ecosystem and the network connectivity that we offer within our campus model, because some don't. And those that are \u2013 that don't value that up and drive much lower price points that frankly is an additive to our ecosystem or our shareholders and the return that we expect. So, again, it will be opportunistic, but we do see good opportunity and the opportunity actually improving as those low lengths of use cases continue to evolve and we see more and more of those every day, across every industry for that matter. So, as you see capacity come on, especially within our top four markets, we expect to see better performance there as it relates to scale and hyperscale opportunity. Michael Funk : One more if I may, I mean obviously you know ability to bring capacity online is dictated by obviously the permitting process and you know available land. What's your view with regard to you know other strategic alternatives for expanding the business either geographically you know product set or event just in terms of getting more reach and scale in the business in general? Paul Szurek : So, great opportunity in our development program is that we are really meeting the needs of our customers where they have the highest need. People like us we're not developing these in-fill urban campuses that have these great connected communities. Somebody else would have to do it and you know the returns there are higher, because the difficulty and the ability of others to compete is you know rewards people who can do it and who pursue it and stick to it. So, we believe that's very strategically important to meet our customers' needs where they express the greatest desire for them and so that's I think for the foreseeable future that's going to be the highest and best use of capital. It has been since our IPO and I think we're going to continue to focus that as our primary strategy where we can differentiate ourselves both to our customers and to the investment community. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Richard Choe : I just wanted to ask a little bit about how we should think about the pacing of churn, the development and revenue growth. It seems like growth will be more back-end loaded in 2019 and accelerating into 2020. And then also can I have an idea of what gives you the confidence about the low double digits in 2020 in terms of your pipeline, if you can give a sense there that would be great? Thank you. Jeff Finnin : Hey good morning Richard, let me just comment a little bit on any questions and I'll ask Steve add some color and commentary. But you are right in that as you point out that in the second half of 2019 is where you are going to see some additional capacity being added and that's going to be the Bay Area with the completion of the first phase SV8. And so, I think what is important and we've tried to get as \u2013 be as transparent on this as possible which is getting to when capacity will be coming online on a quarterly basis and by market. Keep in mind that as we do bring some of that capacity online, depending upon whether some of its pre-leased or not. If we don't have any pre-leasing, you will see some impact \u2013 negative impact to our earnings as a result of absorbing some of costs until we get that list up to a certain level. So just keep that in mind as you look at your quarterly models. And in terms of what's driving that or our confidence around \u2013 you know beyond that, I'll just have Steven or Paul comment on that. Paul Szurek : So I think what you are really asking Richard is, our confidence levels around the timing of delivering capacity, I hope this isn't too much detail, but as we go through our process is the biggest unknowns are in the permitting process. They are just a lot of steps, a lot of opportunities for community input, special environmental reviews. And so, until you are basically at the end of that, it's a lot harder to predict what the timing of development will be. We feel pretty good because we are pretty far along in the properties that have not been permitted yet, and so we've got a few hurdles behind us. Once we have a property under contract with the general contractor, those contracts have set target dates that are based on assumptions you know around field conditions and weather to some extent. And you know sometimes you'll exceed those exceptions, sometimes you won't, but typically on average you are going to be right around those contracted dates with your general contractor. So, once we start coming out of the ground with vertical construction, there are a lot fewer variables that can, you know not completely eliminated but fewer that can impact your schedule and your delivery time lines. Richard Choe : And to follow-up on that really quickly, when can you actually starts selling that capacity and have it in bookings? Is that a second that or like when these properties are actually made or is it \u2013 can you do it ahead of scheduled kind of just some idea of timing? When we can actually do booking? Paul Szurek : So as we said in the past, it really does somewhat depend upon market and somewhat on buyer, but a good rule of thumb is that some pre-leasing can begin to take place, you know generally three to six months before you have an expected certificate of occupancy. And so, typically we see some preleasing before we actually opened up a facility and we try to approach that opportunistic. We are trying to smooth out the J-curve but still get to right applications that value the ecosystem, and the best pricing that we can. Richard Choe : Right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from line of Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Erik Rasmussen : Thanks for taking the questions. A lot has been addressed, but just circling back maybe some clarification on the churn. You guys talked about elevated churn levels in the first half of the 2019 and getting back to more normal levels. But is that 6% to 8% still a good range to consider with the context of the first half guidance? Jeff Finnin : Good morning, Eric. I think when we referenced back to normal levels, we would consider our normal levels to be somewhere between 1% to 2% per quarter, so take a midpoint of some more around 3% from the backend of the year, and if you add on to that 4.25%, you're going to be somewhere towards the higher end of that 6% to 8% range. We are a ways out from some of that, but based on the visibility at least that we have in the first half, we wanted to at least make sure people were aware of it as you considering your models and obviously we are going to work to outperform, but that's our best visibility as we sit here today. Erik Rasmussen : Great, thanks. And then the interconnection, your guide this year is 11% to 14% growth has been decelerating, obviously there is some churn as I think was it talked a little bit earlier that kind of leaks into the equation here. But what is an appropriate growth rate next year or what you are targeting is kind of a longer term, is it 11% to 14% still appropriate? Or can that change based on some of the development that's happening in the pipeline that you have? Jeff Finnin : A great question, Eric. Let me address that. I think if you look at year-to-date growth for our interconnect, we're right at about 12.3%, and I would expect this to end up somewhere in our guidance range of 11% to 14%. If I had to guess maybe towards the lower end, but we'll see how Q4 ultimately produces. In terms of beyond that, we'll obviously plan to give some specific guidance as we typically do on our February call. I think the things to consider is that volume growth really generally is going to drive that revenue growth, absent any increases in pricing or migrating certain customers to different products. So I without giving a lot of specificity, I think it's a reasonable range, but as we get better clarity into 2019 will give some specifics around it probably in February. Erik Rasmussen : Great, thanks. And one final one, obviously, you categorize next year as the transition year and there is a lot of development happening, and you know you talked in the past and it seems like it's still very much in an issue now or consideration is the local permitting. But what could potentially pull that or drive that growth rate up next year? I mean is there potential to pull some of these \u2013 from this land held for development into production now or is it difficult based on the market that you guys participate in? Paul Szurek : So in terms of upside opportunities, the two primary things that could drive that would be; A, if we lease up more quickly the computer rooms that are coming on line in the new buildings that were constructing. B, if we have to start sooner constructing new computer rooms in those buildings or for example in the VA3 campus, where we actually have some shelf where we can add some additional computer rooms more quickly than doing ground up development. So if it is a big year for scale leasing that would be the sort of thing that would drive upside to what we described on this call. Erik Rasmussen : Great, that helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ari Klein with BMO. Ari Klein : Thanks. Just going back to Northern Virginia, as early to the pricing decline you've noted over the last 12 to 18 months. Have you seen that accelerate at all recently? And then just as far as the lack of available capacity recently. Has that in any way affected your customer relationship at all? Paul Szurek : So, on the first question, I don't think we can pinpoint exactly when that pricing drop occurred over. That's why I said over the last 12 to 18 months, but it doesn't seem to have changed much in the last quarter or two as far as we can tell. On the second point to be honest, I think we've actually been fortunate in that we haven't had to \u2013 and part of this is holding some stuff back, so that we make sure we can take care of the existing customers, but we haven't had to disappoint any existing customers and their need or ability to expand in our current markets yet. Although, we do see them ramping up and using up space that was acquired previously, so we do need to stay on top of our development. Ari Klein : Thank. Operator : The next questions come from line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Lukas Hartwich : Hi guys. Given the deceleration in interconnection revenue growth, do you think you're hitting some sort of saturation point there? Paul Szurek : I mean I think the best that we can tell Lukas is that it is just \u2013 this part of the cycle related to telecom and carrier, M&A and subsequent pruning. There has been this longer term slow grind of the 10-gig or 100-gig, but that doesn't seem to have meaningfully changed. On the other hand as you know from the history of this industry, the cycles tend to increase and decrease as a new data products and new demand sources come up. So, I don't think we are negative about interconnection trend growth. We think it's a solid component of the story and the industry and consumer factors that drive it continued to be positive. Lukas Hartwich : That's helpful. And then can you just remind us about the company stance on international expansion? Paul Szurek : We just haven't seen it as necessary to fulfill our business plan or meet our customer needs. And so far compared to developing in the markets that we are in is not the best way to provide value to either our customers or shareholders. Lukas Hartwich : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We reached at the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll like to turn the floor back to Paul Szurek for closing comments. Paul Szurek : Thank you all for being on the call and for your interest in those good questions. We'll be at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. I am sure many of you will be there as well, and we look forward to seeing you. I'd like to just close by thanking my colleagues at CoreSite, as you can tell from the information we provide to you we have a lot of good things happening that require a really capable team, building out new capacity, bringing in all these high quality new customers into our ecosystem, continuing to drive a good product mix of customers within our ecosystem and great diversity there. These are not easy things to accomplish and I am really proud of how well all the members of our team prosecute their jobs day in and day out, and I'd like to thank the board. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Carole Jorgensen, Vice President and Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you. You may begin. Carole Jorgensen : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to CoreSite's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I am joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by Federal Securities Laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations pages of our web site at CoreSite.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I will share our key accomplishments for 2018, provide an annual overview of our business, and service models and share our 2019 priorities. Steve will then cover our sales results and initiatives to strengthen our market position and Jeff will take your financial results and our 2019 financial guidance. Our 2018 annual financial accomplishments showed another solid year of growth including revenue growth of 13%, FFO per share of $5.06, reflecting an increase of 14.2% or 11.9% growth after adjusting for 2017 one-time non-cash charge, and declare dividends of $4.14 per share, reflecting 15.6% growth. We achieved one of our primary sales goals of substantially growing no logo acquisitions. Annualized gap rent sold to new logos in 2018 increased 81% over 2017, and we added many important new companies to our customer communities. We also made significant progress on restoring our development pipeline in 2018. We placed in service nearly 172,000 net rentable square feet including data centers completed in Reston and Washington DC. We expect two new buildings under construction to come online in mid 2019 in Santa Clara and Northern Virginia, two of our biggest markets, and we proactively pursue further development in Santa Clara. In January, we entered into a contract for approximately 4 acre property adjacent to our existing campus to prepare for continued growth in that market. On the operational front, we delivered an approximate 7% improvement in power utilization efficiency on a same-store basis, compared to 2017 due to wise investments in new infrastructure and an ongoing program of operational improvements. We also achieved our highest uptime as a company, what we call seven 9s of reliability, thereby improving customer experience and reducing our operating costs. We also rolled out significant product improvements this year. We upgraded our open cloud exchange to an SDN architecture, which makes it significantly easier for customers to provision cloud interconnection and enables us to add additional features in a more agile manner. We also piloted and put customers in our first inter-market connectivity product and expanded our blended IP product. We also experienced some challenges in 2018. Our overall sales fell short of our goals. We underestimated the challenges selling when our occupancies were high and therefore capacity constrained, leading us to miss out on a number of good opportunities due to lack contiguous space. We expect this challenge will be mostly remedied as our SB8 and our VA3 Phase 1B buildings come online this year. We also expect to complete our LA1 expansion midyear, which will provide further opportunities. Construction commencement at our LA3 data center project in Los Angeles is still on hold due to delays at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and designing the power fleet for new facility, but we expect that design to be completed soon. On balance, 2018 was a solid year with much heavy lifting across our company to position us well for future years. Looking forward to 2019 and beyond, I would like to remind investors of the key components of CoreSite's items business model. Simply stated, we concentrated our activities in eight large metropolitan edge markets, which are rich in consumers and enterprises and where our extensive customer communities provide an outstanding platform for digital activities and transformation. Our campuses are characterized by major interconnection nodes and numerous cloud on-ramps, which anchor large, energy-efficient, highly flexible data centers where the widest possible range of customer deployment sizes and densities can be accommodated and where customers can interconnect with each other via short run, dark fiber or virtual connections providing the maximum performance bandwidth, reliability, flexibility and security. Our primary target customers include first enterprises in these markets through our moving to co-location to reduce the data service costs while increasing uptime and performance, and interconnecting to a powerful hybrid cloud and network ecosystem. Second, companies with edge needs in these markets; third, companies exchanging data traffic at these key internet points; and finally, companies who value deployments in these markets as part of a larger performance and cost strategy built around wide area network realignment. The flexibility of our model is shown by the range of leases we can accommodate. Our smallest new and expansion sales in 2018 was 1 critical kilowatt in our largest was 3 megawatts, and we have added significantly larger leases in the past years when we have more capacity to sell. We believe this speaks to the diversity of how we can drive revenue as we add new capacity. We leverage our service model to focus our leasing efforts on higher value deployments where there is a greater need for the components we offer compared to less differentiated offerings in the marketplace. Our 2019 priorities include; first, to translate new construction and a more abundant sales including to larger scale deployments in our edge markets; second, to continue to focus on acquiring additional new logos; third, to continue to bring new connectivity and customer service products online to increase sales from new and existing customers; and fourth, to continue to deliver great customer experience and ongoing operational efficiencies. We believe these priorities and our other operating objectives will continue to drive value for our customers and employees and shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith : Thanks, Paul. I would like to start with a summary of our quarterly sales and leasing results and then spent some time on product enhancements. Turning to our sales results. For the quarter, we had sales of $4.2 million of annualized which included 16,000 rentable square feet at an average GAAP rate of $259 per square foot, comprised entirely of our core retail co-location sales. While our sales and scale and hyper-scale leasing were below our goals for the quarter, our performance included excellent growth to new logo additions, solid pricing and strong renewals. So, let me walk you through a few of these in more detail. We have discussed in prior calls, the goal of substantially growing new logos acquisitions in order to achieve greater diversity of our base, enhance our ecosystem and provide a platform for future organic growth. And we\u2019re seeing some solid traction in that regard. Here are few highlights. The annual GAAP rent for new logo additions in 2018 increased 81% over 2017. In addition, the average weighted monthly lease term for 2018 new low winds increased by about six months for new logos in 2017 and the majority of these 2018 logos were driven by process with ongoing logo growth for cloud and network providers. Pricing was also an important focus for us. For the quarter pricing on a new and expansion leases was consistent with a trailing 12 month average on a per kilowatt basis driven by continued execution in the core retail co-location space, which typically supports, better pricing and profitability. Moving to scale leasing as Paul mentioned our capacity constraints impacted our sales opportunities primarily sells the scale co-location, which we believe will be addressed by our ongoing property development in our presale activity for projects nearing completion. We also have several markets for available inventory where we look to execute better and driving scale leasing. Renewals are another key aspect of the health of our business during the fourth quarter of customer renewals were strong with annualized GAAP rent of $22.5 million. Rent growth of 3% on a cash bases and 7% on a GAAP basis and rental churn of 1.9% for the quarter, which is better than expected. So the fundamentals of our business remain strong with increasing growth from new customers at logos signing with CoreSite, existing customers including key strategic accounts choosing extend their term and expand their space with us, and core retail co-location pricing levels remain firm. Additional focus going forward will be on executing well in the skill segment as those opportunities align with our value proposition and available capacity. In my role as Chief Revenue Officer, we're evaluating opportunities to evolve or offerings in order to deepen our customer value or providing additional forms of revenue to the Company. We have been working directly and through partners with the goal of making it easier to customers to continue the digital transformation journey. As such, there are several steps, we have delivered this year and look to expand as we go forward. In 2018, we upgraded open cloud exchange with SDN architecture; enabling easier on-boarding to cloud and SaaS providers as well as paving the way for future development; added Microsoft Azure Express Route private connectivity in our Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia markets; enabled enterprises with direct private connectivity between VMware and AWS in four markets including Boston, Denver, New York and Northern Virginia; introduced AWS' logical redundancy offering, a second native point of connectivity to AWS Direct Connect at our Silicon Valley campus; provided dedicated access to the Oracle cloud infrastructure in Northern Virginia and Washington DC campuses; enabled inner market connectivity; expanded the flexibility of our blended IP product and formalize the launch of our solution partner program to extend our reach and value through our ecosystem to help customers along their journey from IT assessment to transition services to ongoing support and management. I hope this gives you a sense of our ever evolving customer centric initiatives in our data centers. We\u2019re focused on the collective value of our solutions to customers as we enable them to execute against their business plans and grow the relationships among each other. Technology is driving higher expectations in all companies to make it easier and faster to do business with them. We believe, we are key resource for enterprises upgrading their technology to better support their business in the future. Enterprises that can drive a better digital experience for their employees, customers and suppliers should win in their respective industries. We expect to be the cornerstone of how they successfully deliver digital transformation. With that, I will hand the call up to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Steve, and Hello everyone. Today, I would like to share some highlights of our 2018 financial performance, review our detailed fourth quarter financial results, update you on our property operations and development, and provide you our financial guidance for 2019. Looking at our financial results. Our full year 2018 results included 13% revenue growth, 14.2% of FFO growth per share, or 11.9%, after excluding a 2017 non-cash charge related to our preferred stock redemption. And adjusted EBITDA growth of 12.5% while maintaining an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.4%, and declare dividends of $4.14 per share or 15.6% growth. In 2018, we successfully access the capital markets and amended and expanded our credit facility which provided us $250 million of additional liquidity while extending our debt maturities as attractive rates. We were also an early adopter of the new lease and revenue accounting standards. So we've had that in our rearview mirror since the beginning of 2018. Moving to our fourth quarter financial results. Our total operating revenues were $139.1 million for the fourth quarter, which was in line with the third quarter and reflected a 10.5% increase year-over-year. Operating revenues consisted of a $118.3 million of rental power and related revenue, $18 million of inner connection revenue and $2.8 million of office wide industrial and other revenue. Interconnection revenue increased 1.8% sequentially and 10.9% year-over-year. FFO was $1.26 per diluted share and unit in line sequentially and an increase of 15.6% year-over-year or 6.8% growth after excluding the 2017 non-cash charge related to our preferred stock redemption. Adjusted EBITDA of $74.6 million increase 1.1% sequentially, and 8.5% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.6% up 57 basis points from the prior quarter and down 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the new lease accounting requirements that we implemented in 2018, higher power rates and increase property taxes. Sales and marketing expense totaled $5.4 million for the quarter or 3.9% of total operating revenue. For the year sales and marketing expense was $21 million or 3.9% of operating revenues in line with 2017. General and administrative expenses totaled $10.5 million for the quarter or 7.6% of total operating revenues. For the year, general and administrative expenses were $14.1 million essentially in line with our guidance. These expenses represented 7.4% of total operating revenues for 2018, compared to 7.8% in 2017. In the fourth quarter, we commenced 23,000 of net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases at an annualized GAAP rent of $192 per square foot which represented $4.4 million of annualized gap rent. Moving to backlog as of year-end projected annualized gap rent from signs, but not yet commenced leases was $9.9 million and $14.3 million on a cash basis. We expect substantially all of the GAAP backlog to commenced during the first half of 2019. Turning to our property operations and development. Fourth quarter same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent was $1,537, reflecting a 1.6% sequential increase and a 6.3% increase year-over-year. Q4 same-store turnkey data center occupancy was 90.7%, an increase of 60 basis points sequentially. We ended the quarter with our stabilize data center occupancy at 92.8%, an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. During the fourth quarter, we completed construction and placed into the pre-stabilize pool 25,000, net rentable square feet for our DC2 data center. We have a total of 271,000 square feet of data center capacity in various stages of development across the portfolio. This includes ground-up construction and VA3 Phase 1B of the and SB8 Phase 1, which together total 108000 square feet with $118 million incurred to date of an estimated $246 million. Data center expansions at LA1 and LA2 which together total 45,000 square foot with $9 million incurred to date of an estimated $34 million. And preconstruction of LA3 and CH2, which together represent 118,000 square feet with $39 million incurred to date of an estimated $250 million to complete the first phases of these projects. Collectively, these projects total $166.4 million invested as of the end of the fourth quarter of the estimated $530.2 million required to complete the projects. For more details on our development projects please see page 19 of the supplemental information. Turning to capitalized interest. The percent capitalize in the fourth quarter was 17.9% in the full-year percentage was 13.6%. For 2019, we expect the percentage of interest capitalized to be in the range of 20% to 24%, which is elevated compared to 2018 based on our development pipeline. Turning to our balance sheet. Our ratio of net principal debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA was 3.8 times as of the end of the fourth quarter, we had $236.2 million of total liquidity, consisting of $233.6 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility and $2.6 million of cash. As a reminder, we announced last quarter that we expect to access the capital markets for $350 million to $400 million in the form of additional debt to term out the outstanding balances our credit facility. We expect the majority of the financing to be completed in the first half of 2019. As I stated last quarter, we are comfortable with modestly increasing our targeted debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 4.5 times. I would now like to address our 2019 guides. For context, it's important to note that our guidance reflects our view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets as well as the health of the broader economy. We do not factoring changes in our portfolio resulting from acquisitions, dispositions, or capital markets activity other than what we have discussed today. And bear in mind that our guidance reflects coming into the year with constraints capacity due to high occupancy and significant new capacity expected to be available mid-year and beyond. As detailed on page 23 of our fourth quarter supplemental information, our guidance for 2019 is as follows. Total operating revenue is estimated to be $580 million to $590 million, based on the midpoint of guidance which represents 7.5% year-over-year revenue growth which reflects the timing of our development pipeline in the current level of capacity entering the year. Connection revenue is estimated to be $74 million to $77 million. This reflects 8.3% growth at the midpoint. General and administrative expense is estimated to be $42 million to $44 million, representing 7.4% of total operating revenue at the midpoint. Net income is estimated to be $104 million to $109 million, representing $2.15 to $2.25 per share of net income to common shares, or $2.20 at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $316 million to $321 million. And at the midpoint reflects a 54.4% adjusted EBITDA margin and 7.6% year-over-year growth. FFO is estimated to be $5.21 to $5.31 per share in operating unit. At the midpoint this reflects 4% growth. As a reminder, this guidance reflects the plans of debt financing that I mentioned earlier. Other guidance includes rental churn, which is estimated to be 6% to 8% for the full year. Cash rent growth on data center renewals estimated at 2% to 4%. And capital expenditures which are estimated at $400 million to $450 million, including data center expansion of $380 million to $415 million, non-recurring investments of $5 million to $10 million, tenants improvements of $5 million to $10 million, and recurring capital expenditures of $10 million to $15 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Atkin : So I was interested in Steve's comments about better execution on scale leases going forward. And if you could maybe elaborate a little bit about what that looks like apart from having inventory to sell, what is it on the execution side that you think can drive better success? And then on the product side, you mentioned the OCX, the Open Cloud Exchange SDN offer. Is that something that you're offering because you can in anticipation of potential customer demand or are you seeing meaningful takeaways already you've kind of ramp that products and active customer interest or is that more on the come? Thank you. Paul Szurek : Great. Hey, Jonathan. Thanks for the question. As it relates to better execution, I think, you'll hear me say that consistently regardless of our results. But I do think we can and should do better, especially in the scale leasing and really across the board. As it relates to scale leasing with the inventory that we have today, there are a few pockets where we have availability to sell scale deals today albeit a few. And I just think there is always areas where we can execute better as far as how we are aligning to the market, making sure that the market is aware of our -- our availability out there, how we're ensuring that our value is driven throughout the organization is making those decisions and that we position us in the most favorable light to win. So that's really just how do we ensure that those aspects come together and we continue to just try to get better in that regard. As it relates to your question around OCX and SDN, it really just sets the platform up for us to be able to provide those capabilities and automating the provisioning of logical circuits across our OCX. We have seen some initial interest and we are encouraged by the future of what that can provide us, not only for intra-market, but also inter-market and some additional enhanced services as we go forward. So it's really just kind of setting the stage for the future. Jonathan Atkin : Yes. So if I could just follow up on that. Are there any sort of use cases that you could maybe illustrate in a generic fashion, that would be driving that demand? And then a last one, perhaps for Jeff. You mentioned the PUE improvement. How would you translate that into kind of margin lift? So on a same-capital basis without the benefit of cross-connect growth, what kind of margin lift would you have seen the PUE improvement that you referenced in the script? Thanks. Paul Szurek : Sure. So just to give you a couple of use cases, a great use case that we've already seen some demand for is where customers may be deployed in one market, but need access to a native on-ramp -- cloud on-ramp in another market, where they can access our Open Cloud Exchange, logically provision that circuit to gain access within our Open Cloud Exchange on the other end in different market and get that native connectivity. So that's a pretty common request, I would say. Another that it would be -- a pretty typical use case would be where our customers are deployed in more than one market, where they may have an active, active type of environment or perhaps want to just load share their requirements between different markets and they can share those from a connectivity standpoint and be able to turn those up and down, based on the amount of demand and amount of traffic that they need. So just a couple of examples for you. Now I'll let Jeff to answer your other question there. Jeff Finnin : Jonathan, I would say that -- excuse me, in general, that PUE uplift contributed about 60 basis points to 70 basis points to our adjusted EBITDA margin during the year. And so those are some of the things that Paul has kind of messaged as we think about operational improvements during 2018 and that our team is continuing to focus on as we head into 2019. Operator : Our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Sadler : So Paul, in your opening remarks, you mentioned that the slower sales will likely be mostly remedied, I think, as it relates to additional capacity. And I'm just curious, is there something else beyond the additional capacity that you're focusing on to increase the sales effort? Paul Szurek : Really just two things. One is the continuous improvement that we strive for that Steve mentioned and they do a great job here in Mali and the rest of the team and diving into every opportunity from the previous quarter, lessons learned, how do we change our approach for future opportunities. And we've seen a lot of success from that continuous improvement. The other thing is what you guys have seen happen in this space since it was created is that you have different waves and cycles of user demand. And one year, we see a lot of scale sales in our markets and then those get filled up. And then in subsequent years, there's less of that. But then as those fill up, the cycle comes back. So I think having the capacity is a prima facie requirement for winning those deals. And I feel good about what we see out there in the industry in general and pipelines in general. Jordan Sadler : Is there anything you could add vis-a-vis the cycle, where you think we are in terms of what types of customers have been slower to lease, which may be coming around in 2019. Paul Szurek : So every side of the edge cycles are different than undifferentiated or hyperscale cycles. We had a big edge cycle in 2015 and 2016. It started tapering off in 2017 and 2018. But we're seeing good signs going forward for that, that's not a promise of anything, but I do feel good about where we are in the edge cycle. Jonathan Atkin : And then along those lines, I was curious regarding the interconnection revenue growth assumption or guidance of 8.3%, is it obvious moderation from what you did in '17, but also from the pace in 4Q of 10.9% growth, down 8.3 for the year. Is there anything else embedded in there in terms of consolidation or churn that you could point to? Jeff Finnin : Yes. Jordan. I would say that all of those items you mentioned, whether it's some of the consolidation just some of it associated with some churn are all embedded into those estimates. But I think if you look at the past two to three years, you can see that has decelerated by 200 basis points to 300 basis points per year, largely driven off of the volume growth. To the positive side, what we continue to see is customers that migrate from a certain volume to a higher volume product which obviously increases price. And so while you may not see volumes, our overall volume increase from a per unit basis, overall pricings continue to go up just as they migrate to a higher priced product, we continue to see that, but all of that has been embedded into that -- those estimates. As you point out, the midpoint is about 8.3%, the range is somewhere around 6% to 11% and we'll just see how we perform as we work through the year. Jonathan Atkin : Okay, thank you. Hey, Jeff, just while I have you there. The commencements, I noticed you didn't provide any specific commentary for the year. Is there any number that's embedded at the midpoint here that you could point to beyond the backlog you talked about? Jeff Finnin : Yes, I mean the -- obviously the backlog as I mentioned, you got about $9.9 million call it $10 million that we've got visibility into for next year. And the remaining of those commencements are going to be largely dependent upon our leasing results and some of that is dependent upon our construction deliveries. And so, we'll continue to update as we work through the year. In terms of trying to estimate that, I would just point to whatever our high-level revenue guidance is, and our churn estimates, and make some estimates on estimated timing of leasing and commencements of -- gets you there based on the high-level revenue guidance we've provided. And we'll continue to update you guys as we progress during the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Nick Del Deo : First one is for Steve. You noted the revenue booked from new logos in 2018 was up 81% versus the prior year, which is a pretty substantial change. Can you talk about some of the specific initiatives you undertook to help drive that results? And were there particular selling point you found to be particularly effective in getting new enterprises on board? Steve Smith : Sure. Well, thanks, Nick. Thanks for the question. I mean, yes, there was one area that we did see some good traction on, I think, is an important aspect. We've mentioned it on prior calls, where that was a key focus area for us even, I would say, more than a year ago where we wanted to really provide more diversity across our base, be less reliant upon our existing customer base for our future growth and just enhance the ecosystem, and that's been the real impetus for this whole initiative. But there's been really a concerted effort both from our sales, marketing, product teams, our channel team really across the board to ensure that we drive the right messaging, the outright outreach that we align our incentive plans, all of those kind of things to ensure that we really motivate all over is in the water toward -- rolling toward those new logos. So, I'd say, it's really kind of a combined effort there as well as just looking at the industries that we've -- that have been adopting CoreSite, those that value our value proposition. And really trying to get better at identifying through internal as we call it customer knowledge of those customers that tend to buy from us, and how do we target more of them to just get smart about where we spend our money and where we spend our time to better attract those logos. So it's really just a combination of all those things. Nick Del Deo : Okay, that's helpful. Then maybe one on Santa Clara specifically. Note that's historically been a very good market for you guys in part, because it's hard to bring new capacity online, it seems like there has recently been a spike in projects under development there with a lot of capacity in various stages of development. How do you see that influencing that market over the next couple years? And are you confident you can get your desired returns on SV8 and the facility you plan on building on the parcel you just acquired? Paul Szurek : This Paul, Nick. We feel good about Santa Clara market. There is always room for more participants in that market. But we like our campus ecosystem, the value that it drives, the performance that it drives, that's why we are -- despite those new participants in the market, we're continuing to look to expand that campus, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Operator : Our next question comes from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Aryeh Klein : Paul, I think you mentioned earlier that LA3 construction has been delayed a little bit more. How does that impact your previous outline for 2020 growth as it relates to revenue, EBITDA and FFO? Do you still feel comfortable returning to the double-digits there? Paul Szurek : I do. And I don't expect this to be a significant delay, although it's a bit of a disappointment. And let me just be clear, I have a lot of sympathy for these power companies that got to manage these grids, and I'm guessing there's more sensitivity around this today than there was in the past. So I get it, they want to get it right, we want them to get it right, and we're hopefully very close to resolving that and being able to start construction in the first half of this year. So it shouldn't meaningfully move from where we were expecting it in the past, but it could be a quarter or two maybe slightly more from what we had previously. Aryeh Klein : Okay. And then, as far as you mentioned the positives from new logo growth, what are you seeing from existing customers? How are they growing their footprints and do you still feel confident about that side of the business? Paul Szurek : It was a little bit lighter in 2018. And I would refer you back to my -- the comments I made earlier about cycles of demand in various areas. I think we'll see that be better in 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Choe with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Richard Choe : Hi. I just want to get a little bit more color, I guess, you have completed projects, pretty stabilized but completed it in Virginia, New York, in D.C., it seems like they've been pre-leased but the commencements haven't kind of come in. Can you give us a little more color on when they will start commencing and when we can see revenue coming from those projects? And I have a follow-up. Paul Szurek : Some of them have already commenced and there's revenue in them, others will commence over this quarter and the next coming quarters. Just want to give you a little bit of detail there, Richard. VA3, 1A is a pure co-location asset, so it doesn't really accommodate scale. And those take a wild lease up, but it's leasing up frankly handsomely right now. DC2 was really completed late in December, it had its first tenant signed up earlier this month. And so that's a very new asset and those new co-location assets tend to take -- they're more linear in their lease up whereas scale assets tend to be lumpier in their lease up. Richard Choe : And giving the development table for 2020 and knowing it's little early. If you look at the megawatt numbers, they're relatively similar to the amount you're doing in 2019, should we expect there might be a little bit drop off in CapEx, but it really seems like the CapEx level for -- going into 2020 should probably be equal to 2019, would that make sense? Jeff Finnin : Yes, just broadly speaking if you look at the megawatts for '19, we're looking at delivering about 19 megawatts, and 2020, it's only 12. And so I think, keep that in mind, I do believe 2019 would be elevated as compared to where we think 2020 will be at least as we sit here today. That may change based upon ultimate sales and absorption trends as we kind of work our way through 2019 and obviously will provide some detailed color around that as we get closer to to the end of this year. But I wouldn't expect it to be higher than what we're expecting for this year. If anything similar or slightly down based on where we sit today. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Erik Rasmussen : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Just a kind of back-to-the-scale location, that obviously continues to be challenged and finished the year with roughly half the amount that you signed last year. So, given your guidance for 2019 and the capacity expansion plans you've talked about, would you say the 2018 was the trough and we'll see scale colo higher in 2019? Here, we're just trying to understand your comments about new leasing opportunities given a lot of the construction and development plans you guys have. Then I have a follow up. Paul Szurek : So, yes, obviously our guidance implies very strongly that we expect 2018 to be a trough. And the the requirement of increased sales is you have to have capacity to sell, and it has to be the right capacity in the right markets. Our trademark has been, as I mentioned in our comments that we've been able to accommodate deployments from as small as a cabinet or sometimes even less all the way up to substantially larger requirements 8 megawatts, 9 megawatts and even occasionally a powered shell. We just didn't have anything like that kind of capacity to accommodate, accommodate those types of opportunities in 2018, but we will in 2019 and continuing further into 2020. Erik Rasmussen : And then maybe in terms of your new development and construction projects, at this stage, how conservative do you think your development completion timeline is the one chart on 19 there, it seems that VA3 did slip the Q2. What were the factors there and then where do you see the major hurdles to hit your overall timeline on that chart. Thank you. Paul Szurek : So we try actually -- and maybe we've taken the wrong approach to this, but we try to be really straightforward based on the documentation that we have in place. So when we're in the permitting phase for going off the advisor's estimates of how long it takes to get permits in a particular jurisdiction, I think, going forward, we're going to categorize that as pre-construction and not be as detailed as on in terms of when we will get permits, because it is very hard to predict in these markets. And then in terms of construction, we go based on what the delivery date in the construction contract is in terms of when we expect delivery. Now those delivery dates can change based on weather changes, we've got a certain amount of allowances and contracts, and sometimes, there are unanticipated field conditions that can drive the delays. That's primarily what's going on with VA3 in terms of sliding from late in the third quarter to call it mid second quarter is a combination of site conditions and weather conditions in the Virginia market. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Colby Synesael : When we met with you guys at NAREIT in, I think, it was early November, it seemed like you guys thought pretty good about the pipeline for a scale deal at VA3 and that you're tracking various opportunities, and obviously, you didn't sign anything during the quarter. Curious if those opportunities are still there, they've gone elsewhere? And if the the delayed opening had had anything to do with it? And then also as you look to get that anchor scale deal with VA3, how are you thinking about pricing? I know in the past, even though the pricing has come down, are you willing to do deal at what you perceive now as the market -- the market clearing price or are you going to kind of hold in there and taking at the price that you want? Thanks. Steve Smith : Hey, Colby. This is Steve. I'll take a shot at this and then Paul can chime in anything that I might miss here. But I would just tell you, as far as the overall pipeline is concerned for pre-leasing, whether it'd be in Virginia or in the Bay Area, activity still remains strong. We are having multiple conversations and we're still positive with the outlook. As far as any individual deals are concerned, not sure exactly which individual deals we're in discussion. But I would tell you that even customer requirements, especially of that size, move all over the place based on their dates, and when they want them or whether or not they remain a real opportunity. So the overall market in the pipeline still remains strong and we're optimistic about where we can go with it. As it relates to pricing, we feel like we've underwritten the asset to where we can still absolutely execute against it and meet the returns that we underwrote. The market clearing price, I would say, there's not necessarily a market clearing price. So I think there's a lot of variables that go into what prices in any given market, but maybe especially in Virginia as to what customers value, whether or not they're willing to pay for it and how much scale they're looking to bring on board. So we feel like, based on the value, the ecosystem, the scale and size and the level of redundancy that we have built into the asset that we'll be able to meet the market. Colby Synesael : Great. And then maybe just one for Jeff. You've taking your leverage target up from what has historically been sub-4 and this year it's 4.5 and in response to, I think, Richard's question, you noted that you expect CapEx next year to be down, but maybe similar. Once model would assume then that your leverage continues to go up as you go into 2020. Do you see that you just can't be taking up your leverage target further or are there other actions that you're likely to take? Jeff Finnin : Yes, good morning, Colby. Those are items, it's going to be very dependent upon ultimately based upon our EBITDA growth in terms of where that leverage ultimately gets too. But more specifically, to your question, our leverage at 4.5 which we've messaged to, we continue to have those conversations with our Board when we meet and assess where we want to take that leverage, but that is one option that we would look at. There are other options that we need to consider based upon many factors in terms of the economics out in the marketplace. And so it's one lever we can pull, not the only lever. We just got to evaluate those with our Board as we work our way through the year and see how the lease-up is coming and ultimately the EBITDA growth associated with it. Operator : Our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Frank Louthan : So going forward, do we -- are we looking for more growth in the sales team or is it really just more -- is having some more inventory available to kind of -- to kind of get the to get the sales up? And then can you walk us through some other rent per the -- rent per square foot kind of have seemed to tick up a little bit in the quarter. What sort of the nature of the mix of those leases that was driving that uptick sequentially? Thanks. Steve Smith : Hey, Frank. This is Steve. As it relates to the sales headcount, we had a couple of open positions, few open positions, I would say coming out of 2018 that we have now filled a couple of markets, for example, Chicago, where we have obviously new building coming on board where we expect to have better traction there and be prepared for that building coming online and just adjusting a few heads here and there. But overall very consistent with where we've been in prior quarters and prior years. So I wouldn't expect any significant changes as far as total number of heads or dollars associated with them. As it relates to the rent and per square footage piece of it, I'll just give you those -- give you my perspective and then hand it up to Jeff. But the uplift was primarily driven just from increased density that we saw in the fourth quarter, whereas as we saw some of those smaller deals that were also more dense that drove the square footage dollar up in that quarter. Jeff Finnin : Frank, the only thing I'd add to that is Steve did make a reference in his prepared remarks that our pricing on a per kilowatt basis was consistent with the trailing 12 months coming into the fourth quarter, and so that gives you a better sense for that density to drive some of that increase on a per square foot basis. Frank Louthan : And how do you see that going forward? Is that just sort of anomaly in the quarter or it is the fact you had little more of the smaller deals versus some larger Hyperscale deals or you think you're able to take that density advantage going forward and drive some higher rents as we look out in our models? Paul Szurek : I think it is pretty variable. I think we've seen that over time as that densities have crept up. So I think that trend will probably continue. I think Q4 was probably a little bit higher elevated primarily because of the fact we had just --such a concentration in retail and the smaller deployments. But I think in that segment and even in the skilled segment, you're seeing densities creep up a little bit. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Dave Rodgers : Yes, hey guys. Maybe for Steve and tying on some comments that Paul had made earlier as well, but when you look at your completed pre-stabilized projects, the nearly 150,000 square feet, it sounds like a large portion of that not really colo scale available. So I was kind of curious, what the percentage of that portfolio is kind of leasable for scale colo? And then compare and contrast that to kind of what's under construction of the full out development pipeline, is all of that colo scale available? And then the third part of that question, just to be more confusing, is the 5,000 square feet that you use for the bottom of the scale colo portion of your business, is that too small? And is just the scale colo today for you needing to be substantially larger than kind of that low end of the bar? Steve Smith : Yes, I'll give you a little bit of color on the scale versus retail. We don't necessarily break it out as far as which sites are specifically suited one for the other. But I would say in general, Paul kind of mapped this out earlier in his comments around our initial phase at VA3, which is primarily geared toward colo, the DC2 facility, which recently came online, is more colo oriented. Obviously the LA1 15th floor that we'll be building out this year, will be more colo-oriented. As you look to our newer build, it's probably easier to look at them has been able to accommodate either, retail or scale or wholesale. Just on the modular fashion and you have a fresh floor plate that you can grow from. So, I think if you look at the next phase of VA3 for example, SV8, LA3, CH2, those are all able to accommodate both retail and scale or hyperscale. Paul Szurek : Dave, this is Paul. I just -- I would point you to page 13 of the supplemental. And I think you can kind of get the picture that it's a combination of tight occupancies and the market spread of where we had capacity like Santa Clara 97.3% occupied, I think you can easily interpret what that means for the ability to handle scale there. NY2, 77% occupied, more capacity to handle scale, but a less strong market, and I think that sort of illustrates the dynamic that we've been working through in 2018 and we'll be solving in 2019. Dave Rodgers : And then maybe a second question. I don't know, Jeff or Steve. But with regard to the Interconnect business, do you have any additional color or clarity commentary around the switching -- the larger switching gear of the customers and maybe any impact that you're able to kind of see now as we've gotten deeper into that process? Jeff Finnin : Yes, Dave. I would just add that we saw, obviously, some of that occurring in 2018. I would say it moderated in the fourth quarter. What that looks like going forward is obviously, we have estimates associated with it and we'll continue to monitor, customer movement and/or changes as we work through the year. But I can't put a number on it for you, but it is, we did see it moderate in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question. Nate Crossett : How do you guys think about land holdings in the long term? Obviously your product is dependent on having good locations and a lot of the markets you are in are tighter markets in terms of available supply. So how should we think about how you're positioning the land bank for the longer term? And maybe are there any new markets that are potentially on the table? Paul Szurek : Nate about the land bank. And I think the new parcel we put under contract in Santa Clara illustrates our approach that we -- as we said the last several quarters, we need to be more proactive than we have been in the past about acquiring, entitling and getting shovel-ready land for expansion in key markets. And so we had a rush to get the SV8 land, the CH2 land and the VA3 land in position to develop, to acquire and put -- it get in a position to develop. And we don't want to fall short like that again in the future. So we are active in all of our major markets to look for additional opportunities to expand. Land availability, property availability in these markets is the -- the supply can be somewhat a femoral. So you have to be in the market all the time looking for it, working on it, striving for off-market deals when you can -- and making them work in terms of connectivity and power and proximity. So again, look at the new land we have under contract in Santa Clara as an example of that. And I apologize, I forgot the second half of your question. Nate Crossett : Yes, are there any new markets that could be on the table? And maybe just your thoughts on U.S. like are you always going to be only U.S. or are you open to expanding kind of internationally? Paul Szurek : So let me try to answer this one. When we sit down with our major customers, really all the way down to the top 20 or 30 customers, the primary thing they value about us is that we keep expanding and these infill edge markets, where we exist. Because they have tremendous needs, they foresee significant needs during the future and they realize it is hard to proactively expand in those markets. That doesn't preclude us from going into other markets, when we can find the right conditions. And believe it or not, we do consistently look at opportunities, but we just haven't found the right ones. I think that would be more of a domestic thing if and when it happens, international may happen in the future, I wouldn't rule it out, but it's not something that we're focused on at this time. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Michael Funk : Just a few for -- if you could. First you mentioned earlier the other waves in cycles in the industry. Just curious how you're thinking on positioning CoreSite is so called skate to where the puck is going strategically based and where you see the market? Second part of the question is somebody asked earlier how you're feeling about -- about the kind of scale demand in general. I guess the freight is slightly differently versus where you stood a beginning of 2018, do you feel better or worse about about scale demand? And then finally in the last piece of the question would be any kind of commentary on build cost and what you're seeing there on an absolute basis, and then just trajectory too? Thank you. Paul Szurek : I would say we feel just as good about secular long term and intermediate-term and really even short-term demand at today as we did at the beginning of 2018. Using your hockey analogy, we just want to camp out in front of the goal, because we know that's where all the pucks ultimately end up. And having capacity in major metro infill markets that is crucial for low latency, high-performance applications for consumers and businesses, and as well as the Internet peering points, is a core part of our strategy and it's served us very well so far and we feel -- we still feel very good about that. In terms of build costs, I think they have come up, obviously a little bit more, I would say than general overall inflation over the last couple of years. It varies significantly market-to-market, labor costs are probably the most variable dynamic. Our design team does puts a lot of work into not constantly, but regularly updating our designs to create a more efficient and cost effective way to build to offset some of those costs. Our construction management team works very hard to keep them in line and our equipment procurement team consistently works through our supply chain to try to offset some of that, but you're still seeing some construction cost inflation. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Lukas Hartwich : Given the comments that leasing was held back by a lack of contiguous space, can you provide a little more color on frictional vacancy for the current portfolio? Paul Szurek : I'm sorry, on what vacancy? Lukas Hartwich : Frictional, is there -- I think you're in the low '90s right now, is there -- is that kind of a natural state, it's hard to get above that given the lack of contiguous space? Paul Szurek : I mean, really, again, I'd go back to the my response to an earlier comment. It really varies by market, but yes, there are markets where we are so tight in the -- or buildings that we're so tight that. And -- I think when you get above 91%, 92% you see this a lot more where you just don't have those contiguous spaces where you can handle 1 megawatt deployment much less 2 megawatts, 3 megawatts, 4 megawatts. Steve Smith : The only thing I would add to that is that I think our model does lend itself, in some cases, to tighten that up on occasion, because we do sell smaller deployments that in the right floor plate will allow us to fill that in tighter with smaller deployments, whether they are networks, smaller enterprises or the otherwise. So I think our model as opposed to being just focused on hyperscale where the -- either you have it or you don't, that's another reason why are we focused on trying to bring in more logos and get more diversity across our install base, so that we can fill in some of those other pockets. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Please state your question. Robert Gutman : So coming into 4Q, you'd expected I think 100 basis points of churn, extraordinary churn from the customer that churned about 70 basis points in the prior quarter. Net-net, the turnover came in lower sequentially, and I'm looking at guidance which is 6% to 8% for 2019. And I think you've prior set 2% to 2.5% per quarter through '19, which would be 8% to 10%. So how -- what's the color there on how your perspective on churn has changed? Secondly, if you could provide the number for new logos, which I think we have in prior quarters. And I have one follow up. Jeff Finnin : I saw your note this morning. So I appreciate you raising the question. Just to give you some color on the fourth quarter, first of all. As Steve alluded to, our churn in the fourth quarter was better than anticipated. We had a good outcome ultimately with the customer we were renewing the fourth quarter. And while they did churn some level of their space, it wasn't as a high as what we anticipated. So I think, overall, that was good news. In terms of 2019, the commentary I provided last quarter which is consistent with where we sit today is -- and we would expect elevated churn from somewhere between 2%, 2.5% in each of the two first quarters, so just the first half of the year. Second half of the year, we would expect that to be returning back to normal levels. So just factor that in, that should explain your question related to the guidance for the year. Robert Gutman : Thanks. And a... Jeff Finnin : Does that make sense? Robert Gutman : Number of new logos -- yes, that's great. Thank you, and about the new logos, number of new logos? Paul Szurek : What was the question around the number? Robert Gutman : I think we've had a number, it was 27, 28 in the prior quarters. Paul Szurek : Yes, sure. Robert Gutman : So what was the number of new logos for the fourth quarter? Paul Szurek : Yes, it was 32 this last quarter. Robert Gutman : Great. And the last thing is that with DC2 coming on at the end of the fourth quarter, rental expense was pretty flat quarter-over-quarter. Should we expect that to be higher in the first quarter and then the impact -- your view on EBITDA margin through the year? Jeff Finnin : Yes, great point Robert. The DC2 did come online very late in the fourth quarter. And so you will see an uptick here in the first quarter associated with that rent for that particular data center. And in terms of the adjusted EBITDA margins, if you look at our guidance, you can see that it's very flat compared to where we ended 2018. I think the implied EBITDA margin is at 54.4%, right in line with where we ended 2018. Operator : Our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please state your question. Jordan Sadler : Just a quick follow-up on the revenue growth guidance of 7.5%, Jeff, the total operating revenues. Do you have a breakdown of rental revenue versus power revenue growth? Jeff Finnin : I don't, George. What I would utilize though, you can see where those percentages came out for the full year of 2018, I would use that same pro-rata allocation as you will look at your estimates for 2019. I don't think those are going to be moving meaningfully. Jordan Sadler : Okay. So a similar split, I think, I had -- rental revenues were up 11% versus '17 for power something like that to a similar... Jeff Finnin : Yes. Jordan Sadler : Spread? Okay. Jeff Finnin : I think that's fair. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then I was just coming back to the interconnection question. It sounds like maybe that cycle of equipment upgrades maybe slowing a little bit. I'm not sure if I read that correctly in your commentary, but what does longer term growth look like in terms of interconnection revenue in your mind sort of three to five year? Jeff Finnin : Yes, I think, just maybe to clarify as it relates to some of the items that were impacting churn for the interconnection growth, I'm sorry in 2018. We alluded to some of the consolidation taking place inside the portfolio as one aspect of it, the second being some of the migration from 10 gig to 100 gig. And on the second, the migration, and there's only a minority of customers that really is applicable to. And so it's hard for us to ultimately forecast when it makes sense from their perspective based on the volume of traffic they are moving through those switches. It is something that we watch and try to make estimates on. I don't know if it's going to moderate for next year or not, but it's something we continue to watch. But just keep in mind, I think, it really is only applicable to a minority of our customers that we haven't based today. And then I've missed the last part of the question, second part. Jordan Sadler : I guess I'm just thinking like what does organic growth look for -- look like in the interconnection business three years or whatever as opposed -- you've seen this 200, I don't know, are we moderating by 200 basis points a year for the next three years or are we going to level off here at 8% is I guess sort of -- and I don't know if you can break that down between price and volume. I mean is price stable in cross connects or are the SDNs eroding price? Jeff Finnin : Yes. No, that's a great question and that's in area that we continue to focus and put a lot of energy into in terms of evaluating how best to monetize the value of the ecosystem that's there today and how to balance that with customer expectations. And as Steve alluded to, we're looking at various products that might enhance that, we're going to continue looking at it. I wish I could give you a definitive number and where that heads. Clearly, we would like to see it moderate rather than continuing to decline and we got to figure out ways to make sure that happens. Steve Smith : The only thing I'd tell you Jonathan is, if you look at the -- just the broader industry and technology as a whole, interconnection is not reducing, it's accelerating if anything. So the amount of interconnected things out there just continues to grow. And so I think that provides a good opportunity for the industry and for us as well and how we monetize that. We have physical versus logical interconnection, I think, is playing out as we speak and that's why we've made some of the investments around the OCX and providing the additional capabilities there. But I guess to answer maybe an embedded question that you had there around SDN eroding any pricing around physical cross connects, we have not seen that as of yet. Jeff Finnin : Jordan, one more thing I've to add as you think about longer-term growth. And that is, I do believe that the interconnection revenue growth is fairly correlated to the volume of kilowatts we're selling and the type of deployments that we are selling. And so keep that in mind as you think about the growth in the outer years. I do think it's little bit -- it's more correlated with the volume of kilowatts that we're selling. Jordan Sadler : That's fair. And no erosion in prices kind of what I heard on the physical cross connects. Jeff Finnin : I think that's accurate. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Paul Szurek for closing comments. Paul Szurek : First, thank you all for being on the call. Appreciate the interest and the good questions. One of the -- I forget which one of you and I apologize for that, but one of the analyst reports that came out overnight, mentioned that they were glad to have 2018 behind us, and for CoreSite. And I certainly appreciate that sentiment because it has been a year of transition from using up the native capacity that we had since IPO and moving into a new development phase of the Company. I honestly feel very good about what the team accomplished in 2018. And I'm not referring to myself, I probably have a longer list than any of you guys of things that I could have done better. But the people that I work with here had a really remarkable 2018 in terms of putting together the building blocks for future growth. From the construction progress that we made, the new land that we've entitled and started into the permitting and development process. The operational excellence and the high levels that we achieved in that and frankly greater efficiencies, the better power efficiency and there are a lot of other smaller building blocks throughout the organization in terms of IT and other areas that are really going to collectively be important as we go forward. So it was from the outside, it was a year of a lot of work, a lot of grinding work, but I feel good about what the team accomplished and I'm very excited as we move forward into 2019 and beyond. So thank you very much for your interest and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

Now at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And your hosting speaker Igor Khislavsky. Please go ahead. Igor Khislavsky : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President, and CEO, will provide a brief update on our U.S. business. And finally, Tom Bartlett, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our first quarter results and 2019 outlook in more detail. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before I begin, I will remind you that this call will contain Forward-Looking Statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding industry trends, as well as our future growth, including our 2019 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; the pacing and magnitude of the Indian carrier consolidation process and its impacts on American Tower, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2018, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now, please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. As expected, these results, as well as our year-over-year growth rates, were impacted by Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn. During the quarter, our property revenue grew 4.4% to $1.8 billion, our adjusted EBITDA grew by 5% to $1.1 billion and our consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share increased by 6.7% and 5.4% to $861 million and $1.94 per share respectively. Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by more than 44% to $397 million or $0.89 per diluted common share. Additionally, like last quarter, many of our comments around first quarter results and our 2019 outlook will be focused on growth rates normalized for carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. Normalized outlook growth rates also adjust for the non-recurrence of the impacts of the Tata settlement we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. We view these normalized results as important indicators of the underlying trends of our business. Reconciliations of these normalized metrics to our GAAP results are included in the back of our earnings presentation, in our press release and in our supplemental package. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jim. Jim Taiclet : Thanks Igor and good morning to everyone on the call. My remarks today will focus on the traditional first quarter report theme of our U.S. business, which accounts for the majority of our cash flows. ATC's U.S. operations continue to generate strong organic tenant billings growth, achieving 8.2% in Q1 2019. Rapidly rising mobile data usage in the range of 30% to 40% per year remains the underlying driver of demand for our U.S. assets. The sheer growth in the volume of mobile data traffic, plus consumers expectations of ubiquitous, higher quality coverage, motivate the national wireless carriers to continually invest in their networks to remain competitive. Consequently, we again expect U.S. aggregate mobile CapEx in 2019 to be on the order of $30 billion, as carriers preserve network quality and enhanced capacity. For ATC, we expect that to translate into significant lease amendment revenue growth on our towers, including for equipment to support the deployment of new and repurposed spectrum bands. Independent industry research estimates suggest that elevated usage trends will persist, as more advanced devices, applications and network technologies are introduced in the United States. One key projection is that by 2023, the average U.S. consumer mobile device is expected to consume nearly 50 gigabytes of data per month, which is nearly four times current levels. Meanwhile, industry analysts are also forecasting the deployment of more than 0.5 billion active IoT devices in the U.S. within the next five years . Taken together, in aggregate. Monthly U.S. mobile data usage is therefore predicted to exceed 20 exabytes by 2023, again, about four times today's levels. As our tenants seek to optimize their networks in the context of this tremendous usage growth, initial deployments and mobile operator planning for wider implementation of 5G have intensified. As described in their respective public statements, each U.S. wireless carrier is crafting its own individual approach to the rollout of this new technology. Each has outlined initial plans, based on specific spectrum assets, coverage goals and a number of other factors. At the same time, there are few fundamental 5G-related themes that we believe will be broad based throughout the industry. In addition to providing a more efficient technology to help support the existing pace of aggregate data demand growth, we expect 5G to usher in a variety of new products and services for both consumers and businesses. These will include numerous IoT functions and a host of other low latency, high bandwidth applications. And when it comes to 5G, we firmly believe that a substantial portion of that network investment will be oriented toward macro towers, utilizing sub-6 gigahertz spectrum to serve the needs of the 85% of the U.S. population that is living outside of urban areas. This is likely to include spectrum assets like 600 megahertz, 2.5 gigahertz, CBRS and the C-band, among others. All these bands, largely deployed on macro tower assets, will likely be utilized to achieve the capacity and the broad coverage needed to serve the topographic and demographic realities of the United States population. Importantly, we view our approximately 40,000-site macro tower portfolio as extremely well positioned to capture a significant portion of this activity during the evolution from 4G to 5G, similar to past network technology cycles. Our franchise real estate assets typically have significant incremental capacity and are located in high value areas, such as highway corridors and major suburbs. We contract for space on these assets under lease structures that have enabled us to maximize the revenue and cash flows throughout the mobile technology deployment cycle, while at the same time providing significant value to our tenants. We believe that the combination of the highest quality asset base and the resiliency of our carefully crafted commercial agreements, has contributed to the relative outperformance in our organic growth for the U.S. business within our domestic peer group. Slide 6 of our earnings deck provides a quick overview of our recent U.S. track record. As you can see, U.S. organic tenant billings growth since 2015 has averaged more than 6.5% at American Tower, including another strong year expected now in 2019, at roughly 7%. An important component of this growth has been consistently low churn, averaging under 2% over the same time period, which correlates directly with our lease arrangements and ability to mitigate churn events, including those resulting from carrier consolidation. We have also made a concerted effort to build and acquire low capital intensity assets that show attractive operating leverage. As a result, U.S. capital intensity for ATC has declined over time, as revenue has grown and maintenance CapEx has remained broadly consistent on a per site basis. Consequently, the overall return on invested capital for our U.S. tower assets has risen by nearly 240 basis points since 2015, with sites we have owned since 2010 generating an even higher ROIC, approaching 20%. Based on the underlying demand trends in the industry, the upcoming rollout of 5G, anticipated deployments of new spectrum and our strong competitive positioning, we expect that our core U.S. business will continue to produce favorable results over a multiyear period looking forward. At the same time, we are proactively looking for ways to further enhance our growth trajectory, augment the value of our existing assets and explore efficiencies through our innovation program. This program includes attracting new tenants and industries beyond our traditional telecom tenants, finding new ways to take advantage of the ground space at the base of our tower sites, along with a number of other opportunities. We have also made some relatively small investments in international fiber within that innovation framework, but continue to view U.S. fiber assets as inherently less attractive, due to the extensive availability of competitive fiber supply in the U.S. and the resulting less attractive growth and return characteristics of domestic U.S. fiber. One area of focus I will expand on for just a few minutes is the initiative that we are pursuing on EDGE data. As information generation and processing progressively moves to the network EDGE, particularly with respect to advanced IoT applications, we expect there to be a greater need for lower latency through distributed storage and compute functionality in close proximity to both wireless and wireline end consumers. As compute offerings may eventually serve autonomous vehicle networks, Interactive and immersive media delivery, content caching and any number of other products and services where low latency is a must or data needs to be closer to the consumer or the machine. We have been evaluating this for some time, and have an ongoing EDGE compute trials at several of our tower sites. In addition, we recently acquired Colo ATL, an interconnection facility in Atlanta to further explore the latency and distributed transport networks and had a firsthand look at the early stages of the cloud evolution to the EDGE that we expect to see accelerate the future. Colo ATL is exactly the type of asset that is ideally suited for our innovation program. The $70 million or so purchase price represents a roughly 15 times year-one adjusted EBITDA multiple and we expect additional growth as this facility is leased up, driving an attractive return on the existing business. Even more importantly, Colo ATL affords us the opportunity to learn firsthand about the evolution of connectivity for consumers' devices, IoT units and autonomous vehicles to the cloud. This includes direct and interactive knowledge of potential future tenant needs, key trends like cloud gaming technology developments, like hybrid cloud and a host of other aspects that we could not evaluate and prototype with partners without owning an asset like this. At the same time, I will emphasize to everyone that projects like Colo ATL do not indicate a shift in strategy or a material pivot in focus for American Tower. On the contrary, our innovation investments are designed primarily to drive additional tenant leasing growth on our tower and in-building systems, whether it be from existing or new customers and adjacent assets that enhance the leasing value and potential of the tower. Importantly, we will apply the same capital allocation discipline that we have used for our tower acquisitions over the years to sizable innovation-related investments that we might explore. In the U.S., in particular, we believe those existing assets are poised to deliver continued strong performance, based on the drivers I referenced earlier. In short, we anticipate more equipment finding its way onto more of our sites as network quality and performance remain essential to our domestic wireless operator tenants. Moreover, whether there are three national wireless players or four in the U.S., the number of subscribers will remain consistent and these subscribers will continue to expand their data usage. Therefore, in either a four or three carrier market, we would continue to expect 30% to 40% annual mobile data usage growth, roughly $30 billion of industry CapEx annually and further deployment of 4G and 5G equipment on towers. Consequently, we expect to generate continued solid U.S. organic growth and attractive returns over our planning cycle. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to go through our results for the quarter and our 2019 outlook. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Following a strong finish to 2018, we kicked off 2019 with a terrific set of results. Our Q1 U.S. organic tenant billings growth came in at over 8%, new business trends throughout our Latin America and EMEA segments remained solid, the recovery in India continue to progress in line with our expectations and we constructed over 700 sites globally. We also grew our common stock dividend by 20% over the prior year quarter, while continuing to deploy capital to both our core business and to select innovation-oriented investments that Jim just mentioned. With that, let's take a deep dive into our first quarter results and our outlook for the full-year. If you please turn to Slide 8. During the quarter, we generated consolidated organic tenant billings growth, normalized for the impacts of Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn of over 8%. More than 6% of this was driven by volume growth from gross new business. From a segment perspective, our U.S. region reported property revenue growth for the period of nearly 6%, including a negative impact of 2.3% from lower non-cash straight-line revenue recognition. This reflected our second consecutive quarter of record new business contributions, leading to organic tenant billings growth of 8.2%. Volume growth from co-locations and amendments contributed over 6%, while pricing escalators contributed just over 3%. This was partially offset by churn of about 1.3%. Our major U.S. wireless carrier customers continue to make significant network investments to keep pace with the growing mobile data usage. And we again saw activity, largely weighted toward amendments in the quarter. Our reported international property revenue growth during the period was about 3%, including a negative impact of 9% due to the Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn. Underpinning this growth was normalized organic tenant billings growth of over 8%. International new business was supported by significant network spending from tenants across our footprint, especially in key markets like India, Mexico and South Africa. New business revenue from co-locations and amendments drove about 6% of the growth, while escalators contributed nearly 4%. Other run rate items added nearly 1% with normal due course churn offsetting the items above by just over 2%. As expected, the flow-through financial impacts due to the India carrier consolidation churn accelerated in the quarter and Q1 should be the high watermark for the year, regards this consolidation churn. Consequently, we expect to see sequential improvement in India churn starting in Q2 and anticipate that overall organic tenant billings growth rates in the market to approach historical rates beginning in 2020. In fact, even in this past quarter, normalized organic tenant billings growth in Asia was over 10%. And finally, the day one revenue associated with the more than 25,000 sites we have added over the course of the last year, contributed another 4.2% to our global tenant billings growth. These new assets included our acquisitions of around 20,000 sites from Vodafone and Idea in India, as well as the nearly 3,200 newly constructed sites, built primarily in our international markets. Our average day one U.S. dollar denominated NOI yields were nearly 12%. New builds continue to be an integral part of our capital deployment program. We had a strong quarter of activity in Q1 across our international markets, constructing more than double the number of sites we built in Q1 of 2018. In India, we sustained momentum from last quarter and built over 540 sites, while also building nearly 100 sites in both EMEA and Latin America. Importantly, the day one NOI yield on these sites remained extremely attractive, with yields on new builds in India and EMEA, in particular, generating initial NOI yields in the mid-teen percent range. This activity is an extension of the historical success we have had building sites across our diverse international portfolio where carriers continue to make significant investments in network coverage and capacity. In fact, more than 15% of our total international portfolio is comprised of sites we have constructed, with NOI yields on those sites now in the 20% range. And as I will touch on later, given the attractive economics of these projects and the strong demand for additional towers, particularly in India and Africa, we expect our construction activity to ramp throughout the year. Turning to Slide 9. We also generated solid adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth during the first quarter, driven by the strong revenue growth and diligent management of operating industry - interest expense and seasonally low maintenance CapEx. Adjusted EBITDA grew by nearly 5% with our adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to about 61.5%. Normalized adjusted EBITDA growth was over 9%, resulting in normalized adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 62%. These results included benefits from recent investments we have made in power and fuel, particularly in our African markets, where we continue to optimize our processes and invest in solutions like lithium-ion batteries and solar power. As a result of these investments, for example, we reduced our generator run hours in Africa by over 15% as compared to Q1 of 2018 and continue to look for ways to further reduce our fuel consumption. We also drove solid consolidated AFFO and AFFO per share in Q1. Consolidated AFFO grew by nearly 7% and consolidated AFFO per share grew over 5% to $1.94 per share, while AFFO attributable to common stockholders grew nearly 8% or over 6% per share. On a normalized basis, consolidated AFFO grew by over 11% or nearly 10% per share. This was driven largely by our strong cash adjusted EBITDA growth, as well as prudent maintenance of our balance sheet. In addition, our Q1 results also benefited from the lower seasonally adjusted maintenance CapEx levels, which we expect will revert to a more typical range as we move through the rest of the year. Turning to Slide 10. Let's now take a look at our expectations for 2019, which are largely consistent with the outlook we previously reviewed with you, given we only issued guidance just a short while ago. At this point, we are reiterating our expectations for organic tenant billings growth across all of our geographic segments. Trends continue to be roughly in line with our prior assumptions. We continue to expect normalized international organic tenant billings growth to be about 50 basis points higher than our U.S. organic tenant billings growth of about 7%. These projections include a record year of contributions from co-locations and amendments throughout the business, just as we discussed last quarter. We expect to see a return to positive organic tenant billings growth in our international business by Q4, after flushing out most of the remaining Indian carrier consolidated churn. Looking at Slide 11. At this point, we are also maintaining our expectations for 2019 property revenue, despite FX headwinds of around $13 million versus our prior outlook. Current assumptions reflect a $10 million increase in U.S. revenue versus our prior outlook, primarily driven by the combination of slightly higher straight-line revenue and acquisitions closed in the quarter. In addition, we expect around $3 million in outperformance internationally, including higher new build assumptions, particularly in EMEA. We view this is an early indication of increasing demand for tower space in the region. We are also reconfirming our expectations for adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of our outlook, despite approximately $14 million in unfavorable FX translation. This is primarily due to the revenue items I just mentioned, as well as some slight outperformance on the operating expense side throughout the business. And lastly, we are reiterating our expectations for consolidated AFFO for the year, with the business offsetting about $12 million in unfavorable FX. On a per share basis, we continue to expect normalized growth of over 9% at the midpoint, reflecting our strong operating leverage. Moving to Slide 12. I would like to now briefly discuss our capital allocation plans for the year and the success of our capital allocation program historically. We continue to target our annual common stock dividend growth of at least 20%, subject to discretion of the Board and expect to declare roughly $1.7 billion in dividends in 2019. In addition, we plan to deploy $1 billion toward our CapEx program with over 80% of that spending being discretionary in nature. This is up $50 million as compared to our prior expectations, driven by a 250-site increase in expected new builds for the year. We now expect to construct almost 3,300 sites at the midpoint during 2019, which would represent a new record for American Tower. This speaks to the tremendous long-term opportunity we have in our existing markets to add incremental scale and help our tenants add coverage and capacity to their networks. Importantly, and as I mentioned earlier, most of our new builds are concentrated in our India and African markets, where initial NOI yields on new site builds were in the mid-teens in Q1. We are especially pleased by the progress we have made in Nigeria, our largest market in Africa, where we have a strong new build pipeline. And finally, taking into account the M&A we have completed year-to-date, the first part of the Tata's options being exercised in our India business that were redeemed in Q1, and the second part that we would expect to redeem in late Q2 or early Q3, we have committed roughly $900 million to acquisitions. Our capital allocation plan for 2019 is firmly aligned with our capital allocation methodology we have used over the last decade to drive attractive long-term returns. This process focuses on constructing and acquiring assets that have exclusive real estate rights, significant structural capacity, low capital intensity and the potential for sustained long-term growth in free cash flow generation, all at attractive price points. Since 2009, utilizing this criteria, we have amassed a high quality portfolio of communications infrastructure assets in the most significant free market democracies around the globe and expanded our global site count at an average annual rate of over 22%. This has driven a free cash flow CAGR of over 15% over the same period. That growing recurring free cash flow base has enabled us to further expand our portfolio, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and simultaneously returning capital to shareholders through our common stock dividend and share repurchase programs. Turning to Slide 13. A key part of our ability to deploy capital effectively has been an extensive evaluation of different asset classes within the communications infrastructure space, drawing on a large set of historical data. For example, while we have a leading portfolio of macro towers in the United States, we also have one of the largest network of indoor DAS systems in the United States and a smaller portfolio of outdoor small cells. We evaluate the performance of these assets regularly, to help inform our future investments in the U.S. and our international markets, where small cell densification is typically in earlier stages. As you can see on this slide, the performance of these assets has varied considerably over time, with towers indoor systems generating margins and returns significantly in excess of outdoor small cells. This divergent performance is in part due to the much higher tenancy ratios we have seen on towers and venue-based DAS systems, as opposed to outdoor networks with towers and indoor DAS at over 2 and non-venue outdoor DAS in the low 1% range. Additionally, the capital intensity of outdoor systems in the U.S. is higher with incremental CapEx generally required to secure additional tenants. And finally, the cash flows of small cell systems tend to be more non-recurring in nature, due to the non-cash prepaid amortization revenue associated with upfront capital contributions. Armed with this historical data, we have optimized our capital allocation decisions over time to ensure that capital is deployed to more attractive projects, centered on inherently more attractive assets. This drove our decision to increase the scale of our macro tower and indoor system portfolio in the U.S. through large transactions with GTP and Verizon, for example, while passing on large U.S. fiber assets that have been available for sale. Importantly, we expect to utilize this framework within our innovation program as well. Significant innovation investments, just like the investments we make in our core business, must conform to the same rigorous database criteria, as well as the governance and decision-making approval process. Turning to Slide 14 and in summary, 2019 is off to a strong start in American Tower with solid organic trends being realized across our global footprint. Our U.S. business generated organic tenant billings growth of 8% or above for the second consecutive quarter, while new business in EMEA and India continues to build. We have also increased assumptions for new site builds, driven primarily by the elevated demand from our carrier customers in Nigeria, which speaks to the tremendous need for incremental coverage in the emerging markets we serve, as the technological migration to 4G continues. We were able to translate this strong top line growth and the solid growth in adjusted EBITDA and solid AFFO per share and expect to grow AFFO per share on a normalized basis by over 9% for the full-year. Additionally, we remain firmly committed to growing our common stock dividend, subject to the Board's discretion, as a key part of our total return formula, while maintaining our long-held financial policies and investment-grade credit rating. All in all, we expect 2019 to be another solid year and look forward to updating you all on our continued progress in July. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator, so we can jump into some Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] With that being said, we will go straight to the first question from Brandon Nispel, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brandon Nispel : Great, thanks for taking my questions. I had two if I could. First in the US business, another strong quarter of 8%-plus growth. I think some people had thought that that could never happen, given the size of your business. Can you maybe unpack that growth in terms of what percentage of your new leasing activity is coming from the big four US carriers and was hoping that you could also impact your guidance along the same lines for the year? Secondly, one of the things that we get questions on, and I thought was highlighted really well on the call, was the return on investment in the US business. When you think about the different international markets you had and maybe particularly India, I was hoping you could comment on your longer-term expectations for return on investment and whether or not there are any structural benefits or negatives that may make those markets less attractive from a return on investment standpoint. Thanks. Jim Taiclet : So Brandon, good morning. The percent of US business coming from the big four carriers in the United States, both for the quarter and our expectations for the year is going to range 85% to 90%, coming from those four companies. So that is similar for both current results and for the guidance for the year. And then when it comes to India and emerging markets in that, Asia generally low to mid-teen percent ROI is our ultimate goal, or ROIC. So we expect to attain that within the planning period, which is 10 years for each investment, so with the Viom investment a couple - three years old, we expect by the mid-2020s that we should be able to achieve that kind of level. Tom Bartlett : And just to add on, just on the color on the growth. Again, we are still, as I mentioned, largely amendment-driven in 2019, and I would expect that to be the same really. For the balance of the year, it is probably 80 :20 kind of relationship. And as Jim mentioned, on the ROI, I mean if you take a look at the U.S. actually in EMEA and LATAM, our ROICs in those markets are largely 10% at this point in time. Now given the consolidated churn that we have seen in India, the ROIC in that particular region is below 10%, probably in that 6% plus kind of range. So we would - obviously given the growth that we have seen in the market - by the way, in Q1 we had a record level of new co-locations in Mammoth, contributing to the organic growth in that market. So, and as I mentioned, there over kind of a 10% on a normalized basis growth. So we would definitely see that kind of expansion ROIC over the next several years. Brandon Nispel : And I guess, if I could just follow up quickly, 85% to 90% new leasing from Big Four, how does that compare with what you have seen historically? Tom Bartlett : It's very consistent with what we have seen historically. Operator : Thank you. And next question is from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. As it relates to your innovation program and I guess that is where the Colo ATL $70 million investment fits in. I'm just curious, how big is that program and what is the expectation or what expectation should we have for additional smaller, I guess what I would refer to as just trial type acquisitions, just to learn more about that market? And then secondly, as it relates to the US organic guidance of around 7% versus the 8% plus you just did that obviously would imply then that we should see a notable step down as we go through the year. How should we interpret that in terms of what might be driving that slowdown as we go through? Thanks. Jim Taiclet : Colby, good morning. It's Jim. On the innovation program, we are essentially in the exploratory and prototyping phase with outside customers, including in some areas the big four or international markets, there is sort of a prevalence overseas in markets, whether it's energy management or it's figuring out what the EDGE data plan is going to be, is often with our current customers. And secondly, we are trying to understand and prototype projects with customers - potential customers that might scale in industries other than telecommunications, which will need those kind of assets, so the kind of assets that we provide, which are tower sites and indoor DAS systems, predominantly. So that is the realm of the program. What we spent so far to-date on capital expense has been - and mergers and acquisitions has been about $1 billion total. The bulk of that in five related assets outside the US, whose predominant purpose at ATC is to connect fiber to towers in markets and countries where there isn't a robust fiber supply base, like there is in the US. So for 4G sites and certainly for 5G, every tower is ultimately going to need a fiber like connection or fiber connection to it and we are making most of our investments to lay the groundwork literally for that to happen in emerging markets. And so, as Tom said, we are only going to make investments in assets and in locations and for applications that we expect to meet our return criteria similar to towers. Tom Bartlett : And Colby, regarding to your second question, at this point of time in the year we are keeping our annual guidance roughly the same. Really the only issue with the guidance is, as I mentioned, kind of a short while ago, we continue - we are seeing the same positive trends we expected when we originally rolled out the guidance just a couple of months ago. Coming into the year, you always have more visibility into the first half. So makes sense that you would expect a stronger first half, and as you know, as we progress through the year and in July, to the extent that we see some different trends, hopefully, we will see upside, but we will see, and we will update that guidance in July. Colby Synesael : So, nothing specific that you are thinking of that would clearly lead to a step down? I guess, sounds like just more conservatism at this point than anything else. Tom Bartlett : Yeah, I think that is fair. I mean I think we have strong application pipelines. The US group is - our US team is excited about this types of activity that they are seeing and we are coming off a very strong first quarter, and hopefully, we will see some of those continuing trends going forward. Jim Taiclet : There is one mathematical factor in addition to that, which is the quarterly comps from year-to-year can vary. Right? So in 2018 at ATC, we had relatively lower growth than later in the year, and this year we are having initially high growth and we have kept our guidance, as Tom said, for the following quarter. So even the comps mathematically, simply give you a little bit of a different answer, if you will, going forward. So again, we will update everything based on what actually happens over the next couple of months. Colby Synesael : Thank you. Operator : And next question is from the line of Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great, thanks a lot. I wonder if we could talk a little bit about some of the international markets. Can you drive it a little bit more into the individual markets in Latin America and EMEA, what are you seeing, where it's strong, where it's a little bit slower? And also in Europe, there is a lot of portfolios that are potentially being offered by the carriers. How do you think about that market and is there likely to be any value there to cause you to do more in that area? Thanks. Jim Taiclet : Sure, Simon. Some of the strong international markets continue to be Mexico, which is having a 4G campaign, if you will, between the new entrant Altan, and some of the incumbents that are already there. Brazil has also been strong. All four of their wireless operators there are competing in deploying 3G and 4G. In spite of all that there are some lower escalators based on inflation, and also some slightly higher churn in the markets, due to some Nextel legacy items that is it rolling off, which we expected anyway. But overall gross growth rates, as Tom suggests, in Brazil are really strong. India is really coming back on the new business, the gross new business, if you will, before churn and we expect that trend to continue, especially with the rights offerings and other capital raising activities of Idea, Vodafone and Airtel along the way. So when you add it all up, it's about 10% plus normalized organic growth in our international markets in our forecast this year. As far as European assets, so we are going to look at them through the same lens we have always looked at them through, most likely lower growth than some of our current markets. including the US. Also some industry structure concerns over there that could also inhibit growth in returns and frankly, there is a new investor class coming into that space, it has come into that space that has lower return criteria and until that changes, because we are not changing our investment criteria, we may or may not act in a large way in Europe. Simon Flannery : And the industry structure means less than four players or what is that kind of comment? Jim Taiclet : Well there are three or four mobile operators in all the markets which - in Europe, which causes them to be highly competitive, it's tougher for them to - because the countries are smaller in scale than, say, the US is to invest as sort of rapidly, historically, than the US will invest. So growth rates tend to be a little bit lower. And then there is the standard supply side of towers in Europe, which tend to be shorter, a lot of overlap and often some churn that comes with infrastructure consolidation that you have to absorb if you are into these businesses. So those are some of the structural issues in Europe that we think retard the growth rate potential a little bit. Tom Bartlett : Even, Simon, if you take a look at the press release, just look down the segment information, you can see some of the growth we had in the quarter internationally in co-locations and amendments and we have roughly $32 million of new business versus $27 million from last year. So I think they are all strong growth, and it's largely being led by India. I mean, the - Latin America continues to be strong and EMEA is up a little bit, but India has actually been kind of the driving force in Q1. So just something to look at. Simon Flannery : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Batya Levi, UBS. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great, thank you. In the U.S., can you provide maybe a little bit more color on the type of early activity and applications you are seeing related to 4G deployments and how do you think that changes the 80 :20 amendment new lease mix going forward? Do you think some of that new business has gone toward carrier-owned towers or maybe other private companies? And just lastly, can you provide an update on the monthly revenues you get from the amendment today, how is that been increasing over time? Jim Taiclet : I mean I think the question was on the 5G, what are you actually seeing relative to deployment of 5G activity on the towers, is that correct? Batya Levi : That is right. Then amendment, new lease and if you think some of that activity is actually going toward their own towers or other private companies? Jim Taiclet : Well, I don't know about that mix. I can tell you that I mean it's a better question for the carriers themselves in terms of the types of things that they are deploying. But I'm sure that they are 4G enhanced, they are 5G radios that are being deployed as we speak. So that when 5G gets turned on, it's really just a kind of a software upgrade. So I'm certain that they are those applications. I don't know what the percentage is relative to how much of that activity is normal - to normal kind of 4G activity, but I'm certain that the carriers themselves are deploying that kind of technology. I mean if you look at T-Mobile, they talked about 600 megahertz being rolled out to really support their nationwide 5G capability. So you know those types of radios are being deployed. And relative to amendment activity, as I said, overall amendments are roughly 80%. The activity that we are seeing from an application and a - perspective in the United States, they are probably in the $800, $900 range, given the level of equipment that is being put on the sites and amending those particular leases. Batya Levi : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of David Barden, Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I guess, to start. First would be, SBA went out of their way to call out Dish as a new business driver for them. Sounds like they were willing to be flexible to kind of accommodate some Dish's challenges that they look to kind of get their 2020 deadline fulfilled. So I was wondering if you guys could kind of address that opportunity and what it's contributing to this kind of 8.2% domestic growth rate that we are seeing today? And then the second is, Jio in India has spoken publicly about trying to monetize its roughly 100,000 tower portfolio, and I could see how that might represent a potential risk if it fell into an independent operator's hands or a potential opportunity if it represented a consolidation opportunity for American Tower. So I wonder if you could talk about the risk-opportunity that Jio represents in their tower portfolio? Thanks. Jim Taiclet : As far as specific customers, including Dish, David, we don't comment on either negotiations contracts or new business flow with any of them, but you can assume that for us Dish is within that 10% to 15% non-major carrier new business ratio that we talked about earlier. As far as Jio, yes, there are press reports about the company exploring ways to either refinance or monetize or spin off tower and fiber assets. we will stay abreast of those developments. Historically, when independent investors eventually get a hold, if they do of carrier-owned tower assets that is good for the tower industry, because the contracts tend to be arm's length and more of what I would call sort of industry standard, once the outside owners are in control of the assets and not the captive carrier business. So it will be a positive if it comes through. Either way, I don't see it as a risk at all. David Barden : Okay, great, thanks guys. Operator : And next question is from the line of Ric Prentiss, Raymond James. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Good morning, guys. A couple of follow-ups and then one deeper question. First, when you guys talk about 80 :20 amendment co-lo, how do you count if an existing customer comes and wants to do more work at the tower, maybe also including a new RAD center. Is that still counting as an amendment? Jim Taiclet : Generally, Ric, that would be a separate lease, but based on specific customers or circumstances or legacy contract that may be on the tower it could be different, but generally a new RAD center equates to a new lease which would count as a co-location. Ric Prentiss : Okay. And second one, one of the other tower guys mentioned that they had explicitly kind of assumed in their guidance a combination in the US from four to three, at least on their services business. Is there anything baked into your guidance on assumption of any industry change in the U.S.? Jim Taiclet : We don't have any assumptions either way baked into industry consolidation in the US. And given that we are almost halfway through the year, and by the time something might close, whatever the ramifications could occur from that, if it happened, would probably be out in 2020 and beyond. Ric Prentiss : Makes sense. The deeper question is, following up on Simon's question where you said the new investor classes coming in with lower return hurdles, is that driving also some of your thoughts that building towers might be able to create value than buying towers as you look at M&A? Jim Taiclet : Yes, because those new builds, whether inside or outside of the US tend to be historically for ATC the highest-return projects we have, it's always been that way, because you are meeting a specific need of a specific carrier in a specific geography versus buying a portfolio and sort of paying the acquisition premium for that. So it's historically been the best return activity we can do, and we will continue to do so, and as the batting order, Ric, of our capital allocation process has remained the same, we are going to fund our dividends first, we are going to build towers second, we are going to do M&A third, and if there is excess capital left over we will buy back equity or buy back stock. So that batting order remains the same. Ric Prentiss : Makes sense. Appreciate the batting order with the Rays doing pretty well. Final question wraps into that, does it make sense to sell any portions of your portfolio? Increased amount of joint ventures that people have lower return hurdles and have cash in their pocket, could we see you guys sell some more stakes in your Company to bring in fresh capital to deploy elsewhere? Jim Taiclet : We are always open to innovative financing and partnership arrangements, Ric, and you have seen us do that in numerous countries, whether they are with carriers or with independent financial partners like PGGM. In Europe, we are a 51/49 partner with them in both France and Germany. So yes, we are open to it and we don't have any sort of religious restrictions, whether it's getting into those stakes or getting out of them, if we think the economic situation merits that. Ric Prentiss : Great, thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Rollins, Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Hi, thanks and good morning. Just maybe staying on the strategic front, two questions. A few years back, you articulated the importance of being, I think it was the top three competitor in any market that you are in. I am just curious, in some of the key international markets, how do you evaluate that today and is that still important as you look at the new markets? And then going back to the question on partnerships, or the comments on partnership, are partnerships more important for the adjacent growth opportunities that you have been considering, for example, on the EDGE data center front or maybe some of the other initiatives where you need to try and edge out into a broader ecosystem? Thanks. Jim Taiclet : So we are already either first or second, Mike, in most of our major international markets, and by the way, we are first in the U.S. as an independent tower company and have been for some time. We are first in Brazil. And remember independent tower company is important here, because captive carrier assets, really to us, don't perform and aren't managed the same way. But nevertheless, in Brazil, we are number one in Mexico, we are number one, South Africa the number one independent, in India the number one independent. So we have achieved industry leadership as an independent infrastructure provider outside of carrier ownership and control in essentially all of the major markets that we care to be in. There is some where we are not and those were conscious decisions, like at the time in Nigeria where IHS was creating a larger market position than we currently have, will be a happy number two there for a while, it looks like. But, generally in the large major markets, we are the number one or two operator. As far as partnerships, we are applying our innovation initiatives really across the board. As I said, the PGGM partnership on a financial perspective in Europe was something that Tom and I talked about as an innovative way to bring capital in to support our ambitions in Europe. Similarly, and you pointed out specifically EDGE data. I think there is a great opportunity for us to bring the asset base that we bring, which is the 40,000 US towers and the 330 or 340 indoor DAS systems we have in the US, to a partner who brings something else, could it be spectrum, could it be cloud compute capability, could it be existing big larger datacenters, any of those are possible. So we have had to actually pivot our thinking to say partnerships can be, in an innovation sense, a much broader context than they are today, or they have been historically, I would say, in our industry, which is partnerships with wireless operators in some fashion, whether it's a sale leaseback, it's sublease et cetera with the mobile operators, those have always been in our industry. But now we are taking a much wider perspective on partnerships and figuring out, we hope where the puck is going, who can partner with our assets and bring theirs in a complementary fashion and that is a perspective we are now taking. Michael Rollins : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matthew Niknam, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Just on India, any more color you can share in terms of what is driving the growth activity, and then what gives you confidence in the ability of the business to actually return growth to sort of historical levels within the next couple of quarters, by 2020? Thanks. Jim Taiclet : So, the drivers in India, organic growth for us on a gross basis now are Jio and the other two major carriers, are actually ramping up as well. As I mentioned, they are going to be having access to proceeds from both rights issues, so equity investments from their end investors and also asset sales that they are all planning or expected to do. So, we think that those three carriers along with BSNL in a much more minor way, will continue to drive organic growth in India, because the three of them are going to need to establish a national 4G network, which although Jio gets a lot of headlines for doing it first, is, A, not pervasive across the country, and B, with the capacity to handle a billion users on 4G. So that spend is going to happen, there will be we think a significant increase in the number of sites and the loading on sites in India. And as Tom referenced, our most active construction program already is in India, to start serving this market. So when you look at, again, the fundamentals in the US, we talk about is 30% to 40% data growth, $30 billion of CapEx. In India, you are talking about even faster data growth rates on three times as many people, much earlier in the technology deployment cycle. So once the industry consolidation settles in over the course of 2019 and as we roll into 2020 and beyond, we fully expect between those three large carriers and BSNL that there will be strong top-line organic growth demand in India. Tom Bartlett : The other thing I would add Matt is that our own internal estimates, as well as outside third-party estimates is suggesting that kind of the roughly industry 600,000 tower leases that exist in the market are going to be growing to over 1 million over the next several years and I think that is just a reflection of all the things that Jim just talked to. Matthew Niknam : If I could just follow up, I think in the past you have talked about 3% to 4% sort of normalized longer-term churn in that market. Is that still the case and when do you sort of anticipate getting to more of a stabilized rate? Jim Taiclet : Actually, we think that probably the normalized rate of churn, which is if you back out what the impact of the India carrier consolidation churn in Q1, it is probably more in that 1% to 2% kind of range. So, half of what you just talked to. Matthew Niknam : And in terms of timing to get there, that sort of late 2020? Jim Taiclet : We realized that already in Q1. So we would think that as we are going out into the end of this year we will flush out all of that India carrier consolidated churn. So getting back into 2020, we should start to get back to those historical rates of what we have realized in terms of growth back in the 2016 and 2017 time frames. Matthew Niknam : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tim Horan, Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Tim Horan : Thanks, guys. Tom, I know you said normalized AFFO grew 11%. But if you normalize for the India churn, was that closer to 15%? Tom Bartlett : When I referred to the normalization, it's actually backing out that India carrier consolidated churn. Tim Horan : Great. Indoor - can you talk about what percentage of revenue indoor is in the United States now and do you think you are kind of growing at market rate? Jim Taiclet : The indoor DAS asset is about 2% to 3% of our US revenue at this point, and that is been growing about 10% recently. So pretty solid growth in that business, although, it's relatively small compared to the major tower asset we have in the US. Tim Horan : And then lastly on India, do you think with the consolidation being done and maybe more sales of assets that the pricing structure over there could look more like the US over time? It's a fairly unique market in terms of pricing. Jim Taiclet : The pricing is going to be in a different category than the US, but the long-term structure of contracts will, I think, evolve more closely to what I would call the global tower industry standard, where there is more favorable escalation rates, less favorable reinvestment rates et cetera on the sites and the elimination of discounts for second or third tenants along the way. So those sort of contract structural adjustments I expect to come over time in India, which will actually improve your effective pricing, frankly. But as far as rupees for per month per antenna, I can't predict where those are going to go. Tim Horan : Yeah. No, that is what I was looking for. That is very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we do have time for one additional question and that will be from the line of Philip Cusick, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip Cusick : Just before the bell. Jim, can you talk more about the potential model for your EDGE compute at the tower, any estimate on the potential number or percent of sites over time that that might generate and sort of relative rent versus a carrier? Thanks. Jim Taiclet : So there is a lot of uncertainty around all those factors Phil, and that is why we are broadening our access and involvement with other industries right now. So we are engaged with cloud providers, we are part of the CVRS team that is looking at how to deploy 3.5 spectrum, both within and without outside of mobile operators. We are involved and engaged, especially our CTO is, on innovation and technology task forces with other industries like the automotive industry, for example. So we are in a learning phase about a lot of these initiatives, including EDGE compute. But we are taking them in a methodical, serious and resourced way, so that we can be ahead of our industry, both in the U.S. and outside, because frankly we feel we are the only globally accessible tower company in the world that can reach really all the highly populated continents with a partner, and some of those partners will be global multinational companies, unlike even the national license holders we have in our tenant base today. So we do learn and prototype and determine all those factors. We know it's going to be important and we want to lead the wider industry in figuring out these tower sites. Because of their placement and their immediate proximity to the mobile RAN, radio access network, are going to be really important real estate assets that they should learn how to work with and we want them to work with us. Philip Cusick : Great. Thanks Jim. Operator : Thank you. Back over to speakers for any closing remarks. Jim Taiclet : Great, thank you everybody for joining. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining, you may now disconnect.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Carole Jorgensen, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Carole. Carole Jorgensen : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined here today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Maile Kaiser, Senior Vice President of Sales; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by the federal securities law, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risk is included in our filings with the SEC. Also on the call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information this is part of the full earnings release, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations page on our website at coresite.com. And now I will turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I will review our second quarter financial highlights, recap several significant second quarter events and provide an update on our development pipeline. First, I'd like to welcome to today's call Maile Kaiser who is substituting for Steve to cover our sales results and our sales strategy and execution. Steve is enjoying some well deserved family vacation time. Jeff will then take you through our financial results and financing activities and provide an updated guidance overview. Turning to our financial highlights for the quarter, we grew operating revenues 4.7% year-over-year delivered a $1.27 of FFO per share, grew adjusted EBITDA 2.4% year-over-year and achieved a record quarter for sales with $27.3 million of annualized rent including solid retail, scale, and new logo sales, and an unusually strong quarter for hyperscale sales, all of which Maile will discuss in more detail. Next I would like to highlight several significant events, some of which we shared on our call in April. First, our pre-lease at SV8 in Santa Clara. For two of the three phases at that data center with expected in-service timing of late Q3 for Phase 1 and late Q4 for Phase 2. Second closing on our SV9 property purchase, for a future data center addition to our Santa Clara campus. Third, closing the financing of senior notes totaling $400 million, and fourth receiving permits for LA3 data center leading to construction starting in early July. In addition to the SV8, SV9, and LA3 milestones, we also made substantial progress on the rest of our development pipeline. We completed construction at LA1 a data center expansion of 17,000 square feet, and also leased nearly 30% of the computer room to a large network and content provider. We completed construction of our last phase of LA2 and commenced the pre-lease of this data center expansion for the entire 28,000 square feet. We completed construction of VA3, Phase 1B, a purpose-built data center in Reston, Virginia, at 51,000 square feet. We advanced our ground-up construction of CH2 in Chicago, and we began pre-construction activities for SV9 including initiation of the environmental permitting and other early stage processes. Summing up we placed into service, about 100,000 square feet this quarter, of which, a third is leased. We have another 323,000 square feet under construction, of which we expect nearly 40% or 128,000 square feet to be completed this year. So we continue to make steady progress delivering on our commitment to provide more capacity in our markets and more large contiguous spaces to sell to customers. I'm grateful for the efforts of my colleagues in all of these areas. I also want to share a modest but important accomplishment related to our energy efficiency improvements. We were recently recognized by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power with an energy efficiency rebate of $3 million for the efficiency gains were achieved in 2018 based on our chiller plant replacement of LA2. Sustainability is an important ongoing goal for CoreSite, and we are pleased with both our energy savings and this award. As we look forward 2019 continues to be a transition year for us. We entered the year with a leasable capacity at lower levels than historical norms, and we plan to end 2019 with leasable capacity and quickly developable inventory at the higher levels we experienced in previous years. As I shared last quarter, to ensure a successful transition, our 2019 priorities include translating new construction into more abundant sales acquiring additional new customer logos, bringing new connectivity and customer service products online to drive sales and to delivering great customer experiences and operational efficiencies. I'm pleased that we are executing effectively on these priorities. That said, we have much work ahead of us, including ongoing sales execution for our existing and anticipated new capacity. Leasing at VA3 which is going well for retail that continues to be challenged by the supply and pricing for large-scale and hyperscale in that market, keeping construction on a good pace at CH2, SV8, and LA3, and obtaining entitlements, power, and permits for SV9. We are making important progress on the sales front, taking into account market dynamics. Hyperscale and large-scale leasing will continue to be lumpy as it has throughout our history as a company, but is currently challenging in Virginia. Outside Virginia, our market seem to be reasonably balanced in terms of supply and demand for our offering. We are pleased with the quarter and all that we've accomplished. The cycles of demand trends appear to be strong, however, the cyclical headwinds for Northern Virginia scale and hyperscale leasing and increased churn will affect the second half of the year. Jeff will discuss these items further in his comments. We've seen cycles of demand pick up quickly in the past, and this time we are ready to pounce with available data center space and shovel ready product. I have confidence in our teams, which are working diligently to address all of these activities and challenges and look forward to continuing to make progress toward stronger growth in 2020. With that I will turn the call over to Maile. Maile Kaiser : Thank you, Paul. Today, I'll start off with a summary of our quarterly sales and leasing results and then talk more about our sales strategy and execution. Moving to our sales. For the quarter, we had new and expansion sales of $27.3 million of annualized GAAP rent. These sales reflected a record quarter for CoreSite where we delivered solid core retail colocation sales and a large pre-lease at SV8 in addition to other scale leasing. Turning to a few highlights on our sales. Our $27.3 million of annualized GAAP rent for new and expansion sales included $5.3 million of core retail colocation sales and $22 million of hyperscale and scale leasing including our pre-lease at SV8. These new sales included a 143,000 net rentable square feet reflecting an average annualized GAAP rate of $191 per square foot and strong sales of new logos. Our $5.3 million of annualized GAAP rent for core retail colocation sales included solid pricing on a per kilowatt basis compared to our trailing 12-month average. Looking at new logos we won 43 new logos, compared to 30 last quarter. These new logo additions reflect the highest number of quarterly additions in five quarters include quality new brand names that enrich our ecosystem and represent total annual rent nearly double our trailing 12-month average. We believe these new logos should help drive future growth and remain a focus and priority for us. Renewals were another key aspect of our leasing. During the second quarter, our customer renewals included annualized GAAP rent of $24.1 million reflecting our growing base of business and strong customer relationships. Our renewals represented rent growth of 2.6% on a cash basis and 7.4% on a GAAP basis, but included, as anticipated, higher than historical churn of 2.4%. Next, I'll talk more about our sales strategy and execution. I've been with CoreSite seven years, and in my current role as the Head of Sales for about a year. I can best describe our Team Sales focus as what we refer to as the community effect. Simply put, we bring customers together to support their digital transformations and access to new technology, such as new cloud applications, like advanced and specialized development platforms, analytics or machine learning, edge storage, and cloud adjacent storage, security as a service, and other SaaS offerings, and content delivery platforms. We have a strong ecosystem as we're positioned at the network edge, which creates an ongoing cycle of attracting large cloud and network providers and enterprise customers, who need to Interconnect their workloads and care about performance, cost, and latency, and need our proximity to serve their teams and customers with very low latency. To build on our ecosystem, we are providing our customers tools to drive opportunities for them to navigate their digital transformations. For some customers this means providing access to solutions like the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange, which provides an efficient, flexible, and scalable SDN product, to interact with multiple cloud providers and CoreSite's SDN inter-site capabilities between markets that provide convenient options for WAN realignment as well as easy access to multiple cloud regions from a single market. For other customers, it may mean introducing them to our solution partners, which provide them access to important solution providers to speed and streamline our transition to a hybrid cloud architecture and empower them to manage and interconnect those related applications and workloads. As the market changes and shifts we are changing also. We continue to refine our go-to-market strategy for ongoing growth and community density, constantly working to attract new customers that value our ecosystem, serving new applications as they are created, and supporting new ways to serve the network edge as new technology and customer needs become more defined. As Paul mentioned, new capacity is coming online, which is critical to the customer opportunities we are pursuing. As we continue to demonstrate to our customers that we have the capacity for them to grow with us. In summary, while we've had a strong quarter, we believe we can continue to improve in retail, new logo, and scale sales, while constantly building on the community effect in our markets and periodically achieving complementary hyperscale sale. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Maile and hello, everyone. Today, I will review our financial results for the quarter, provide an overview of our April and July financing activities, and discuss our financial guidance. Turning to our detailed results for the quarter. Our total operating revenues were $142.9 million for the quarter, which increased 4.7% year-over-year and 2.9% sequentially. Operating revenues consisted of $121.1 million of rental, power, and related revenue, $18.8 million of interconnection revenue, and $3 million of office, light industrial, and other revenue. Interconnection revenue increased 7.8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. FFO was $1.27 per diluted share, which decreased $0.01 per share year-over-year and increased $0.02 per share sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA of $76.7 million, grew 2.4% year-over-year and 2.9% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.6% for the quarter, consistent with our trailing 12-month average of 53.8%. Sales and marketing expense totaled $5.8 million for the quarter or 4% of total operating revenues. General and administrative expense totaled $12.3 million for the quarter or 8.6% of total operating revenues, including elevated legal expenses, adding approximately $0.04 per share in costs this quarter that I will address further related to the impact on full-year guidance. We commenced 65,000 net rentable square feet of new and expansion leases for the quarter at an annualized GAAP rent of $176 per square foot, which represented $10.2 million of annualized GAAP rent. Moving to data center sales backlog. As of June 30th, the annualized GAAP rent from signed, but not yet commenced leases was $26.1 million or $29.5 million on a cash basis. We expect most of the GAAP backlog to commence in the next two quarters. Turning to our property operations and development. Same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent for the quarter was $1575, reflecting an increase of 6.1% year-over-year and an increase of 1.2% sequentially. Q2 same-store turnkey data center occupancy was 88.9%, a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year and a decrease of 30 basis points sequentially, which offsets some of the same-store growth in MRR per cabinet equivalent. We have 323,000 square feet of data center capacity under development. With a $191 million of cost incurred to date of estimated total cost of $528 million or $337 million of remaining cost to complete these projects. This includes all three phases of SV8 as well as LA3 Phase 1. For more details on our development projects please see Page 19 of our supplemental information. Capitalized interest was $3.6 million for the quarter and represented approximately 26% of total interest. Moving to our balance sheet. To recap and update our financing activities from our last call, on April 17th, we entered into a note purchase agreement and agreed to issue and sell an aggregate principal amount of $200 million of 4.11% Series A Senior Notes due April 2026 and $200 million of 4.31% Series B Senior Notes due April 2029. An initial aggregate principal amount of $325 million was issued on April 17, with the remaining $75 million issued on July 17. The proceeds from the notes were used to pay down outstanding amounts on the revolving portion of our senior unsecured credit facility. This provides us liquidity of $456 million, which includes credit available under the revolving credit facility, senior notes, and cash as of quarter end, that will be used primarily to fund the estimated $337 million of remaining current development pipeline costs. Turning to our financial guidance. As Paul mentioned, we've identified some headwinds in the last half of the year as it relates to sales in Northern Virginia and elevated levels of churn. For sales, this primarily relates to scale and hyperscale leasing in Virginia, where supply and demand dynamics are having a negative impact on pricing. And therefore, we are expecting more retail signings which support our expected returns for our business, and we are hopeful supply and demand dynamics for larger scale leasing will improve over the coming year. We also have recently identified additional churn for the last half of the year, resulting from customers terminating in end of life application or line of business or for some going out of business and deployments to the cloud, which will be elevated the next few months compared to historical trends. Fortunately, the elevated churn appears to support edge cloud provider demand on our campuses. We also have two other impacts to our financial guidance that are either event related or a reflection of timing. The first is our legal expense, which has increased and elevated our G&A costs this quarter. We anticipate incurring additional cost for a total full year negative impact of $0.09 per share. Another impact includes the timing of our commencements. We've had strong sales this year and we're focused on leveraging that momentum into the second half of 2019. However, we believe the timing of slower than expected sales commencements will impact this year's operating results. As a result, we are revising our guidance to reflect these items. Our 2019 guidance range is revised as follows. Total operating revenues of $570 million to $580 million with a midpoint of $575 million. Net income of $98 million to $103 million with a midpoint of $100.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $306 million to $311 million with a midpoint of $308.5 million. Net income per common diluted share of $2.04 to $2.10 with a midpoint of $2.07. FFO per diluted common share and OP unit of $5.07 to $5.13 per share with a midpoint for $5.10. Annual rental churn rate of 9% to 11% with a midpoint of 10%. This revised guidance reflects a decrease in FFO per share of $0.16 at the midpoint, largely attributable to $0.09 per share related to legal cost and $0.07 per share due to Northern Virginia sales, elevated churn, and timing of commencements. Please see page 23 of our supplemental earnings information for other guidance changes. In closing, we made significant progress in the second quarter including reporting a record sales quarter achieving substantial property development progress and closing a successful financing. As we move into the last half of 2019, the team will be working to continue our momentum despite the headwinds of churn in Northern Virginia scale leasing, which we will work through. Our business fundamentals are strong, and we will continue to focus on our goal to accelerate growth in 2020 and beyond. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, and good morning out there. So first I wanted to just address the changes in the guidance. If I could dig in a little bit more, the churn elevated again for the second consecutive quarter. Can you sort of identify with the specific drivers were that caused you to increase it again, sort of 90 days later, Jeff? I mean, I think you probably had a decent handle 90 days ago which caused you to increase the guidance there? And then here we are 90 days later with an incremental sizable bump at the midpoint, at least, to the overall churn rate. And I'm just wondering what's driving that, especially seven months into the year? Jeff Finnin : Yes, good morning, Jordan. Let me see if I can give you some color related to your question. And hopefully it helps explain the increases and what we're seeing inside the portfolio, but just a little bit more broadly speaking, if you look at our churn over the last several years, our average has been right around 7.3%. If you look at the bankruptcy that we talked about last quarter plus another small one we've got, that increases that average churn by about 120 basis points. So, all in there, you're at about 8.5% and what we've seen since that as we continue to look forward is we've got some additional customers who are looking to migrate some portion of their IT architecture into the cloud and that element of what is really resulting in the increase for this particular guidance is the incremental amount we're seeing and looking at for the rest of this year. And so that explains the timing associated with it. I think we are optimistic that we will retain a larger share than what we are of their deployments, but knowing what we know today, we felt more comfortable to increasing that guidance to the levels of which we have guidance. Jordan Sadler : So I guess I would characterize that reason as sort of a secular driver, I mean something that you guys have been experiencing and seeing broadly, you and your peers, for a couple of years. Is there, are you baking in some incremental room for additional potential customers to migrate to the cloud? Or how do you, what's with the sort of out-sized migration to the cloud to sort of happening in the back half, is just one large customer? Jeff Finnin : No, it's a handful of customers that are driving that. And most of that as Paul alluded to, and we're experiencing in three markets, two of those markets are on the West Coast, and so it is a-- I'd say, four or five customers that are really elevating that churn. And again, we just, we're estimating, we'd be able to retain more of their architecture than ultimately we think we're going to. I think to your comment is to it being a more broad secular driver, I think inside our portfolio, it hasn't been as big of a driver as what we're seeing this year. And so where we're spending more and more time is getting our arms around what that looks like in the next one to three years, so we could better understand that dynamic and make sure we're obviously communicating that as best as we can. We hope this is elevated for a single year and not a sign of a trend to come, but that's something we got to spend some more time on. Paul Szurek : Jordan this is Paul. I would just add two things. There is a little bit of a good news element to this churn we're experiencing because from what we can see pretty much all of it is going into the edge cloud cases that we're hosting. And so, it further cements the demand in our data centers for that activity. Secondly, as you know there is always different used cases that increase and then subside. And I think we're sort of at the tail end of the cycle of some of those historical use cases that are subsiding. So, I would expect, and Jeff and his team will dig into it much more extensively over the next couple of months, but I would expect that this will be a crest of churn for us and we'll see it subsiding in the coming couple of years. Jordan Sadler : Okay. That would be good. In terms of the timing of the churn, is it, I was surprised that it's a couple of hundred basis point increase since we're already past June 30, but has it churned out, have these guys churned out of the portfolio already or is this sort of a third quarter or fourth quarter event? Jeff Finnin : No, I mean the churn we experienced in the second quarter was right in line with what we had originally communicated, Jordan. So we had expected the Q3 churn to be elevated again at that 2.5%. I would say based upon what we know today, I would expect that churn in the third quarter to be somewhere between 3% and 3.5% and then back to around 2.5% in the fourth quarter. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Last question is just on legal costs. You're elevated, what is the source of these? And then could you give us the breakout again of, I just missed it in your prepared remarks, how much the impact was in this quarter? Paul Szurek : So, Jordan. This is ongoing litigation. So there's not a whole lot we could talk about. I can tell you it involves a dispute with a landlord in one of our smaller markets that started with the construction issue, there is, the normal disclosure in our 10-Q, which we'll be filling soon. And as with all ongoing litigation, there's just not a whole lot I should comment on beyond that. To clarify the numbers, though it affected the second quarter, $0.04 a share, and we expect the full-year impact and obviously it's not perfectly predictable, but to be about $0.09 a share, full year including the $0.04. Jeff Finnin : And just to add one more level, just for your modeling purposes if it helps, the incremental $0.05 for the year will be weighted toward the third quarter. Jordan Sadler : Okay. I'll yield the floor. Thanks guys. Jeff Finnin : You bet. Thanks, Jordan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Erik Rasmussen : Yes. Thanks. Maybe just circling back on that. I know you had given the outlook for FFO per share and it was a $0.16 sort of impact and $0.09 was coming from legal. You gave sort of three other reasons for the other $0.07, if you had to sort of weight those three Northern Virginia or the churn or timing of commencements, how would you say that those would be weighted in terms of those, the $0.07 for that remainder? Jeff Finnin : Yes, good morning, Erik. Yes, let me just go to some of the, obviously the public comments I said earlier in my prepared script, but you're correct, I did say that the $0.09 that was attributable-- the $0.09 of the $0.16 was attributable to the legal costs and the incremental $0.07 is largely attributable to the churn, the market conditions in Northern Virginia, and the timing commencements. Those three are relatively weighted equally to be quite honest. And just so that you also have again for just full transparency, given everything we've disclosed around our guidance, there are some offsetting, expense savings, some of it in SG&A, and in operating expenses, but it's largely attributable to those two items that we highlighted, and those three items weighted relatively equal. Erik Rasmussen : Great. Okay. Well then, in terms of, it maybe just asking in another way, the top line, there was a $10 million impact, what would you say sort of the primary driver there? Is it more of the churn that happened or is it the impact of slowness that you're seeing in Northern Virginia? Is there something else? And then I'll have just one more question. Jeff Finnin : Yes. I know that-- if you look at it from a topline perspective, those three have contributed to that $10 million reduction fairly equally at the top line. There is some additional power cost revenue also but the larger ones are the three that I mentioned weighted relatively equally. Erik Rasmussen : Okay, great. And then, I guess then, thinking of the set up for next year and expectations for sort of accelerated growth. And I'd say return to low double-digits, at this point where do you foresee sort of the biggest risk to hitting this target as we stand today? Jeff Finnin : Well, it's a great question, Erik. I think obviously based upon what we've just talked about in some of those items influencing 2019, is providing some headwinds, and those headwinds will impact 2020, and I think we've obviously got a lot of work ahead of us related to the back half of this year. In terms of the highest risk, I think ultimately, sales and churn are probably the two, I would elevate to the highest risk. Obviously, Steve, Maile and the team worked hard on the sales perspective, and we're doing what we can to minimize the churn, but I would say, those would be the two that I would say to elevate the highest. Paul Szurek : Yes, Eric. We have a lot of opportunity between now and year-end, we have a lot of capacity, so we definitely have the raw materials to have a very strong. We'll have a good growth year next year regardless, but the strength of it will depend on how well we can capitalize on the raw materials we have in place. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you for taking my questions. I guess just to be specific, do you still expect to achieve low double-digit growth in 2020 or is that now less likely? And I guess as part of that, are you still wanting to do a scale lease for SV8 Phase 3 or that something that you're looking to do retail with? And then, my other question, how much are you recognizing in termination fees or expecting to recognize in termination fees, considering all the churn in 2019, including specifically what you just occurred maybe in the second quarter to the extent that it's immaterial. Thanks. Paul Szurek : So, obviously, it's a little bit more challenging with the headwinds in Northern Virginia and not expecting as much scale and hyperscale sales out of Northern Virginia as we did six months to nine months ago, to hit double-digit growth, but it is still possible to do that for 2020, and then you carry that out with the capacity we have, in the markets that we have, and the much increased number of markets in which we have capacity, and it should be more sustainable thereafter. It's still possible. It's going to be a harder lift to get there. What was the second half of his question? Colby Synesael : SV8. Paul Szurek : Oh, on SV8, yes SV8, we will build that out as our traditional colo floor. Colby as you know we are flexible on all of our floors. They're designed where we can accommodate both scale, small hyperscale deployments, as well as retail deployments. And as we always do, we will pursue it on a broad range and make decisions based on customer ecosystem fit and pricing. Jeff Finnin : Colby, to address your third question as it relates to termination fee. We don't have anything material in the second quarter regarding termination fees. However, I think what you're referencing is probably the bankruptcy, the customer that on the previous bankruptcy that we talked about, and I think it's important to just give you a little bit of color around that. When we went through, we basically negotiated a lease modification with that particular customer. And as part of that process, we drove overall economics that would include some level of a termination fee, but it doesn't get called that just because of the way it gets accounted for. But just so you're aware, in the second quarter we had $0.01 a share from that particular customer. And we expect another $0.01 a share in the third quarter from that particular customer before they vacate that particular computer room. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Jeff Finnin : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. Robert Gutman : Thanks for taking the questions. First, in the scale leasing of $22 million, does that include any other hyperscale or hyper block or small deals besides SV8 1 and 2? Secondly, you mentioned $3 million energy efficiency rebate, and I think in the quarter a footnote it said you realized $1.7, so does that mean the balance gets recognized over the next two quarters and more broadly, how should we expect recurring at capex to play out in the second half of the year in light of that and ordinary spending? Maile Kaiser : Hi, Robert. This is Maile Kaiser, just to answer your first question on the scale leasing and hyperscale, there was other scale leasing in addition to the hyperscale that made up the $22 million and I'll let Jeff answer the other questions for you. Jeff Finnin : Yes, Robert. Paul alluded to his prepared remarks that we actually received $3 million, which is ultimately the cash that we received, and ultimately we allocated the $3 million pro rata to both recurring capex and expansion capex based upon the way we spent those dollars on the original project. And so, when we were spending the money. A portion of what we spent was included in recurring capex and that related to that portion that was already built. And then another portion was expansion capex, it related to the expansion of that particular data center, and so the $1.7 million just reflects the pro rata portion of that allocated to recurring capex initially and that's what's given you that, that decrease in recurring capex for the second quarter. Does that explain what you were asking? Robert Gutman : Sure, but I think it was also, recurring capex in the first quarter was elevated, now it's actually a positive number with the rebate, what should we expect it to be in the next several quarters, what's the normal rate? Jeff Finnin : Yes, that's a great question. So, I think if you just ignore the rebate in the second quarter, we would have had about $1 million of recurring capex in the second quarter, and obviously that's down just a little bit from the first. We've typically been forecasting somewhere between $1 million to $2 million per quarter of recurring capex for 2019, and that's what I would expect in the third and fourth quarter of this year. Robert Gutman : Thanks. One more if I may? In the commencements that were delayed, was that a function of the opening times, like construction or was it a function of customer accommodation moving in later? Paul Szurek : I think it really reflects the more new customers in this hybrid cloud type of architecture, and they tend to take longer to make some of the decisions they need to make to set up their space and even sometimes finalize the sales order for what they need. They have more decisions taking place than customers, typical customers two-three years ago would have had. Robert Gutman : Got it. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Maile Kaiser : I was just going to say, this is Maile Kaiser. And I would just add that, that it really is a lot of times customer-dependent on their timing and putting together all of that architecture in the design and if it's a migration versus a new project. All of those commencements can change. So, we're really at the mercy of their timing and requirements . Robert Gutman : Thank you very much. Jeff Finnin : You bet. Thanks, Robert. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Nick Del Deo : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, cloud has been putting some pressure on the MSP business model or at least forced them to evolve some. In a general sense, do you think MSPs and system integrators are as attractive customers for CoreSite as they used to be, or would you describe them as higher risk now? Paul Szurek : You know what I alluded earlier to churn we're having in traditional business models. I think we've seen over the last four-five years kind of steady bleed-off of MSP, hosting, some private cloud options that are not specifically geared to a hybrid cloud architecture. So I think a lot of our churn this year is related to some of those companies come into their final reckoning. So, yes, and we don't see those, Maile do we see those types of customers budget in our funnel these days? Maile Kaiser : Well, I think that we see them in a new form. So we definitely do quite a bit of business with SI and MSP but there are a smaller deployments and they're more aggregating hybrid cloud architecture and then helping to manage that hybrid cloud architecture. So, traditionally, they used to purchase larger deployments and try to build out their own private cloud. Now, what we're seeing those customers do, is provide additional services on top of a hybrid cloud architecture and deploying those services in our data centers. Nick Del Deo : Got it. Can you share what portion of revenue they represent? Jeff Finnin : Yes. I think if you do a deep dive, just depending on how you categorize it for us, Nick it's about 2% of our embedded here today. Nick Del Deo : Okay. So it's pretty small. Jeff Finnin : Yes. Nick Del Deo : Okay, that's helpful. And then one last one, would you consider the Northern Virginia market soft enough that any scale leasing renewals you're going to see in coming years are likely to face pricing pressure that you haven't historically seen? Paul Szurek : It depends on how quickly the market recovers. I don't think we have any coming up for a couple of years, but if market conditions persist today we probably would have some negative market-to-market on some scale leasing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Atkin with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Jon Atkin : Thanks. Got a couple, I'll ask them upfront and you can answer them in whatever order. But when you fail to close on a scale deal opportunity, is it because of churn? is it price? is it product? just curious to get a little color on deals that maybe came close, but didn't quite finish it? Secondly, on the new logos, I'm interested in kind of any qualitative color around the cross-connect intensity of the new logos you're bringing in? And also, is that primarily coming from channel or is that coming from the efforts of your direct sales people in terms of the new logos? And then on the churn, I was wondering if you could help us localize where on the West Coast? Is it some of your older inventory outside of Santa Clara and San Jose in Milpitas in Northern California? Or is it on the center of the campus that you were seeing some of the churn? And then in LA is it Alameda or One Wilshire? Thanks very much. Paul Szurek : So let me try to address everything except the new logos, and I'll let Maile address those. Obviously I get involved in every large scale deal and every one of them that we have missed on, I believe, were just 100% pricing, where the pricing was below what we thought was the right trade-off. And understand that if our retail sales in North Virginia-- if our retail sales in Northern Virginia were not going as well as they were, we'd probably be more tempted to take some of this discounted pricing, but we're doing pretty well on the retail bucket and that continues to seem to gather momentum. So right now I think we can continue to pursue that strategy for leasing up VA3 until better opportunities come along on the scale side. In terms of the churn again, most of this is, most of the churn within the Stender campus in Santa Clara and in Alameda at LA2 and obviously the Boston situation. So Maile you want to talk about the new logos? Maile Kaiser : Sure. So I think as we look to target new logos and bring on a new customers, we're looking for customers that value our ecosystem and our community effect, and with that and those deployments that are looking to be closer to the edge and interconnect their workloads with our service providers in our cloud on-ramps. We see that that brings in more cross connect activity. So we feel pretty good about the new customers that we've brought on, and the mix of customers, they're actually, about 55% of the new logos were coming from enterprise, and the rest were coming from network and cloud, and those enterprises are looking to interconnect with several cloud providers and network providers and services. So we expect to see a growth in cross connects with those customers coming on board. Jon Atkin : And then lastly, is there anyway to kind of characterize the close rate that you've seen, is it same close rate, but just kind of a smaller deal funnel late stage or what was kind of some of the dynamics that you've seen? And then going forward, would you characterize the late stage funnel as being at average levels, above average, below average as we sit here today? Maile Kaiser : So I think that the good news is, we are improving our win ratio that is one of our top priorities for 2019 in addition to improving sales productivity and increasing the funnel of new opportunities. So, both are critical. I think that we've seen an increase in the quality of new logos and opportunities in our funnel where we're trending in the right direction with our improved win rate. And again, our focus is on bringing in more and more customers that value our ecosystem and need access to cloud on ramps and the interconnection support that we provide in our data centers. Jon Atkin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question. Nate Crossett : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about yield for the development pipeline as you do more scale leasing? And do you think you'll be able to maintain that 12% to 16% that you quote or should we expect that range to kind of migrate lower the more scale that you do? Paul Szurek : So, Nate, it really depends on the market being very candid about Virginia, if we did a significant amount of scale in VA3 we would at today's pricing not hit that 12% threshold. On the other side of the coast that with, as long as we have an appropriate mix of retail, we can still do a significant amount of scale and hit our underwriting hurdles. And I believe that will be true for LA and Chicago based on the interest we're seeing in the early stages of construction, time will tell on those. But in those markets right now the supply demand balance seems to be much more healthy than it is in Northern Virginia. Nate Crossett : Okay, and then just longer term like what percent of your overall portfolio should we expect to be scale. I guess is there a certain threshold you don't want to go over, or is it just customer? Paul Szurek : It's really hard to give you any guidelines on that because it's going to vary based on pricing and supply and demand in each market. So I think that is going to be a derivative variable as opposed to an outright target. Nate Crossett : Okay and then on just the land bank, are there any other purchases like SV9 that are in the works? What's the amount of capital you're allocating toward kind of land purchases? Paul Szurek : I think it will be very modest going forward. We do want to, we've got SV9 in Santa Clara and very glad to have that. We will, down the road, probably need to acquire additional pieces of land in Los Angeles and Chicago. But we are good for a long time in Northern Virginia. We're good for a long time in the Northeast. And obviously we're in good shape in Santa Clara. Nate Crossett : Okay, so there is no new markets on the horizon any time soon. Paul Szurek : We keep looking at them. I'll be honest, the more we look at new markets, the more grateful I am to be in the markets that we're in. I think relative to our size and based on the quality of our markets in terms of supply and demand in the other drivers of demand. I think share per share we have more opportunity for growth relative to our size as far as I could tell among our peers. So time will tell if that's an accurate prediction, but I feel pretty good about where we are right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Frank Louthan : Great, thank you. So, talk to us a little bit about the pace of some of the hyperscale deals that you've got, when can we expect to see those kind of layer in and start billing? And I apologize if you already addressed this, but how do you feel about funding for that? do you, do you need to raise additional capital over the next 12 months to 18 months to fund those? Jeff Finnin : Hi, good morning Frank. Well, I think we did reference it, but let me just to make sure you caught what we said is, when you look at SV8 Phase 1 and Phase 2, which is really what is a majority of our backlog today, we've got 6 megawatts of that 12 coming online late Q3, and the remainder coming on late Q4. And so that's the timing associated with that particular deployment. In terms of liquidity, we've got about $335 million of remaining spend based on what's under construction today, and our liquidity, we ended the quarter at somewhere right around $460 million. So we've got plenty of liquidity to take care of what's under construction today, so I don't see any needs for additional liquidity before year-end. But, it is something we look at, and we always want to be watching the markets to ultimately see if we want to do something based upon pricing and where markets are headed. But as I look at it today, and I don't think there is a need to do anything. And we'll obviously probably have through the first half of next year without any real issues on the liquidity perspective. Frank Louthan : Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow up to the question, so SV8 Phase 1 and 2 in Q3 and Q4, what sort of the revenue ramp we should expect? Is this, with the hyperscale deal, is this going to be a longer revenue ramp for the full billing run rate or will they be sort of at full rate in those, by the end of each of those quarters? Jeff Finnin : I got to be a little careful here just due to the confidentiality we have with a customer. But just to help you out there, there is not a significant ramp there. I'd look at it fairly reasonable in terms of when it's coming online late Q3 and late Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Aryeh Klein : Thanks. So, of the 7% or so on historical churn, how much of that has been associated with cloud migration? And then in your prepared comments you mentioned that you're hopeful that pricing would improve in Northern Virginia over the next year or so, what could drive that since it seems very challenging right now? Jeff Finnin : Good morning Aryeh. If you look back historically, as it relates to our churn, and you know, you referenced that 7.3%, in terms of what's migrating to the cloud historically, it's been a relatively small percentage. We've had some of it over the years, but nothing to the levels of what we're seeing this year. So I would say, if I had to quantify it, it's somewhere around, call it 25 basis points to 40 basis points, maybe 25 basis points to 50 basis points on an annual basis. And I'm sorry Aryeh but what was the second question? Paul Szurek : Aryeh, let me, I think you're asking about the potential for change in the Northern Virginia market and what would drive that. Is that right? Aryeh Klein : Yes. Paul Szurek : I mean, I think we're already seeing a little bit in that some of the buildings that we expect to come out of the ground by now, appear to have been postponed, what is behind that in every case, we don't know. We do, we are aware of a couple of prospective builders who have publicly said they're going to go on pause and just look for build-to-suit opportunities. So, supply will be affected by those types of actions, demand will pick up probably when the cloud hyperscalers get into their next, get out of their absorption phase of what they leased in 2017 and 2018 and move into the phase of having to lease or produce additional capacity to accommodate the growth. Historically that tends to be about 12 months to 18 months cycle between the bottom of those cycles and coming back up more to the top. So maybe we're, I don't know 12 months away from that, but it's hard to predict with certainty. Is that, is that responsive? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rollins : Thanks. So a couple of follow-ups, if I could. So, first on the question of Virginia, from looking at the rent schedule correctly there is about $53 million of annualized rent. Based on current pricing, what would you estimate the revenue risk would be over time in the mark-to-market? Paul Szurek : We'd have to going to go back and calculate that relative to scale and retail, you know, Virginia still is primarily a retail data center campus for us and retail pricing has been pretty solid there. So, I don't know what the magnitude of that would be, but we'll try to present that on our next quarterly call. Jeff Finnin : Yes, Mike just to further that, as you look at the numbers we've disclosed, keep in mind, what's in DC1, DC2 is really the retail side of the business, and then the composition of the Reston campus. If I had to give you an estimate, it will give you something more solid, I'd probably say at least two thirds of that is going to be built up with our retail business. And so just keep that in mind as you think about that. And you guys are asking very good questions related to pricing and let us just dig into it more we'll give additional color and commentary on that as we move forward. Michael Rollins : And secondly as, as we think about the comments that you made on churn and the risk of customers migrating some infrastructure into the cloud. If we look at the segmentation schedule on Page 15 of the leases by size of NRSF, is there a story to tell of where their susceptibility in terms of the size of the leases? And is there some way that you've internally estimated like the long-term risk ,long-term exposure, where a certain class of the revenue is more susceptible to some of the migration that you're seeing from the handful of customers that you mentioned for this year? Jeff Finnin : Well, I think you're trying to look at it with, obviously, the information we've given as best as you can. And when I think about what we're seeing this year, I would say most of that churn is probably bucketed in two portions, one would be the 5000 or less square foot bucket and the other one would be between 5000 square foot bucket to 10,000 square foot bucket, and that's why you've seen some of the numbers being elevated just due to the size, but in terms of what, what that looks like going forward, where is our biggest susceptibility, that's a, it's a great question. I think that the most important thing is ultimately as Maile and Steve have alluded to in the past, we're ultimately trying to make sure we can address those hybrid cloud solutions. And the question is going to be, what portion of their architecture that we, that might reside with us today, either is retained with us or that moves to the cloud, and I can't, I don't think I have enough data today. It says because just see how much of that we've been experiencing, to be quite honest. It's just not that we're going have to dig into more and see if we can get it quantified for you. But just to give you an idea, those two buckets is where most of that churn resides today that I referenced earlier. Paul Szurek : And Michael, so far what we're seeing are really specialized use cases that are going into specialized edge cloud used cases. Most of what we have in our data centers, the network, the cloud obviously, that stuff is pretty impervious to migration of the cloud, and most of our enterprise occupancy is come in the last two, three years from customers that have already moved primarily into our data centers to do the hybrid cloud type of activity. I should point out, we also, one of our new logos this last quarter was somebody coming out of the cloud with a significant amount of capacity. So we're going to continue to see these dynamics and Jeff and his team have been working diligently this year to develop better predictive analytics around these things and it's still a work in progress, but I think we have enough visibility to not feel terrible about where the churn situation is with respect to cloud migration. Maile Kaiser : And this is Maile. I think just to highlight what Jeff and Paul have shared, as we see our customers start to take advantage of some of the workloads that they can put into the cloud, we are going to see that right size of the deployment. But we're also finding that it's the exact same reason that we are winning new hybrid cloud deployments due to that exact need to have their workloads connected with the cloud providers and with low latency in the edge market. So where on the one case, we do see some churn on the other case, we do see new logos and then we also see it feeding into our edge campus cloud customers. So kind of a three pieces to that puzzle. Michael Rollins : And so one final question. And so in the guidance change, the guidance for revenues changed, but not the interconnection revenue guidance. So, does that provide some observations about how your customers are valuing connectivity in that portion of what they get out of the data centers maybe to your point about the size of the deployment and if there's maybe some additional color there that would be great. Jeff Finnin : Yes, I think just to give you some quantity numbers, I think obviously year-to-date our interconnection revenues up 9.4% cumulatively year-to-date. I think our midpoint of our guidance is 8.3. So we're comfortable where our numbers are for this year, and obviously, we didn't change the guidance. I think we've seen, in the first two quarters, we've seen good volume growth inside our business and that does play toward ultimately those customers that are needing to connect, whether it's to the cloud, whether it's to the networks, actually it's some of both. The growth in interconnection inside our portfolio continues to be very strong for those people needing to connect to the cloud. And I don't think that dynamic is going to change or subside anytime soon. And as long as we can continue driving those types of deployments Maile described, I think that will continue, at what levels, not certain, but we're comfortable with where we are for 2019. Paul Szurek : Yes, Michael, on a micro level for an individual customer to the extent they're keeping some deployment in our data center, they will either maintain their current cloud connectivity or even increase it depending upon how many additional clouds they use and how they architecture to potentially connect to different cloud regions for additional resiliency. Maile Kaiser : And we've added a couple of new products into our interconnection portfolio as we've mentioned earlier the CoreSite interconnection Gateway that allows them to interconnect and manage the connectivity between workloads to different cloud providers, as well as the inter-site capabilities between markets. So connecting their existing deployment into a new market, so more interconnection product that we have, will continue to drive the interconnection revenue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Jon Petersen : Great, thanks for sticking with us here. So if I could just a little bit more on the churn, if you could just maybe give us how you're thinking about backfilling this level of churn, or maybe just to think about more from a real estate perspective, obviously your occupancy is going to be going down through the rest of the year. How should we expect that to trend in 2020? And as you think of about getting back to 2020 or getting back to double-digit growth in 2020, it's kind of a quick turnaround of releasing that space required? Maile Kaiser : Yes, hi, Jon, this is Maile. So we are actively pursuing backfill opportunities for any of the areas where we expect to see customers churn out. The good news is in most markets, the the location in which there, we're going to see that come back, is in turnkey colocation space and computer rooms, so very quick to be able to turnaround and support new customers. We've already been able to backfill a few opportunities and consistently look for pipeline to support the ones that are coming up. Jeff Finnin : It term of. Jon Petersen : Go ahead. Jeff Finnin : Jon, I'm sorry, I was just going to say in terms of occupancy, I mean if you look at our same-store portfolio, it's declined a little bit here over the last couple of quarters and I would expect that to continue as you point out, it's probably going to decline probably another 200 basis points to 300 basis points or before year-end based on the churn we're looking at today. Jon Petersen : Yes, that's kind of what I expected. I guess my thought, my question was more about as we look into 2020 do we expect that to reaccelerate? Paul Szurek : I think it would, Jon. As Maile was saying, this churn space is basically our generic bread and butter colocation product. So we just keep selling. Jon Petersen : Okay. I think you probably just answered this question, but just to be clear, when we think about your development pipeline versus this now vacant churn space, is there any different in kind of the ability to sell that space? And do you now have to kind of pulled in those markets where you now have more vacant space or are you going to pull back on new developments for a quarter or two while you backfill that vacant space? Paul Szurek : All the development that we have in process right now, we will continue to press forward on because we think we're going to need it. The new development quite honestly gives us the ability to handle much larger opportunities than what the churn space enables us to handle. The churn space just comes back into our generic retail colocation inventory. Jeff Finnin : And Jon the only change related to that is we did purposefully move back the completion of the Boston computer room due to the one computer room we're getting back. And so to your point, it helped, we're going to delay the completion of that room, but we still think longer term, we're going to need it. And as a result, we're continuing to move forward to just the timing is pushed back by quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Sami Badri : Thank you. My question has to do with visibility of these discontinuation of applications, you referred to some of your customers doing that. Now when this happens in your business, how much of general visibility do you have before it happens, before they have this conversation where they want to disengage out of colocation and move to another type of workload or just ended application. Do they communicate this to you, like every month when it happens, three months, six months just so we have an idea for as this transition takes place. We can just have an idea on how exactly the dynamics are impacting your ability to guide? Paul Szurek : So it really depends on the customer and the type in our traditional types of churn the SI, MSP, hosting companies that appear to be into their subsided cycle. We've generally been able to predict that based on the account representatives interactions with the customer plus some details around their activity in this space and historically we have been pretty accurate with that. Little bit harder to predict that with the things that might go to the cloud, because the customers themselves even though we are in close contact with them, are still evolving in some of these decisions, and so one month, it's yes we're not going to do anything for some period of time and then two months later, after more understanding of what cloud products are available, they make a change in decision. So that's why that segment is a little bit harder to predict than our traditional churn forecasting. Sami Badri : Got it. And then we talked a lot about Northern Virginia market softness and most of the people on this call probably know that Northern Virginia is a very major market. So would you say that this specific dynamic is isolated, or you know like the supply and demand dynamics. Would you say that these are isolated to Northern Virginia or do you think this is a overall sector deceleration that we're going to start hearing about in some of the other markets over the rest of the year. Paul Szurek : So in our markets. The only place we're seeing it is Northern Virginia, I've heard similar rumblings about the Phoenix and Dallas markets. But we're not in those markets, and I should also qualify that we're not, we don't have the capacity to be going after 12 megawatt to 18 megawatt deals in Northern Virginia. So, there might be less visibility for us into that particular subset of the market than others are seeing, and like you guys, I'm looking forward to seeing what we learn as our peers with activities in Northern Virginia report, in the next week or so, but so far, supply and demand, as I said, it looks pretty good in all of our other markets it looks pretty balanced, and again, the long-term secular drivers for demand. The new data products, the increase in the amount of content being pushed out. You know the increasing interaction with consumers and demand for lower latency, those all seem to be very much in place. And that's why we're seeing kind of consistent sales results across our core products and are hopeful of increasing that, over coming quarters, and why we still believe there will be periodically opportunistic sales for scale and hyperscale. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Richard Choe : Great, thank you. Just a follow-up on the churn aspect and migration to the cloud. Normally, the life cycle is you go from being in the cloud and move to dedicated, and so this is kind of a reversal of that, but I guess, given your comments so far, it seems like it's with certain applications and very specific, do you think this is going to be more broad based or is this very application-specific? And then in terms of maybe on the other side of it, it seems like that you're getting some benefit in that, you're not completely losing the customer in that they continue to want connectivity and infrastructure around cloud providers. So can you kind of maybe give us a bit of a more holistic view on kind of the net loss versus the net gain on that? Thank you. Paul Szurek : So, we actually track that pretty well, are pretty diligently, and so far between what we've leased for cloud applications, including all the different components of the cloud companies and edge cloud use cases plus what we've leased to companies coming into our data centers so that they could do hybrid cloud in the most secure and high performance way possible, we are way ahead on the whole cloud migration element. And I'm guessing If you talk to your colleagues in the enterprise space, they'd probably tell you that the vast majority of all migrations to the cloud are happening out of proprietary enterprise owned data centers. Again as I mentioned earlier, most of what we're seeing are specific use cases. And we're also seeing a lot of hybrid cloud that's coming to us specifically because they have the cloud operations right there on our campus or the direct cloud on ramps or the type of connectivity options we give them. So, net-net cloud is still a huge positive for us. Richard Choe : And then in terms of the backfilling, is speed of filling it more important or getting the right price in looking at the space that you're getting back? Paul Szurek : All of the above. Richard Choe : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks. I just want to clarify, has Northern Virginia become incrementally worse or you just reiterating prior comments around that market? Paul Szurek : So we've been saying for about two years now that pricing for scale and hyperscale is coming down in Northern Virginia, we didn't really get to acid test that until we were out responding to RFPs for the new space coming on in VA3 Phase 1B and based on that, I would say that it has over the last three months to six months has continued to deteriorate a bit. It may be bottoming out right now. Everyone certainly hope so, but that's, that's our perception of the market. Lukas Hartwich : Yes, it's maybe a little bit worse, and then you touched on this a little bit earlier, but in Boston. I noticed that a big chunk of square footage moved from stabilized to your held for development. But the AVR was the same. So I was trying to figure out what exactly went on there. Paul Szurek : That was just a space that was leased on a powered shell basis to a wholesale customer that's in one of those business models that has been declining for a while and to release it according to our normal colocation model we'll have to put some additional capital into that space to convert it from powered shell to colocation space. Lukas Hartwich : Got it. Paul Szurek : And until we do that, it's not available inventory. Lukas Hartwich : Got it. And then the rent didn't really move. Is that just a timing? Will that go down next quarter? Jeff Finnin : Yes, no it's, those powered shell, obviously are not leased at the same levels in which typical turnkey is, so it did come down, but it was offset by the lease modification we executed with the other customer, that will come down in the third quarter. Lukas Hartwich : Got it. That's it from me. Thank you. Jeff Finnin : You bet, Lukas. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Jon Atkin with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Jon Atkin : Thank you. Yes, just real quick on the new connectivity products that Maile was alluding to a couple of questions back, and I wondered, maybe if it be possible to learn a little bit about customer adoption. Is it new logos taking it on day one. Is it long-standing retail customers that are, that are beginning to kind of migrate to it. Are we still in kind of really early days here or is there a mature run rate to think about as people kind of adopts the Internet Gateway and other newer products. Thanks. Maile Kaiser : Absolutely. Thanks, Jon for the follow-up. So these are relatively new products. So I think it is still early stages, we are actively proposing them to existing customers that can take advantage of new sites and interconnecting the two sites together as well as reaching new cloud zone, availability zones, from their existing site with us, but it's also, I think also on the CoreSite interconnection gateway product, we're going to see that be something that new customers are going to be interested in as they look to migrate out of their enterprise data center and into a colocation site, but they're not yet ready to make that move. So this, we see, is kind of a, a way to bring them into the data centers. So right now we're seeing some good pipeline with existing customers and we think that that's going to grow as we sell it with our solution partners. Jon Atkin : Thank you. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Jon. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue, I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing comments. Paul Szurek : So thank you all for your time and interest. Lot of good questions. I come out of every quarter, really proud of the team, the things the building blocks, we're putting in place for long-term growth have really come together well, and I like where we're going with that. I do believe the cyclical headwinds will pass and will be much happier as we have this additional space to sell, and I know one thing that you can't get any sales if you don't have the space to sell and so right now we have much more opportunity to sell than we've had in quite some time. So, I look forward to the future and I'm grateful to work with such a good great group of people to accomplish what we've accomplished so far. Thank you all very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's teleconference, thank you for your participation, you may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Carole Jorgensen Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead. Carole Jorgensen : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to CoreSite's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek President and CEO; Jeff Finnin Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Smith Chief Revenue Officer. Before we begin I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal security laws including statements addressing projections plans and future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also on this conference call we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the simple information that is part of our full earnings release which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at coresite.com. With that I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm going to briefly cover financial highlights and then focus most of my time on how our strategic initiatives are playing out in light of today's market and technological environment. Jeff and Steve will then follow with their respective discussions of financial matters and sales results and trends. financial results for the quarter included operating revenue growth 4.1% year over year, SFO of $1 28 per share an increase of 2.4% year over year, and another strong quarter of sales at $14.4 million of annualized gap brand signed, including strong new logo revenue. This puts on track to comfortably achieve a record year of sales. Moving on to our strategy fulfillment. Secular demand for data center space is strong and we forecast this strength to continue in the foreseeable future. Our strategy capitalizes on this trend by expanding our extensive customer communities of enterprises networks and clouds who interoperate with each other in our campuses to serve businesses and consumers in major U.S. metropolitan markets. We fulfill this mission by providing capacity and connectivity including numerous cloud on-ramps and reliability and the ease of use in serving our customers. Our strategy starts with data center capacity. We reinvigorated our construction and development activities beginning in like 2016. And these activities are now delivering plentiful sellable capacity at our campuses, while building a pipeline for sustainable and agile capacity additions in two to three years. With the delivery of FDA phase one at the beginning of September. We are on track to deliver 224,000 square feet of new capacity this year, including phase two of SB eight in the fourth quarter. We are also on track to deliver an additional hundred 96,000 square feet of new capacity next year. They some of the projects currently under development, and we have a sustainable pipeline for future years. In our existing buildings we can quickly deliver incremental computering capacity of 550000 square feet at projected higher margins compared to new ground-up development. In other words we are shifting over the next 12 months from primarily ground-up development to primarily in-building development. And we also have 1 million square feet of space we believe we can develop on existing owned land at SV9 in Santa Clara NY2 in Secaucus New Jersey and in our Reston campus expansion making it easier to be shovel-ready when demand is strong. As our sales results show this additional capacity is crucial to meeting the customer demand we continue to see for community expansion and edge capacity in our major metro markets especially for enterprises seeking the highest performance and most cost-effective and most secure and reliable colocation solutions for hybrid cloud IT architectures. An example of the type of demand our new capacity is addressing is our pre-lease of LA3 Phase 1 for 74% of the space a year in advance of construction completion. Although we are in early stages we are also seeing a positive impact on colocation sales related to the additional connectivity products we offer to customers. These products are designed to accomplish several objectives for enterprises including enabling more efficient provisioning of cloud access redundancy and enabling flatter optimized wide area networks to reduce customer operating costs while maintaining significant edge deployments. As mentioned last quarter current market conditions have some temporary headwinds. Although the growth of public cloud has been a strong positive for us due to significant leasing to cloud providers and to the enterprises seeking powerful hybrid cloud solutions to a much lesser extent the trend has affected other sources of demand. We have higher-than-normal churn this year as a few longtime customers have gone through bankruptcy or out of business. To a lesser extent some customer use cases are transitioning to the cloud much of this fortunately cloud edge products located within our data centers. The strong secular data use trends have also drawn additional capital into the sector. While most of our markets are fairly well protected by high barriers to entry and our network-dense business model Northern Virginia continues to be [indiscernible]. We believe our record sales would be even higher if supply and demand in Northern Virginia were more balanced. We have however existing and potential capacity in Northern Virginia for when the market there strengthens. And of course new multi-tenant development is generally a modest drag on earnings while pretty stabilized but the available capacity enables us to meet fast emerging customer needs and strengthen our campuses. On balance we continue to believe the long-term data center demand trends are very positive for our campuses and will generally reward us for staying abreast of capacity and product needs. Therefore we are confident that our major market network-dense proactive development and product optimization strategies will provide sustainable growth. With that I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks Paul and hello everyone. Turning to our financial results for the quarter. Total operating revenues increased 4.1% year-over-year and 1.4% sequentially primarily due to increased rental revenue related to new and expansion lease commencements and growth in interconnection revenue. We commenced 78000 square feet of new and expansion leases for $15.7 million of annualized GAAP rent at an annualized GAAP rate of $200 per square foot and our sales backlog as of September 30 included $25.3 million of annualized GAAP rent from signed but not yet commenced leases or $28.4 million on a cash basis. We expect a majority of the GAAP backlog to commence in the next 2 quarters and the remaining amount in Q4 2020 following completion of LA3 Phase 1. Total property operating expenses increased 2.9% year-over-year primarily as a result of increases in rent expense from recently completed developments in our L.A. and D.C. markets where we leased some of our facilities. These property operating expenses also increased 4.3% sequentially including the impact of increased rent expense I just mentioned and other increases resulting from seasonal power costs and other property operating expenses partially offset by a property tax refund. General and administrative costs for the quarter were relatively flat year-over-year and decreased sequentially. This included the impact of a successful outcome related to a trial in Q3 including a minimum expected legal expense recovery of approximately $3 million minimizing the negative impact from legal fees this quarter to $0.01 per share. Turning to adjusted EBITDA net income and FFO. Adjusted EBITDA was $77.9 million reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.6% and a 53.8% adjusted EBITDA margin. Net income per diluted common share was $0.47 per share and FFO was $1.28 per diluted share a $0.03 increase year-over-year and a $0.01 increase sequentially. Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $388 million in liquidity including $383 million available under the revolver and $5 million in cash. Leverage at quarter end was 4.4x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements including our anticipated development activity over the next 12 months primarily through utilization of our credit facility. We also anticipate addressing our 2020 and 2021 debt maturities before the end of this year by working with our lending partners and our credit facility to extend the maturity dates. Next I'll recap some highlights of our first nine months of 2019. As Paul mentioned we expect to bring more capacity to the market by adding 224000 square feet into service in 2019. This new capacity provides us an opportunity for leasing and revenue growth by providing larger contiguous space for our sales team to compete for a larger set of customers' needs. This expanded capacity has led to new leasing year-to-date of more than $48 million annualized GAAP rent. That's more than doubled the new leasing in the first nine months of 2018. And our sales team will continue working hard during the fourth quarter to maintain our momentum. Next, I'd like to address churn. Last quarter, we raised our guidance of annual revenue churn to a range of nine to 11% for 2019, which compares to our typical historical range of seven and a half to 8%. churn has resulted from various drivers over the years, primarily from integration related to m&a activities. Bankrupt These and end of life applications. Last quarter, we identified additional churn expected for the last half of 2019. Since our last call we used a cross-functional team to further analyze our customer portfolio looking for emerging trends vulnerabilities and areas to address. This review identified customer characteristics to better identify growth opportunities and risk of churn and was a valuable process that our sales and customer service teams will use to augment our existing practices. Based on our historical trends and characteristics of churn our remaining exposure to customer deployments with similar characteristics is not a meaningful percentage of our embedded base and we expect almost all categories of churn to abate next year. However we have sizable capacity relocating from the Bay Area market over the next two years and we are optimistic about our ability to release this capacity due to the strength of current market dynamics. Turning to our work ahead. We have accomplished a great deal in the first nine months and we are focused on continuing that momentum. Our scale pre-leasing executed at SV8 and LA3 in the second and third quarters respectively were key objectives for the organization and helps derisk our development activity. As Paul mentioned we've delivered strong leasing results without the contribution we expected in Northern Virginia and still expect a strong finish to the year. As it relates to 2020 we will provide a detailed annual guidance on our fourth quarter call. However I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. We feel good about the fundamentals of the business and our progress on our property development and pre-leasing. To provide some perspective as you update your models for 2020 and beyond our accomplishments and challenges versus one year ago includes some timing considerations. First our property development at SV8 was delivered as planned. However Phase 1 of LA3 and CH2 while also dressing well are behind our time line from a year ago due to issues like permitting and other impacts. Second as a result of these changes leasing of these properties also looks different from a year ago. We executed more pre-leasing than planned at SV8 pushed out the timing related to lease commencements at Phase 1 of LA3 and CH2 and scale leasing in Northern Virginia has been lower than expected. And lastly our churn from 2019 will have carryover impacts on 2020 as we work to release our data center capacity. Before I hand off to Steve I want to recap. We are executing on our previously discussed priorities related to bringing on capacity and increasing leasing. The business drivers and secular tailwinds from our services are strong and we believe we are well positioned for the long term. With that I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith : Thanks Jeff. Today I'll start off with a summary of our quarterly sales results and then talk more about some sales wins and the business drivers behind them. Moving to our sales. We executed another very strong quarter of sales which is back-to-back with last quarter's highest sales quarter of the company. We delivered $14.4 million of annualized GAAP rent for new and expansion sales including $4.5 million of core retail colocation sales $9.9 million of scale leasing including a large pre-lease at LA3 as well as other scale leasing and some impressive new logo wins with opportunities for future growth. Turning to a few highlights of our sales. They included 73000 net rentable square feet reflecting an average annualized GAAP rate of $197 per square foot and core retail colocation sales included pricing on a per kilowatt basis in line with our trailing 12-month average. Looking at new logos we won 36 new logos that reflect total annualized GAAP rent approaching 3x our trailing 12-month average and include a weighted average contract term of 77 months versus the trailing 12-month average of 46 months. We're excited about the quality of these new logos and believe they will help drive future growth as their IT needs evolve. Attracting and winning new customers that value our platform remains a key area of focus and it's great to see it continuing to bear fruit. Renewals are another key aspect of our leasing focus. During the third quarter our customer renewals included annualized GAAP rent of $20.4 million reflecting growing base of business and strong customer relationships. Our renewals represented rent growth of 4.2% on a GAAP basis and a decrease of 2.2% on a cash basis which was impacted by the renewal of 3 long-term scale customers and excluding these 3 customers the remaining renewal volume reflected a positive 2.8% cash rent growth. Churn was 3.1% as anticipated. Next I'll share some highlights of our sales wins and the related business drivers. As Paul mentioned we are located in strong edge markets with uniquely positioned assets to serve highly connected workload environments. Customers in every segment are looking for help in their ever-changing IT journey as they interconnect their hybrid cloud and multi-cloud needs into seamless service for their end customers. Today's IT environment has greater innovation and less tolerance than ever for poor performance or latency with our applications. These factors seem to be only increasing in importance. Here's a glimpse of a few wins across sectors we signed this quarter : a multinational technology company specializing in cloud-related services that are latency-sensitive leasing space in our LA market 1 of the top connected data centers in the world; a global pharma organization further introducing and leveraging technology across their business units to serve their diverse corporate and R&D needs locating in our Santa Clara market; a multinational company with businesses in consumer professional electronics gaming entertainment and financial services in our L.A. market where performance is critical in supporting their gaming end users; and a large electronics company in our Boston market working to solve the needs of their multi-cloud environment. All of these customers are in different industries and deployed across various markets that are all leveraging the value of our interconnected platform to drive their business. Each are experiencing increasing data growth heavy reliance on technology to develop new products and serve new customers high-performance needs with no room for latency and all of them rely on or support a hybrid multi-cloud environment. Technology continues to move at a frenetic pace and we continue to focus on winning and growing with these customers as we help them solve their IT challenges to address the changing dynamic needs of their industry and their business. We're pleased with our execution for the quarter and we look forward to further helping customers solve their IT challenges. With that operator we would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jonathan Atkin RBC. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. So had a question about Jeff's comments with regard to Santa Clara. So the sublease capacity that's being marketed now at SV7 for 9 megawatts you refer to that as a relocation but is that going to be a customer that leaves your roles entirely? Or are they relocating to a different core site market? I'm assuming it's the former. Paul Szurek : Jonathan let me answer that. First of all there's -- I don't think there's really any sublease capacity out there. There may be some misunderstanding in the local market. But as Jeff mentioned it is a tenant that is moving their operations to different areas not to our facilities. That lease expires partly toward the end of 2020 a little over half toward the end of 2020 and the rest toward the end of 2021. And as we've seen in similar situations in that market in prior years we like having the ramp to go and release that space and hopefully help the tenant out a little bit and get somebody in there earlier. But in that market we're glad to have that capacity. Jonathan Atkin : Well the tenant is marketing at a subleased space. And so I guess maybe just semantics but this would be elevated churn for next year at least in that market. Paul Szurek : So Jonathan I don't want to get into any misunderstandings out there but there is no right to remarket that space as sublease space. Jonathan Atkin : Okay. But you mentioned the expirations some in '20 and some in '21 and I hear you about Santa Clara being a very strong market tight supply very strong pricing trends. But is it fair to say that you could see churn in the market over those two years? But your expectation is that you refill it and perhaps accretively. Is that a fair way to characterize it? Paul Szurek : I think it's fair. Again pricing and the ultimate replacement deployments will need to be worked out and whether that is slightly accretive or not we'll work out. But you've got the gist of my comments correct which is it's a good data center it's good space. We believe there's good demand in the market for it. And we are working proactively to retenant that. Jonathan Atkin : Two more questions then or a question related to kind of new markets. So Council Bluffs is a market that CyrusOne just indicated that they want to build capacity for enterprise sort of hybrid cloud applications. And I was interested in kind of that how you continue to look at growth opportunities domestically into new markets and whether those types of opportunities are interesting to you. And then secondly there's been very strong leasing in Europe and then there's been a recent M&A transaction announced there. And I know you've addressed this in many meetings as has your predecessor but just an update on your thoughts on international expansion. Paul Szurek : So we do continually look for new markets. And I'm guessing at some point down the road we will enter new markets. But so far we just haven't found the right mix. We do very very strongly prefer and I'd be surprised if we did anything outside of a major metropolitan market. And we want to be able to deploy our business model which as you know depends very much on network density. So it's a high bar to jump but we keep looking for it. Our views on international haven't changed and we believe that the model that we pursued of going deeper and building larger communities and greater scale in major U.S. metro markets relative to the size of our company continues to provide us with as much percentage growth opportunity as I think is appropriate or needed for this property category. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Jordan Sadler KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Katie Noel : Hi, good morning. This is Katie on for Jordan. You kind of touched upon this in your prepared remarks a little bit. Just want to go back to churn. It was 3% in the quarter 10% at the midpoint for the year. Then you talked about this space to release in SV7. How should we think about churn on a go-forward basis for next year? Do you anticipate churn coming back down to your historical 6% to 8% levels? Jeff Finnin : Yes. As I said a little bit in my prepared remarks based on the analysis we did and the items that led to our churn we expect some of those items to abate if not -- most of those items to abate as we go through 2020. However some portion of that decrease is going to be offset with the item Paul just alluded to some of the churn that will take place in Q4 2020. As Paul alluded we've got time to work on backfilling that space which is what we're planning on doing. But that's where we're headed for 2020. Steve Smith : And I would just add Katie that we're already actively discussing that space with potential prospects right now. So activity is strong. And as you know that market is pretty tight right now so that's a good thing for us. Katie Noel : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Colby Synesael Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you Two if I may. Jeff in the past you guys had talked about getting to potentially double-digit growth in 2020. And it feels like in the last few quarters you guys may have walked that back and some of the comments you just mentioned now in terms of timing delays and then also the full impact of churn in '20 versus what kind of rolled through in 2019. Just curious if you can give us an update on whether or not that double digits is achievable. And then secondly just going back to the California. This is one of the first times I think at least that I'm aware of a large 9-megawatt customer looking to vacate a third-party data center. And I'm just curious what your observations are around this trend and whether you think it's very specific to this customer or it's part of something broader going on. And maybe as it relates to California with the rolling blackouts with the fires do you think that that market's going to sustain the strategic value that it has had for now many years? Jeff Finnin : Let me address your first question and then I'll have Paul provide some commentary on the second. But as you mentioned I did provide some items of reference in my prepared remarks as you guys look at updating models for 2020 and beyond. And as I noticed or as I mentioned primarily related to development completions that are further outlined in our supplemental and then as you guys think about the timing of leasing and commencements. In addition we've highlighted some of the Northern Virginia market challenges as well as some of the 2019 churn. So we still have a lot to accomplish before year-end and that will provide us some better visibility into 2020. But I think it is fair to say when we provided that guidance one year ago a lot has changed. And we do not expect to hit double-digit growth for 2020. And so hopefully that helps clear up that question from that perspective. Paul Szurek : Colby this is actually the second time we've had a customer of this relative magnitude move out of that very same market. The last time was five, six, seven years ago and the circumstances were very similar. And I think we and all of our peers have seen this to some extent that the so-called unicorns in their early stages ramp up very quickly in markets like this. And then as they become more mature they start rationalizing things and moving things out as they discover more precisely what their latency needs are. Meanwhile that market has continued to grow with much more mature and established business models and operations that are however leveraging new technology products especially cloud-type products. And we see that continuing notwithstanding the factors that you've mentioned which as you know haven't really affected this particular area as much of us. Unfortunately some outlying areas are. And I know we all feel for the people in those areas. But so far we continue to see very strong demand and need for space in this market and expect that to continue. Colby Synesael : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Frank Louthan Raymond James. please proceed with your question. Frank Louthan : Great, thank you. Just wanted to touch on the churn in Boston. I assume that was similar to the churn that you discussed last quarter it was kind of expected. Any thoughts on that being released? And then to the commentary about at the steady pricing for KW. In your conversations you're having with clients now do you expect that to persist? How does sort of the next few quarters of pricing look on that basis? Jeff Finnin : Let me address the first one and then I'll hand it off to Steve for the second question. But you're correct the decrease in occupancy in Boston is directly attributable to that churn an event that we've been mentioning the last couple of quarters. And so that occurred as we anticipated. They vacated that space in August. And that computer room is ready to be released with very little if any additional capital needed to get that ready for lease. Steve on the second? Steve Smith : Yes just to carry on with the Boston conversation. While it does give us more space back there we are pleased with the market dynamics in Boston and have shown some good sales results and also see some pipeline there. So we're encouraged with what we see in Boston. As far as pricing on a per kilowatt basis as we mentioned in the comments earlier if they -- on balance they remain in check for most of our markets. And as we mentioned on prior calls probably the only market that we've seen any material erosion has been the Virginia market. And even that we feel like it's pretty much stabilized and look to see some of that come back. And given our retail and enterprise sectors there it's been pretty consistent over time. So overall things seem to be holding pretty well. Frank Louthan : Right, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Erik Rasmussen Stifel. please proceed with your question. Q - Erik Rasmussen : Yes, thanks. On the leasing that again was quite healthy. And over the last 12 -- you've now outperformed your 12-month average. Scale was the -- sort of the primary driver there with steady sort of retail color we'll call it. But are you seeing a sort of a change in your business that would suggest that you may continue to see sort of larger deals come through? Steve Smith : Well as Paul mentioned in his remarks as we bring on more capacity that does open up the market for us to sell larger opportunities. So that's a good thing for us and we've seen some of the results of that already. And I think as you look at the average size deal and that -- more contribution from new logos and just the overall maturity of the market where you see more mid- to large enterprises now maturing to the point where they're adopting more multi-cloud and hybrid cloud-type of environments that opens it up to on average larger opportunities for us. So we feel like with our expansions in different markets that well positions us for that opportunity. Erik Rasmussen : And maybe just then a follow-on with that then. So in terms of -- what does this mean for like for pricing and cash rent growth? Obviously the scale and depending on who that customer base is that could have different dynamics. How do you plan to balance this? Steve Smith : Well we're pretty judicious about how we approach each opportunity and especially as they get larger we do a lot of diligence around pricing and the yields that they deliver to that market and that specific facility. So we work through both timing as well as size and pricing and try to make sure that we make the right decisions to deliver the yields that we expect for ourselves and our shareholders are expecting of us. So we continue to balance that. Erik Rasmussen : Hey, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Nick Del Deo MoffettNathanson. please proceed with your question. Nick Del Deo : Hey, Maybe first 1 for Steve. You've had a lot of success landing on-ramps for call it Tier 1 CSPs like AWS and Microsoft. You oftentimes highlight that in your presentations. How would you characterize your degree of success with call it Tier 2 or more specialized on-ramps? And do you feel like there are opportunities to grow that part of the business? Steve Smith : Yes we have seen good success there. We don't necessarily publicly state those very often and maybe we should do more of that. Obviously most of the cloud business that happens there especially public cloud probably 80% of it happens among 4 players. So that's where the real focus is and that's where I think a lot of our customers are focused. But there is a lot of other services that are delivering those same type of on-ramps and we'll -- I expect to see more of those in the future as connectivity and low latency demands are driving better performance out of those platforms and customers are looking for better performance out of them that those on-ramps that deliver that performance will become even more important. So we pursue all of those and adding those to our platform and to our Open Cloud Exchange continues to be a focus and we've been successful but I always like to see more. Nick Del Deo : Okay good. And I guess sort of back to the Bay Area you guys seem pretty confident you'll be able to release any space that you need to at attractive rents. Can you comment on that in the context of the number of projects that are currently under way by other market participants in the Bay Area and likely to come online in the coming years? Paul Szurek : So predicting when any or all of those projects will come online is kind of a perfect science in that market. But we don't believe any meaningful capacity is going to come online before this space is going to be released. Nick Del Deo : Okay, got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Rollins Citi. Please proceed with your question. Q - Michael Rollins : I Good morning. So just as a follow-up to some of the hyperscale leases that you repriced downward in the quarter. Do you have a sense for what percent of leases or the rent today might be subject to reductions in the future either because of the deployment size or the customer size just to try to ring-fence the future risk over time on pricing within the portfolio? Jeff Finnin : Hey Michael were you -- let me just clarify were you asking on the entire portfolio or a market specifically? Michael Rollins : Just the broader portfolio please? Paul Szurek : Yes. So first of all the 3 leases where we had the significant mark-to-market I'm not sure they would -- they'd classify more of scale not hyperscale. And as we look at our portfolio and Jeff can correct me if I'm wrong we don't see a meaningful amount of that -- of customers in those circumstances. There's always going to be some. Every quarter we have some mark-to-markets that are negative and most of them are positive. And so most quarters that result is positive. And we don't see anything in our portfolio that would significantly change that. Jeff Finnin : Michael just 2 other things to think about as you're looking forward related to that. But if I just look at 2020 and had to give you an estimate on where I think that mark-to-market would go I think it's going to be fairly consistent with maybe a little less than where we're going to finish this year. As you probably saw we're taking that -- we took it down to 1% to 2% mark-to-market for the full year. So keep that in mind as you think about 2020. And then the only other thing I'd have you look at is our lease expiration table which you're familiar with on 15. I think it's important to just look at the pricing that we provide. When those leases expire on a per square foot basis at least gives you some idea where those are as compared to where we're signing renewals at new and expansion leases. Just to give -- another data point to think about. Steve Smith : Yes. And I would just -- I'll also just offer a little bit of color which is as we become more mature as an organization and our customer base becomes more mature we just evaluate each customer as they become up for renewal and ensure that we are market that we look to retain them and look at what our other alternatives are in that market based on available capacity and overall strength in demand and so forth. So overall we don't see a major risk there but we look at all those independently. Michael Rollins : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Funk Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Q - Mike Funk : Yes, thank you for taking the question a couple if I may. You mentioned before that the churn and kind of throwing some resources out that to analyze the portfolio. Hope you can give some more detail kind of on what your findings were maybe ways that you found you can better manage clients. I think you also mentioned that it's part of the analysis that you maybe saw some opportunity to actually expand the business you're doing with existing customers in addition to predicting when they might churn. Steve Smith : Sure. Just to give you a little bit of color on what we did in conjunction with a pretty broad team here within CoreSite we took a look at the last five years of data in our customers and just the behavior of those customers and work through any kind of correlation of growth as well as risk of churn and identified a small segment that might have some additional risk there. It didn't appear to be material as Jeff mentioned in his remarks but we did identify it. It allowed us to also just build a better view as to which customers are likely to grow with us as well and establish a bit of a more formal and deeper process around how we engage with those customers to give them a better experience give us better visibility into the likelihood of them growing or churning and make sure that we have the right resources around them to maximize that opportunity. Mike Funk : Great. And then one more quick one if I could. You mentioned -- and thank you for the update that you don't expect to hit the double-digit growth in 2020. I think your comment worth a lot of change. Maybe just expand on that a bit on the different factors that have changed over the course of the past 12 months that are affecting your shift in view. Jeff Finnin : Yes Mike. I think the churn that we've talked about obviously contributed to that. Northern Virginia contributed to that. And then a large part of what contributed to that is the timing associated with our development completions. As we thought about one year ago from where we are -- a year ago from where we are today we are obviously making a lot of estimates and assumptions related to that. And the timing has really been modified due to working through that development process which as Paul has alluded to this year it can be challenging. You manage it as best you can but you just don't know the ultimate outcome. So that's contributing to a lot of it. I think from our perspective as you think about 2020 the back half of 2020 where you're seeing a lot of our development being completed some of which has been pre-leased a lot which we will still work on to lease is where we're focused on trying to exit 2020 at a higher growth rate given what we think we can accomplish in the next 12 to 15 months. And that's our objective as we look out forward from here. Paul Szurek : Yes Mike I'd only add briefly that as we transition out of this phase of a lot of ground-up development by the end of next year almost all of our new development the vast majority of it will be just building out in new buildings which is much easier to predict from a timing standpoint. Mike Funk : Thank you guys very much for the questions and see you guys in a few weeks at a rate. Jeff Finnin : Thanks right. Our next question is from Jon Petersen Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Q - Jon Petersen : Great, thanks. Just maybe 1 more question on the Bay Area. I know you mentioned it's hard to predict what your competitors are going to do in terms of delivering product but how are you guys thinking about the SV9 development and starting that in light of the upcoming space you're going to have over the next couple of years? Paul Szurek : So the important thing is to get it shovel-ready and we're vigorously in the process of that. And as we've said it typically takes about 12 months give or take a couple of months to go from acquisition to entitlement and permitting. And by the way that's for a data center the size of SV9. For larger campuses there's a much longer process to get all of the necessary environmental and power approvals. We feel good about where we are in that process so far. It is going as we expected. And therefore after about 12 months we should be able to start construction. And typically construction in that market takes about 12 months. And we'll be able to make that decision on starting construction based on what we see in the market and what we see in the SV7 retenanting. But from what -- the view we have of it today is we're likely to start that construction when we have the permits. Jon Petersen : Okay. That's good color. And then a couple of your peers have achieved investment-grade ratings this year. I don't think that's something that you guys have aggressively pursued so far. But I'm curious what your thoughts are there. Obviously there's some interest expense savings but I think CyrusOne on their call just now was talking about some customers and how that was an important aspect in their underwriting of who to choose as a provider. So just curious any context or comments you might have around the possibility of getting an investment-grade rating how that might position you? Jeff Finnin : Yes Jon. I would just offer that as you know and have seen over the last three years or so we've accessed the private placement debt markets and those go through a different ratings process. But as we sit here today and when we issued each of those instruments those were rated as investment-grade. And so we feel comfortable with the access to the capital we have and how it's been priced. Pricing on those instruments has been probably tighter than what we would have seen without the public markets just given the lending and the investor group in those instruments. So we're comfortable with where we are related to that. Obviously we continue to operate the business in a manner to get that investment-grade at more of a public level to the extent we ever go out in the public bond market. But that's probably not going to happen here in the near term but it's something we continue to watch and manage the business around. Jon Petersen : So to what part is that a conversation with potential customers? I'm looking at your balance sheet and financial strength. Steve Smith : Sure. Yes Jon I'll just tell you that it's -- I've never seen it be an issue in my customer interactions. I mean if you look at our balance sheet and how we're levered we're one of the least levered data center providers in the market. So our financial strength has actually been an asset to us not a hindrance. Jon Petersen : Yes. Okay. Makes sense. Thank you. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, john. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Gutman Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. Robert Gutman : Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. First last quarter you mentioned slowing customer commencements. I was wondering if you've seen that stabilize. Secondly on the legal expense which I think you gave guidance of $0.09 for the year last time around I think $0.04 had been incurred and I'm not sure did you say in this call another $0.01 had been incurred? And could that at all extend into next year? Or is that kind of -- that's all there is to it $0.09? And lastly although it's too early for guidance for next year given the expansion table and the elevated CapEx this year would you expect CapEx to be in a relatively similar level next year? Or as you mentioned second phase and second-tier developments are less expensive. Should that bring CapEx down next year? Jeff Finnin : Rob it's Jeff. Let me answer 2 of those and then I'll pass it off to either Paul or Steve to address the commencements. As it relates to legal I did reference that we went through the third quarter as we expected and resolved our dispute through the trial that we unfortunately had to go through. The $0.01 of negative contribution to FFO keep in mind that was net of about a -- of the refund that we mentioned which we believe today is a minimum of $3.1 million. So just keep that in mind. So for the year it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.05 to $0.06 is where we'll expect it to be for 2019. Maybe some -- more of that noise as we go through '20. As most companies have there's always some legal issues out there that we're dealing with but at not nearly to the magnitude we had it for this year. As it relates to CapEx yes I would not expect our CapEx next year to be elevated like it is this year. Paul alluded to some of the reasons why. But if you think about us we've got about $265 million still to spend on everything that's under construction today. Some of that will be spent in the fourth quarter. And if I had to give you a range today I'd say somewhere around $275 million $300 million maybe by next year. Or I should say for next year that's going to be largely dependent upon leasing absorption etc. in the markets. But that gives you some idea where we think it would be going into next year. And then commencements? Steve Smith : Yes. As far as commencements are concerned we did see a little bit of slowdown there from last year as far as commencements are concerned. And we have seen that moderate but then we've also seen the deal sizes I mentioned earlier. And the complexity within enterprises as they roll out their deployments to take a little bit longer. So that's part of the calculus on those commitments and when they actually happened and how they turn up their environment. So -- but overall we've seen that kind of stabilize. Robert Gutman : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Lukas Hartwich Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. David Guarino : Hey guys, This is actually David on for Lukas. I wanted to ask about the pre-leasing at LA3 and what drove that tenant to sign the lease so far in advance of delivery. And maybe if there are more attractive terms attached with that deal. And then if you could just also talk about your yield expectations on that project. Obviously when you bring LA2 and 3 online they're going to improve. Just want to know if there's been any change in expectations there? Steve Smith : Yes David I could just give you a little bit of color I guess on the pre-lease. Obviously we have nondisclosures with the customer and can't give you a whole lot of detail around the lease itself. I would just probably just offer more color around the value of our position in that market which is pretty consistent with our position in other markets which is large-scale capacity that's right next to 1 of the most connected buildings on the planet. And that is a unique offering a unique value that as I mentioned in my earlier comments is becoming more and more valued by more and more customers out there. So that is -- I would just say that that low latency scalable type of environment has proven to be invaluable to a lot of customers in this case a pretty large customer that was willing and could plan for the need of that capacity in the future. So I'm not sure I can give you a whole lot more color beyond that but that just gives you a little bit. David Guarino : That's -- I understand. And then I guess just maybe with pre-leasing in general. Obviously the window has been shortened dramatically over the past few quarters but is there any indication that maybe that's lengthening again or was LA3 just a unique situation? Steve Smith : Well I think it's market by market right? As there's more capacity in a given market like Virginia there's less need for customers to sign to longer pre-leases ahead of time. In markets like L.A. and the Bay they do. So it's really market-by-market and also application by application or even customer by customer. But obviously with tight inventory that always lengthens that behavior. David Guarino : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Richard Choe JPMorgan. please proceed with your question. Richard Choe : Hi, I wanted to follow up on your analysis of your customers in terms of if they might churn or grow with you. With the ones that you identified with that might churn how do you plan on addressing them? Do you expect them to -- or kind of keep them or focus on growing customers in that same deployment to take over the space as they turn out? Steve Smith : Well of course my preference is always to keep a customer. So that's job 1. As Jeff mentioned the numbers of those customers is very small. I think we identified it as roughly 2% overall. And within that 2% we expect to maintain hopefully all of them but many of those are still under term. And as we engage with them and get deeper into their business models and how they operate then hopefully we'll retain as much or all of them as possible. But the process just allowed us to identify them get a better operating model around how we engage with them and hopefully that will bear some fruit as the final outcome. Richard Choe : And then regarding the Bay Area move-out is that going to keep the churn elevated this 9% to 11%? Or is that part of the envelope of 7.5% to 8% of normal or just part of that or is it too hard to say this far out? Jeff Finnin : Yes. No Richard I think if you think about our annual churn when we -- you go back over to several years on average the range -- or it has ranged anywhere from roughly 7.5% to 8%. We expect as I mentioned some of those items that were elevating at this year to decrease for next year and if you back into that normal range. The offset that might drive that a little bit higher is related to this Bay Area customer and that's probably going to add somewhere between 225 to 240 basis points in late 2020 and in late 2021. Paul Szurek : I'd only add to what Jeff has said that churn of this type in a market like that is generally a different quality of churn than the more widespread churn that is typically within our 7.5% to 8%. And again alluding to what we've mentioned earlier about having a lot of lead time to retenant that space before maturity and also having a lot of contiguous space to accommodate a wider range of customers. Richard Choe : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin RBC. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Atkin : Yes 2 follow-ups. One if you can maybe talk about the trajectory of channel mix as a portion of new logos in the most recent quarter and going forward. And then on LA3 are you anticipating that that new -- that pre-lease is going to generate a lot of direct cross-connect demand because of the nature of the customer's deployment? Or is it more likely to be indirect over time as perhaps there's enterprise hybrid attachments to that initial deployment? Steve Smith : Sure. Jonathan this is Steve. As far as the channel mix is concerned we've been really pleased with the channel growth over the year. As of last quarter we saw that pick up even further. If you look at the collective mix it ended up being about 16% of our total. And if you back out the larger-scale lease that we mentioned earlier it ends up being about 32% just in rough math. So that's a pretty good chunk and higher than what we've seen in prior years and that's been ramping throughout the year. So that's good to see. As far as the LA3 pre-lease is concerned again not getting into too much of the details around that but I think your final comments are around not only that deployment connecting to a network that's going to drive some interconnection but also customers that will be connecting to that will also drive in their hybrid use cases will drive further interconnection is accurate. Jonathan Atkin : And when a customer takes advantage of dark fiber between LA1 and LA2 for instance does that count as a cross-connect that you monetize? Or do you sometimes just let them buy the fiber and then you're just collecting rent? Steve Smith : We typically count that as a cross-connect. In some cases we've worked out specific arrangements for them to have dark fiber between the 2 but in 99% of the cases it's through our cross-connect. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks very much. Operator : I will turn the call back to Paul Szurek for a few closing comments. Please go ahead. Paul Szurek : Thanks. Appreciate all the good questions. Before I move to my final comments I do want to invite you to our L.A. campus data center tour and networking event on November 11 at the beginning of REITworld. Come join both our local and headquarters teams who will be hosting the activities. You can sign up with the link in our earnings press release or you can go directly to CoreSite's website to do that. And let me just close by reiterating we believe the market trends we discuss today will continue to reward us for creating a more proactive development and construction program. And going forward our job is to keep meeting campus expansion needs and to continue growing the customer communities in our campuses. I feel very confident in the team that we have here that are doing all the various aspects of that of those activities and feel very good working with them going forward. Thanks to everyone for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CoreSite. Operator : And this concludes today's teleconference, you may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Jeff and Steve will follow with their respective discussions of financial and sales matters. Our 2019 financial results included new and expansion sales of $55 million, a record which nearly doubled the $27.7 million of annualized GAAP rent signed in 2018, operating revenue of $572.7 million, which grew 5.2% over 2018 and FFO per share of $5.10, an increase of $0.04 year-over-year. A year ago, I shared four priorities for 2019 translating new construction into more abundant sales, acquiring additional new logos, bringing new connectivity products online to increase sales and delivering a great customer experience and ongoing operational efficiencies. I'll review each of these relative to our 2019 accomplishments. We executed well in our first priority of translating new construction into higher sales. In 2019, we placed 224,000 Square feet of data centre capacity into service, including a 108,000 square feet for the first two phases of FDA, our ground up development in Santa Clara and 116,000 square feet of campus expansions in Reston, Los Angeles and Boston. As a result, we restored our available and developable capacity to 25% in our top five markets at the end of 2019, compared to 16% at the end of 2018. And we used the new capacity to achieve a record leasing year, including leasing 100% of the first two phases of FDA and 74% of LA3 phase one a year in advance of its expected completion in late Q3 of 2020. Our 2020 development pipeline continues to be strong as we expect to deliver at least 196,000 square feet of new projects, including two grand up developments CH2 in Chicago and LA3 in Los Angeles, the final phase of SV8 in Santa Clara and the data centre expansion at NY2 in our New York market. Importantly, as we shift in the latter half of 2020 to delivering new computer rooms, instead of completely new buildings, our agility and development yields should also increase. Our second priority of acquiring new logos also generated strong results. For the year we acquired 145 new logos, our highest in three years. Attracted valuable new strategic accounts in multiple markets and grew annualize GAAP rent from new logos by 50% over 2018. Steve will provide more color on these new logos and their attraction to our hybrid cloud friendly ecosystems. Our third priority was to bring new connectivity products online to increase sales, which we also executed well on in 2019. We increase participation 44% in the SDN based open cloud exchange format we launched in late 2018. We added inter-site service for connectivity between markets providing route and site diversity to enterprises. And we continue to expand our relationships with and offerings from key cloud providers with additional on campus edge cloud products and availability zones. Our fourth priority was to deliver a great customer experience and ongoing operational efficiencies. We achieved several major accomplishments in 2019 that significantly benefit our customers. We achieved an exceptional Eight 9's of power and cooling uptime for 2019 across our portfolio of data centers. This level of uptime is well above our Six 9's target and even higher above the Five 9's industry standard. High uptime is key to minimizing customer disruption and to increasing loyalty and is especially important for high performance hybrid cloud deployments. In addition to our long-term record of customer compliance certifications, we added a new NIST assessment that helps customers meet certain compliance regulations relating to federal government deployments, which helped us win some of our new logos in 2019. We again improved our power utilization effectiveness this year by 4.8% on a same-store basis compared to 2018. Our commitment to ongoing power efficiency improvements helps our customers and us to maintain margins, while also making us all more environmentally sustainable. Finally, we deployed a new product in our customer portal, which gives customers ongoing visibility into their operating environment to streamline the management of their CoreSite deployments. Our 2019 achievements reflect a capable and committed team of colleagues and continuing strong demand across our markets. Even Northern Virginia, which was slow for most of 2019, saw good traction in Q4 leasing. We did encounter some unusual headwinds in 2019, which offset some of our accomplishments. Our churn was well above our typical range, with heavier lease expirations and terminations from customers with business and service models affected by competition from the public cloud. Importantly, we believe we have significantly reduced our exposure to these types of customers. Meanwhile, abundant supply in Northern Virginia extended the normal J-curve on our new developments in that market by making large scale and hyper scale leases and attractive, therefore driving us to focus our leasing efforts near term on retail customers to preserve longer term returns. As we move into 2020, our priorities are to build on our 2019 successes. Our primary goal this year include number one, completing on time our new data centre buildings in Chicago and Los Angeles and translating that new capacity into sales that build on our market leading customer ecosystem in LA and create critical mass for our ecosystem in Chicago. Number two, improving on our strong 2019 performance and attracting major new enterprises to our hybrid cloud ecosystem. Number three, thoughtfully expanding our products to help enterprises with their hybrid and multi cloud needs. And number four, maintaining high levels of facility performance and customer service while continuing to invest in PUE improvements and other sustainability focused opportunities. In closing, we believe our diverse network and cloud dense campuses and the interoperability we enable for customers through our ongoing capacity growth, new connectivity products, and superior customer experience, position us well to benefit from the secular tailwind for data centre space and the demand for high performance hybrid cloud solutions. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Paul. Today I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial performance, discuss our balance sheet, including our liquidity and leverage expectations and review our financial outlook and guidance for 2020. Looking at our financial results, for the full year, operating revenues grew 5.2% year-over-year, reflecting increases in new and expansion lease commencements of 46.8%, growth in interconnection revenue in line with our expectations, offset by elevated churn we experienced in 2019. General and administrative costs were $43.8 million reflecting 7.6% of revenue in 2019 compared to 7.4% in 2018. Net income was $2.05 per diluted share, a decrease of 7.7%. FFO per share was $5.10, an increase of $0.04 over 2018 and adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.8%, a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, operating revenues grew 5% year-over-year and approximately 1% sequentially. We commenced new and expansion leases of 86,000 square feet during the quarter, reflecting $16.6 million of annualized GAAP rent. Our sales backlog as of December 31, included $15.6 million of annualized GAAP rent for signed, but not yet commenced to leases or $19.8 million on a cash basis. We expect about 40% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the first half of 2020 with the remaining 60% in the second half of the year, weighted to the fourth quarter with completion of LA3 phase one. Adjusted EBITDA was $79 million for the quarter and increased 6% year-over-year and 1.4% sequentially. Moving to our balance sheet, in November, we amended our credit agreement, extending our near term maturities. We also extended the maturity date of our revolving credit facility to November 2023, with a one year extension option, and we added an additional $100 million of liquidity. We ended the year with $386 million of total liquidity, providing plenty of liquidity to fund our 2020 estimated data centre expansion plans, which includes $179 million of remaining construction costs for properties currently under development. Our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 4.7 times at year end. Inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 4.5 times. As previously stated, we are comfortable with increasing leverage to five times. Based on our current development pipeline, and the related timing of capital deployment and commencements, we may temporarily trend higher than five times leverage in 2020, with the expectation of moderating leverage based on our backlog, and timing of commencements. I would now like to address our 2020 guidance. Let me start with some perspective on our outlook for 2020. Our mission for the last couple of years has been to increase our development pipeline to provide more capacity in our markets. We invested significant amounts of capital and we made substantial progress in 2019 on that objective. As a follow on, we've had a record leasing year which was enabled by our new capacity, and supports our view that we continue to benefit from secular tailwinds for our strategic edge markets. At the same time, we experienced elevated churn in the last half of the year, which we attribute to customer business models that were not as strong as they were historically. And we estimate that there's a minimal churn exposure in our remaining customer base of annualized GAAP rent for these types of customer use cases. We will be delivering additional capacity in 2020 to provide greater contiguous space allowing us to further meet market demand. We expect the benefits from this new capacity will be mostly back end loaded to Q3 and Q4 2020 given construction timing, and we will be focused on achieving pre-leasing of this capacity, including LA3 phase one, which was 74% leased at year end. That brings me to our 2020 guidance, which reflects our view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets, as well as the health of the broader economy. I will cover the key highlights of our 2020 guidance, but point you to our complete guidance on page 23 of our fourth quarter supplemental information for further details. Operating revenue is estimated to be $600 million to $610 million. Based on the midpoint of guidance, this represents a 5.6% year-over-year revenue growth, which reflects the timing of our development pipeline. Our guidance also reflects the impacts of elevated churn, which we've estimated to be 9% to 11% for the year, based on our current expectations related to customer timing. About 250 basis points of this expected churn is from one customer in the Santa Clara market. And given the current market dynamics we are optimistic and actively working to backfill this capacity. In terms of timing, we anticipate elevated churn in the first and fourth quarters related to customer relocations. Additionally, we expect cash rent growth on data centre renewals will be fairly consistent with 2019 at 0% to 2% growth for the full year. Interconnection revenue is estimated to be $80 million to $86 million, representing 9.6% growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $318 million to $324 million, and at the midpoint represents a 53.1% adjusted EBITDA margin, and 4.2% year-over-year growth. FFO is estimated to be $5.10 to $5. 20 per diluted share in operating unit, at the midpoint, this reflects growth consistent with 2019 or approximately 1%. And capital expenditures are estimated to decline to $225 million to $275 5 million, decreasing as expected from the approximate $400 million of capital spent in 2019. This includes $215 million to $250 million for data centre expansions, primarily including the completion of the ground up development at CH2 and LA3. With our investments in 2018 and 2019 and the initial phases of ground up development at VA3, SV8 and the anticipated 2020 completions of CH2 and LA3, it provides us the flexibility to bring on data centre expansions quickly and at higher returns in the future as we build out new computer rooms as needed within the existing buildings. In closing, we remain optimistic related to business drivers and secular tailwinds for our services remains strong. We're executing on our priorities to bring on capacity and translating it into increased sales opportunities. We also now have the capacity to accommodate additional growth should demand exceed what is assumed in our guidance. Our balance sheet is strong and we continue to stay in tune to the markets, opportunistically pushing out maturities and improving our borrowing position. And we believe we are well positioned for the long-term. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith : Thanks, Jeff and hello, everyone. I'll start off reviewing our quarterly sales results, and then talk further about our sales successes for the year and key drivers. We had a solid quarter of new and expansion sales, we delivered $6.6 million of annualized GAAP rent, primarily reflecting core enterprise leasing, including 31,000 square feet with an average annualized GAAP rate of $216 per square foot. Included in those results was a sizable multi market hybrid lease, leveraging the unique capabilities of our campus platform to support their dense architecture and complex interconnection requirements. As a second example of how business continues to evolve and leverage low latency, high performance technology, we believe this and others, like this customer, will provide additional interconnection opportunities, as well as stickiness to our platform. Winning new logos has been a key driver for us throughout 2019 and more an important contribution to these quarterly results. In the fourth quarter, we won 36 new logos. Two thirds of these new logos were enterprise customers, which included some notable strategic accounts. Turning to pricing, overall pricing in our markets is fairly stable, except for Northern Virginia where pricing is softer, especially on larger deals, as we've been saying for the last three to four quarters. We were pleased with our fourth quarter sales in Northern Virginia, which outpaced each of the prior three quarters on a volume basis. Renewals are another key aspect of releasing focus. During the fourth quarter, our customer renewals included, annualized GAAP rent of $21.9 million. Our renewals represented rent that decreased about 1% on a cash basis. Similar to last quarter, we had a few customer renewals negatively impact our cash flow growth for the quarter. This includes five customers that went excluded our cash mark-to-market was a positive 3.4%. Churn was 2.9% for the quarter in line with our expectations. Next, I'll share some highlights of our sales wins and the related business drivers. Our 2019 sales set a new record for the company with $55 million of new and expansion sales in annualized GAAP rent, which was nearly double our leasing at $27.7 million in 2018 and included retail leasing of $23.2 million, a 19% increase over 2018 and scale leasing of $31.8 million, nearly four times higher than $8.2 million in 2018. Driving our new and expansion sales this year were several key factors, including ongoing strength in new logo sales, strategic scale leasing, contribution from our channel sales and the overall secular tailwinds driving customers with hybrid and multi cloud needs to our data centers, which enrich and broaden our ecosystem, deepen our communities of interest and in turn create a network effect as our vertical markets became more diverse, while also more interconnected. All of which we believe helps to enhance our competitive mode and further differentiates our data centers. Let me touch on these drivers. Our new logo annualized GAAP rent was the highest in three years, increasing 50% over 2018 and 172% over 2017, reflecting substantial progress on a goal we set two years ago to attract high quality new customers that value our platform, which can help drive future growth as their IT needs evolve. Strategic scale leasing in 2019 was an important part of our results, which helped us with pre-leasing at two ground up developments in 2019, including 100% of SV8 first two phases, as well as 74% of LA3 phase one. Our channel sales were also an important driver, which increased to nearly 12% of our annualized GAAP rent in 2019. Importantly, overall absolute production from our channel sales grew 136% over 2018. As a final thought on key drivers, despite higher 2019 churn and that expected for 2020, on balance more enterprises are buying from us as demonstrated from our new logo additions. We also believe our increased sales in 2019 more accurately reflect our market position and mid-term growth opportunities as we continue to take advantage of our growth capacity program to compete more effectively in the marketplace. In closing, here's a recap on why we win and what drove our 2019 results. We are located in strong edge markets which uniquely positioned assets to serve highly connected workload environments. Customers in every segment are looking for help in their ever changing IT journey as they interconnect their hybrid cloud and multi cloud needs into a seamless service for their end customers as they deal with increasing data growth, heavy reliance on technology to develop new products and serve new customers and high performance needs with no room for latency. We continue to focus on winning and growing with these customers as we help them solve their IT challenges to address the changing dynamic needs of their industry and their business. We're pleased with our execution in 2019 and we look forward to further helping customers solve their IT challenges. With that operator, we would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. Power as a percentage of rental revenue came down in the second half of 2019. And your revenue guidance for 2020, I think was below Street expectations. I'm curious if any of this has to do with the customer who's moving out of SV7, I think they may have actually already moved out and that space might be vacant. And that's what I'm thinking is the explanation, but I'm hoping could fill that in and give us some color on what the expectation is for power in 2020, that might be I'm thinking the delta between what the Street was expecting and what you guided to. And then secondly, as it relates to CapEx, I'm just curious what you've assumed for additional land purchases? Thank you. Jeff Finnin : Good morning, Colby. It's Jeff. Let me see if I can take your first question. You are correct, that some of that decrease in power revenue is directly attributable to the customer at SV7. And so as you think about 2020, I'd probably put it in simplistic terms from the standpoint given the guidance we've given you can see we've guided to an increase of revenue of about $32 million at the midpoint. We've also guided to interconnection revenue growth of about $8 million at the midpoint. The remaining $24 million, I would allocate that pro rata to what our full year 2019 is, the relative portions between rent to power, which is about two third rent, one third power, as you think about modeling and those components for 2020. In terms of CapEx, we have \u2013 obviously, the projects that are under development at this point in time. And well obviously, as we work through 2020 will have the need, hopefully in the opportunity to add additional development projects that will disclose at that point in time. At this point in time, we don't have any incremental land purchases in our guidance, not to say we're not looking, not to say we won't execute it on it, but at this point, none of that is embedded into the guidance for CapEx for 2020. Colby Synesael : Okay, thank you. Jeff Finnin : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Sadler : Hi, so I just wanted to come back to the churn. It seemed like you had the guidance for the full year laid out last year, and we ended up at 11.1 just above the high end of the range. I'm kind of curious \u2013 I feel like you ended up a little bit higher for some reason, was there something that was missing? Or something that happened during the quarter that you didn't anticipate 90 days ago, that caused sort of an increase in that churn that you could sort of speak to? And I guess sort of similar question for 2020. I feel like you discussed last quarter on the call the normalized level of 7.5% to 8% plus a little extra from this customer move out. But it even seems like this customer move out exposure in the fourth quarter of '20, it feels like the full exposure of the customer as opposed to half of the exposure that customer. I can clarify that if that doesn't make sense. Jeff Finnin : Yeah, Jordan, let me let me see if I can address that and, and see if we can clarify some things. But let me just start with the 2020 turn and then I'll come back and talk about the fourth quarter. As it relates to 2020 churn, what we tried to communicate last quarter is that we expect our churn in 2020 to recede back to its normal levels of call it 7.5% to 8% with the exception of the fact that we have to add another, as we just said, on the call 250 basis points related to that specific customer. So all in, you're going to have churn somewhere around 10%, which is what our guidance is. We tried to communicate that last quarter, and I think it got lost a little bit in the translation. And so I just want to make sure we're clear on that. So we expect midpoint at 10%, inclusive of 250 basis points from that one customer. Jordan Sadler : Is it 250 in 4Q of '20 and 250 4Q of '21, Jeff? Jeff Finnin : It's 250 in 4Q of 2020 and it'll be less in the fourth quarter of 2021. Just to give you an idea, it's five megawatts this year, four megawatts next year, just to give you an idea how that deployment will, will mature. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Jeff Finnin : And then as it relates to the fourth quarter, Jordan, obviously, the full year churn came in slightly ahead of and higher than what our guidance was. And I would point to two things. As it relates to our churn in 2019 and in 2020, we had some of that churn that we expected to ultimately take place in the fourth quarter of this year, so a little bit earlier than we anticipated. And then as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect to also have our churn in the first quarter of 2020 to be elevated. The full year, we still expect it to be in line with what we anticipated. But the timing associated with it got moved into the first quarter where some customers are moving out sooner than what we expected. As a result of that we expect first quarter churn to be somewhere around 325 to 375 basis points. And those two elements of some of that moving sooner than we anticipated are obviously weighing in on some of the guidance we've given for 2020. Jordan Sadler : Okay, and then I have a bigger picture question for you, Paul. Is a combination I guess of the elevated churn lower releasing spreads, lower CapEx, particularly relative to the size of the company today and higher leverage they all seem to point to slower growth profile for your domestic data centre portfolio. So even though demand does seem like it's going to persist longer term for data centre space, is it fair to say that we've passed the point of maximum valuation and/or maximum growth for data centers in the US? Paul Szurek : No. Jordan, it's a good question. It may seem odd, even contradictory that we have, for example record sales and record churn in the same year. But it makes sense if you view them as two sides of the same technology coin. Our record sales reflect new data business models and use cases that seem to have significant tailwinds behind them, as reflected in our growing new logo sales and to edge in major metro cloud sales and continuing growth from customers acquired in recent years. The churn primarily reflects business models that are waning and as Jeff mentioned, have become a significantly smaller part of our portfolio, which means that the amount of that churn should wane, especially to the extended has been accelerated into 2019 and 2020. And the lower CapEx just relates back to what I said in my prepared remarks that we are shifting from the need to build out entirely new buildings, which for over the last year plus this year into a phase where we're building out new computer rooms in existing buildings which we can do more quickly and have higher returns. So I mean, look, we're like every company that has grown, you get bigger, your denominator gets bigger and the industry has matured some in terms of new capital coming into the industry. But we still feel really good about our business model and our markets. We actually have more markets that we can grow in that we practically had or had as a practical matter a few years ago because we used to be highly dependent on three markets. We didn't have scale in Chicago and New Jersey was more urban for a few years. But now we're building scale in Chicago and New Jersey has really picked up as a nice enterprise market. So in terms of being able to deliver, I think, above standard growth to compared to the rest of the reed industry, and serving an industry with significant tailwinds. I still feel very optimistic. But we are impacted last year and this coming year by this accelerated churn from these older business models. Jeff Finnin : And I guess the only other thing I would add there, Jordan is just to kind of point you back to some of the prepared remarks there as well. And just the overall demand characteristics that we've seen over the especially the last year and new customers coming to the platform we had more customers that are contributing more revenue, significantly more revenue and the average size of those customers is also significantly up. So I think as you look at the overall demand currents of the business and those customers adopting CoreSite it's actually stronger than ever. Jordan Sadler : Okay, I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Gutman with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. Robert Gutman : Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. So it looks like at the 30,000 square feet leased McWhorter about half that was mostly the Virginia, Northern Virginia, DC market and some Denver, where was \u2013 it's hard to discern where the other half of that was markets wise. And second question on renewal pricing, the week renewal pricing or the recurring sort of low renewal pricing in 2020 is it \u2013 can you characterize it a little more? Is it broad number of customers, concentrated customer and early, middle, end of the year? Steve Smith : Yeah, just to give you some perspective on the strongest markets, which kind of implies where some of that larger leasing came from were LA, Northern Virginia and New York, so hopefully that gives you a little bit more color as to where those leases came from. And the second part, your question there? Robert Gutman : Just some color on the on the sort of muted renewal pricing this year, is it a few customers or is it sort of widespread, is it can be an even pace through the years, is it concentrated with one customer in the second half? I mean, just trying to figure out why, again, the renewal pricing is kind of weak. Steve Smith : Yeah and it's pretty indicative. As I pointed out in the prepared remarks around Q4 leasing where we had a few customers that drug down our mark-to-market to a negative 1% and when you exclude those five customers, we actually had a positive 3.4% cash basis. So as we look at some of those ageing customers, those specific customers side with us back typically in the 2015 or prior era, and as they've been \u2013 had annual escalations in their rent and some of the pricing in those markets has been stable or in some cases decreased. Now, we've obviously had to make some adjustments that have brought down the overall expectation there. So there's a little bit of that sprinkled throughout the entire guidance, but that's also baked into the overall assumptions in guidance for 2020. Robert Gutman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkins with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Atkins : Thanks. I got a couple. I was interested on the demand side any markets you would call out has seen elevated levels of current demand compared to last year? And then wanted to get kind of an update on the SV7 backfill situation, if you could provide us a little bit more color than what you've provided in the script if that's possible. And then finally, the customer relocations in 1Q and 4Q, which markets is it occurring in and are these customers that are moving to the cloud or just downsizing the right G going through consolidation? Or what are the factors that are leading to this occurrence? Thank you. Paul Szurek : Okay. I mean, the markets where we've seen pickup in demand as we mentioned, the comment I made earlier, New York has really improved. Santa Clara continues to be strong. We obviously had strong demand in LA last year and frankly as Steve mentioned in his sales comments Virginia picked up in the fourth quarter. So those are those are the primary markets that are plus on the demand side. In terms of \u2013 Jonathan Atkins : Sorry, I asked about the current demand, so it sounds like \u2013 so what you called out was kind of backward looking at that and then continuing prospectively into this year [indiscernible] market in terms of elevators at the end. Paul Szurek : Yeah, based on our sales funnel, they still seem to be to be good markets. The relocations, primarily, that's the SV7 lease that you talked about. And as we mentioned in the past, that's just a customer that realized that their applications were not performance sensitive, didn't need to be in Santa Clara moved it to a lower cost market. And to a certain extent, the other relocation is the same kind of thing and it's out of Milpitas and they are making the same kind of cost rationalization decision. No, I mean all I can really say about the SV7 situation and Jon you know as well as anybody how the scale and hyper scale leasing in Santa Clara tends to come in lumps and weighs although they tend to come quarter-by-quarter with very significant amplitude between quarters as opposed to year-by-year. But our sales team is out there, working with our customers and working the market for backfills for that space. The customer itself as you know has hired a brokerage firm which worked for the customer and we don't have any control over what they do. Time will tell if their efforts are a distraction or if they provide value to the customer and indirectly to us. But so there's a good coverage out in the market of all the opportunities that are potentially out there to backfill that space before the end of the year. Jonathan Atkins : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Nick Del Deo : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, when you look across your entire book of business, not just lease that we\u2019re doing in 2020. How do you feel about mark-to-market risk and particularly in Northern Virginia? Paul Szurek : So you could see how we feel about it that's baked into the guidance Jeff provided. I think it's harder to look beyond that because it really depends upon how supply and demand evolves in each of our markets. But I do believe it's a little bit like the churn thing that some of that will go away as we go past certain vintages of past leasing. Nick Del Deo : Alright, got it and then Steve, you noted pretty significant growth in deals that came through the channel [technical difficulty]. Do you expect additional growth in channel deals in 2020 and beyond? And how do you think about the cost of acquiring revenue via the channel versus in house and minimizing potential channel conflict? Steve Smith : I'll start with the last part of that question and get into the first part. It definitely is a balance right. So I do see value in extending the channel and we have some efforts internally to continue that growth and actually look at some other channels to broaden our reach and deepen our reach into key customers. As we look at the market, I think there's a great opportunity out there for the mid to large enterprise that is really wrestling with how they evolve their IT challenges and much of that involves partners to help them with that evolution. So working with those partners to make sure that we're part of that conversation is definitely part of the strategy. But it is balanced because in some cases that does come with cost associated with it. I would say that in some cases as well, it actually brings more value and stronger pricing, so it just kind of depends on the channel and how we manage that mix. Nick Del Deo : Got it, it seems like a number your peers are leaning harder into the channel as well. Do you think that's just kind of a natural function of new enterprises being potential customers going forward or is there a risk that people become too heavily reliant on the channel? Steve Smith : I do think it is balanced, right. And it is important to manage that risk or that mix rather, but I do think that it is such a complex environment out there for enterprises that they need help in managing that evolution of their IT strategy. And so as they look to partners, collocation is part of that and their cloud on ramps and how they bring that into a seamless architecture for their customers and their employees. So they need help doing that. And partners of various flavors are a key part of that, whether it's system integrators, resellers and otherwise. So I think that's a good opportunity to help our enterprises come to our platform, as well as a good opportunity for us to leverage kind of off payroll resources to help us find demand. Nick Del Deo : Okay, got it. Thanks Steve. Steve Smith : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rollins : Hi thanks and good afternoon. I guess two things if I could. First, can you help frame if you take a look at the signed leases in 2019 and the $55 million of annualized rent, can you frame for us what the total opportunity was that you were pursuing in dollars in 2019? It gives us a relative sense. And are you finding that you're \u2013 that there's just maybe less available in the market for certain areas that you may want to fill? Or are you purposely moving away from those because of price over churns or some other factors? And then the second thing is just \u2013 if you take a step back, are there things in the portfolio that CoreSite would benefit from overtime larger sales force, different systems, certain geographies, are there certain things that you're finding could be incremental to pursue the growth and the wallet share opportunities that you're looking to achieve? Thanks. Paul Szurek : So Michael, typically we don't give out specific sales forecasts. And so we probably shouldn't retroactively give out comparisons to sales forecast. But obviously, we're very happy with having a record sales year last year and what it tells us about the market. In terms of the latter part of your question, it's a really good question and kind of balances between strategy and execution, what you're doing, what we're doing, strategy is obviously really important. And we and our board take it seriously and we evaluate it regularly. But there's a \u2013 if you'll pardon my use of the expression, there's no Polish proverb to the effect that execution eats strategies lunch. And we have consistent as you pointed out we have put more focus on execution in the last few years. And I think you see some of that showing up in our results already. Well, we're building faster, better and more cost effectively. And capacity is crucial for sales. We're selling more effectively, including the difficult transition to selling hybrid cloud data centre solutions to enterprises who are relatively new to collocation, which shows up in our rising new logo sales. We've made agile changes in our product offerings that we've talked about that are specifically targeted to facilitating the customer journey to the hybrid cloud while easing the transition to a collocation model. Every one of those products has a purpose, making it easier to switch from one cloud to another, making it easier to provision redundancy for both resiliency and cloud SLAs, making it easier for companies to flatten their wand networks and be able to save significantly on their overall network costs as they move to a hybrid cloud model, and even giving them the same visibility into their collocation environment in terms of temperature, humidity, power and other features that they would have if they were using on premises data centre facilities. Again, easing that transition in that comfort level and going into collocation. So it's been a big area of focus for us. And frankly, I don't want to underestimate the importance of operational effectiveness. That's reflected in our vastly improved uptime record or significantly better PUE, which by the way is a frequent comment from enterprise customers moving into collocation is how much they are saving in terms of power costs and energy efficiency by moving into this environment, as well as the improved operating efficiencies at the data centre level. Again, these customers that may have some discomfort moving from on-perm to collocation and are putting a lot of their digital transformation into this hybrid cloud model. They really take a lot of comfort in those operational improvements. So again, wrapping up, and as I mentioned earlier, I think we have more markets that we can grow in now relative to what we had historically. And I'll reiterate what I've said on other calls that pound per pound or share per share, I think we have a higher concentration of exposure to strong growth markets than probably any of our peers. So we feel good about where we are. We continue to look at and evaluate other opportunities. But we believe these ongoing improvements in execution coupled with the tailwinds, we believe will be strong for a few years. Plus our scale and strong ecosystems in key markets is what makes us optimistic going forward and I think what is showing up in our sales levels. Michael Rollins : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. Looking at your annualized rent mix by customer type and surprisingly cloud revenues keep growing as a percentage of mix now at 33% of annualized revenues as of 4Q 2019. But if I look at the total enterprise rent or the other enterprise mix that moved to 44.6% on an annualized basis, it was actually down slightly 4Q '19 and it was down a little bit more on a sequential basis in 3Q '19. So could you just give us more color on why this is happening and should the enterprise footprint in your facility on an annualized revenue basis continue to decline as a percentage of total mix or should it be stabilizing around this 33% of annualized rent level? Paul Szurek : Well, I think what you're saying Sami is just another data manifestation of the churn versus the sales. I believe and Jeff will correct me if I'm wrong, that the vast majority of the churn that we have been experiencing this year and last year that relates to these older business models has been categorized in the enterprise bucket. Jeff Finnin : That's correct, yeah. Paul Szurek : So as that bucket \u2013 those enterprises have shrunk as a percentage of our portfolio and eventually that churn wanes because we just don't have that much more left there. Theoretically, that should see \u2013 that should drive up the percentage of our share of enterprise with the caveat that as we saw last year, we are seeing more edge cloud use cases and cloud demand for availability zones in these high performance markets. So that may counterbalance the growth in our enterprises. Steve Smith : And Sami, just to give you a little bit more color around the new logos that are buying from us, about 78% of them are enterprise versus 20% on cloud and a few new networks as well. So this gives you a bit of color as to where the new logos are coming from. And I do think you'll see some big lumps in cloud as that's how they buy. Sami Badri : Got it and then just as a follow up, as you look at your interconnection revenue that keeps outpacing rent growth on a year-on-year basis. What is \u2013 would you say some of these new data manifestations or what is driving some of the acceleration that interconnection growth? And if you were to pinpoint on customer types, cloud, network and the other enterprise category, do you think that this is \u2013 which customer type is driving this and do you think that this could accelerate given the change in the data manifestation business types. Jeff Finnin : Yeah, Sami let me give you some information related to that and see if Steve has anything else to follow more broadly. But in terms of that interconnection revenue growth, historically, as we've said, you get about two thirds of that revenue growth that come from pure increase in just the volume of the cross connect products. And then you get your other one third of that growth \u2013 really comes from those customers moving from a lower price product into a higher price product, as well as customers renew you get some price increases from those conversations, as well as on occasion, we look at what our list prices are for our various products. So that's what captures that remaining one third. As you think about going forward and where we're seeing some of that growth. It's important to look at ultimately, who our customers are ordering connections to and where we're seeing outpaced growth as compared to overall, those customers connected to our cloud customers. And that has been consistent for the last couple years. It's probably two to three times higher from a percentage basis then the overall growth and that just leads to a lot of the ecosystem that Steve and Paul have commented on, but anything else to add there Steve? Steve Smith : I think you spelled it out well there, Jeff. When you think about enterprises connecting their hybrid architecture, as we've mentioned before, it really does need to be well connected in low latency fashion and with some of the upgrades that we've made in our OCX platform, as well as adding new on ramps to our campuses, that's helped facilitate all of that as well as some of the newer products that we provided as far as inter site capabilities and so forth. So we've seen some good uptick in that product as well. Sami Badri : Got it, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Frank Louthan : Great, thank you. I want to go back to the churn and just get a little more detail. You did mention that you have customers impacted going to public cloud, you think this is going to kind of slow down. Give us some more color on what \u2013 so what is that based on? Is that customer feedback or is there a particular vertical that you have the exposure to and why you're confident that after these next couple of quarters, were you calling out the elevated churn that this situation you found yourself in is going to correct itself? Jeff Finnin : Yeah, Frank, this is Jeff. I'll just provide a little bit of additional color around and hope it I hope it helps. We've obviously spent a lot of time, energy and effort in 2019 just continuing to peel back the onion and better understand some of the contributors to the churn and specifically related to some of those business models. And some of what we found, just to give you some color around it are \u2013 as an example, some of the resellers in the marketplace are an example of some of those business models that are not as strong today as they were historically and you saw some of that impacting our 2019 churn, some of its impact in 2020. And then there's other business models that rely heavily on the need and desire for burst capacity various times during the year. Some of those customers rely on the cloud; other customers rely on us in terms of adding capacity. And when you look at that those are the areas that have some exposure to migrating some or part of those to the cloud or to just that may not be as strong and may migrate out of out of our data centre entirely. When you look at and quantify what remaining exposure we have, as I commented on its much lower today than it has been historically, worried about 4% to 6% of our annualized rent that's embedded in our base today. That's why we get comfort that as we look beyond 2020, we believe those churn levels will recede back to the historical levels of 7.5% to 8%. And that's what we're modeling and why we continue to be optimistic in \u2013 and in relationship to some of the comments we've provided today. So hopefully that helps. Frank Louthan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Funk with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Mike Funk : Yeah, thank you for taking the questions. A couple if I could. Yeah, going back to your comments on SV7, maybe just quickly, can you let us know what the expiring rent is there relative to market rates? Then I've got a follow up question after that one. Paul Szurek : We try to not talk about customer specifics. We have mentioned in the past that this lease was signed when market conditions were fairly tight in Santa Clara, but they seem to be fairly tight in Santa Clara today as well. So it's really hard to predict. Mike Funk : Great and then second one, you mentioned the \u2013 part of the move driver is a performance centric application maybe not being as performance centric as the customers thought. If you look at some of your higher profile locations, how good of visibility do you have into the use cases of your customers in those facilities, and maybe risk of further churn as customers look at the need to be paying peak rents versus being say hundred miles away. Paul Szurek : As we've said in the past, there's always a dynamic related to this, because some customers just don't have that type of visibility, especially when they start \u2013 when they're in the startup phase and are scaling up. Having said that, we don't have \u2013 we've got this one big chunk, I don't believe that we have anything comparably sized that would be subject to this dynamic elsewhere in the portfolio. Mike Funk : And maybe just kind of comment on some other comments in the quarter. So I guess Cummings on their call mentioned they project 5% to 10% decline in power generation because they're seeing some slippage of construction from '20 into '21. I think Google said they expect to have more of their spending budget allocated towards servers over data centers. So I mean, certainly some mixed commentary out there just about the kind of the strength of the data centre market and demand in general. I'd love to get your thoughts or commentary on that. Paul Szurek : So again, we have a hard time seeing what's going on outside our markets and our customer activity, but from what we see demand still seems to be strong. Having said that, if you just look broadly from what we can all see there are markets that have low barriers to entry, saw significant private capital going to development platforms over the last two years and probably got over built. To some extent we've mentioned that in Northern Virginia and the spec construction that took place in 2018 and 2019, which appears to have abated quite a bit. So that may be part of it. And I think you've got similar dynamics going on in markets like Phoenix and Dallas and maybe other markets that are less visible to all of us, but that may be a part of it of what you're seeing there Michael. I don't know that we see any slowdown. I mean, you look at the overall growth trends of the major CSPs and they still seem to be in absolute terms growing the same volume year-over-year. Mike Funk : And your comments imply that maybe some of the speculative capital is pulling back out of those markets that are coming in the last two years. I mean, in the markets where you do compete, are you seeing any kind of specific changes in competitor behavior, maybe less aggressive or more aggressive, any kind of change in behavior? Paul Szurek : I mean, the only one where we've really seen a significant amount of that has been that we're in has been Northern Virginia, and I believe we have absolutely seen a pullback in privately funded speculative development. And I don't know, it's three or four of those development platforms have explicitly announced that they're not going to go forward with the spec development they're trying to mutate into a build to suit model. Mike Funk : And then one final one, I appreciate of the time here. Just to clarify, so what is your exposure if any to some of the second tier data centre providers, I guess even guys like Flexential, Cyxtera, Internap, do you have any exposure there as far as leasing space? Paul Szurek : I think that's covered in Jeff's comment about how our exposure to that kind of sector in general has declined. That has been in some respects, some of our churn \u2013 at least with respect to one of those companies. But again, we don't have much of that left. Mike Funk : Right, that's in the \u2013 that's in the low single digits that you called out, the 46% of the business, right? Paul Szurek : Exactly. Mike Funk : That's great. Thanks for clarification. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Rasmussen with Stifel. Please proceed you\u2019re your question. Erik Rasmussen : Yeah, thank you. So in terms of your 2020 guidance, how should we think about the range of your revenue guidance 600 to 610? What can drive that to the lower end of that range? And then what are your thoughts about the company's ability to return to low double digit growth in possibly 2021. Jeff Finnin : Hey, Eric, it's Jeff. Let me just give you some feedback on your first question related to revenue. And I think, similar to what Paul alluded to in his prepared remarks, we've got the capacity today as compared to the last couple of years, where I think it gives us the agility to compete more effectively, where we can see some of that demand. As some of the demand continues, I just think it gives us the capabilities to compete more effectively especially for some of those scale deals that might in the marketplace, so I think we're optimistic about that. But we got to see ultimately how the market evolves and where those opportunities arise. And as we've said, historically, those tend to be fairly lumpy. In terms of your question longer term the ability to return to double digit growth. I would say that as I look near term and call it the next two to three years, I think we're optimistic to get back to those high single digit growth rates, assuming we continue to execute on some of the priorities Paul laid out and assuming that the churn received back to those levels we've seen historically, and I think we're optimistic about getting back to those high single digit growth levels in the near term. Paul Szurek : And I'd just add \u2013 remind you the comments I made earlier that we're bigger cut made, the denominator is bigger, the industry is more mature and yet relative to other reach sectors I think our prospects for recurring annual growth over the intermediate term are better than probably all the other ones I can think of or at least most of them I can think of. And I think that's a good business model. Erik Rasmussen : Great, thanks and then VA3 seem to make a nice progress despite no scale deals in the quarter. Are you starting to see any movement where leasing dynamics are improving where you would potentially participate in this market when it comes to larger deals? Steve Smith : Yeah, I would just say you're exactly right. I mean, our fourth quarter was actually the best quarter we've had in two years. And if you look at the makeup of that as you look at the overall numbers, it's all retail type of business, good enterprise business that we've been selling there. So we've been able to really sell effectively into our first phase there and now into second phase. And we have seen good pipeline and good results there. So we're optimistic. And as the opportunities present themselves both in retail and scale there is scale opportunities out there that value that type of platform that we both now have the capacity for, as well as the interconnection for those low latency applications that exist out there. We just \u2013 as we've said, in the past, we are trying to be diligent and pragmatic about those opportunities and ensure that they add value to the platform and deliver the returns that we expect. Erik Rasmussen : Thanks and maybe just last, just following on that theme. Obviously, last year was a great year for your scale colo business. I mean, I think it was up 4X of what it was a prior year. Is that at where we are today \u2013 is this sort of an achievable target for the company this year or it's still too early to tell when we're waiting on sort of some of these key markets to come back? Steve Smith : Well, as Jeff mentioned, we're optimistic about the growth opportunities that we see ahead of us. So it was a record year for us. And as you can back into the math of our current guidance, we have not expected that same type of result in our current sales mix for 2020. But we're optimistic about \u2013that opportunity for us, but those deals and that leaking is very lumpy as we've depicted in the past and so trying to forecast that type of growth is challenging. Erik Rasmussen : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question. Nate Crossett : Thanks, guys. A lot\u2019s been answered already. But what are you guys expecting for interconnected pricing going forward? So it looks like MMR per Cabinet, the growth rate has trended down I believe. What's kind of a stabilized long-term growth rate that we should be assuming for that? Jeff Finnin : Hey, Nate as you look at that, MRR per Cabi and you look at the results for the fourth quarter, really what contributed to the \u2013 I think it's 4.1% overall growth rate year-over-year is the largest contributor to that was the interconnection revenue growth. And historically we've been in that mid-single digits for that MRR per Cabi growth, I would expect that as we think about 2020 to be probably low single to mid-single \u2013 low to mid-single digits for 2020 and largely just because of the guidance we've given around our mark-to-market on renewals being a little bit lower for this year. So that's how I would think about it as you head into 2020 given where we are today. Nate Crossett : Okay, and then you just go on that cash renewals, what was the 2020 guidance and then if you stripped out some of the larger roll downs? Or is it just across the board roll downs everywhere? Just trying to get a sense of normalized kind of pricing? Jeff Finnin : Yeah, I think it's \u2013 I would look at it from the perspective of what we experienced the last two quarters, which is both in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, we had a handful of customers, where we had some roll downs and Steve alluded to it in his prepared remarks and that's dependent upon their size, is dependent upon the term of their leases and more specific into the market, which those renewals are. Once you strip those out, the pricing in both third and fourth quarter was positive. I think it was 3.4% last year \u2013 I'm sorry, in fourth quarter and I think it was 2.8% as my recollection the third quarter. So that's the dynamic you're seeing. And I think that dynamic will continue as we go through 2020. Paul Szurek : Jeff, would it be helpful for him to understand for every hundred basis points of churn or combination of churn in mark-to-market what that means in terms of dollars for us? And that falls to the bottom line? Jeff Finnin : Yeah and I think \u2013 Nate, specifically, I think what Paul is alluding to is if you just think about our 2020 guidance and forecast, when you look at our churn from 2019, into the year 11.1%, if you get that down to a more normal range where we have been historically, so just strip, four percentage points off that to make the math easy. That type of elevated turn in '19 and that four percentage points adds another $12 million or roughly $0.25 per share to our bottom line in 2020. And I think that gives you an indication of some of those headwinds we're face headed in 2020. And it makes it real when you start to quantify it from that perspective. Is that what you're looking for? Nate Crossett : Yeah, I mean, that's helpful. Just completely different topic now, what do you guys doing on the ESG front in terms of commitment to clean energy? What are the targets you guys have put out? And then maybe can you speak to what the financial impact would be or could be by going, for example, 100% green? Paul Szurek : So, first of all, I just refer you to the ESG report that we put out every year. Our primary focus quite honestly has been on energy efficiency dollar for dollar, that's the largest impact on our and our customers' greenness. And frankly, we're already providing a lot of that greenness to customers. We know one customer for example that is able to qualify their new compute environment as one of the 10 greenest in the world just by moving into our more power efficient data centers from their on-premises deployment. So that's where our most of our focus has been, as we said in the past, we will purchase renewable energy, where it is allowed by the local utility and where the cost is basically competitive i.e., will not adversely impact our customers. And that tends to be the focus of our customers and that is what we have been \u2013 that's what we've accomplished. We also quite honestly encourage our utilities to generate and allocate other low carbon or non-carbon sources of generation. But because we don't have control over the power mix in our more regulated markets, we don't have any specific targets, but we do advocate for non-carbon and renewable generation sources and we do as often as they allow us and we can do so competitively purchase and wheel in those sources of energy. Nate Crossett : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Richard Choe : Hi, I just wanted to clarify on the annualized cash rent growth, the five customers and you mentioned the 2015 vintage, is this something that's going to last just through 2020? Or is it going to last for a few years since it just started in the second half of last year, just want to get a sense of how long you might be facing some of these roll downs going forward. Paul Szurek : Yeah. So Richard, as I said, I think in response to an earlier question, it's hard to predict beyond 2020 because you don't know what supply and demand will be in each market and what that will mean for market pricing in each market. But we do believe it's like a lot of \u2013 like even the churn that we're experiencing is that you do go through these vintages and then eventually the effects of a certain vintage are two go away. And so we don't really have visibility beyond 2020. But if history is any guide, we should see some improvement in these areas going forward past 2020. Jeff Finnin : Hey, Richard the only thing I'd add is on page 15 of the supplemental, just take a look also at our lease expiration table, it'll give you an idea what those explorations are on a per square foot and compare that to our current pricing. And then just monitor that as we move forward. I think it gives you a better idea maybe where that's going to be longer term. Richard Choe : Got it, thank you. Jeff Finnin : You bet. Operator : Our next question is a follow up question from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Sadler : Thanks. I was \u2013 just want to dial in a second on California for a second. Could you give what you think market pricing is for scale in Santa Clara these days? Steve Smith : Don't know if you want to \u2013 I don't know if there's \u2013 it's difficult to disclose what market pricing is. There are so many factors that go into a price for a given customer, depending upon their density, the size of the deployment, as well as their interconnection requirements. So that's why the moment of silence there because it's really difficult to kind of quantify a given market price given all those different factors. Jordan Sadler : Is it feasible for a scale requirement to be better than $250 per K Debt [ph]? Steve Smith : All in is that you're talking about? Jordan Sadler : Yeah. Yeah. Steve Smith : I guess it's \u2013again, it just depends on the deployment. And there's a lot of different ways to configure a pricing parameter around a different given customer based off of their power draw, their density levels, all those different factors. So it's just challenging for me to even give you a straight answer. Paul Szurek : And honestly, we encounter different dynamics than other companies do because our ecosystem has a different value than campuses that don't have the same density and diversity of customers who are using all the various services and want to do it with the lowest latency or zero latency in essence highest bandwidth, highest security for exchanging data. And so there's \u2013 it's like saying in other forms real estate what's the market price for space in particular mixed use development. A lot of that depends on what the mixed use development is compared to what other alternatives are. Steve Smith : The only other thing I would just kind of \u2013 my comments with this, as you build a contractual agreement with a customer, there's a lot of factors that go into that part of it as size and density and so forth, but also expected power draw from that customer and how you manage that in relation to the rest of the draw of that computer room and the building. So it really is very challenging, really impossible to give you just a market price without knowing the exact parameters of the customer. Jordan Sadler : Okay, and then this is for \u2013 maybe for Jeff. Jeff, have you thought about the potential exposure to Prop 13 for CoreSite? Jeff Finnin : Yeah Jordan, we have looked at it over the last couple years. And basically when you look at that portion of our property tax expense that's isolated to specifically California and then more specifically, to those leases, where we do not have the ability to pass through the cost increases. It's limited to about $3.5 million that sits inside our portfolio that's equal to about 15% of our total property tax expense. And so what's important also about that \u2013 Jordan Sadler : Your direct exposure to California property taxes is 3.5 million. Jeff Finnin : For that portion in which we cannot pass cost increases to customers. Jordan Sadler : Right, right. Jeff Finnin : Yeah, that's correct, so 3.5 million and just to give you some other data around that I think helps as we look at this, the leases associated with that $3.5 million, they're on average ever remaining lease term about two and a half years. So obviously, we'll have plenty of opportunities near term to have \u2013 continue to have conversations about maintaining them and pricing it accordingly. But we're watching that closely and continue to monitor the overall effects to our business. Paul Szurek : Jordon I'd only add that these are estimates based on what we believe the impact on property tax valuations would be, obviously, if this thing passes and it gets implemented, latter part of 2021 into 2022, some of those things will be determined more specifically. Jordan Sadler : Right, right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Michael Bilerman : Hey, thanks for sticking on. So I just want to go back on the churn just in terms of \u2013 as you discussed last year it caught you by surprise and you have spent a lot of time digging into it. Jeff you peeling back the onion to really understand things. What have you done from an organizational perspective in terms of changes, in terms of reporting lines? Maybe people who've left the organization, the people who've joined the organization, I guess other than just sucking it up and having a lot of churn last year and this year, what are you doing differently to get the Street comfortable that this won't be a recurring problem? Paul Szurek : Well, obviously Jeff and his team, as you've mentioned have done a lot more digging and analytics around the customer base. But we have also made it a high priority with all of our general managers in each market, working collaboratively with the sales team to have specific responsibilities and reporting around churn, risk, expectations, what's being done with respect to each customer. We've laid out a new rubric for determining how to address customers, when they come in at renewal and want a pricing change or something like that. When do we give that when do we not? The main focus being at least not be surprised by it, but having said that, I think even had those efforts been in place a year to 18 months ago or those new processes in place a year to 18 months ago, I don't think it would have changed our experience that much because quite honestly, a significant part of the \u2013 probably almost all of the unexpected churn is churn that really wasn't to be expected based on lease terms. Customers turned out before their lease term was up or even customers that at one stage in the discussions were planning to renew and then somewhere late in the game changed their mind. So we should be able to have \u2013 and I think the biggest comfort, as you said for the Street is just the fact that a lot of these business models have significantly declined, as Jeff described as a percentage of our portfolio. Michael Bilerman : So I guess there's an element of the leasing decisions initially, right? So in the banking world, we're all familiar with claw backs when something you do turns out to have not been the right thing. And so I wonder just on your initial leasing is there changes there that need to be made in terms of the types of customers you're bringing into the portfolio that may have a higher risk of churn in the future, right. So are you making better leasing decisions today? And also, it sounds like you're taking it a lot seriously, trying to manage the outgoing customers from churn. Paul Szurek : So I think we're making good leasing decisions today. I can't really say that they're better because when you look at some of these customers that came in and some of them have been in place for seven, eight, nine years, had vibrant business models at the time. And I think neither they nor most people really expected the significant disruption from cloud that started occurring four, five years ago. So that's always a part of this business. It's why we stress the importance of constantly acquiring new logos. That's why we've tried to build great relationships for edge cloud use cases with the major CSPs who are good to work with and are obviously good credits. So yeah, I think that as we work through these churn episodes we come out with a stronger portfolio. But I think the company has always been pretty careful about its leasing decisions and that shows up in our very low bad debt expenses. Michael Bilerman : Right and just specifically on the 10% for next year, so it sounds like 370 in the first quarter, 250 for a specific tenant in the fourth quarter, which leaves about 380 spread over the second, third and fourth, just from what I guess I would call normal, so 120 basis points a quarter. Is that \u2013 just to make sure I got the math right, is that right? Jeff Finnin : Yeah, I think that's close Michael. I would say 350 was our midpoint for the first quarter, so you were just a little bit high there. But that might leave you about 400 basis points for the rest of the last three quarters. Michael Bilerman : And is that \u2013 I guess, just knowing that number, that enough, right. I mean, I guess I'd be conservative enough on the level of an anticipated churn that normally would occur outside of what you know today, right. And it's going to be really high in the first quarter. What's to say that it won't stay that an elevated level through the second, third and fourth quarter, right? Jeff Finnin : Right, yeah. No, it's obviously something we look at as we're going through all of our renewals over the next call it 24 months and it's our expectations that it would be lower. Typically on a typical quarter for us it's usually 1% to 2% is what we've seen historically. So those numbers don't sound out of line with what the remaining portion is. Paul Szurek : And Michael, just as Jeff mentioned earlier, the higher churn in the first quarter is basically one customer and the higher churn in the fourth quarter is another customer. And absent that, we don't see any other customers of significant magnitude \u2013 of similar magnitude that are in that category. Steve Smith : Obviously, closer to those quarters we get better visibility right. Michael Bilerman : Okay, alright, thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to Paul Szurek for closing remarks. Paul Szurek : Thank you. Thank you all for your time and your interest today. Those were a lot of good questions. I just like to wrap up by thanking my colleagues throughout the company for all the progress they've made and proactively and efficiently building new capacity, expanding our sales to new enterprise customers, and supporting customers with new connectivity products and exceptional operations. I'm very fortunate to work with this group of people. And just to recap, we believe the ongoing benefits of these improvements along with the secular tailwinds for our campuses should lead to a resurgence of growth if we outpaced churn for our expectations. We look forward to working to achieve that future and we hope all of you have a great day. Thanks very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Igor Khislavsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Igor Khislavsky : Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. Before the rest of my comments, I'll note that due to COVID-19, all of us on the call this morning are dialing in remotely from different locations. So to the extent there are any minor technical difficulties on the call, we would ask that you bear with us. Our agenda for this morning will be as follows. First, I'll quickly summarize our financial results for the first quarter. Next, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide some brief commentary on our U.S. business. Next, Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q1 2020 results and updated 2020 outlook. And finally, our Executive Chairman, Jim Taiclet, will share a few closing remarks. After these comments, we will take your questions. I'll remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include : our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2020 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance, our expectation regarding the impacts of COVID-19, our expectations regarding the impacts of the AGR decision in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.  Now please turn to Slide four of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the first quarter. During the quarter, our property revenue increased 10.5% to nearly $2 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by 14.1% to $1.3 billion. And our consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share increased by roughly 5% to $907 million and $2.03, respectively. These consolidated AFFO metrics were impacted by a onetime cash interest charge of approximately $63 million associated with our purchase of MTN's minority stakes in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda during the quarter. Absent this onetime item, consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share would have grown by more than 12%. Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by roughly 4.4% to $415 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Igor, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all staying safe and well. Typically, in our first quarter earnings call, we would talk exclusively about our U.S. business, and how it is positioned in the market. But given that there is nothing typical in the world in which we live today, I'd like to first discuss how we are navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, including its historical impact on the global economy. Our number one priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, their families, our tenants, suppliers and surrounding communities. Most of our team members globally are working from home. To facilitate this, we bolstered our IT environment to support more remote work and established alternative business processes and solutions to overcome the need to have work accomplished from our office or at our established operational centers. We're practicing social distancing in a few instances where certain employees need to be in the office and have provided added equipment and supplies for those considered essential and needed to be out in our sites supporting our tenants. We're also in the process of establishing our overall guidelines and procedures for an eventual return to work in our offices across the globe. These guidelines will adhere to government directives and be supplemented by reasonable and practical criteria based on local situational needs and circumstances. The reopening process will be based on safety readiness levels and will not commence until I'm certain we have complete access to the necessary critical resources and supplies. I also want to emphasize that while immersed in all this activity and uncertainty, relative to just how long this crisis will last, we remain focused on continuing to meet the needs of our tenants. To that end, I want to note that to this point, the direct effects of the virus on our core business outside of translational FX impacts have been modest. While we're continually monitoring the COVID-19 impacts, our business model globally has demonstrated its resiliency and stability. Now more than ever, our infrastructure is incredibly critical to ensure our tenants are able to keep their customers connected. As a result, in many of our served markets, including the United States, we have received official priority designations that enable tower-related work to continue, largely uninterrupted. In a few locations, we have experienced some limitations and restrictions, particularly with respect to new builds and other discretionary tower work. In fact, in certain locations, new construction is currently prohibited. While these impacts have so far been modest, we do expect some slight delays in our new build pipeline and colocation activity in certain areas, but do believe these delays will be temporary. All in all, our business and operational focus will continue to be to prioritize actions, projects and capital allocation initiatives that extend, deepen and secure connectivity throughout our served markets. We are proud to help deliver meaningful connectivity to billions of people around the world at an important time like this and are focused on maintaining its continuity. This then brings me to the original topic I wanted to cover with you this morning, and that's of our business here in the United States. In 2020, at the midpoint of our outlook, our U.S. business is expected to represent about 57% of our consolidated property revenues and around 2/3 of our consolidated property operating profit. The U.S. operation is the foundation of our consolidated business and will continue to be for many years to come. Mobile data usage growth of at least 30% per year has driven significant levels of colocations and amendments on our U.S. assets over the last decade. And we expect that growth to continue for the foreseeable future. In fact, according to industry estimates, the average U.S. smartphone user consumed around nine gigabytes per month in 2019, which is up some 450% from just five years ago. Incredibly, by 2025, that same user is projected to consume over 45 gigabytes per month. To account for the strain that this usage growth will create on mobile networks, we believe that our tenants will continue to invest significant amounts of capital into our infrastructure. Over the last five years, this spending has averaged upwards of $30 billion per year. In fact, it's increased over the past 20 years as each new technology generation has been deployed, dating back to 2G. And we would expect that number to remain steady, if not rise, over the next few years, particularly given the recent completion of the Sprint, T-Mobile merger. A significant portion of our tenants' network investments in future years is expected to be 5G focused. And I'll take some time to cover our latest high-level thoughts around 5G and what that might mean for our business in a moment. But first, I'd like to spend a few minutes laying out the key characteristics and return profile of our U.S. business. Our U.S. portfolio, comprised of nearly 41,000 sites, has been created over the last 20-plus years through a number of M&A transactions, complemented by our internal new build program. We've consistently focused on sites with premier locations, significant capacity for lease-up, attractive land lease arrangements and modest requirements for ongoing maintenance CapEx. Perhaps the single biggest driver of value in these assets over the long-term has been the tenant lease contracts or master lease agreements that accompany them, which we have purposely designed to both deliver compelling value to the tenant and secure attractive economics for American Tower. Our requirement for exclusive franchise real estate locations in mission-critical areas has supported our ability to implement these contract structures to generate a consistent, recurring, growing base of cash flow. As you can see on Slide 6, that focus on tower and other franchise real estate assets has resulted in sustained attractive organic tenant billings growth for American Tower, averaging more than 6% over the past five years. The combination of strong colocation and amendment trends, annual contractual escalators and consistently low churn in the U.S. have been key drivers of this growth, as we've capitalized on the deployment and densification of 4G networks across the country. We've translated this strong organic tenant billings growth into attractive NOI yields across our portfolio, particularly for assets that we've owned over the long-term. For example, we're generating yields of 24% on sites we owned prior to 2005 and yields of 17% on sites added to the portfolio from 2005 to 2010. On assets added after 2010, including those from our GTP and Verizon transactions, NOI yields averaged around 6% as of the end of the first quarter. We believe there is significant upside in this vintage of sites as additional equipment is deployed, particularly given the expected acceleration of 5G rollouts over the next few years. Our U.S. tower leadership team has done a terrific job managing our base of assets in the U.S., having locked in more than $28 billion in contractually committed revenue as of the end of the first quarter. Margins in this business, including all of the M&A completed over the last several years, have continued to expand with the property segment operating profit margin coming in at nearly 79% in Q1, accompanied by cash SG&A as a percentage of revenue of just 4.1%. Additionally, our U.S. business ROIC has continued to rise over the last 10 years, while we have nearly doubled our asset base. We now have around 3,000 tenants in the U.S., including a vertical segment focusing on nontraditional tenants. This segment, although still in relatively early stages of development, generated more than 15% of our non-MLA related U.S. [new] [ph] business in the quarter. From an operational perspective, over the past year, our U.S. team has been focused on automating tasks to reduce cycle times, implementing a fleet of drones to secure more accurate data on our sites and implementing several new innovative contract structures, providing process efficiencies for both ourselves and our tenants and reducing the need for site-specific evaluations. From a macro industry perspective, over the next few years, we see several trends unfolding in the U.S. First, we believe the cloud is going to come closer to the edge. Second, 5G will be deployed using a number of different spectrum bands, depending upon the specific areas coverage and capacity requirements, which will look like as somewhat labeled, like a 3-layer cake, opening up the network to allow for a multitude of different customer experiences. And third, the variety of end-user devices and applications is expected to grow faster than we could possibly imagine. In addition, much of this activity should enable our customers to be able to wirelessly transmit data at a lower cost per bit. The overall increase in our tenants resulting value proposition, driven by continued 4G and new 5G network deployments on our infrastructure, will, we expect, continue to increase our NOI yields and returns on invested capital. While we expect to have 4G-related infrastructure on our sites for years to come, we believe ubiquitous 5G deployments are also on our doorstep. What is interesting is that, in fact, each of the major carriers have initially deployed 5G in their own unique ways. Multiple spectrum bands have been and will continue to be deployed, spanning the range from high-band millimeter wave in cities to low band, like 600 megahertz, in rural areas and will ultimately be coupled with mid-band spectrum to support their customers' needs around suburbs and highway corridors. Importantly, we continue to believe that the majority of the sub-6 gigahertz spectrum deployments throughout the country will be on macro towers, and that mid-band spectrum will be a critical component of our tenants' 5G networks. We continue to expect mid-band deployments to accelerate beginning in the second half of this year as the new T-Mobile builds out more of its 2.5-gig spectrum for the foreseeable future. As I mentioned, we also expect spending on 4G networks to continue, given that the migration of the user base from 4G to 5G will take a number of years. Bottom line, we believe that as a result, a tremendous amount of incrementally more complex equipment should end up on our towers across the U.S. over the next five to 10 years, allowing our business to continue to excel. As I mentioned, we believe that over the next several years, the cloud is going to get closer to the edge. We're already seeing this trend from the major hyperscalers, and as a result, continue to evaluate the opportunities that might be there for us. What will also be interesting is how the hyperscale and cloud service providers will interact and position themselves with the carriers. So as a result, we continue to explore trials and partnerships with a variety of different players, including hyperscalers, cloud service providers, carriers, data center companies and equipment suppliers to see just how our infrastructure may plug into this new environment. Using our existing set of assets on the edge data center front, we continue to learn about the rapidly evolving edge ecosystem through our ownership of the metro interconnect facility in Atlanta and initial deployments of several trial edge data facilities at our tower sites. At a high level, we continue to believe that as information generation and processing progressively moves to the network edge, particularly with respect to advanced IoT applications, there will be a greater need for lower latency through distributed storage and compute functionality in close proximity to both wireless and wireline end consumers. Edge compute offerings may eventually serve autonomous vehicle networks, interactive and immersive media delivery, cloud gaming and any number of other products and services where lower latency is a must and/or data needs to be closer to the consumer machine, where we believe the opportunity for us can truly scale. And while the potential for a scaled mobile edge solution is likely several years away, we are seeing initial positive indications of customer interest in our assets and are also having numerous conversations with a number of parties that are likely to play a significant role in the edge going forward. One such example is with Microsoft through their Azure Edge Zones program, where we are now a named partner. As time goes on, we are hopeful that other partnerships will develop to help us accelerate the development of the edge data model. On the indoor connectivity side, we continue to explore ways to leverage carrier-grade Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G and CBRS spectrum to create converged networks. These targeted neutral host solutions can make sense in a much broader array of venues than traditional DAS. So in other words, drastically increasing the total addressable market. We've been part of the CBRS alliance for many years and have several CBRS-based deployments throughout the country. As demand for better, faster and more secure network connectivity continues to accelerate in apartment buildings, class A office space and other similar locations, we are positioning American Tower to hopefully play a meaningful role in satisfying that demand. Here, again, we are likely at least a few years away from potentially scaling CBRS-based neutral host systems but are already seeing positive indications of demand for fixed wireless access, private networks and other solutions in these types of locations. As we look at these and other U.S.-based innovation opportunities, I want to underscore that our investment criteria and philosophy remains the same : we are looking for scalable, exclusive, multi-tenant franchise real estate digital infrastructure opportunities that have the potential to deliver consistent, sustainable, recurring growth for us with returns that rival those of our existing tower model. Taking these innovation initiatives together with our high-performing existing U.S. business, we are energized about the future. The secular trends driving demand for space on our franchise real estate assets continues to accelerate, and we believe we are optimally positioned to convert that demand into attractive total returns for our stockholders over the long-term. Further, our business has performed extremely well through a variety of economic and capital market cycles, and we are confident that American Tower will again stand and deliver through the current turmoil. With that, I turn the call over to Rod to go through our results for the quarter and our updated full year outlook. Rod? Rod Smith : Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. Thank you for joining. Before I dive into our first quarter results, I'd like to also take a moment and acknowledge the COVID-19 pandemic that is affecting all of us. My thoughts and best wishes go out to our employees, tenants, vendors and to each of you on the call this morning. I hope you all are safe and healthy through this difficult time. Let's now turn to our first quarter results. As you saw in today's press release, we began 2020 with a solid quarter, as mobile data consumption continued to grow across the globe. In fact, in many of our markets, particularly internationally, mobile data traffic has increased as a result of COVID-19, highlighting the importance of wireless services everywhere and the critical nature of our global portfolio of communications real estate. To start, I'd like to note a few of our first quarter achievements. Specifically, we met our expectations for organic tenant billings growth rates across the globe, led by Africa at 9.3%, Latin America at 7.5% and the U.S. at 5.6%. We grew our property revenue in tenant billings by more than 10%. We expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 230 basis points over the prior year. We made substantial progress integrating the more than 8,000 sites we acquired at the end of 2019 in Africa and Latin America. We've built approximately 1,000 new sites. We strengthened our balance sheet and now have $5.4 billion of liquidity pro forma for our new term loan from earlier this month. And we grew our common stock dividend by 20% again. Before we discuss the details of our full year outlook, let's first spend a few minutes reviewing our financial and operational results for the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 8, and we will review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. For the quarter, you can see that our underlying growth remains solid throughout our markets. Due to strong demand for our assets across the globe and on an FX-neutral basis, we met our internal expectations for revenue. As Igor mentioned earlier, our first quarter consolidated property revenue of approximately $1,970,000,000, grew by $187 million or 10.5% over Q1 of last year. This included a headwind of roughly $48 million from unfavorable FX translations. Our U.S. segment represented 55% of both our consolidated property revenue and the corresponding growth, while our international segments accounted for the remaining 45%. As always has been the case, the critical components of our consolidated property revenue are those items that impact our recurring tenant billings revenue, including around $79 million in colocations and amendments, a similar level to prior quarters. Our consistent and reliable contractual escalators, which added $50 million, our day one incremental tenant billings resulting from our returns-based and disciplined capital investments, which contributed $72 million and includes M&A and new builds. These positive items were partially offset by lease non-renewals or churn, which reduced our tenant billings revenue by $49 million for the quarter. Looking at our major business segments; our U.S. property segment revenue totaled nearly $1.1 billion for the quarter and grew by $104 million or 10.5% over the prior year period. Our international property revenue of $883 million grew by $84 million or 10.5% over last year's levels. As expected, we saw solid demand from our major carrier tenants around the globe. This demand was driven by the carriers' need to continually invest in their networks in order to keep pace with the exploding growth in mobile data consumption. Moving to the right side of the slide, you will see that our consolidated organic tenant billings growth also met our expectations, coming in at 5.4% for the quarter. For our U.S. property segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.6%, comprised of new business activity, which totaled 4.5%; pricing escalators, which totaled 3.3%; and churn of 2%; and a roughly 0.3% negative impact from other items, which partially offset the items I mentioned above. As expected, this growth rate reflects a deceleration from prior quarters, partially driven by the impact of the pending Sprint, T-Mobile merger had on new business activity levels. Now that the merger has closed, we stand ready to support the new T-Mobile as it begins to invest significant capital and to perform the earnest work of integrating two complex networks, deploying diverse spectrum holdings and servicing more than 100 million subscribers, all while preparing for a 5G future. Regarding our international segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.1%, led by Africa at more than 9% and Latin America at 7.5%. Europe totaled just about 2%, while India came in with a decline of around 1%, which was in line with our expectations, given anticipated churn and market conditions. The component parts of our international organic tenant billings growth were new business activity, which totaled 7%; our mostly local inflation-based pricing escalators, which totaled 3.6%; other items, which contributed around 20 basis points and partially offsetting these increases was churn of 5.8%, largely attributable to previously anticipated cancellations in India. Turning to slide nine. You can see our first quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.3 billion grew by $157 million or 14.1% over the prior year period. As a result of our continued focus on driving organic growth, adding new assets and managing costs throughout our business, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.8% for the quarter, which was up 230 basis points compared to Q1 of last year. I will also note that these results include the impacts of around $16 million in incremental bad debt recorded in India due to some slow payments of accounts receivable from certain tenants, including government-owned BSNL. We think it's likely we will collect these receivables in the future, but for now, we have provided for them by increasing our bad debt reserves. In addition, our adjusted EBITDA growth was negatively impacted by approximately $26 million or 2.3% for FX fluctuations as compared to Q1 of last year. Our U.S. property segment operating profit of $858 million grew by $105 million or nearly 14% over the year-ago period, while our international property segment operating profit of $448 million grew by $62 million or 16% over last year's level. As a result, our U.S. segment represented 66% of our property segment operating profit in the quarter and 63% of the corresponding growth, while international accounted for the remaining 34% and 37%, respectively. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see our consolidated AFFO of $907 million grew by $45 million or 5.3% over the year-ago period. Our consolidated AFFO per share of $2.03 grew by $0.09 or 4.6% over last year's levels. It is important to consider that the consolidated AFFO results include the impact of a onetime cash interest expense charge totaling $63 million as a result of our purchase of MTN's stake in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda. Absent this non-recurring charge, our consolidated AFFO and AFFO per share growth would have been 12.6% and 12.4%, respectively. As a reminder, we now expect a gap between consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to common stockholders to be modest in future years as a result of these minority stake purchases and our expected purchase of the remaining Tata stake in our India business, which is anticipated for later this year. Moving to Slide 10, let's now take a look at our updated expectations for 2020. To start, I will address a few of the business issues that require careful consideration as we updated our full year outlook. First and foremost is the COVID-19 pandemic. Although its full year impact on the world is not yet known, to date, on a constant currency basis, we have experienced only modest impacts. In fact, in many of our international markets, markets that have little or no fixed line infrastructure, our tenants are actually seeing increases in mobile data consumption across their networks, which may increase demand for our sites over time. As stated earlier, this highlights the world's growing reliance on wireless services and evidences the critical nature of our global portfolio of communications real estate. With that said, COVID-19 has caused global financial turmoil and material moves in many foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Of course, these FX moves are having a negative impact on our updated full year outlook. I'll discuss the detail of those impact shortly. But in the general context of the current FX volatility, I will note that we routinely review our hedging policies and often engage with the help of specialized external advisers in doing so. Although we have hedged purchase prices for certain international transactions in the past, historically, we have concluded that the potential benefit of actively hedging our ongoing translational FX exposure are not worth the real economic cost. Instead, we rely on natural hedges such as the portfolio effect of our '19 markets, our reinvestment of locally generated operating cash flow through new builds and M&A activity and select issuances of local currency debt. In addition, most of our tenant leases in international markets have annual local inflation-based escalators or are denominated in U.S. dollars. At this stage, we do not anticipate any significant changes in our approach to hedging, but as always, we continue to evaluate our options. Next, in the U.S., T-Mobile recently completed its merger with Sprint. As a result, we continue to anticipate an acceleration of spending from the new T-Mobile to begin in the second half of the year. In addition, beyond 2020, we believe this industry shift may result in a sustained increase in wireless industry capital spending as 5G deployments ramp and Dish supported its network. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from the future 5G deployments as carriers continue to focus on network quality. Finally, in India, the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the fees, penalties and interest assessments associated with the previous ruling on the definition of adjusted gross revenues. Although the total liability has been reaffirmed, we don't yet know the pacing and duration of the required payments on the part of the carriers, particularly in the context of the current COVID-19 situation. Taking these updated considerations and our assessment of market conditions into account and based on the proven resilience of our global business, our total property revenue outlook on a constant currency basis is unchanged. However, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as compared to our prior outlook are expected to negatively impact reported property revenues for the full year by approximately $300 million. For organic tenant billings growth, we are reiterating our outlook across most of our geographic segments. However, for Africa, we now expect organic tenant billings growth of around 9% for the year, down from 11% in our initial outlook. This is being driven by a reclassification of certain revenues out of tenant billings rather than a shift in the underlying fundamentals of our Africa business. Looking at Slide 11, you will see that we are also affirming our underlying expectations for adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of our outlook outside of an FX translational impact of approximately $165 million. This includes the expectation that cash, SG&A as a percent of total revenue will be right around 8%. Lastly, we are reiterating our expectations for consolidated AFFO for the year on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to carefully manage our cash interest expense and cash taxes, while converting the vast majority of our cash adjusted EBITDA growth into consolidated AFFO growth. As a result, outside of roughly $140 million or $0.32 per share and unfavorable FX translation impacts, our consolidated AFFO and AFFO per share projections are unchanged. Although we are not surprised by how well our business has performed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to monitor events closely as the full impacts of this crisis develop. I would also note that to the extent that local market measures, like shelter-in-place orders are prolonged, we could eventually experience some timing issues regarding new business commencements, new builds or even accounts receivable collections. Flipping to Slide 12, I'd like to now briefly discuss our capital allocation plans for the year, which remain broadly consistent with our prior view. Our full year dividend declaration, subject to the approval of our Board, is expected to be approximately $2 billion, resulting in an annual common stock dividend growth rate of right around 20% once again. We also expect to deploy $1.2 billion towards our CapEx program, with 85% of that investment being discretionary. As a result of COVID-19 and the associated FX impacts, we now expect a reduction of $50 million from our prior CapEx outlook. This includes a $30 million reduction in redevelopment CapEx, $5 million in lower maintenance CapEx and $15 million in lower development capital spending, in part due to a delay of construction of approximately 1,000 new builds in India. In the first quarter, we deployed $524 million to buy MTN's minority stakes in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda and have earmarked another $328 million at March 31, 2020, exchange rates for our pending purchase of Tata's remaining interest in our India business. In addition, we have spent roughly $49 million on other M&A so far this year and have deployed about $55 million through April 22 to share repurchases. Given our strong balance sheet and current liquidity, we expect to fund the entirety of our 2020 capital deployment plans with cash on hand, cash from operations and modest levels of revolver borrowings. We also expect to explore additional opportunities to extend and ladder our debt maturities and reduce our overall cost of borrowings. As a result, we anticipate continuing our long track record of generating strong consolidated AFFO per share growth, while simultaneously growing our return on invested capital. Turning now to Slide 13, I will briefly summarize the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet and our current liquidity position, which we believe is unmatched in our sector. As of the end of the first quarter, we had more than $1.3 billion in cash and $2.9 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed an additional one year term loan of nearly $1.2 billion, increasing our liquidity on a pro forma basis to more than $5 billion. Our net leverage at the end of the quarter was 4.6 times, in line with our targeted range and consistent with our historical levels. Our weighted average cost of debt was around 3.1%, and our weighted average debt tenor was over five years. Regarding our debt maturities for 2020, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced the redemption of our $750 million, 2.8% unsecured notes, leaving us with just $350 million in the remaining maturities this year. As a result of our prudent financial policies that have been implemented and enhanced over the last decade and the overall stability and resilience of our business, we believe we are in an extremely strong financial position amid the current market turmoil. We expect this to enable us to continue to be opportunistic with respect to investing and growth, including M&A opportunities on a global basis. If you would please turn to slide 14, I will conclude my comments with a brief summary. Despite the global pandemic, we had a good start to 2020 as we achieved solid organic tenant billings growth, expanded our margins and ROIC, started integrating the portfolios acquired at the end of 2019 and once again, increased our quarterly dividend by 20%. We further strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet, increasing our current liquidity to $5.4 billion and positioning ourselves to comfortably fund our 2020 capital deployment plan, while expanding our global power portfolio through opportunistic M&A. And finally, outside of the translational FX impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, our outlook remains largely unchanged, highlighting the critical nature of wireless services everywhere as mobile data consumption continues to grow at a dramatic pace across the globe. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Taiclet : Thanks, Rod, and good morning, everyone. To each of you on the call today, I wish you and yours a safe and healthy path to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Tom stated earlier, our top priority in American Tower is the health and safety of our global workforce. Our dedicated employees and managers throughout the company are committed to keeping critical telecommunications infrastructure fully operational and functional in their communities. The senior executive team and management throughout ATC are doing everything they can to support our global teams in this essential work. Our company is also contributing to those communities financially through our philanthropy and CSR programs and through the American Tower Foundation. This includes everything from working in Boston, Massachusetts with local and state support funds for citizens in need, to funding and donating PPE to health workers throughout the U.S., to helping with the government of India's COVID-19 recovery fund and many more. In addition, Commerce Secretary Ross and I have agreed to immediately pivot the entire near-term work effort of the U.S.-India CEO Forum, which we co-chair, toward COVID-19 relief and recovery efforts in the world's two largest democracies. We are fully engaged with the GOI and our Indian counterpart companies in this effort. As ATC's Executive Chairman, I have been offering guidance regarding our COVID-19 response, while also working very closely with Tom to ensure a smooth and seamless management transition. As I move toward completing my nearly 20-year tenure at American Tower, I am tremendously confident in three key respects : Tom's ability to lead our highly capable executive team and the business into a successful and prosperous future, the continuing vibrancy of our Stand and Deliver strategy and its ability to deliver strong performance and returns to our investors and that the ongoing demand drivers for mobile infrastructure will underpin strong growth for ATC for many years to come. Lastly, I would like to thank our investors and analysts, many of whom are on this call today, for your confidence in our team during the many years that I have been privileged to lead it. I fully expect that Tom will now lead the company, along the trajectory of our Stand and Deliver strategy, to even greater heights in the future. And now I'll turn it back over to Tom for some closing thoughts before we go to Q&A. Tom Bartlett : Hey, thanks, Jim. Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to first recognize our Board Chairman, Jim Taiclet, for his incredible leadership, judgment and friendship over these last 20 years. Over that period, our business has grown from operating in just three markets, generating about $1 billion in revenue with 15 sites to where we are today. That, in and of itself, is amazing and a testament to his leadership, but it's the way he has guided us and built this culture that, in my mind, will forever be his legacy and my compass for where we go from here. So Jim, I'd like to say on behalf of all your investors and employees, we thank you. Okay. Operator, please, now, let's open the lines for some Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. please go ahead. Brett Feldman : And congrats to Tom and Rod, well earned. And congrats, and thank you to Jim. It's obviously sad to see you go, but I do feel like this transition is natural and seamless, and I do think that it speaks volumes about the quality of the organization that you built and the legacy you leave behind. And so I'm going to take advantage of this opportunity to ask you one last question. When you and the Board were starting to design the company's expanded international strategy, which is, I don't know, 13, 14 years ago, you talked about a range of risks that the company was willing to take, a range of stresses that you thought you were designing your international operations to absorb. And while I'm certain you didn't anticipate this exact situation, I was hoping you can maybe remind us of those risk parameters, the stress points that you designed the business for so as we watch this pandemic unfold, we can assess for ourselves whether these changes are within scope or whether adjustments are going to need to be made. Jim Taiclet : Sure, Brett, and thanks for your kind comments. I'll start it off and maybe turn it back over to Tom to speak of the plan ahead. But the range of risks that we anticipated was based on the fundamental risk we had at the time, which we were a single country, single-product company that had really large growth ambitions. And I think to risk mitigate that very high concentration in the U.S. tower market that we went on, as you described it, a 15-year sort of diversification plan. So we diversified among currencies, continents, countries, customers, markets, etcetera, to try to, as you would do, create a portfolio that grew over time that would mitigate risk and grow faster than otherwise we could have. And that's really the framework around what we've been doing for all that time since 2007 or so. So I think within that context, I could let Tom describe how he and perhaps Rod thinks that this can play out given the COVID-19. I think it's still within our framework, frankly, Brett. But let me ask Tom to comment. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Jim. And thanks, Brett, as well for the comments. I think, as Jim said, I mean, what kind of supports and underwrites the overall international strategy is it's the same business model as we have in the United States. It's not a new set of products and services. And so it allows us to take the model that we built in the United States in terms of how we look at an infrastructure, how we actually look at the master lease agreements and being able to take that offshore into those large, emerging market economies to be able to drive growth. The other piece that Jim talked about was the diversification. We underwrite these investments operationally, which I'll spend a minute some thoughts on it in a minute, but it's a very diversified portfolio. And so we are scattered around in 19 markets, 18 of which are outside of the United States. And we also think that, that serves as a useful way for us to be able to kind of underwrite the risk. The third is we're large incumbents. Our customers are the largest telecommunications companies around the world. So it's we're not dealing with consumers. We're not dealing with a number of small players. These are the large AT&Ts and Verizons outside of out of the United States. And operationally, when we look at the investments themselves, we're looking at them over a very long period of time, so we have a 10-year discounted cash flow, and we underwrite them with a risk-adjusted cost of capital. So we are caring for a lot of the risks that you would normally see. And they have escalators in them that are CPI based, utilizing local debt, reinvesting that cash back into the business. And so we think if we're able to do this in a very balanced way, a very diversified way, we're going to be able to successfully enjoy the growth that we're seeing from these markets that, as you all know, are anywhere from three to five years behind the U.S. from a technology perspective. So we think that's a sound approach, a balanced approach, again, to being able to kind of leverage all the opportunity we see offshore. Jim Taiclet : Yes. And Tom, I'd like to just add one more point. We still got about 2/3 or more of the cash flow coming from the U.S. So it's grown just as rapidly. In fact, as the international has on a cash flow basis all for that 15-year period. So there wasn't so much risk mitigation that we ended up with, which was really turbocharging growth and keeping a similar risk profile based on diversification. Tom Bartlett : Jim, if I could just add a couple of comments there in terms of our ability to build new assets in these international markets. When we build new assets, those are our highest yielding investments and we've been able to build a lot of assets around the globe, more than 4,000 sites last year. And this year, we expect to build even more than that. So it's a way for us to kind of expand our horizon and be able to deploy significant capital in the most productive way possible. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Morning, guys. Well, the world certainly has changed -the world has certainly changed in the last two months since your 4Q call. First, I'm glad to hear, and I hope your family, you and your employees stay safe in this crazy time. I'll add my comments to say, Jim, I remember that non-deal road show in San Francisco. Must be almost 20 years ago as you were starting. And the world was in chaos then too, so you guys have navigated very strongly. And echo congrats to Tom and Rod as well. From a business standpoint, obviously, another thing that's changed is Sprint and T-Mobile merger has closed, finally. Dish-Boost might be closing soon. How should we think about the timing of working with them in what's going to be a very complicated process of integrating networks? Do we think of MLAs? Do we think of holistic approaches? And how long do those, generically speaking, how long does it take to kind of work through these complicated master lease agreements? Tom Bartlett : Yes. Rick, I think with - first of all, thank you for your comments and your thoughts. T-Mobile and Sprint have been working and thinking about, I think, their network deployment plans for some time now. So now that the deal is, in fact, closed, we're now able to sit down with them in a meaningful way to talk about a number of different contractual structures with them. I mean, to this point, we've seen some level of increase in the pipeline, but it's still awaiting the bulk really of what we would expect to eventually come through as they ramp up their network deployments. And so we would expect that, as we said, more in the second half of the year to start up some of the more significant volumes. But these are multiyear master lease agreements that master lease agreement structurally that we would put in place. Clearly, we would entertain one of our traditional holistic agreements, where we think it makes sense for us, as well as makes sense for T-Mobile and Sprint. But I think you could be assured that there are significant conversations going on as we speak. T-Mobile is very anxious to get going in terms of being able to meet a lot of their network commitments, and they'll be very aggressive, I am sure. And we are very much committed to being there. And we'll want to tailor the MLA to really be mutually advantaged to both of us. And so that kind of those events will be going on heavily, I would suspect, over the next 60 to 90 days. Ric Prentiss : Great. And Jim, you mentioned your CEO panel committee in India U.S., India jointly working together on the COVID-19, great effort. Any updated thoughts on when the pacing of the payments and the AGR issue in India might be resolved? I'm seeing COVID-19 has kind of put things on a back burner. But I know we get a question a lot of times about when will the carriers know the pacing of that payment. any thoughts? Tom Bartlett : Ric, just as an update. I think as Rod really mentioned, I mean, the process has largely been put on hold as have so many things as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. And so my sense is that I mean, and they're on, as you know, full lockdown in the country itself. So it's really status quo as we sit right now. We anticipate in the second half of the year there'll be further hearings to discuss the payment time line for dues and things like that. But everything is really on hold at this point in time. Ric Prentiss : Makes sense. Again, I'll close with thoughts and hopes and prayers of everybody's family and employees make it through this crazy time. Thanks for taking my questions. Rod Smith : Thanks, Ric. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Ric, and you too. Jim Taiclet : Ric, thanks for your support, it's Jim, over those last 20 years and your deep understanding of our company. To underpin what Tom said on India very quickly, is that the telecommunication and digital infrastructure industry is one of the significant work streams of this group. And we've got great talent on both sides between American Tower. Sunil Mittal of Bharti Airtel is my sub-co-chair for the group on telecom and also Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who's my co-chair for the entire effort in India with Tata. We have really made some great progress on telecom. In general, we've gotten it on the top shelf of the government of India's consideration to strengthen this industry. And I think the AGR resolution will ultimately be included in how that industry has strengthened. That is becoming increasingly important during this crisis as you can imagine there as it is here. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thank you, morning. I also want to extend my congratulations and thanks to Jim, as well as congratulations to Tom and Rod on their new roles. Maybe taking a step back you're welcome. Taking a step back to some of the comments you discussed on expanding the addressable market for revenue, and this is something that the company has been looking at for quite some time. Is there a way to just further put some numbers on the long-term opportunities to expand revenue, whether it's pushing the cloud to the edge with your towers, leveraging CBRS within the DAS strategy and potentially augmenting that and maybe some of the other initiatives that you've been pursuing in the international market? Tom Bartlett : Yes. No, thanks, Michael, and thanks for your congratulations as well. We did set out revenue goals internally, and we've actually talked about them externally, that within a 10-year period, and this is goals that we actually set back in 2017. We would generate probably incremental $1.5 billion from innovation-related events and activities. And fundamentally, there are really two principal elements of those innovation initiatives. First of all, it'll be utilizing exclusive real estate rights and would be multi-tenant. So very much related to our existing tower business. If you kind of step back and you think about our innovation strategy, it's really based upon, again, this neutral multi-tenant connectivity platform, as I'll refer to it, with our own stack that includes exclusive real estate, passive infrastructure, power, transport, compute layers, and again, I refer to that as kind of as our ATC stack on our existing or on a new platform that we are currently building, platform ATC, if you will. I'm not a marketing guy, Michael, but platform ATC. So everything that we're trialing from our edge computing initiatives, power initiatives, our in-building initiatives, the ones that you were referring to, and the kind of the multitude of international access and transport initiatives, they're largely fiber based, are really meant to be constructive as we really build out this stack, if you will, on this platform. So it's not a vertical point solution, but really a broad kind of a horizontal platform, if you will, capable of providing really a myriad of connectivity services. So if you think about 2020, we have three or four kind of major initiatives going on, again, building out this stack, if you will, this platform, if you will. And the first one is what you referred to, is kind of building out our in-building capabilities. We're trying to drive down the traditional DAS costs that we've developed and segment that we've developed over the last 20 years. And we're really trying to open it up to increase the overall TAM. So we're using CBRS spectrum and really opportunities to increase the tendency as well as increase the offload from our customers. We're also trying to more fully develop what we call our transport layer of the stack. And we're looking at fiber to the curb shared initiatives to really facilitate multiservice providers, and we're doing that largely down in Latin America. You also referred to, and we're doing additional work on developing and exploring our edge-based distributed compute and mobile edge computing opportunities. And I mentioned some of those in my remarks, but we're really trying to leverage our Colo Atl [ph] asset in certain sites in our U.S. portfolio. And finally, kind of rounding it out, we're really trying to improve our overall power layer of the stack. We continue to develop a hybrid shared power solution really using historical diesel-fueled generator power with new lower-cost solar and battery packs. So it's a bit of a double click on many of the initiatives. But clearly, we're at the early stages of the development of this stack, if you will. But we do think, again, it's a very effective way to look at our ability to leverage our existing core set of assets and to be able to offer new types of services to existing customers as well as to new types of customers around the globe. So we'll talk more broadly about that. I think on an upcoming call, our second or third quarter call where we take a deeper dive into a lot of the innovation initiatives. But we're well on our way, and we're very focused and we're doing it, I think, very efficiently. We're not throwing money against the wall here, if you will, in terms of building it out. We're being very focused but we're and we're, as you know, I think we have a CTO that we brought in a couple of years ago that is really providing an overall oversight on these overall initiatives that we have. So as I said, more to come, and we'll feel this back even further in a couple of quarters. Rod Smith : And Tom, if I could just add a couple of, I'm sorry, Michael, can I just add a couple of things to what Tom outlined? So I would just add that the strength and resilience of our underlying business really does help support our ability to be inquisitive and opportunistic when it comes to innovation. So our strong and kind of consistent adjusted EBITDA margins, north of 63%, are consistent double-digit revenue growth and the fact that our return on invested capital was north of 11%. That strength in the core underlying business, combined with our very strong balance sheet, again, the liquidity position that we're in at $5.2 billion and pretty low cost of debt at 3.1%, that balance sheet strength is ready to go to work and really does support our ability to be inquisitive when it comes to innovation. Michael Rollins : Just a quick follow-up. Is there a risk that the activity in the bookings pick up in the back half of the year, as you described, but there are labor constraints to actually get the infrastructure on to all of the sites and so therefore, there could be the possibility of an elongated book-to-bill cycle entering into 2021? Tom Bartlett : Michael, sure. I mean, that could always be. We haven't seen that necessarily. We're obviously given kind of the essential ticket, so we're able to be out at the sites, but it could be effective on or could affect our build-to-suit program. For example, we've actually come back a bit on the build-to-suit program. We think that those sites will ultimately be deployed, but the timing could be affected by construction personnel from being out of the site. And we are considered essential personnel. So we think that we won't see significant delays there. But as this continues to go along and if it intensifies, sure, that could delay some of the growth that we see in business. But more specifically, I think it's around build-to-suit. Jim Taiclet : Yes. And Tom, I would just add, I think from an industry leadership position, we were - I think, instrumental with business roundtable in the U.S., the U.S.-India CEO Forum, therefore, in India, to get us in both countries that critical infrastructure designation, not only for our own company, but for our suppliers. And that still needs to be worked through a little bit more deeply in India. But in the U.S., I think it's pretty effective right now. So I expect, Mike, that we'll have a fairly capable vendor force available to us as well our carrier customers as a result of some of that leadership. Tom Bartlett : Yes. And this brings a good point. I mean, one of our initial thoughts was would there be some issues from a supply chain perspective, and it's not necessarily bringing in big radios and things like antennas in, but it's usually that $0.50 part that might get in the way of actually deploying infrastructure. And we haven't seen that at this point in time, but and we don't anticipate it. But as I said, if this continues on, we think we're in a good spot, but and our customers are in a good spot, but time will tell. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Spencer Kurn with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Spencer Kurn : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to inquire about the M&A landscape. In periods of dislocation well, first of all, have you seen any better valuations on some international portfolios in this current dislocation? And I was hoping you could elaborate on your experience in prior periods of market turmoil. Have you found that these are these present opportunities for you to expand more rapidly than you've been able to in periods where markets are tight? Tom Bartlett : Yes. No, Spencer. We always are looking at opportunities, M&A opportunities. As you know, we have business development teams around the globe. And it's a fairly lengthy number of opportunities that are out there, if you will. Whether they're COVID-19 related or not, there continue to be a lot of assets out there up for sale. Back in the 2008, 2009 time frame, there was a significant amount of growth. There were companies that were just distressed and looking to monetize their assets. And we actually were pretty aggressive back at the time and picked up some sizable assets. And so we'll see. I think we're in still early stages, if you will, in terms of the pandemic, in terms of its impacting a particular company's financial position. As Rod mentioned before, we have a sizable liquidity position at this point in time. So I think we're really well positioned to be opportunistic here. But we'll go back to our fundamental investment policy and the way we look at deals, and we'll continue to manage it and monitor it that way. And so time will tell. We just closed two transactions at the end of last year, which we're currently integrating and it's going very well. And so we'll continue to see how the year pans out. But as I said, I think we're in a good financial position to be able to strike at some of these to the extent they become available and make sense to us. Spencer Kurn : Great, thank you. Rod Smith : Sure. Operator : And we have a question from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. please go ahead. David Barden : Let me go everyone else's sentiments. Congrats, Jim, on a successful career and congrats, Tom and Rod, on your guys' elevation. I guess the question I want to ask you is the question I've been getting from a lot of investors, which is what is Tom Bartlett's American Tower going to look like in five years versus how Jim Taiclet's American Tower might have looked? Where is your ambition? What is your strategic goal? Jim, a few years ago, came up with this idea that you wanted to double the size of the company and achieve that goal. What are you ready? Are you able to articulate kind of what your vision now for the company might be and how that might be similar or different from the vision that we've kind of all understood American Tower has? And then let me just ask that. Tom Bartlett : Yes. No. Thanks, David, and thanks for your congrats as well. We've got an excellent strategic and tactical blueprint that I believe that's in place that Jim and I, and the rest of my colleagues that we developed and that we're currently executing. We refer to it as is our Stand and Deliver strategy. And as you know, there are four key elements of it. There's industry leadership. There's a focused innovation process, one that I just talked about a few minutes ago. It's enhancing our efficiency initiatives. And it's a continuing drive for growth, profitable growth, sustainable growth, both organically and inorganically. I think that the way we have consistently thought about creating shareholder value based upon sound principles, around capital allocation and investment criteria, our dividend policy, the way we manage our balance sheet, is absolutely sound. So I mean, I don't see any changes to the way that we've been operating the business, and clearly, no changes to the blueprint that we really have in place. I think that the existing team is outstanding. And so now it's up to us to continue to execute. Will we adjust it and tweak it as the market evolves? Absolutely, as we have continually doing. And as we have done over the last 10, 15 years, if we need to, just, as I say, just as we always have. But the fundamentals are solid. I mean, I don't have any grandiose notions that, okay, we're going to be a $20 billion business by 2025. If that happens, terrific. But we're just going to continue to keep our heads down, really move on the strategy that we've got in place. I think that there are as I was talking a few minutes ago, I think there are a lot of really interesting elements of our innovation strategy, which I think are going to increase the overall addressable market that we're going to be able to take our fair share of. And we're going to continue to globalize. We're a very good and very big international business. I think that there are opportunities for us to continue to globalize, particularly when you look at some centralized global business, operational centers that we have. And so I think there are a lot of things that we can do on the efficiency side. And on the leadership side, Jim is really he's got big shoes to fill on the leadership side, and I think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to really push the envelope in terms of how we're positioned in all the markets that we're in. But when you kind of step back and you look at our inventory, we own about 1/3 of the inventory the assets, if you will, of the 20 market, 19 markets that we're in. So there's a lot of opportunity for inorganic growth. And I think we've got a great business model to enjoy organic growth going forward. So I think we've got the fundamental pieces in place. As I said, we'll tweak it and adjust it based upon where the market is and how the market evolves. But feel very good about the blueprint that we've got in place. Jim Taiclet : And David, to bring it full circle, when we embarked on our international strategy in '07, it actually positioned us to have, as the circle closed in, say, 2017 through 2025, it gave us the opportunity to potentially expand our U.S. domestic business because our innovation program could then kick in over the U.S. and our international portfolios. It gave us a character that no other tower company in the world has, where we can work with new types of customers like hyperscalers, like big real estate owners that span countries. And we're the only one that can take that dimension of an innovation program on digital infrastructure and circle it back to the United States and maybe even grow faster here over the coming years than we otherwise would have without the Stand and Deliver strategy in the international assets, David. So I think there's some real blue skies here for Tom and the team to pursue under the strategy. And I agree that I don't perceive any big deviations from that based on the fact that this is the same exact team that put the strategy together and executed it for 12-plus years with the people on the call we have right now. So I think we're going to be having really exciting times at ATC going forward. David Barden : That's great. Thank you for that, Jim. Appreciate it. And look, everybody. Jim Taiclet : Thanks again. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Thank you very much. Good morning. Let me add my congratulations and best wishes to the team. On the mobile edge compute, can maybe you can just give us some sense of what you're seeing in the current market environment. We've seen strong demand for interconnection, etcetera, in the COVID world. What's going on with the Colo business you have today? And as you think about taking advantage of that opportunity, do you think you need to add additional assets more across the country and in other markets to expand that on that opportunity? Tom Bartlett : Yes. No. Thanks, Simon, and thanks for your congrats as well. I think when you kind of step back and you take a look at our overall edge computing initiatives, I'd really look at it in kind of two pieces. First of all, from a pure distribution or distributed compute perspective, those are aware we've actually had some early-on successes, and this is where we're actually putting cages out at our particular sites. And we're offering edge computing to enterprise, smaller enterprise, midsized enterprise accounts, where they're looking to perhaps move to the public cloud and just looking for some of their workloads to being more distributed. So that's the kind of the easy element and the easy piece that I think we've experienced. And then the second, more complicated piece, candidly, is on the kind of traditional mobile edge computing. And I see this from a number of different elements. I see this from the data center side, we're obviously looking at it from the hyperscaler side. And this is where we're looking at the opportunity for lower latency types of needs that we think are going to be ultimately developing out at the edge and how we might be able to participate in that. And so we have, as you know, the Colo Atl facility that we picked up a couple of or last year, really. And we're looking to interconnect that offering and kind of access to the cloud and trying to interconnect it back to our own sites themselves with the compute power that we're putting out at the sites to see what that ecosystem, if you will, looks like. I don't actually know how this is all ultimately going to pan out. I don't know the relationships that we're going to see with the hyperscalers as well as with the carriers. We see a lot of initiatives going on between Amazon and Google and Azure in terms of how they're looking at the C-RAN and how they're working with AT&T and Verizon and getting further and further out to the edge. We think that we have some very valuable assets that can be part of that overall solution. And we're looking to be able to kind of leverage the assets that we have to be able to support that. But this is going to be something that, as I mentioned before, it's going to take a while to figure out how to scale. I don't think that without the kind of the whole vehicle element here, with all the IoT element here that it's really going to be something that we can scale efficiently. But that's probably three to five years away. And so we're participating in a number of different trials. As I said, we're taking advantage of this kind of distributed compute capability, and we're trying to figure out how we might fit into the overall mobile edge computing environment going forward. So more to come on that. But as I said, I think we've got some very valuable assets there that can play a meaningful role in some way. Simon Flannery : Great, thanks. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. And also just want to extend my congratulations to everyone. I guess, just my first question, you had mentioned some counterparty risk in India. I'm just curious if there's any other areas that you think we should be paying attention to or that you're paying attention to, particularly in the COVID-19 environment. And I guess somewhat related, you mentioned in the international markets, at least, right now, you're actually seeing increased usage, particularly in countries where their wireline networks aren't as strong. Do you think that, that will ultimately translate into incremental revenue? Are you starting to have those conversations now? Although on the opposite side of things, do you actually think that given some of the economic pressures that some of those international markets are going to be seeing, we could actually start to see the opposite where they actually start to pull back on some of their Investments? Just trying to get a better sense of what's winning out. Tom Bartlett : Yes. Colby, on that particular question, I think because of the lack of the wireline presence, I think the governments themselves are going to continue to put pressure on the carriers themselves to ensure that their connectivity continues. And as Jim said, we've been on to some tables with WEF and talking with some of our customers there. I mean, they're all essential and they're incredibly important in terms of ensuring that their customers are connected, particularly with this disease that is so isolationary. So yes, I think that, that demand is going to continue there. As Rod kind of walked through some of our growth rates, we're looking at kind of that 7% to 8% growth rate in Latin America and up in the high single-digit growth rate in Africa. So we're - I believe that, that kind of the growth is actually going to continue. There will there be issues associated with collections and delays and things like that, internet? We haven't seen it, candidly. But to the extent that this continues, sure, that can always be something that we'll that we might see. But we're monitoring it closely. We have obviously, very close relationships with our customers. Our infrastructure is critical to their ability to be able to continue to meet the needs of their customers. So I think we'll be able to manage through that. But we're monitoring it, and we'll watch it very closely and work with our customers to be able to, for all of us, to be able to get through this pandemic. On your first question, could there be delays in organic growth, and we've mentioned some of the delays in the build-to-suit program, the collections issues that we're seeing in India, we've been managing and monitoring those for many years. And so we're working again with our customers. We have an incredible management team in place there who have really terrific relationships with our customers. And so we'll work with them. But ultimately, I think we're in a good position, again, kind of given the critical nature of our infrastructure and that being infrastructure that's really going to allow us all if you kind of get through this pandemic itself. Rod Smith : And then Tom, if I can just add one additional point on the collections issue in India, Colby, that you raised. So when we think about our customer base globally, it is a very strong customer base, large multinational carriers, most of which are investment-grade carriers. When you look at our collections, and when you go through the press release and you see the increase in our accounts receivable, the vast majority of that increase comes from India. In India, I'll point to one customer in particular, which is BSNL, which is a government-owned entity, and that entity has a long history of paying their bills. So we do expect that when the government funding comes through and that could be impacted because of the COVID-19 situation in India, when that comes through, we do expect that those receivables will be paid through that customer. Again, our local teams in India that have a very close relationship with BSNL, they've been through this before. That carrier pays their bills from time to time. They do have to wait for government funding, however. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. Rod Smith : Thanks, Colby [ph]. I think we have time for one more question. Operator, Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brandon Nispel : Great. Appreciate you guys squeezing me in. A couple of three questions. Can you guys quantify for us the backlog in terms of new lease applications that are signed but not on air in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis? And maybe some color on how that trajectory has maybe changed through April here after T-Mobile closed? Second, can you give us what the kicker was on the MLA from AT&T this quarter that may not repeat in the second quarter? And third, maybe just a bigger picture question on 5G. Have you seen enough from your customers for you to see what like a standard configuration that they're going to put up for 5G and what that might mean from an amendment standpoint in the U.S.? Tom Bartlett : Yes. Sure, Brad. Let me take the kind of the 5G question, and then I'll ask Rod to kind of manage through the other myriad questions that you asked here. On the 5G side, I think all the carriers themselves, as I mentioned, have taken kind of their own unique approach to being able to deploy it. I mean, if you take a look at Verizon on the millimeter wave, they're in 34 cities, 17 NFL stadiums. On the sub-6, they're talking about using dynamic spectrum sharing, no stated time lines. AT&T in the millimeter, they deployed 5G in, I think, roughly 35 cities. They're adding new 5G cities this year. They have a sizable amount of millimeter-wave spectrum as well. And then in the sub-6, they're providing 5G in, I think, upwards of 100 markets using kind of low-band 5G. And T-Mobile have also taken a very different approach, largely leveraging their sub-6 spectrum now with Sprint with their 2.5 gig kind of sitting on top of a lot of their 600 megahertz spectrum, but they also have a sizable amount of millimeter-wave spectrum. So I think all of the carriers have taken very different approaches. All ultimately will be circling around kind of this 3-level layer cake, as I've talked about before, where it's at the very base level, kind of the sub-2 gigahertz level, good propagation, limited capacity, but really, it'd be able to get kind of nationwide coverage. The mid-band, which we've talked about, the CBRS and C band, which we think will ultimately be auctioned off this year, improved capacity, lower propagation. And then the millimeter wave, and they'll look at millimeter wave as being that spectrum that you use for dense urban and urban markets. So I think the carriers themselves, as they've always had, are going to leverage the spectrum that they have. They're going to try to put their hands on more spectrum, as they always have, to be able to come up with this kind of this 3-level approach to being able to deploy 5G. And as I said, it's I think it's on our doorstep. And we'll be seeing it over the next several years get built out. I think some of the forecasts are saying that by 2025 or 2026, 70-some-odd percent of the traffic will be 5G based. So I just think they're going to continue to look at various forms of spectrum, and it's the propagation characteristics are very different, as you well know, but they'll take advantage given the kind of geography that they're looking to support. And Rod on the other? Rod Smith : Yes. Sure, Tom. So thanks for the question, Brandon, and I'll address the organic growth and what we expect kind of going forward. So if you look at our Q1 earnings, we came in for organic tenant billings growth, the total company was about 5.4%. U.S. was about 5.6%. International came in at 5.1%. If you look at our outlook for the full year, we're expecting total organic tenant billings growth to be about 5%. In the U.S., we expect it to be about 5%. And internationally, we also expect it to be about 5%. So certainly from that perspective, we do expect a kind of a deceleration in those growth rates throughout the quarter. So I do think you'll see that in the first quarter here, we'll post the highest organic tenant billings growth compared to the next three quarters for the year in order to come down to hit those full year organic tenant billings growth rates that we talked about. Of course, those organic tenant billings growth, I guess, I would point out, Brandon, that a big contributor to the organic tenant billing this year is what happened last year. So we still see a good level of activity coming in for the year. The timing of when that activity comes in is a little bit there's a timing issue between quarters, particularly when you think about some of our larger U.S. customers that are under MLA agreements, where the timing of their increases on a quarterly basis could certainly isn't smooth. So we end up, which is a good thing for us, with a bump in Q1, which gives us a full year benefit for a lot of those increases. But in the next few quarters, we will have a lower increase, but it doesn't that won't necessarily be able to translate into lower activity or lower demand for the site. It's really just the timing of the new business increases as per our large MLAs. So I think that's kind of, in a nutshell, without going too much further into individual customers. We do expect a deceleration. I think if you look at our organic tenant billings growth rates and our outlook, we're going to come in right around those levels. That's our best guess at this point. And again, when you see that deceleration, it's not because of a drop in activity levels. It's really mostly driven by the timing of some of the increases for our MLAs. Tom Bartlett : Great. Thank you, everybody, for being with us this morning. I know we went a little bit late, but I really do appreciate you hanging in there with us. And again, as we've all said, be safe, really, in this environment and keep your family safe, social distance and be well and look forward to catching up with you. Thanks, again. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing services. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Igor Khislavsky, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Igor Khislavsky : Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to you throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. Before the rest of my comments, I'll note that due to COVID-19, all of us on the call this morning are again dialing in remotely from different locations. So to the extent there are any minor technical difficulties, we would ask that you bear with us. Our agenda for this morning will be as follows : First, I'll quickly summarize our financial results for the second quarter; next, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO will provide an overview of our international business and the associated key trends and returns; and then finally, Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer will discuss our second quarter results and updated 2020 outlook. After these comments, we will take your questions. I'll remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include : our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2020 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance, our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19, our expectations regarding the impacts of the AGR decision in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include, the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the quarter. During the quarter, our property revenue increased 2.4% to nearly $1.9 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA also grew by 2.4% to over $1.2 billion. And our consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share increased by 1.6% and 1.5% respectively to $924 million and $2.07. On an FX neutral basis, growth rates for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO per share would have been 8.6%, 7.6% and 7.4% respectively.  Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by roughly 4% to $446 million or $1 per diluted common share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Okay, thanks, Igor. Good morning, everyone. I hope that you are all healthy and well. As we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our number one priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, their families, our tenants, suppliers, and surrounding communities. The remote work policies I mentioned on our last call continue to service well throughout our global footprint.  And I am pleased to say that there are even a few geographies where certain employees have been able to return to the office with numerous incremental safety measures in place. I am also happy to report that our business continues to perform well as we work closely with our tenants to preserve and enhance mobile connectivity, when it is needed the most.  And outside of FX impacts, which have moderated slightly over the last few months, we have to this point not seen material impacts from COVID-19 on our operations. As we move forward, we believe we are well positioned to continue to provide high levels of service and drive solid results. The rest of my remarks today, similar to prior second quarter calls, will center on the key trends in return profiles we are seeing across our international business and what we expect in the future.  Since we entered Brazil and Mexico back in the late 1990s to provide geographic diversification to our foundational U.S. business, we\u2019ve added nearly 140,000 communication sites in 19 countries outside of United States, focusing on partnering with large multinational wireless carriers in select markets with strong property rights, rules of law and vibrant wireless industries.  Since day one of our international expansion strategy, our mandate has been clear, build and acquire multitenant exclusive franchise real estate assets that would generate attractive organic growth rates, while driving margin expansion and growing returns on invested capital overt the long-term.  And so with an emphasis on building leading market positions in the largest democracies across the world with a goal of positioning ourselves is either the top one or two tower company in each market.  This strategy has been underpinned by our proven risk underwriting process including among other things contemplating FX movements and local country inflation trends. As we discussed with you before, all of our investments are evaluated using a ten year unlevered DCF model with varying IRR hurdles due to the inclusion of appropriate risk adjustments to account for the specific local country risk, the type of that asset counterparty and a host of other factors. These hurdles range from the mid-to-high single-digits in markets like the United States and Western Europe, to the mid-to-high teens in some of our more nascent African markets to ensure that our shareholders are being appropriately compensated for the level of risk being assumed.  This balanced approach to market risk has enabled us to evaluate each individual investment opportunity in the context of its risk-adjusted return profile, long-term AFFO accretion potential and the NPV expected to be generated rather than utilizing a specific cap as to how big any market or region can get or should get in relation to the United States.  Operationally, we are also executing a number of risk mitigation strategies. For example, our MLAs include primarily local CPI-based escalators. Our overall portfolio has significant diversification. And we selectively issue local currency debt where it makes sense.  Further, the vast majority of our local country generated net cash flows are denominated in the local currency and we are generally reinvesting those same cash flows back into those very same markets.  Lastly, we have mechanisms in place through which we are able to pass through the cost of land to our tenants in Latin America and the cost of fuel and power to our tenants across India and Africa, helping to further derisk significant portions of our operating expenses across these regions.  Taking all of these items into account, we believe we have a risk evaluation and mitigation framework that will enable us to continue to be successful internationally over the long-term. Within this context the primary thesis underlying our global strategy has always been and continues to be that the evolution of network technology that we\u2019ve seen in the United States will be replicated internationally, likely at an accelerated pace given the lack of fixed line penetration in many areas. Our U.S. business model and international model are effectively the same. The sites look the same, the structures are comparable and the MLAs are fundamentally similar, but include the risk mitigation terms I discussed earlier. At the core, our international expansion serves as a way to significantly increase our total addressable market.  As consumers gain access to advanced smartphone handsets and mobile data usage increases, mobile network operators continue to deploy meaningful wireless CapEx. Service providers in international markets where we have a presence are expected to spend approximately $30 billion on their networks in 2020, in essence doubling the TAM of our U.S. market alone.  With mobile broadband penetration growing, we continue to expect to generate higher organic growth rates internationally and in the United States over the long-term while driving meaningful expansion in our international return on invested capital.  Fundamentally, we are utilizing our international strategy to increase and extend our overall global return profile. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has served to further highlight the criticality of wireless connectivity internationally, particularly in markets where fixed line penetration is minimum. Unlike in the United States, where most of us are plugging into our Wi-Fi-enabled fixed line connections, as we work from home, mobile networks serve as the backbone of virtually all work-from-home functions in each international locations.  And as you can imagine, broad based stay-at-home orders and other restrictions that have been implemented in these markets over the last several months have led to additional strain in existing mobile networks.  For example, Vodafone Idea in India noted that they experienced a year\u2019s worth of data traffic across their network in a single week following the implementation of lockdown measures. Similarly, major carriers across Latin America, Africa and Europe have outlined significant spikes in data usage and regulators have allocated additional temporary spectrum and implemented other policies to help maintain connectivity.  As I mentioned earlier, we are committed to doing everything we can to support our tenants as they deal with the strain of this increased usage on their networks. Now I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the attractive economics that we are driving across our international business. In the second quarter, our international operations accounted for approximately 43% of our property revenue and about a third of our property operating profit.  Our international tower and DAS properties drove an annualized cash gross margin of over $1.8 billion in the quarter resulting in a nearly 9.5% NOI yield on our more than $19 billion in total international tower and DAS investments, as you can see on Slide 6 of our earnings presentation.  This NOI yield includes both sites that we have recently acquired, as well as sites that have been in our portfolio for a number of years benefiting from long-term tenancy and revenue growth. Our most seasoned vintage of international sites those built or acquired prior to 2010 is yielding approximately 24% in U.S. dollar terms illustrating the power of operating leverage within our business.  We view this type of return profile as a clear indication that international tower assets have the capacity to drive economics that are equal to or better than the United States tower model over the long-term.  Importantly, I\u2019ll note that the NOI yield numbers I am referencing today are U.S. dollar equivalents. That is they take into account any foreign currency devaluation in a numerator, while freezing the denominator at historical exchange rates in the period in which the sites were acquired or built. Over the last 20 years and especially since 2007, we have been steadily growing our international portfolio with a focus on macro towers in some of the largest three market democracies worldwide through a combination of our highly efficient newbuild programs and selective acquisitions including the Eaton Towers deal we closed at the end of last year.  We\u2019ve added more than a 130,000 international sites in just the last decade including more than 24,000 sites we built ourselves. These sites typically have lower initial returns due to lower initial tenancy. You can see this on the slide where sites we\u2019ve added to our international portfolio between 2010 and 2014 are generating yields of 10% and those added since 2015 are generating yields of around 8%.  Over time, our experience across all of our served markets has been that as networks mature, additional spectrum bands are deployed and consumers obtained advanced handsets both daily usage grows exponentially and significant additional network density becomes a necessity. As a result, we\u2019ve seen sites that have initially produced modest returns, attract collocations and amendments with minimal incremental costs, thereby driving substantial upside over time, no different than what we\u2019ve experienced in the United States.  In Latin America, where we have owned and operated towers for now over two decades have invested approximately $8 billion and now have over 41,000 sites across eight countries, 4G deployments are in full swing. Our long time presence and scale have resulted in substantial business relationships with key operators in the region including AT&T, American Mobile and a number of others.  These relationships coupled with our extensive asset base has enabled us to drive average organic billings growth of around 10% in the region over the last five years, that\u2019s by strong levels of new business activity and a continuing appetite for mobile data. Although organic growth rates are down a bit in 2020 in part due to falling local CPI, we continue to expect a long trajectory of solid underlying growth. We are also focused on a new build program if network densification efforts accelerate. In fact, we expect to construct over 500 sites across Latin America this year and anticipate strong demand for new builds in the region over a multiyear period.  Importantly, these new builds typically have day one NOI yields in the high-single-digit range with just one tenant with an average tenancy ratio of around 1.5 across the region, we believe we are well positioned to drive meaningful margin and return accretion in Latin America for many years to come.  In Africa, the majority of our markets are in earlier stages of the technology evolution with 4G penetration only around 10% and average mobile data usage being a fraction of LATAM numbers as a result. We\u2019ve invested approximately $5 billion across the continent and have an average tenancy of around 1.5 on our portfolio of nearly 19,000 sites, which are yielding roughly 11%. Importantly, we partnered with key telecom operators like Vodafone, MTN and AirTel to bring enhanced connectivity to hundreds of millions of people. With extremely limited fixed line penetration, young tech savvy populations, and governments committed to modernizing economies through connectivity, we expect mobile broadband to play a foundational role in Africa\u2019s growth story over the next decade plus.  We also anticipate that continued organic growth, our new build program through which we expect to construct well over a 1,000 sites this year, and our ongoing business development efforts will enable us to build on the strong foundation we\u2019ve created in Africa as we deliver solid growth and increasing returns over the long-term.  At the same time, we are making substantial progress in our commitment to reduce the mobile industry\u2019s carbon footprint through our innovative power and fuel program. In African markets, where grid power in many areas tends to be unreliable, we are now deploying next-generation greener technologies including lithium ion batteries and solar solutions. We expect to invest more than $60 million in 2020 to enhance the uptime performance of our sites in the region, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions after deploying an excess of $100 million over the last few years. Not only do these initiatives benefit our tenants through higher uptimes and more efficient operating capabilities, but also they represent a critical part of our commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen.  These investments have helped enable us to reduce diesel consumption by more than 25% from 2017 to 2019 across our global footprint after normalizing for portfolio growth. Meanwhile, in Europe, where we have nearly 5,000 sites between Germany and France, and recently entered Poland by acquiring a handful of towers, networks are at a fairly mature stage with 4G having been broadly deployed over the last decade. , : Consequently, we continue to look for ways to expand our European portfolio, but only at valuations that with underlying growth expectations allow us to hit our required return thresholds. Our entry into Poland, although on a small-scale initially is an example of our continued focus on finding macro tower portfolios poised for sustainable growth in markets with attractive regulatory frameworks, supportive regulators, and vibrant wireless sectors, all at sensible valuations.  And finally, moving to India, where we will have invested over $5 billion, pro forma redeeming our minority interest, we believe the wireless industry has now completed a much needed and long awaited consolidation to enable the deployment of 4G technology throughout the country by the remaining carriers. Through this process, we\u2019ve experienced high levels of churns which is reflected in our current 8% NOI yield.  Although I\u2019d note that the more than $400 million in cash settlement payments we\u2019ve received from TATA are not incorporated in that number or it would be higher.  More recently, there have been pricing increases by all of the carriers in the marketplace, while the telecom regulator has indicated that it intends to be supportive of the carriers to rational spectrum policies and the Indian government continues to stress its Digital India initiative. The key near-term issue that needs to get sorted out in the marketplace centers on the AGR decision by the Supreme Court including finalizing the timeline as to when the wireless carrier payments are to be made, particularly as it relates to Vodafone Idea. We are hopeful that India can return to being a significant growth engine for the company as it was for nearly a decade before the consolidation process kicked off several years ago.  We have several reasons for optimism in this regard. As I just mentioned, the market structure is now much more rational. Price competition in wireless has stabilized and the regulatory environment seems constructive. The Indian consumer has proven to have a tremendous appetite for mobile data with average smartphone usage per customer of well 10-gigabits per month, even before the impacts of COVID-19.  With that said, the majority of wireless users in India are still using legacy technologies, rather than 4G in large part because the networks are ill equipped and their current state to handle levels of traffic for more than 1 billion people. To get those networks ready, we continue to believe that significant levels of incremental network spending are necessary accompanied by material level of network densification.  With our nearly 75,000 site existing portfolio, and the additional sites we are adding through our new build program, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from our tenants\u2019 network deployments over an extended period of time.  Additionally, we are continuing to meaningfully participate in connecting the unconnected in India through our Digital Village program with more than a 150 Digital Villages in place today and more in development, we are proud to be making a difference in the areas of digital literacy, e-learning, tower help, as well as providing enhanced access to career opportunities in many rural Indian communities. Looking forward, we believe that we have a compelling opportunity to further enhance our international business by driving organic growth, focusing on operational efficiency and continuing to build and acquire sites using our proven investment evaluation methodology. Our preference continues to be to add incremental scale to existing markets, while strengthening ties with large multinational wireless carriers.  But there are handful of additional markets that could be attractive for us as well. We also believe there are additional opportunities to generate margin improvement as we further standardize operational processes, create regional centers of excellence and further reduce our power and fuel requirements. We also believe there will be demand for many of our innovative initiatives to extend our core platform of capabilities for new and existing tenants. So in summary, we believe that our diverse macro tower-focused international portfolio positions us well for a prolonged period of solid growth and attractive returns on invested capital. We can further augment this to disciplined selection acquisitions in new builds on a global basis. While we expect our foundational U.S. business to drive the majority of our cash flows for years to come, we think our international operations can enhance and extend our growth trajectory by effectively doubling our total addressable market size.  The global demand for mobile connectivity shows no sign of slowing and we believe we are positioned to play a critical role in extending the reach of mobile broadband, while generating strong total returns for our shareholders. So, with that, let me hand it over to Rod to go through the details of our results and updated outlook. Rod? Rod Smith : Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone on the call. I hope you are safe and healthy. As you saw in today's press release, we had another solid quarter throughout our global business, driven by consistent demand for our mission-critical tower assets.  Before we turn to the accompanying charts, I would like to highlight a few specific accomplishments for the quarter. First, we met our revenue. Adjusted EBITDA consolidated AFFO expectations which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  Second, we had solid organic tenant billings growth across our business led by Africa at nearly 10% and Latin America at over 7%. Third, we constructed more than 500 towers across our international footprint. And finally, we further strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet by issuing $2 billion in senior unsecured notes across multiple tenors with very attractive economics. Now, let\u2019s turn to the details of our second quarter results. Please turn to Slide 8 and we will review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. Although we experienced some unfavorable FX translational impact, primarily resulting from the global pandemic, overall, we generated solid underlying revenue growth.  In the interest of understanding our fundamental operational performance, I\u2019ll be referring to growth rates for some of our key metrics on an FX neutral basis in addition to our standard as-reported basis.  As Igor mentioned earlier, our second quarter consolidated property revenue of nearly $1,900 million grew on a reported basis by $44 million or 2.4% over the prior year period. And on an FX neutral basis by $158 million or 8.6%.  Our U.S. segment represented 57% of our consolidated property revenue with international comprising the remaining 43%. A key contributor to our consolidated property revenue was our tenant billings revenue of $1,620 million, which grew by nearly 10%. The components of our tenant billings growth included around $71 million in colocation and amendments. Roughly $50 million in contributions from escalators and $72 million in day one tenant billings from acquisitions and new builds. These positive items were partially offset by churn impacts of $46 million and $2 million in other items.  Our U.S. property segment revenue totaled nearly $1,100 million for the quarter and grew by $80 million or 8% over the prior year period. Our international property revenue of nearly $806 million declined by $36 million or 4.3% as compared to last year\u2019s levels, primarily due to the FX translational headwinds we just discussed. Moving to the right-side of the slide, you will see that our consolidated organic tenant billings growth was in line with our expectations at 5% for the quarter. For our U.S. property segment, organic tenant billings growth was 4.7% comprised of new business activity which contributed 3.7%, escalators, which contributed 3.2%, churn of 1.9% and a roughly 30 basis points negative impact from other items.  As expected, this growth rate reflects a sequential deceleration driven primarily by relatively modest contributions to our new business from T-Mobile over the last few quarters.  With that said, and as I will discuss in more detail when we review our updated outlook, we have seen new business activity from T-Mobile begin to pickup with further acceleration anticipated towards the end of the year. Our international property segment organic tenant billings growth was 5.4%, led by Africa at nearly 10% and Latin America at over 7%. Europe was just over 2%, while India was 0.4%, again, in line with our expectations given anticipated churn and general market conditions.  The component parts of international organic tenant billings growth where new business activity which totaled nearly 7% are mostly local inflation-based pricing escalators which contributed 3.7% and other items which contributed around 20 basis points. These items were partially offset by churn of 5.3%, much of which was in India.  Now, please turn to Slide 9 and we will review our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO results. Our second quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of just over $1.2 billion grew on a reported basis by about $28 million or 2.4% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by $19 million or 7.6%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.3%, up roughly 70 basis points over the prior year.  This increase was attributable to a combination of our solid organic growth, diligent focus on cost controls, and a favorable impact of some incremental net straight-line. These favorable impacts were partially offset by approximately $21 million in bad debt reserves, against certain receivables in India.  Although we operate in 20 countries, our U.S. business again drove the substantial majority of our property segment operating profit in the quarter accounting for 68% of the total, while our international business generated the remaining 32%.  Moving to the right-side of the slide, you can see our consolidated AFFO of $924 million grew on a reported basis by nearly $15 million or 1.6% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by around $69 million or 7.5%.  Consolidated AFFO per share of $2.07grew on a reported basis by $0.03 or 1.5% over last year\u2019s levels and on an FX neutral basis grew by $0.15 or 7.4%. This growth in AFFO and AFFO per share was driven by our previously discussed growth in adjusted EBITDA, as well as interest expense management, careful oversight of cash taxes and lower maintenance capital spending.  Let\u2019s now take a look at our updated expectations for 2020. Before I get into the numbers, I want to cover a few of our high-level assumptions. First is our updated expectation regarding the post-merger acceleration in new business activity from T-Mobile. Our prior outlook assumed activity levels would have materially increased by now and that we would be seeing increased levels of new business from T-Mobile starting this month.  Although, we have seen a modest increase in activity, it has not yet reached the level we expect to eventually see, based on the T-Mobile\u2019s public comments. As a result, we now expect this acceleration of new business to come much later this year. Consequently, we are reducing our U.S. organic tenant billings growth expectations for 2020, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  Next is our updated expectations regarding customer collections and additional reserves for some bad debt. For the most part, tenants throughout our footprint have continued to pay on-time and without interruption through the pandemic.  However, in India, we have layered in approximately $65 million in additional bad debt assumptions for the full year. This is primarily attributable to the expected timing of payments from the government owned carrier BSNL, as well as the possibility that Vodafone Idea future payments become interrupted or delayed as they weigh a final outcome of the ongoing AGR court proceedings in India.  Additionally, we have assumed roughly $10 million in incremental bad debt reserves for a few tenants in Africa.  Lastly, we have updated the foreign currency exchange rates in our full year outlook. The impacts of these revised FX rates on full year expectations, as compared to our prior guidance are estimated to be a positive $45 million of property revenue, $20 million for both adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO.  Aside from these adjustments, our other high-level assumptions remain largely consistent with our prior view as demand for our telecommunications real estate across all of our markets is expected to remain solid. If you\u2019ll please turn to Slide 10, I will now review our revised outlook midpoints. Our updated guidance for property revenue is $7,720 million, which is a decrease of $30 million compared to the midpoint of our prior outlook and reflects a growth rate on a reported basis of 3.4%. On an FX neutral basis, the growth rate is approximately 8%.  For our U.S. segment, we now expect property revenue of $4,380 million, which is $35 million lower than our prior projections. About $20 million of this decrease is attributable to the timing of T-Mobile activity with the remaining $15 million or so being driven by an adjustment in our non-cash straight-line revenue expectations as a result of an accounting true-up.  For our International segment, we now anticipate property revenue of $3,340 million, which is $5 million higher than our prior expectation. This is being driven by roughly $45 million in favorable FX impacts, along with around $10 million in other outperformance, partially offset by a $50 million currency neutral decline in pass-through revenues across our footprint due to lower fuel prices.  At a high level, our expectations for our international businesses are broadly consistent with our prior outlook, which demonstrates the critical nature of our assets, as well as the effectiveness of our more than 5,000 employees across the globe. We could not be more proud of the way our global teams have performed throughout this pandemic. Moving on to the right-side of the slide, we now expect organic tenant billings growth to be between 4.5% and 5% on a consolidated basis. This includes projected U.S. organic tenant billings growth of approximately 4.5% for the full year.  As I just mentioned the change to our U.S. expectations is driven by our adjusted timing assumptions around T-Mobile\u2019s activity ramp up with us rather than a fundamental change in underlying long-term trends. For our International segment, we are reaffirming our outlook for organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5%.  Moving on to Slide 11, you will see that we now expect our full year adjusted EBITDA to be $4,930 million, which is $40 million below the midpoint of our prior outlook and reflects nearly 8% growth over the prior year on an FX neutral basis.  The drivers of this reduction in outlook are, a roughly $75 million increase to our bad debt reserves, primarily in India, and approximately $17 million reduction in net straight-line, and a $10 million reduction from our services segment which is the result of the revised outlook for T-Mobile activity.  These negative impacts are expected to be partially offset by a favorable FX translational impact of $20 million, as well as an additional $42 million or so of general outperformance we now anticipate throughout our business, particularly on the direct expenses and SG&A side.  As part of our adjusted EBITDA projections, we now expect cash SG&A as a percent of total property for the year to be in the high 8% range or around 7.4% excluding bad debt. Lastly, we now expect consolidated AFFO for the full year to be $3,670 million, which is $20 million above the midpoint of our prior outlook and reflects nearly 9% growth over the prior year on an FX neutral basis.  We have been able to offset the expected decline in cash adjusted EBITDA through, $25 million and lower net cash interest, $10 million in lower cash taxes, $10 million in reduced maintenance capital expenditures and about $20 million in FX favorability. On a per share basis, we expect to generate consolidated AFFO of $8.23, up $0.05 relative to our prior guidance.  Moving on to Slide 12, let\u2019s review our capital deployment expectations for the year. Our full year dividend subject to the Board approval is expected to be approximately $2 billion resulting in an annual common stock dividend growth rate of right around 20% once again. As previously discussed, in future years, you could expect our dividend to grow roughly in line with our REIT taxable income. That will be consistent with our REIT requirements, as well as with our internally held dividend philosophy and is likely to result in growth rates dipping below 20% beginning next year.  Subject to Board discretion, we anticipate the impact of any deceleration in the growth rate to be gradual and expect our dividend to grow between 15% and 20% for each of the next several years.  We also expect to deploy nearly $1.1 billion towards our CapEx program with more than 85% of that investment being discretionary. This is down $25 million from our prior outlook with $15 million in lower redevelopment CapEx and an additional $10 million decline in maintenance CapEx. We have spent roughly $757 million on M&A so far this year including our acquisition of MTN\u2019s minority stakes in our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda earlier this year and our entry into Poland through a small transaction in late June.  The purchase of TATA\u2019s remaining interest in our India business, which at current exchange rates had an approximate value of $329 million is currently pending regulatory approval in India. We continue to expect to complete the purchase of these shares this year. We also deployed around $56 million through share repurchases earlier in the year.  This combined with our year-to-date dividend declaration of $967 million brings our total capital returned to shareholders so far this year to over $1 billion. Finally, as a step towards ensuring we have access to a wide variety of options for raising capital, we intend to implement an aftermarket stock offering program. We anticipate having the ability to from time-to-time sell up to $1 billion of our common stock. It\u2019s our intention to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include investment opportunities or debt repayments among other things.  Turning now to Slide 13, I will briefly discuss our investment philosophy, historical capital allocation and the associated financial returns. Since 2010, we have deployed nearly $46 billion through a combination of common stock dividend, our internal capital investment program, M&A transactions and common stock repurchases. As you can see on the capital deployment chart to the left, approximately $27 billion was invested in M&A. Over $10 billion was returned to our common stockholders through the combination of dividend distributions and share repurchases. Roughly, $7 billion represented discretionary capital investments and with the remaining $1 billion being dedicated to non-discretionary maintenance capital projects. As Tom alluded to earlier, the vast majority of investments to-date have been geared towards macro towers. This has been guided by our longstanding investment objectives, which have always been and continue to be focused on generating maximum total shareholder returns by driving long-term AFFO per share growth and attractive return on invested capital, all while prudently managing risk. Based on our significant experience and our constant review of all types of communications infrastructure, we view macro towers, whether in the United States or in select international markets as the most compelling assets for us to own as we pursue our investment objectives.  Likewise, as we explore innovation initiatives as a means of extending our platform of communications real estate our longstanding investment objectives and our disciplined approach will remain the same. As you can see, from our historical results, our investment process has worked well for our shareholders.  A key element of our success has been that our tower portfolios, regardless of where they are located shares several value-creating characteristics including the ability to monetize growth in mobile data consumption, significant and proven operating leverage driven by contractual escalators, new business commencements and a high likelihood of multi-tenancy and very low ongoing capital maintenance.  Lastly, the high quality nature of our model is highlighted in our consistent and attractive financial returns. In the last decade, we have added more than 153,000 sites, many of which were less mature towers located outside the United States and came with lower, day one tenancy and margin profiles.  Even taking this into account, as you can see on the charts in the right, our return on invested capital has risen by around 50 basis points over the last ten years and stands now at nearly 11%. We view this as a testament to our disciplined investment approach and the powerful operating leverage inherent in the tower model.  We can now turn to Slide 14 and I\u2019ll make a few closing remarks. First, we finished the second quarter with a solid set of results and believe we are well positioned as we head into the second half of 2020 and beyond. Pro forma for refinancing activity earlier this month, we have over $5 billion in total liquidity with an average tenor of more than six years and an average interest cost of under 3%.  This position reflects our early redemption of all of our 2020 and 2021 senior notes, which leaves us with no senior note maturities until 2022. As Tom and I both discussed, outside of translational FX effects, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business thus far have been modest. We are pleased to see our global infrastructure assets play such a critical role in keeping people connected through this difficult time.  And in closing, I will make two final points. First, we are energized about the United States as we look out over a multi-year period. We expect the new wireless landscape to drive higher levels of network deployment activity as C-band spectrum becomes available. DISH begins rolling out their network and 5G activity across the industry lands up.  And second, our international markets also show great promise as our primarily large multinational tenants continue to invest heavily in their networks including around $30 billion expected in 2020. Networks across the globe are seeing tremendous growth in mobile data usage as consumers gain access to advance handsets than applications and we expect a long cycle of carrier capital spending to support these trends. From our advantage point today, we continue to be excited about the future of wireless communications and the central role our real estate will play.  With that, operator, will you please open the line for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam [Ph]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just two if I could. First on the U.S., if you can give us any additional color on what you are seeing in your discussions with the new T-Mobile, whether this delay is really timing-related or have there been any changes in terms of spending plan on them relative to earlier expectations?  And then just secondly, on the ATM program, can you help us think about the investment opportunities you are evaluating and the decision to use equity as a percent of means of funding this relative to the debt you\u2019ve traditionally used given where your leverage is today? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Hey Matt. How are you? This is Tom. On the T-Mobile side, based upon everything that I think they said publicly, I think it\u2019s fair to say that it really is just timing. And they are working through all their plans. They closed their deal in April then settled their transaction with DISH, not that long ago. So, we believe it clearly is timing. And are looking forward to really supporting them as they continue to really build out their network even further.  On the ATM side, it\u2019s good plumbing. It really is just having more flexibility. It\u2019s not a significant number clearly, compared to general ATM programs as part of market cap. So it really is just kind of good plumbing to have a flexibility of having access to a number of different sources of capital. Rod Smith : And if I can, Matt, maybe I would add\u2026 Unidentified Analyst : And just a follow-up \u2013 go ahead, Rod. Rod Smith : I am sorry, Matt. Yes, let me just add a couple of points on the U.S. growth. Number one is, everyone kind of saw the slowdown from T-Mobile as the sorts of middle to third quarter of last year.  Now that we are almost lapping that slowdown and that\u2019s where the further way from the beginning of that slowdown, the bigger impact that it has on the organic tenant billings growth deceleration. So, the fact that they haven\u2019t started up yet is, what\u2019s causing us to reduce our outlook from about 5% down to about 4.5%. And the other expectations in the U.S. industry remain the same. So, we haven\u2019t seen any changes in our expectations relative to the other carriers or anything else going on in the U.S. it really is isolated to the new T-Mobile and the timing of when they begin to spend. Unidentified Analyst : And that was going to be my follow-up. I appreciate it. Thank you. Rod Smith : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. And just to follow-up on the U.S. activity, can you provide an update on how you think about the potential decommissioning that T-Mobile can do? I think the Sprint sides are \u2013 upward maybe next year.  And second question on LATAM. How do you think about the growth going forward given that the macro environment is weaker and with the potential acquisition of other carriers could potentially create some churn activity. Yes. I would like to see your thoughts on how you think that could impact your growth over the next few years. Thank you. Tom Bartlett : Yes, Batiya [Ph] it\u2019s Tom. With regard to \u2013 I\u2019ll address the LATAM question first, I mean we are really excited about the opportunities that we continue to see down in the market, particularly in a market like Brazil which is still so underserved. I mean, if you take a look at customers per site, it\u2019s significantly higher than what we are seeing in the United States.  And so, we continue to see a \u2013 the opportunities for further densification where our build programs are continuing to grow. So we are actually very energized and our teams in the markets are very excited about the opportunities there. Yes, there is some consolidation perhaps going on in the market, but that was fully understood, fully expected. So there really no surprises there.  And I think the government themselves, particularly with regards to what we are seeing in the pandemic continue to want to drive a connectivity and digital connectivity in their markets. So, we are quite excited about that. And as you all know it represents a relatively small piece of revenues. I am sorry Batiya, [Ph] second question on the U.S. side, was? Unidentified Analyst : On the T-Mobile decommissioning activity that could start potentially next year? ... with last year. So we think that, that's a good... Tom Bartlett : Yes. No. You are right. I mean, those \u2013 a vast majority of those sites come up for renewal towards the end of next year.  We believe they are obviously well positioned sites and we will likely try to mitigate as much of that churn potential as possible and hopeful that between the new build it\u2019s going on in the marketplace as well as, DISH's expectations for building out, they will be successful in terms of mitigating that. But that\u2019s all part of the lot of the negotiations and discussions that are going on as we speak. Unidentified Analyst : Alright. Thank you. Rod Smith : And Batia [Ph] I will just a couple of comments on the Sprint T-Mobile, maybe I put the merger kind of in context with the U.S. market. So, you know, that the U.S. is experiencing kind of exploding growth in mobile data, about 30% a year increases. We\u2019ve seen accelerating deployments for 5G kind of heading our way that the number of new spectrums heading into the market that will have to be built out.  The carriers continue to invest heavily in 4G as they focus on their customer experience and strengthen their networks to handle the growing data demand. So all that is, really constructive in terms of what\u2019s happening in the U.S. landscape. When you look at T-Mobile in particular, they have come with pretty significant build-out requirements. So they said that they are going to spend $40 billion over the first three years, build an additional 10 to 15 sites, particularly in some of the rural areas where they are expected to cover 97% of the population on low-band spectrum of about 75%, on mid-band spectrum within three years. So, they\u2019ve got an awful lot of work to do. They are certainly going to be deploying capital.  So we continue to believe that it\u2019s in their best interest and good for our shareholders, as well to the extent that we can enter into an arrangement where they can have quick access to our site and potentially renegotiating the way some of the churn happens over time. So to spread that potential churn, which is we continue to believe it\u2019s in the range of 3% to 4% of our overall property revenue. That\u2019s the overlap piece. And we continue to expect that could be spread out over time and we could give T-Mobile easy quick access to our sites through a holistic deal which will help them deploy their network. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Yes. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about Brazil and kind of the directionality of the organic growth rates. You talked about OI, but maybe Nextel and that consolidation, does that represent perhaps a little bit of a headwind or not big enough to matter? And then, I just wondered a little bit about India. You talked a little bit about the bad debt provision, but if you talk about just actual leasing activity in the market any changes that to kind of call out over the next couple of quarters versus what you\u2019ve seen. Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Yes. I mean, Jon, first on Brazil, just kind of getting a little bit deeper into the market, it\u2019s a market that we expect the wireless CapEx is going to be in the $3 billion to $4 billion range. So, obviously, very, very strong, a high growth market for us. The CapEx percent of carrier revenue is to be around 25%, which is actually a bit higher than we\u2019ve seen in prior years consistent with last year.  So we think that that\u2019s a good sign. Their margins are in the 40%. So the carriers themselves, I think are quite well capitalized and very focused on building out their 4G overall initiatives. The local CPI is actually been down over the last several years, so was our escalators in concert with it. And that\u2019s being really reflected in some of the 2020 escalator that we are seeing this year.  But Vivo, Tim, America Movil, including Nextel, in that transaction is relatively insignificant relative to our overall growth rates. And we are seeing organic tenant billings growth of over 8% in Q2, churn was in the kind of the mid 1% to 1.7% for the year. And we expect for the year overall, billings growth is 7%. So, we are bullish on the marketplace. We think we are well positioned.  We have really solid relationships with what we expect to be kind of the three main players in the marketplace. And as I mentioned before, we believe that the networks are overburdened. They have roughly 3000 to 4000 sims for sell-side. It\u2019s really twice what we are seeing in the U.S. So, the teams are excited or bullish. We are building out sites. We have a lot of interesting things, I think, going on with the various carriers. And so, we are excited about what we expect in the marketplace.  On the India side, again, if you take a look at the kind of the total growth that we\u2019ve seen in the market, and again it\u2019s double-digits on a total gross basis. Carrier spending continues to be strong, building out their networks. They continue to make the network investments to support the overall usage demands. I mean, I think I mentioned in some of my comments that, we really remain optimistic about the market.  The structure is now much more rational. There is price competition and wireless has actually stabilized and the regulatory environment is very, very constructive. There is a significant appetite for mobile data from a customer perspective. They are using over 10 gig per month and that was even before the COVID-19 impact.  So, as well as they are still using the significant legacy technologies, 2G technologies, rather than even 4G. So we think is that the network continues to get equipped as the government continues to expand its overall Digital India strategy that there is going to be a significant amount of further densification and network investment going on in the marketplace. Jonathan Atkin : And then, lastly on the U.S., yes, and on U.S. you talked Sprint T-Mobile at some lengths done, what about the rest of the industry? There is two other national carriers and if you think about in aggregate kind of their activity level and do you think that you are expecting there that will be different compared to year-to-date trends? Tom Bartlett : No. I mean, they have been very interested. I mean, very, very steady in terms of their build out. You\u2019ve heard them kind of tweak what they expect their overall CapEx expectations are probably for the year. But for us, we\u2019ve been very consistent. We are expecting to be so. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you very much. Tom Bartlett : Sure, Jon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri. Please go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to take a step back to India and just talk about \u2013 I was hoping you could give us some of your views on U.S. hyperscalers, really kind of starting to navigate that region and how that actually changes anything. And then maybe perhaps just thinking about your international strategy and what you\u2019ve observed in India and how that could potentially happen in other markets?  Does this at all change your international M&A strategy, your expansion strategy at all? Are there regions that you are going to start avoiding simply because you don\u2019t want to get tangled up in these kinds of speed bumps along the road and just want to get your take kind of on those different dynamics there? Tom Bartlett : I think that the fact that we are seeing another \u2013 number of hyperscalers investing in India is a very good thing. There are significant investments being made into the networks. They see the same things that we do in terms of the kind of the digital transformation that\u2019s going on in the marketplace and they are bringing many more applications and products to the consumers to those particular markets.  And given that the wire line penetration is very, very low in that market, as well as most of the markets that we are in outside of the United States. We think that then most of that traffic to be able to utilize those applications is going to go over those wireless networks and clearly the carriers are going to want to invest in their networks to be able to support it.  It\u2019s no different than what we\u2019ve seen here in the United States. And so, I think it\u2019s a very good sign candidly. And I would hope that we would continue to see more of that kind of activity being in \u2013 occurring in the markets outside where we have a presence. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you for that color. And then, just take me back to the U.S., and on prior earnings calls, you\u2019ve talked about the micro datacenter opportunity and probably within the last twelve months if opportunity has quickly evolved from proof-of-concepts in 2019 and now fully funded, we see competitors and you guys have now kind of drawn the lines of the sand coming to the table. So if you could give us an update on the micro datacenter opportunity within the U.S.? Tom Bartlett : Well, I mean, the underlying premise clearly is that, we believe the cloud is moving to the edge and we see this. There are a number of factors that are supporting it, whether if you are looking at CRAN, you are looking at what\u2019s going on with cloud infrastructure and with the deployment of 5G, we think that enterprise customers are going to be looking for low latency access as well as cloud, kinds of capabilities out of the edge. And so, we remain very bullish on the whole opportunity.  We do have a number of trial sites. I think we have five or six trial sites down in the Southeast and actually out in west. And the way we are looking at it really is that, at this point in time, there are really kind of a couple of distinct trends that we are paying attention to. First of all, on the distributed compute and then more broadly on the mobilized computing where we think that the TAM is going to be significantly higher and that we will be able to create some scale.  And we've talked about the distributed compute, which is really where we are focused right now with regards to a number of our kind of trial sites. And that\u2019s where enterprise workloads moving to the public cloud and there is a growing near-term market segment use for on and off for private cloud computing in somewhat of a hybrid solution.  And so, when in many of the sites that we have, we have 50 kilowatts of power and we are providing kind of local compute capability for mid and smaller sized enterprises. And so, it\u2019s an interesting market segment. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually being serviced, particularly well today. But clearly, that\u2019s not the big opportunity that we see going forward.  The big opportunity is clearly on the mobile edge compute. And it\u2019s one where we think that we are actually going to be able to further scale. But we are really just in the early innings of it. But the concept of the strategy is that we expect we\u2019ll be able to build a neutral host, multi-operator, multi-cloud datacenter in several thousand of our sites that we have across the country.  And we do have a meet-me room/data center in Atlanta, which is, as I said tied to a major datacenter down in the marketplace. And so, we are tracking in the opportunity and what it will mean to be able to really develop this type of a strategy. We realize that we don\u2019t have lots of the skill sets that are going to be required to really scale this. And so, like our other kind of innovative initiatives, very potentially we\u2019ll look to partner to be able to gain access to those kinds of skill sets and capabilities, distribution, software engineers, those types of things to really be able to scale and grow the opportunity. So, early innings as I said, but we remain quite bullish on the overall opportunity. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Good morning guys. Everybody, hope you and your family and employees are doing okay through this COVID-19 time. Tom Bartlett : And you, as well. Rod Smith : Yes. Thanks, Rick. Ric Prentiss : Yes. Wanted to touch on the Sprint decommissioning question again. Obviously, T-Mobile has a lot of dominos they are trying to knock down in the process. But it sounded like, to Batiya\u2019s question, you guys might be more interested in spreading the effects of the churn through holistic over time versus maybe taking a one-time payment like you did with TATA? Tom Bartlett : Ric, it will come down to math. Right, it\u2019s really a TBD type of an event. We expect really based upon what T-Mobile has said is that, they are going to need thousands of sites over and above what they are expecting right now after the decommissioning, right? And so, there could be an opportunity for those sites. There could be an opportunity for those sites in the hands of somebody else.  And so, it\u2019s a bit of three dimensional chess right now in terms of what these transactions with all of our customers and potential customers. I would expect that there will be churn of some sort. I don\u2019t know it will be all at once or over an extended period of time. But we believe that longer-term, there are clearly going to be a number of offsets and if you just take a look at the wireless growth that we are seeing in the marketplace.  And what we\u2019d expect and the amount of capital that all these carriers are looking to spend and the fact that this is going to be coming into the full there, we would expect solid growth going forward. But, so it\u2019s really a TBD at this point. I would want to give you a sense of that anything is certain, or anything is put in concrete we continue to work all those items with our customers. Ric Prentiss : Right. So it\u2019s all mass negotiations, see how it plays out. Okay. Tom Bartlett : Right. Ric Prentiss : You mentioned there is a couple of times that obviously, we are all monitoring this very closely, there is a feeling that this needs a lot more funding to really get the network ramp going. It was a good sign to see Dave Mayo join I think, DISH as Network Deployment Head, but how are you thinking about when DISH might be starting to show up in the process as you look into 2021, 2022, 2023, how \u2013 given the funding is not there yet. Tom Bartlett : Well, I mean, they also have network requirements that they need to adhere to. And I think that the 2023 I think is the first commitment that they\u2019ve made. So, I would expect to see them hit market in 2021. I think that's a better question for T-Mobile. I mean, I think it is a good sign. They brought in Dave Mayo. I think he'll do a terrific job there. And time will tell in terms of what it looks like. But we are there to service them and support them in any way that they feel necessary and we think that we've got a portfolio of assets that really can be helpful to them. And I think they appreciate that as well. So, but I would expect that we\u2019ll start to see them towards the end of this year into 2021. They are not in our forecast.  They are not in our guidance until we really have a more formal arrangement with them and understand what their demands are going to be, we won\u2019t put them into our forecast. Ric Prentiss : Okay. And apologize you might have already answered this, I was on a call this morning. On the AFFO guidance, Slide 11, you talked about a $45 million benefit to AFFO guidance from other components. Could you unpack that what\u2019s in that $45 million that obviously offsets the $45 million negative on cash EBITDA? Tom Bartlett : Yes, I mean, it\u2019s interest. It\u2019s maintenance CapEx. It\u2019s cash access. It\u2019s kind of the typical group of items below EBITDA that impact AFFO that we are seeing some positive benefits from. Ric Prentiss : Okay. And last one for me, the CBRS auction is obviously going on right now. What are your thoughts about what that means, particularly maybe to the indoor states and what the opportunity for you guys? Tom Bartlett : We continue to be very positive on the indoor spot, our indoor space. We think that the unlicensed here access spectrum in the U.S. that\u2019s a potential to really transform, if you will the overall indoor connectivity landscape. It improves the overall TAM clearly, and it reduces the overall total ownership cost. And so, we are very positive - we have the number of trials going on, Ric, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past.  But again, it\u2019s early innings right now in terms of what that opportunity is. We have 400 DAS locations, if you will, around the country with a TAM of probably a couple thousand. But we think that given the cost components of being able to open up, feed the network, exactly TAMs would increase ten-fold.  And so, what we are seeing, what that looks like, we are taking a look at what those relationships are going to look like then with the landlords across the country. But we are energized by what we think we might be able to \u2013 and how we might be able to position ourselves. Ric Prentiss : Thanks much. Rod Smith : And Ric, I\u2019ll just give you a couple of numbers there to back up what Tom was saying about the AFFO. So, the $45 million offsets are broken down with $10 million on lower maintenance CapEx. $25 million in lower net cash interest and $10 million in lower cash taxes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden, Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Tom, I think in the opening comments, you mentioned that you saw that CPI did bring in some of the international markets affecting the organic growth. I was wondering if you could kind of put some numbers around that. And then, sort of another situation unfolding in Latin America is the Telefonica RAN sharing agreement with AT&T.  I think that there is just been a lack of certainty around what that will ultimately look like and you guys have talked about having some engagement there to maybe try to create a holistic relationship down there. Could you kind of update us on any progress on that front? Thanks a lot. Tom Bartlett : Yes. Sure, Dave. I think on the CPI side, the escalator, I think in the quarter was roughly 3.7% and that really, again the way they work, it works off with the 2019 kind of the inflation number is which drive what the escalator would be. So our escalator is down. And if you think about, even looking at Brazil for example, the growth rates in Brazil, my sense, we are up in the kind of even the 10% range in the last couple of years if I recall.  And we are now down in kind of that 7%, 8% range. And so, it has a significant impact, if you will kind of going forward. And as you know it\u2019s very volatile on a year-to-year basis, but it can impact the overall organic growth rate by a couple 100 basis points one way or another.  With regards to Mexico, a fair question in terms of Telefonica and their interest in the marketplace. We have a terrific relationship with AT&T in the market and we are working closely with both Telefonica and AT&T right now on that transition and what that might look like over the next several years. And so, it\u2019s a TBD. We are in the middle of it. And as I said, I think we are really well positioned to be able to support both our customers as they transition their network. David Barden : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Horan. Please go ahead. Tim Horan : Thanks. Tom, regarding the \u2013 do you think there is an opportunity longer term for you guys to deploy more equipment as we kind of virtualize the networks more and the carriers can kind of share the equipment, particularly the cable companies are kind of entering the market are going to want capacity, but maybe not trying to deploy their own equipment. I know you've done some of this in past and well in each segments, but just any thoughts around that? Tom Bartlett : Tim, are you talking about O-RAN or? Tim Horan : Yes, yes. Tom Bartlett : Yes. It\u2019s very interesting. I mean, I do think the whole O-RAN opportunity which we\u2019ve seen in other markets, by the way, we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the world is definitely starting to take hold here in the United States and ultimately we could see even the large carriers looking to take certain segments of their spectrum, certain segments of their technology and really opening it up. It kind of ties to my thoughts before in terms of kind of that cloud even becoming closer and closer to the edge. Now, keep in mind that, that\u2019s kind of what happens behind the curtain. So, that\u2019s happening back on the RAN side away from the impact on the towercos. So, my intent is that any opportunity for the carriers, wireless carriers and potential new players in the marketplace to be able to bring down their total cost of ownership will then allow them to have more capital available to spend on the RAN, which is really where we come in, right?  And so, we don\u2019t expect any of the kind of the O-RAN implications to impact at all what\u2019s happening from the site out to the device. And as I said, it\u2019s in fact the total cost of ownership comes down as a result of the kind of the open nature of the infrastructure that might allow more capital to be able to spent on where we come in, which is from the tower out to the device.  And so, we are cautiously optimistic on the opportunity for O-RAN in the United State, as well as many of our international markets. Tim Horan : And kind of related on the technology front, do you think carriers are still favoring macros over small cells or if you are talking to the carriers, how are they feeling on small cell deployments at this point over the next couple of years? Tom Bartlett : It all comes down to band, it all comes down to densification. We don\u2019t see any change. I mean, the economics are still clearly that the macro tower can be able to support much more efficiently their customer base.  Now there are going to be certain locations, there may be certain technologies, certain band that can be better utilized and supportive at a small cell than in those dense urban markets. But we don\u2019t see it any different right now. Those dense urban markets, the New York City kind of things, just because of interference, talking about high bands, just like what Verizon is doing today.  So, I don\u2019t expect really any change to that. It\u2019s going to be a function of band. It\u2019s going to be a function of the densification of the markets that they are trying to serve, really the topography of what they are trying to serve. But we don\u2019t see any change at all and they use the small cells versus macro. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Colby Synesael. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great. Two if I may. There has been some press reports of late that Vodafone Idea may have skipped out on its June payments to lease some of the tower operators and I am curious if you are one of those, or if everything you are doing is, I think, just cautionary and being trying to get ahead of that.  And to the extent that they haven\u2019t actually made their June or perhaps July payment, do you think that, that's going to last until the AGR situation is settled? Or is this maybe just a month or two?  And then secondly, I am just curious, what do you think your exit velocity is in terms of U.S. organic growth in the fourth quarter of this year? And what does that really imply, I guess, for potential growth in 2021?  And I am sure you can appreciate a lot of investors are trying to get a sense of what is that magnitude of acceleration we could potentially think. And when we start to balance that out from the comments, Rod that you mentioned about trying to flatten out the churn. Just trying to start to frame out how to think about what that could look like? I appreciate you don\u2019t want to give guidance, but clearly a big focus for investors. Tom Bartlett : Yes, So, Colby, let me try to address a couple and Rod can add a few comments as well. On the whole, Vodafone India situation, I mean, I don\u2019t want to get into specifics there. I think if you step back and if you take a look at where the government is, I mean the government has definitely advocated for having three strong players in the marketplace.  They are currently working through as the other carriers are with the Supreme Court in terms of where that final AGR issue is going to land. We are hopeful that there will be some resolution to this even over the next 30 to 45 days or so. There is a hearing I think in mid-August for the carriers that are no longer and providing service.  But we hope that that will provide some guidance for how the payments \u2013 the extended payments will be made \u2013 have to be made by the carriers themselves. I mean, they\u2019ve made some sizable good base installments, as best I can tell in terms of what is owed in the marketplace. And they are aggressively trying to restructure to save cost and compete in the marketplace. And so, yes, I mean, there is some slow paying going on in the marketplace. We are working very closely with them as we would be working with any customer who is going through a similar situation. So more to come. You saw what some of our expectations were relative to how we looked at outlook for the balance of the year. But kind of given the direction of the government, given what we are seeing in the marketplace, again we remain optimistic and cautiously optimistic about their ability to continue and to grow.  I am sorry, Colby your question on the U.S. side was, the exit rate. It will largely be a \u2013 candidly a function of the kind of growth that we are going to be seeing later in the year by the various carriers in terms of their overall investments in their network. You heard Rod talked about that we are talking about an overall growth rate based upon what we are seeing right now and kind of that 4.5-ish range. So, it\u2019s down a little bit, again, largely tied \u2013 almost exclusively tied to the timing of T-Mobile. So, we are optimistic that T-Mobile will pickup pace and we\u2019ll see that increase in activity. And I think that will bode well foregoing into 2021. And the whole notion of the churn relative to Sprint, as we talked about before, that's a TBD in terms of where does the math sets aligned for us and where can we best service our customers in terms of whether that will be over an extended period of time or whether that would be taken more upfront. So, more to come on that one. Rod Smith : And Colby, maybe I\u2019ll just add a couple of comments on the accounts receivable issue. Not specific to Vodafone, but Tom covered that up. But just to put it into context, Q1 rolling into Q2, our accounts receivable has been very stable. So we didn\u2019t see any increase in our overall accounts receivable across the globe. Our DSO numbers are still in the mid to upper 30s. That\u2019s consistent Q2 over Q1.  So we\u2019ve been very pleased that not only in India, but also in terms of the COVID-19 impacts around the globe, we\u2019ve had very stable accounts receivable balances from Q1 to Q2 where our net receivables on the books at the end of Q1 was about $620 million. It's actually about $585 million at the end of Q2. With that said, you will see in our numbers that we took a bad debt reserve charge in Q2 of about $25 million.  And then, we also built into the back half of the forecast an additional $75 million. Those are both reserves at this point. So, we do expect that much of that will be collected. It just may \u2013 it may take us a little bit longer. So, we are trying to be cautious for the back half of the year. I\u2019d also let you know that we have the balances in our accounts receivable ledger that are over 90 days are 100% reserves coming out of Q2.  So, again, we look that as a pretty comfortable position. Maybe it\u2019s conservative position. Their reserves are not actually bad debt write-offs yet. So we do expect to collect a lot of that. It\u2019s just a matter of when. And of course, Vodafone is tied to AGR and we'll see how that gets resolved here soon. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions. Tom Bartlett : Thanks everybody for joining. Have a great day and stay healthy and safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Igor Khislavsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Igor Khislavsky : Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. Before the rest of my comments, I'll note that due to COVID-19, all of us on the call this morning are again dialing in remotely from different locations. So to the extent if there are any minor technical difficulties, we would ask that you bear with us. Our agenda for this morning will be as follows : first, I'll quickly summarize our financial results for the third quarter. Next, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our platform expense initiatives and how we are positioned to benefit from continued wireless technology evolution; and finally, Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our third quarter results and updated 2020 outlook. After these comments, we will take your questions. I'll remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include : our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2020 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19; our expectations regarding the impacts of the AGR decision in India; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter. During the quarter, our property revenue increased 3.4% to nearly $2 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by 5.6% to approximately $1.3 billion. And our consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share increased by 14.7% and 14.5%, respectively, to $1.02 billion and $2.29. On an FX-neutral basis, growth rates for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and consolidated AFFO per share would have been 8.1%, 9.7%, and 19.5%, respectively. Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders decreased by roughly 7% to $464 million, or $1.04 per diluted common share. The decrease included the impacts of an FX loss of about $49 million in the quarter and a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of roughly $37 million. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thank you, Igor. Good morning everyone. Consistent with our past practice from our third quarter reports, my remarks today will center largely around the evolution of mobile technology and how we are positioning American Tower to benefit, specifically how we aim to extend our core neutral-host exclusive real estate portfolio to a digital multi-product, multi-service platform offering incremental value to existing and new customers. I'll also go into a bit more depth around two specific platform expansion initiatives, one in the United States and one outside of our core U.S. market. But before I elaborate on that topic, I wanted to briefly cover a few key points on the comprehensive master lease agreement, or MLA, that we signed with T-Mobile in mid-September. This agreement, which lasts through early 2035 augments our strategic relationship with T-Mobile, positions us to capture a significant new business with them over an extended period of time, and preserves the potential for incremental upside for us, particularly later on in the contract term. The MLA maintains the typical annual base escalator that we will recognize on the entire portfolio of included leases over the nearly 15-year term. This escalator is consistent with our historical 3% to 3.5% average rate included in our other U.S. based customer lease agreements. In addition to the base escalator, as is typical with our other comprehensive MLA agreements, there's an annual use fee or bonus escalator component. This additional annual use fee calculated as a percentage of the prior year's lease run rate is in force over the entire term of the agreement, and it allows T-Mobile to add equipment on certain sites up to pre-agreed loading levels. As a result of this use fee, we lock in contractually guaranteed revenue growth over and above the base escalator while T-Mobile will be able to more efficiently deploy their network, a win for both parties. In total, between their contracted backlog we already had in place before the deal, the approximately $17 billion in incremental contractual backlog from the agreement and a 10% or so of our T-Mobile revenues that sit outside of the MLA, we expect to generate at least $23 billion in total revenue from T-Mobile through the contract term and bring our total consolidated contractually committed revenue to more than $58 billion as of the end of Q3. This backlog incorporates the impact of cancellations included within the agreement, which in total is expected to represent around 4% of our consolidated property revenue at the time they occur. Included in these contractual terminations are principally the legacy Sprint revenues that we extended for 10 years back in 2011. As you may recall through that contract, we were able to delay the significant [indiscernible] that our peers experienced for more than five years. Having realized the NPV benefits from that, we will now see some of that deferred to commissioning flow through our run rate over a multi-year period. Once that is complete, we would expect to incur minimal levels of cancellations from T-Mobile over the remaining life of this agreement. Taken as a whole, we believe that our expanded relationship with T-Mobile will be important as we seek to generate double digit annual growth in the combination of our consolidated AFFO per share and dividend yield over the next decade. These types of comprehensive agreements have been incredibly valuable and strategic for us as we are better able to service our customers and consequently become more strategic to them as they densify their networks and deploy new spectrum. As a result, our cash flow generation becomes even more predictable providing us a solid foundation for continued investment in our business and generating further shareholder value. With that said, let me now turn our attention back to discussing how we are positioning American Tower to further benefit from the evolution of mobile technology. Our core global macro tower business has been and will continue to be the foundation of our success, and the primary driver of future cash flows. In fact, our conviction around macro towers being the primary infrastructure for 5G deployments has only increased. As more and more mid-band spectrum is deployed to support 5G, and this network usage continues to grow at upwards of 30% per year and even faster internationally, we believe that significant additional macro tower oriented network densification is inevitable. Recall that today we believe our consolidated customer base is spending upwards of $60 billion per year on building out their network. Going forward, there will be the need for even more equipment on more of our sites as carriers deploy massive MIMO and utilize DSS O-RAN, and then any other tools they have at their disposal to optimize their network performance and efficiency. In addition, as 5G and the surrounding ecosystem develops in the U.S. and this network technology continues to advance throughout our international footprint, we expect to have compelling opportunities to extend our core value proposition into new, related, accretive product and service offerings to expand our total addressable market. One of the key trends driving these opportunities is the continued convergence of wireless and wireline networks. We believe that this convergence along with increasing digitalization, network virtualization, and the agility of cloud native software-defined services will lead to increasing demand for distributed, interconnected, global-edge compute processing. As a result, the first mile of cloud OnRamp as this edge should become a more critical component of our customers' network architecture, and notably this edge is exactly where our exclusive communications real estate assets are located. To capitalize on the opportunities this network evolution is likely to present, we are focused on developing communications infrastructure business model that augment the value of our existing assets, expand our revenue base beyond traditional tenants, and enhance our leadership role in the wireless ecosystem. At the highest level, our goal is to selectively extend our digital infrastructure core capabilities to further encapsulate neutral hosted wireless connectivity, transport and compute functions as part of our comprehensive ATC platform. We can then offer tenants an integrated suite of complementary solutions to fit well within their ever more complex network designs. Within this framework, we intend to remain disciplined in terms of how we deploy capital and believe ventures with select partners could be the most efficient way to develop this platform extension. We expect our investments to focus on business models with several key elements : first, contracted long-term revenue commitments from Tier 1 customers; second, increasing ROIC with multi-tenancy, and multi-service offerings requiring modest ongoing maintenance CapEx; third, operating leverage characteristics similar to towers, we focus on our fixed costs; and fourth synergies and adjacencies with existing ATC assets and skill sets. So with that General backdrop in mind, let me dive deeper into a few specific areas where we are currently focusing our efforts with one example in the United States, and one offshore. In the United States, as 5G deployments accelerate, we expect the proliferation of lower latency applications, and incremental cloud-based customer demand for application level and network compute functions at the edge. There are two distinct solutions within this emerging ecosystem that we are paying attention to : distributed compute, and mobile edge compute. We believe that these two offerings will develop at different timelines and will allow us to provide differentiated value propositions for our customers. On the distributed compute side, enterprise workloads continue to move to the public cloud and a growing near-term market segment is the use of on or off-prem private cloud computing is a hybrid solution. Small and medium-sized businesses are often willing to move legacy workloads to more responsive, proximate, cost-effective data centers, and we believe that many data centers at some of our macro towers can represent optimal locations for these installations. We have started to deploy micro data center facilities at select tower sites, and have seen early indications of solid demand in collaboration with partners like Flexential. In the near-term, this solution enables us to develop operational excellence around the technology and iron out the kinks on a small scale. With that said, we don't necessarily think this use case alone will be the long-term driver of significant value for us. We expect true 5G mobile edge compute solutions to represent a much larger long-term opportunity. The foundational concept of our mobile edge strategy is the expectation that localized neutral host, multi-operator, multi-cloud micro data centers can be the most cost and technology efficient means to which latency can be reduced to the edge. And that these facilities can be optimally located at select macro tower sites that already have power, fiber, and multiple wireless tenants, rather than each cloud provider and carrier forging ahead with their own connectivity arrangements, our vision is to serve as the neutral host for these low latency relationships, which would drive cost efficiency, improve enter MNO application performance, and accelerate deployment of these facilities throughout the network. We expect this to be a multi-year rearchitecture process, and we are in the early stages of leveraging the knowledge that we've developed through Colo Atl in the small scale deployments at the tower sites I mentioned earlier, to determine the specifics of our go-forward strategy. They also mentioned these offerings in all likelihood will involve partnerships and joint ventures, as we continue to explore where in the value chain we can drive the most incremental upside. At this point, we think a scaled solution is still at least a few years away, but there is tangible progress being made and we are excited about the possibilities. Underlying this excitement of the potential future 5G related use cases that we expect to drive rapid uptake of mobile edge compute functions. Immersive AR and VR gaming applications are obvious examples. Autonomous Vehicle connectivity is another, including our involvement in C-V2X with partners like Qualcomm, and Audi. Next-generation drone delivery networks, real-time sensor-based data collection and analytics, and a host of other enterprise-oriented solutions are also on the way and will require significant levels of compute power on the network edge. Our objective today is to position American Tower to be ready to act decisively when the time is right to be a meaningful player in the space. Meanwhile on the international side, most of our markets are at least five years behind the U.S., in terms of deployed network technology. As a result, the edge compute opportunity and other potential 5G enabled business models are further down the road. The strategic advantage that we expect to have in these areas similar to what we did with our core tower business is the ability to prove out these models in the United States first, and then export them internationally when the time is right. Over time, we believe that our global interconnected reach will be critical in the context of an ever more global, multinational customer base, and their need to support their customer's global needs. In the meantime, one of the main focus areas of our platform extension efforts today throughout Africa and India especially, is on developing power as a service, to drive operational efficiency and cost savings, while materially reducing the carbon footprint of the wireless industry. Throughout much of Africa and India, the electric grid is inherently unreliable. It is part of our service offerings we are responsible for providing onsite power for our tenants. In the past, this was almost exclusively delivered through diesel generators with significant daily run times and diesel usage at considerable expense. More recently, as solar and lithium-ion battery technologies improve or becoming more cost-effective, we have accelerated our adoption of these technologies to make power provision in our sites more efficient, and environmentally friendly. In fact, as of the end of 2019, we had 12.3 megawatts of solar capacity already online with more than 4,500 sites utilizing lithium-ion batteries. To date, we've invested nearly $135 million on fuel and power optimization solutions, and expect to continue to make these investments as we improve site reliability levels for our tenants. As we disclosed in our latest sustainability report, our long-term target is to reduce our scope on fossil fuel consumption in diesel related greenhouse gas emissions in Africa and India by more than 60%, or 140 million liters of diesel annually by 2027. Already, we have made significant progress towards that objective having reduced annual diesel consumption by 65 million liters since 2017, after normalizing for site count growth. To give you a sense for what that translates to, it's essentially the equivalent of taking more than 35,000 cars off the road for a full year or preserving more than 65,000 acres of forest. In addition, we are currently exploring the development of science-based emissions targets consistent with the Paris Agreement goals. These initiatives are in their early stages. We are excited about the impact that we can make going forward. Just like in the United States where we are seeking to leverage our expanding platform to augment the value of our communication sites, we believe that we can translate our expertise and industry leadership in fuel and power internationally into tremendous added value. Reducing the total cost of ownership for our tenants further improving up times and developing more efficient, clean, renewable networks will benefit stakeholders across the value chain. We're committed to making substantial additional progress over the long-term. Just like in the United States where we are working on a number of other initiatives, we're continuing to look at things like fiber to the tower, fiber to the home, and other transport models in many of our international markets as ways to further broaden our addressable market and add value. These value propositions would all be predicated on long-term contractual commitments with multi-tenant and multi-service elements that mirror our existing tower model. In closing, on a global basis, we are in a time of tremendous technological digital transformation. Access to ubiquitous broadband connectivity has never been more important, particularly, in the context of the ongoing pandemic. There are new use cases emerging every day with modern wireless networks becoming more and more dynamic, responsive and critical. As providers of the underlying infrastructure that supports mobile connectivity for billions of people around the world, we have a unique advantage point from which to observe all of these developments. And I think we also have an incredible opportunity to pair our advantages and scale, financial resources, and global reach with our platform expansion initiatives to drive tremendous incremental value for our stakeholders over time in a sustainable way. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod, to go through our third quarter results, and updated full-year 2020 outlook. Rod Smith : Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining our call, and I hope you're well and remain safe during these challenging times. As you saw in our press release, we had a very strong third quarter that outpaced our expectations, and as a result, are raising our full year outlook for key metrics. Before we dive into the details of our results and updated expectations, I'd like to highlight the following. First, demand for our global tower assets was strong in the quarter, most notably and as Tom just discussed, we signed a comprehensive nearly 15-year long master lease agreement with T-Mobile in the U.S. which brought our contracted base of committed future revenue across the company to over $58 billion. We believe that this MLA serves as another reaffirmation of macro towers serving as the baseline of modern wireless networks for the foreseeable future. We also expanded our tower portfolio through select acquisitions and build to suit initiatives, acquiring more than 300 sites in building nearly 1,500, which was a quarterly record. We continue to effectively manage through the challenges posed by COVID with a continued focus on the safety of our employees, vendors, customers and communities. Additionally, our focus on operational excellence, efficiency, and cost controls enabled us to drive expanding margins across the business, despite some of the challenges resulting from the global pandemic. Moving to the balance sheet, we issued around $2.8 billion in U.S. dollar in euro-denominated senior notes across several tenders, including 30 years during the quarter. As a result of these refinancing initiatives, we were able to further extend our repayment schedule, and reduce our weighted average cost of borrowings. We ended the quarter with nearly $6.7 billion in liquidity and increased our euro-denominated borrowings to represent over 10% of our total debt. Finally, we declared a common stock dividend of $1.14 per share, extending our long track record of solid dividend growth. Returning capital to shareholders through the dividend remains an important part of our capital allocation strategy. Now, please turn to Slide 6, and I will review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. In addition to discussing growth rates on a reported basis, I'll also outline FX neutral metrics. Our third quarter consolidated property revenue of nearly $2 billion grew on a reported basis by $66 million, or 3.4% over the prior-year period and on an FX neutral basis by $155 million, or 8.1%. Our U.S. property revenue totaled more than $1.1 billion and grew by $27 million, or 2.4% over the prior year, including a roughly 2% negative impact from lower straight-line revenue. Approximately 55% of our consolidated property revenue was generated in the U.S. Our international property revenue was approximately $865 million and grew on a reported basis by around $39 million, or 4.8%. This included FX headwinds of roughly $89 million as compared to Q3 of last year. And on an FX-neutral basis, International Property revenue grew by $129 million, or 15.6%. FX trends have appeared to stabilize over the last several months, and FX was slightly better in Q3 than our prior expectations. Our underlying revenue growth rates reflect solid demand for our tower space from our base of primarily large multinational tenants, who are expected to invest approximately $30 billion in their networks this year, as they continue to add coverage, increased network capacity and rollout more advanced network technology. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see that we achieved consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 4.4% for the quarter, right in line with our expectations. This included U.S. organic tenant billings growth of 4.2% comprised of new business activity, which contributed 2.9%. Escalators, which contributed 3.1%, churn of 1.4%, and a roughly 0.3% negative impact from other items. As expected this growth rate reflects a sequential deceleration driven by modest levels of new business activity from T-Mobile over the last year, but continued strong contributions from other tenants. On a gross basis, including the impacts of our new MLA with T-Mobile, we expect activity to increase beginning in early 2021. Although this will be accompanied by higher levels of churn over the next few years as T-Mobile decommissioned certain Sprint sites. Our international organic tenant billings growth in the quarter was 4.7% led by Africa at over 8%, and Latin America at 7%. Europe was just over 2%, while India was negative 0.5% all of which were in line with our expectations. Gross new business commencements were solid once again as network expansion and densification initiatives continued. The component parts of our international organic tenant billings growth were new business activity, which totaled over 6%. Our mostly local inflation based pricing escalators, which contributed 3.5%, and other items which contributed 20 basis points, partially offset by the churn of 5.2% concentrated in India. Moving on to Slide 7, you can see that our third-quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.3 billion grew on a reported basis by about $69 million, or 5.6% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by $119 million, or 9.7%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 64.5%, up roughly 160 basis points over the prior year, and 120 basis points sequentially. This increase was attributable primarily to solid organic growth throughout the business, as well as diligent cost management and efficiency initiatives. Our U.S. business again drove a substantial majority of our consolidated property segment operating profit accounting for roughly two thirds of the total. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see our consolidated AFFO of $1.020 billion grew on a reported basis by nearly $131 million or 14.7% over the prior year and on an FX neutral basis by around $175 million for nearly 20%. Consolidated AFFO per share of $2.29 grew on a reported basis by about $0.29 or 14.5% over last year's levels and on an FX neutral basis grew by $0.39, or almost 20%. This growth in AFFO and AFFO per share was driven by our previously discussed growth in cash adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower cash interest costs resulting from financing activity along with lower levels of cash taxes and maintenance capital spending. Let's now move on to the high-level themes driving our updated 2020 expectations, which reflect increases across all key metrics. Our revised full-year outlook is based on underlying demand expectations that are broadly consistent with our prior view. The large multinational carriers that account for the vast majority of our consolidated property revenue continue to deploy network capital as their customers consume more and more mobile data, irrespective of some of the disruptions caused by COVID-19. In the U.S., we expect leasing demand to pick up as we head into 2021, as carriers ramp investments in 5G and continue 4G upgrades. Mobile data consumption grows at 30% or more per year, and mid-band spectrum deployments accelerate. In the intermediate-term, we think that much of this acceleration is likely to revolve around the deployment of 2.5 gigahertz spectrum. Looking slightly further out, we expect that the C band DISH's spectrum assets and to some extent CBRS are likely to all be relevant drivers of network activity. As a result, we believe that the U.S. wireless landscape remains constructive and is poised to drive solid tower leasing activity for many years to come. Our international businesses are performing well and continue to meet our expectations, highlighting the resiliency and critical nature of tower assets across the globe. We also continue to augment our international portfolio through both accretive M&A, and high return new build programs. For the full year, we are raising our expectations for new builds to 5,500 at the midpoint on the back of a record third-quarter where we constructed nearly 1,500 sites. And on the M&A front, we added nearly 300 sites across our international footprint in Q3, bringing our year-to-date total to about 800, including more than 300 in Europe. Broadband connectivity across our international footprint has never been more critical, particularly, in markets with limited fixed-line access and we are working closely with our tenants to help them drive it. As part of these efforts, we have augmented several customer relationships recently, which we believe positioned us well to drive attractive growth while delivering high levels of service. We are already seeing benefits of these enhanced partnerships through accelerating organic growth in markets like Nigeria, and higher levels of new build activity in many of our other markets and expect these positive trends to continue over the long-term. Meanwhile, in India, the Supreme Court has ruled on a 10-year AGR repayment timeline for the carriers. We view this as a positive as it provides incremental clarity in the marketplace in near-term breathing room for the carriers in terms of their liquidity. While we believe it is too early for these positive developments to translate into significant improvements in our near-term operating results, they do provide a base for optimism for the longer term. As it relates to our 2020 outlook, outside of some more favorable projections for a bad debt due to better collections over the last few months, our operational expectations in India are essentially unchanged from our prior view. Now, please turn to Slide 8, and we will review our raised outlook midpoints. Our updated guidance for property revenue is $7.89 billion, which is an increase of $165 million, compared to our prior outlook and reflects a growth rate on a reported basis of 5.6%. On an FX neutral basis, the growth rate would be right around 10%. For the U.S. property segment, we now expect revenues of nearly $4.5 billion, which is $115 million above our prior projection. This is primarily being driven by about $105 million in incremental straight-line revenue attributable to our new T-Mobile MLA, as well as some other non-run rate outperformance in the business. For our International property segment, we now anticipate property revenue of $3.390 billion, which is $50 million higher than our prior projections. This is being driven by approximately $15 million in favorable FX impacts along with around $13 million in additional currency neutral pastures, and roughly $7 million in incremental straight-line revenue as well as $15 million or so in other outperformance throughout the business. Moving to the right side of the slide, we are reiterating our expectations for 4.5% to 5% consolidated organic tenant billings growth. This includes a projection of 4.5% for the U.S. and roughly 5% for international. As I mentioned earlier, we do expect an acceleration in gross new business activity in the U.S. beginning in early 2021, in part driven by our new agreement with T-Mobile. Turning to Slide 9, you can see that we now expect our full-year adjusted EBITDA to be $5.1 billion, which is $170 million above the midpoint of our prior outlook and over11% greater than the prior year on an FX neutral basis. The primary drivers of this increase are approximately $105 million in an incremental net straight line, about $27 million and better than expected non-pass through, primarily non-run rate cash revenues around $28 million, and lower than expected non-pass through direct operating costs in cash SG&A, including $20 million and lower bad debt expectations in India in favorable FX impacts of roughly $5 million. For the year, we now expect cash SG&A as a percent of consolidated property revenue to be 8.2%, or around 7.2%, excluding bad debt reflecting continued scale benefits across the business. Lastly, we expect consolidated AFFO for the full year to be $3.75 billion at the midpoint, which is $75 million, or 2% above our prior outlook. On an FX-neutral basis, this reflects the growth of nearly 11% even including the $63 million one-time cash interest expense impact from our purchase of MTNs joint venture stakes in Africa earlier this year. The primary drivers of the increase as compared to our prior expectations include the cash adjusted EBITDA outperformance I just mentioned, $20 million in lower net cash interest, and about $5 million in favorable FX impacts, partially offset by $10 million in additional expected maintenance capital spending. On a per share basis, we now expect to generate consolidated AFFO of $8.40, an increase of $0.17 as compared to the prior outlook. On an FX neutral basis, the year-on-year per share growth rate would be nearly 11%. Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our capital deployment expectations for the full year. Let me start by stating that we remain committed to our existing disciplined approach to capital allocation, which for many years has proven to be successful. This deep-rooted philosophy guides our decisions regarding dividends, capital expenditures, M&A and stock repurchases. For 2020, we expect our full-year dividend subject to board approval to be approximately $2 billion resulting in an annual common stock dividend growth rate of right around 20%. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we expect the dividend growth rates in future years will likely be below 20% in line with our expected re-taxable income growth rates, again subject to the discretion of our board. Regarding our capital expenditures, we expect to deploy about $1.15 billion with more than 85% allocated towards discretionary projects. This is up to $75 million from our prior outlook, driven primarily by higher expected new build activity, as well as some acceleration in start-up capital spending and a small increase in maintenance CapEx. On the M&A front, we have spent roughly $860 million so far this year, including our previously mentioned purchase of the JV stake in Africa in the first quarter, and we are actively evaluating additional opportunities. Our previously announced purchase of the Tata's remaining stake in our India business is still pending regulatory approval in India. At quarter-end and exchange rates, this represents a purchase price of approximately $336 million, and for the purposes of outlook, we have assumed that this transaction will be finalized by the end of the year. And lastly, our year-to-date dividend declarations plus the $56 million we have deployed for stock repurchases, we have now returned about $1.5 billion to common stockholders so far in 2020. Turning now to Slide 11, I will briefly touch on our strong investment-grade balance sheet, which we believe will be a critical component of our continued growth. Since becoming an investment grade in late 2009, our balance sheet strength has allowed us to grow revenue, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO, and consolidated AFFO per share, while maintaining prudent levels of liquidity and ensuring unobstructed access to capital at attractive rates. During the quarter, we accessed capital markets in the U.S. and Europe to issue roughly $2.8 billion across multiple tenures, including 30-years in both the U.S. dollar and euros. As of the end of the quarter, our average cost of debt stood at 2.9% more than 200 basis points below 2010 levels and average debt tenor was more than seven years, nearly two years in excess of where we were back in 2010. Our available liquidity totaled $6.7 billion, and our net leverage was 4.5 times, solidly within the three to five times target range. Taking all this balance sheet momentum into account, we believe that we are in a tremendous position of financial strength. Looking forward, we remain committed to our existing financial policies as we continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, low cost of debt appropriate and consistent levels of leverage along with disciplined capital allocation decisions are essential to our ability to deliver attractive total shareholder returns over an extended period of time. On Slide 12 and in summary, we are positioned to finish the year strong with improving margins, enhanced strategic relationships with our tenants and continued opportunities to deploy capital towards accretive growth. Looking ahead, 5G deployment activity in the U.S. is poised to accelerate beginning in 2021, and we believe this will include material deployments of the mid-band spectrum, primarily in suburban and rural areas of the country where our towers are located. In addition, DISH is expected to begin building a nationwide network towards the back half of next year, driving potential future upside. Given our comprehensive portfolio of U.S. assets and mutually beneficial relationships with our tenants, we believe that we are well-positioned to drive a prolonged period of attractive contractually guaranteed U.S. growth. Meanwhile, we expect our diverse International Property segment to continue to perform well as global mobile network operator's deployed significant capital to deliver capable high-quality networks for their customers who are consuming more and more mobile data than ever before. Our international footprint of more than 140,000 sites is an excellent complement to our foundational U.S. asset base, and we expect that over the long term it will help us elongate and augment our growth trajectory. Finally, we believe that as a result of our strong balance sheet, our disciplined and steady approach to capital allocation, and most importantly because of our 5,500 experienced and talented employees across the globe, we are well-positioned to continue our long track record of driving consistent reoccurring consolidated AFFO per share growth, and growing dividend and attractive total shareholder returns. With that, operator, will you please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we have a first question from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please, go ahead. Wait. One moment here. My apologies Mr. Rollins. Please, go ahead. Michael Rollins : Well, thanks, and good morning. Two questions if I could. The first is, you were describing that gross new activity in the U.S. business should improve in early 2021. Is there a risk that carriers slow activity, while they await the results of the C-Band auction? Can you provide us with a framework or historical perspective on how to think about how much leasing activity can improve from the current run rate? And then just secondly, if you could help unpack the timing of churn related to the comprehensive deal that you signed with T-Mobile? Thank you. Tom Bartlett : Hey Michael, maybe I'll start and then, Rod can come in. What we'll come out with specific guidance, obviously in February of next year when we release earnings. But what we are seeing is, as we said on the last call, we expect that a pickup in activity from T-Mobile. So there is going to be one of the principal drivers of the pickup particularly early on in 2021. As we see the level of activity picking up in the latter half of 2020. So there are going to be one of the principal, I think drivers of that pickup. And with regards to kind of the C-Band question what we've seen historically, you've seen this as clearly as well being so close to us and to what the carriers are doing. They're going to be taking advantage and leveraging every last megahertz they have of the spectrum. And so I think that they're not going to wait specifically for the new spectrum to be deployed there. That's going to fit right into their strategy at C-Band deployment schedule is going to be over a multi-year. And so they're going to continue to build out their current 5G if you will, along the same kind of layered cake kind of spectrum capacity that we've talked about in the past. So we would expect that the carriers are going to continue to spend, continue to meet their own customers' needs, and they're doing it differently. As you well know, they're doing it across many different bands. But they're going to continue to deploy. So as I said, we'll provide more detail on that deployment in our Q4 call. But we're obviously, very bullish in terms of how we would see 2021. And Rod, you have anything to add. Rod Smith : Yes. I'll add a couple of things. Good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. So the pickup that we are seeing going forward really is centered on T-Mobile as Tom alluded to. So, everybody knows that there was a slowdown from T-Mobile that began late in 2019 as they prepared for their merger with Sprint that persisted through most of 2020 to date. So that \u2013 now that we're lapping that, we've got a base of growth to grow from and that was the new T-Mobile deal, we have contracted levels of business going into 2021. So we do see an acceleration there. The other carriers have been pretty consistent through 2020, so that's been good to see this year so far. And then related to the churning part of your question, we do see that churn for T-Mobile happening over a multi-year period. It really will begin in late 2021, and go out for a few years, about four years. And we'll talk more about that Michael when we give guidance in February. Michael Rollins : Thanks for the additional detail. Operator : Next, we'll go to a question from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please, go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks, good morning. I hope you guys are doing well. Rod Smith : Good Morning, Ric. Ric Prentiss : A couple of questions. Hey Rod. A couple of questions, I apologize I got pulled off for a second there to give my name and firm when you were getting your prepared remarks. T-Mobile when they were talking about the new MLA said that the escalators could de-escalate over time. Tom, you mentioned before I got cut-off that escalators are in the kind of consistent with the 3%, 3.5% range. But how should we think about escalators plus usage and then churn affecting that kind of a multi-year basis. Do the numbers go up every year or percent going down? How should we think about that comment from T-Mobile say escalators are going to de-escalate? Tom Bartlett : Well, I think as I mentioned before Ric. There are two escalators that are part of this agreement. As is typical with similar types of the agreement, we have the base escalator which we have in all as you well know in all of our agreements \u2013 master agreements which are in the 3% to 3.5% range. And that will stay fixed for the entire term of the contract. On top of that is our \u2013 what we call is our use fee or our second escalator that's on top of the base escalator. And that escalator allows then \u2013 and that on an annual basis, and it's and it's determined based upon the prior year, monthly or the ending year run rates. And that then allows T-Mobile to add equipment up to preloading agreements, up to certain rights on the agreement themselves. And that escalator is also in force over the lane of the contract. Now that second escalator unlike the first does decrease over time really as a result of the base getting bigger. So it's a slightly lower escalator that it's applied to a higher base to drive consistent rate of incremental growth. And so the comment was that I believe that it does de-escalate. And on that second escalator the way we think about that, that is in fact true. But it's really as I said, a function of that the base is getting bigger. And so you have a slightly lower use fee escalator being applied to it to keep a consistent rate of incremental growth, again, as part of the comprehensive or holistic agreement over the entire term of the agreement. So that I think, I'm trying to tie to connect the dots and tie it together. That's fundamentally how that agreement, both escalators will work. Ric Prentiss : Okay. And I know you're going to give 2021 guidance on the February call. But should we think about given all the complexity here. Maybe you guys might consider giving multi-year guidance in the future? Tom Bartlett : That's something that we are thinking about. I mean I've been spending time with Rod and Igor. So that's very, very possible Ric, just to give people a sense of what it might look like on a multi-year period given the churn that we are expecting in as a result of the, kind of the Sprint leases coming off. But that's very possible. Ric Prentiss : Okay. And lastly from me, you mentioned -Rod mentioned Dish maybe back half of 2021 ramping up. Are you guys MLA discussions with them. Should we expect an MLA with Dish and could there be maybe C-Band effort earlier and then you suggested if people are aggressive with their other carriers? Tom Bartlett : We know, on the Dish question, I don't want to get into any specifics with them or as you would expect, we're in significant conversations with them, as we're always talking to customers. They've stated that they are looking to start to build out their network. I believe in the second half of the year, and so we want to make sure that we're there for them enable to service them to the extent that we can. So there are, candidly, a lot of conversation going on there. As I said that we'd like we have with all our customers. On the C-Band that's possible in anticipation of that spectrum being deployed, carriers getting ready to be able to participate in that. That's always an opportunity we believe. I'm not sure how material that would be, candidly, Ric at this point in time, it's hard to tell. The likes of Verizon, AT&T, I mean they deploy capital in a very regimented kind of measured way. And so it's hard to say that would materially change the timing or direction of growth rates. But it's very possible that there might be some acceleration of some growth as a result of that band in particular becoming available. Ric Prentiss : And I meant \u2013 sorry, I meant to also ask, are you seeing anything from cable operators who have started buying some spectrum and are registered for some auctions? Any activity from the cable interested in new towers? Tom Bartlett : We've \u2013 and by the way we have cable customers today. Again, I don't want to get any specifics there Ric, particularly as it relates to new entrants into the market. But we're obviously, I think well positioned to be able to service them to the extent that they go down that path. Ric Prentiss : Appreciate it. Hope you, family and employees stay well in these crazy times. Good luck, guys. Tom Bartlett : Yes. You too, Ric. Be well. Rod Smith : Thanks, Ric. Operator : And our next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a few on international. I guess more broadly are you seeing any cause or slowing in the pacing of activity across your larger markets whether you like the macro or COVID-related pressure, sort of hampering carrier spending plans? And then just drilling down in terms of India, Colo and amendment activity looks like it's moderated now for three straight quarters. So I'm just wondering what's the latest you're seeing there, and how should we think about the pacing of net organic growth from here? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Yes. Hey Matt. Hey, thanks. Thanks for the question. I think on the contrary on international markets. I continually see incredible densification initiatives and new newbuild projects going on in just about all of the markets whether it's Mexico, Brazil, down in Latin America, Africa. We're seeing significant increases in demand for build to suit new co-locations orders. So I can go by market and I can see significant levels of increase in Colo orders as well as build to suit. As Rod said, I would continue to set records on build to suit activities. So I think that's just indicative of the amount of densification that's going on around the globe. With particularly in India, in India again, we hit on a gross basis kind of double-digit growth rates. And so what we see continued demand there. I think there has been a general slowdown overall, not just regards to COVID, but I think also with regard to clearing through a lot of the AGR, a lot of tax issues, I think that put a slowdown if you will. Some of the levels of the spend that the carriers were doing in the marketplace. But hopefully, much of that will be behind us and the carriers I now \u2013 I know are really starting to think about and move forward in terms of looking to increase kind of rates of growth going forward. COVID has impacted some of the build to suit activity in the marketplace in terms of getting permits and some of those types of things. And as you well know, I mean India has really struggled as much of the world. But in particular, India has struggled with COVID, particularly over the last several months. So I know that has actually slowed down some of the build to suit activity. But on the growth side, the market is very strong. Rod Smith : And Tom, if I could just add a couple of points there. So on the organic tenant billings growth, we did have a basically a flat organic tenant billings growth for the quarter in India. But we had about 2.3% added through the newbuild program that Tom just mentioned. So we built just shy of a thousand towers in India in the quarter. And I'll just remind everyone that in India, our day one returns on those new bills are solidly in the double digits. So even close to 14 %. Matt Niknam : Thanks, guys. Tom Bartlett : Yes. Thanks, Matt. Operator : And our next question is from Jon Atkin with RBC. Please, go ahead. Jon Atkin : Thanks. So one international and one U.S. I guess on the U.S., given again all the moving parts around CBRS, and C-Band, and Dish, and the T-Mobile churn that Rod talked about. Can you frame the U.S. organic growth rate next year? Just sort of directionally higher or lower than what you were forecasting for this year based on \u2013 based on what you're seeing right now. And then internationally, apart from India where it sounds like you made a little bit of a different assumption with respect to bad debt there was some churn \u2013 there's some gross leasing a lot to unpack there. But what are the biggest variables to think about as we think about 2021 either by country or within India? If India is that country that would need to kind of the most variability in the outlook? I would appreciate your perspective. Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Yes. Hey, thanks, Jon. We'll get in the specifics for 2021 and on our next quarter's call. I think as we've alluded to it, we've talked that we would expect an increase in the gross in the U.S. business. Michael if that wouldn't be before and I think it's a function of some of the activity that we're seeing happen with T-Mobile. And we're very bullish on what's going on in the U.S. markets. I mean not a lot of different fronts not just in terms of the new spectrum, new technology being deployed, but potential new entrants into the market continued growth in demand. Even though the realization process that the government is driving in terms of trying to ensure that broadband is therefore for all. I mean I think all of these would clearly give us a bullish sense of what we would expect in the U.S. market over the next couple of years. And in particular in 2021, just on top of the ongoing demand that we see going on from a network usage perspective. Internationally, in each of the markets we \u2013 just in terms of guidance for 2020, I mean all of the markets are up from a revenue perspective. As I mentioned before they're significant densification efforts going on in all of the markets. You can always go market-by-market and look at various metrics, and you can \u2013 you can see that there is a significant new infrastructure that needs to be added. New sites that need to be added in those markets to be able to support the growth that they have going on in those markets. And so, as we've always said, and as you well know, the international markets are a couple of technologies behind generally. And so \u2013 and without any really strong wireline capability, and so on \u2013 and a pandemic even the market, the world that we're living in today there's even more of a demand for wireless infrastructure in those markets. And so, I think all of that gives a good backdrop for what we would expect growth to look like in the internationally in those markets. We've always said it's going to be 200 basis points to 300 basis points faster than we're seeing in the United States. And if you take a look at even in Q3, you look at Latin America; you look at Africa they're all up in the kind of 7% to 8% range. And so, it's \u2013 the model works. I think the strategy works and we're very bullish in terms of what we're expecting to see in our international markets over the next several years. Jon Atkin : The 5,500 deals that upsized outlook that you gave us to any kind of a regional pick out that you could provide? Tom Bartlett : I mean, I think we have. I mean Rod can give the one. I mean India was up a bit. We've seen continued growth in the India marketplace from a couple of the large carriers there. So there's an outsized, probably piece of that 5,500 that is there. And as Rod mentioned, we're getting double-digit rates of return right out of the gate. We're seeing also significant demand in Africa. In Nigeria \u2013 markets like Nigeria, Uganda, some of the markets there we're seeing upticks in the overall build to suit the activity. Brazil is a market we've always talked about. It's been indeed probably twice as many sites in the market as they are today. I think to be able to meet the demand and provide a good quality signal, and so we're seeing increased demand for site builds in Brazil as well. So it's a bit of a mix across the three of them I'd say. And I'm hopeful that we're going to be able to see continued increases in rates that built the suit going forward. It's our best rate of return capital dollars spent in the business. And so, we work very closely with our carriers to be able to kind of maximize that category of CapEx. Jon Atkin : Thank you, very much. Rod Smith : And Jonathan, I'll just give you a few numbers here to support Tom's comment. So of the 5,500, India is going to be the lion's share of that probably close to 3,500. In Latin America maybe around 500. In Africa, you can think of that as about 1,300 or so in that range and handful in Europe, maybe 40 in Europe and in a small number in the U.S. Jon Atkin : Got it. Thanks, so much. Operator : Next, we have a question from Tim Long with Barclays. Please, go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Thank you. Just one quick clarification if I could and then a question. I just want to make sure I heard it right as far as not to kill the team of Sprint MLA here. But it is the comment that this is likely going to be a four-year period. I think I heard that? And then second, I'm just interested in talking a little bit about Europe. Obviously, still pretty small but a few hundred, 200 acquired sites there. Could you give a little more color on that, and maybe update us on views there with the MLA landscape is obviously still a lot of activity in the European theatre. And you guys are underrepresented? So just an update there would be great. Thank you. Tom Bartlett : Yes. Sure. No, Tim. The churn in the \u2013 as we said multi-year, three to four years that you would expect to see a lot of that churn flush through. So hopefully that will give you a sense of the time period on that. Europe has always been a market. We've been looking at Europe for, and getting deeper into the region for many, many years. And we've always struggled from a valuation perspective and a growth perspective. We think of the U.S. business being the largest driver of cash flow as kind of the developed market and create a consistent rate of growth. And then we've looked at our Europe, our international markets candidly as ways to increase the slope of the curve from a cash flow growth perspective. And so we're willing and have been able to take some higher levels of risk if you will going into international markets using significantly higher risk-adjusted hurdle rates. But really is a function of the core U.S. business. And so when we take a look at Europe as being somewhat \u2013 more of a developed market, the growth rates have just not been particularly strong. I mean the beachfront properties that we have in France, and Germany and now just entered into Poland; the growth rates have been in the 2% to 4% kind of rate of growth. And so when we think about allocating capital that generally hasn't been overly exciting, candidly in terms of the overall rates of growth. And then when we take a look at the underlying valuations for a lot of the assets in the particular markets, we really struggle with some of the growth expectations that you would have to realize to be able to support some of the underlying valuations for those assets. Now, we're \u2013 given the size and kind of the scope of American Tower, we're part of every deal that goes down in the region. And so, we're watching it very closely. We're participating in certain areas. As you said, we're undersized, I guess, relative to some of the \u2013 to Cellnex, for example, in the marketplace. But that's okay. I mean we're \u2013 that doesn't bother me in terms of our presence. We're going to continue to look at a deal by every deal on its own and take a look at the underlying variables of the deal and expectations of the deal and to the extent that the ROI and the NPDs can be sizeable. We'll look to participate in it and see kind of where we land in terms of being successful there. But just because we're relatively under sized versus the other players in the marketplace that doesn't concern me at all. We're all here about creating AFFO per share growth and ROIC growth, and to the extent that they can contribute to those two variables. We're going to weigh in and participate. So, we'll see where that lands over and it will continue to develop. There are a lot of assets, as you said. They're going to be coming up on the marketplace. There are a lot of large carriers, who are looking to monetize their assets. So, there very well could be some opportunities there. And as I said, we'll just take a look at them one at a time. Tim Long : Okay, thank you very much. Rod Smith : Hi, Tim. Tim, I think the other part of your question was the breakdown of the sites that we acquired in Q3, so we acquired a little over 300 sites in Q3. 195 of those were in France through our arrangement with Orange, which we've talked about in the past. And then there was an additional block here in Chile and Peru, which are our additional tranches with the \u2013 on the Intel agreement that we have. So that makes up the majority of that that 305. So it's really in France, Chile, and Peru. Tim Long : Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification. Operator : And next we go to a question from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tom Bartlett : Hi, Dave. David Barden : Hi, Tom. I wanted to come back to the T-Mobile agreement a little bit, last quarter you guys took T-Mobile out of your second half guidance. Your competitors actually spoke pretty optimistically about what that was going to mean for them. And so, the conclusion was that T-Mobile was steering business away from American Tower in an effort to gain leverage to negotiate a new MLA. And as a result of that, as we look forward to conversations that are going to emerge around the C-Band deployments, brand new networks not going to be deployed everywhere, only need to be deployed somewhere. Is there a thought that other carriers, DISH included, are going to look at what T-Mobile did in terms of how they steered business to some players in a way from others to gain leverage in these negotiations that somehow the balance of power between the towers and the carriers might have changed somehow. Could you kind of comment on how you think that might evolve in kind of the next phase of network development? Tom Bartlett : Yes, Dave, I mean, I don't think that's the case candidly. I think given the real estate that we have and the sites that we have, we're quite comfortable that the carriers are always going to have to come to us. I mean, that's kind of the beauty of the business that we have and the real estate that we have. I mean, we're always in negotiations with all the carriers. We're trying to meet their needs along the way is any typical kind of lesser or lessee kind of a relationship, but I don't think there's any real credence to the fact that there's leverage that's created as a result of moving or not coming onto our sites. I mean, we have a very long-term view of our business, of our customer base. We think that I think that's indicative of kind of the 15-year agreement that we put in place with T-Mobile. We think that, as we said in the past, that these types of master lease agreements are incredibly strategic and important to us for a number of reasons, not just to driving sizable predictable growth, but we also see really very sizable growth overall as a result of the additional right to use kind of base escalator. Historically, if you look at ATC in the United States, we've garnered, we generated over 50% of the new business in the United States on a fairly consistent basis. And so, I think that's indicative of the types of relationships that we have with our carriers over time. Are there always other issues in terms of some of the negotiations, sure we get some high priced sites, sites that have been out there for a very long period of time that have escalators on them. And we work very closely with the carriers then to try to bring those back to market, but then generating other types of value for us over a long time. So we're in constant \u2013 I'm in constant conversations with our U.S. customers. And so, I don't see that kind of activity. And if it does, as I said, it would be noise and it would not impact the way we think about our business or the way we strike kind of long-term lease agreements with any of our customers. David Barden : Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And then Rod, could I ask you just one quick one. You mentioned that part of the guidance in the quarter was related to non-run rate outperformance factors. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on what those were and what they contributed? Rod Smith : Sure, Dave. I think you're referring to the Q3 numbers. So, the non-run rate items, they're primarily in India. We had a few settlements in India about $25 million worth of settlements in India that will not be recurring that were in our Q3 numbers. David Barden : Got it. Okay. So that was the big delta in the Indian performance, all right. Thank you so much. Rod Smith : Correct. Operator : And our next question is from Sami Badri with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you for the question. So a lot of the questions today have been focused on the model, the 3Q results, the escalators, and it's all been very helpful. But I wanted to just shift gears to the micro data center and to the edge compute commentary that you made earlier on the conference call. And I think the one thing that a lot of market constituents and the analyst community is interested in is what is American Tower's core strategy entering this market? Is it going to be the provider of Colo? Is it going to be the leasing aspect? Is it going to be the go-to-market with Flexential and other providers? Can you just give us more color on what we should expect from AMT over the next couple of years on what your tactical strategy is going to be within the edge ecosystem? That'd be very helpful just to get a good idea on where all the chips are going to fall. Tom Bartlett : Right. No, no, I appreciate it. Thanks for the question. I tried to cover that in some of my prepared remarks. I mean, it's the highest level. We're really trying to create tower like communications infrastructure business models. They really augment, if you will, the value of our existing assets, expand our revenue base beyond the traditional tenants if you will and expand our role in that whole delivery system. It's all about extending the platform. And clearly part of that platform is that compute capability. And so, we're looking as part of that platform and the compute transport functions and really trying to create ways of being able to incrementally provide service to our customers. And so, if you think about kind of our longer term views of it, we're candidly looking at okay of the 40,000 sites in the United States, which could all be considered edge compute locations. It is at the edge. It is at the very edge of the edge if you will. How many of those sites would fit well in terms of fitting them out to be able to support the number of enterprise accounts, to support hyperscalers, to supplier data centers in ways where we can provide and be really part of that process to provide lower latency types of applications. And at each one of those sites then given kind of the real estate that we have, how many shelters can we put at each one of those locations, how much power can we drop into each one of those shelters and how many comes down to how many cabinets can we load up in each one of those new shelters? And so, we're looking at sites that potentially can hold two or three shelters, each shelter holding 8 to 10 cabs each providing 100 kilowatt of power into each one of those shelters themselves in a way that it can provide them kind of really an on-ramp for accounts in that particular location into the wireless world. And so, the models that we have and the trials that we have right now are trialing exactly that. And looking at then what are the price points for each one of those cabinets, can we get a traditional kind of $1,900 to $2,000 per cab in each one of those locations. How stackable are the shelters going to be? And then \u2013 and really looking at what that demand is. And so, we have several proof-of-concepts that we're working on in tandem with some potential partners and actually are looking at those now in front of certain enterprises to be able to determine really what is the opportunity there. In terms of how far we go along the kind of the value prop scale, that to be determined. Clearly, we have co-location in real estate, so those are kind of given. Then the question is, okay, how far do we go up the stack and then how do we provide those kinds of capabilities? As I mentioned in my remarks, it's not like we're looking to hire 1,000 software engineers or 2,000 sales reps to start selling into enterprise accounts and providing them access to cloud-based services. That's not our skill set. And so we would look to augment our capabilities with other capabilities to be able to jointly provide what we think could be a very interesting value proposition to the enterprise accounts around the country. So, time will tell. However, this is in early stages now. As I said, we're really dedicated. We have a number of resources dedicated to try to understand what this is, what the CapEx requirements are going to be at the site location and really again to come back to driving tower like communications infrastructure business models. So that's it, and kind of a short \u2013 a couple of sound bites. And you'll continually hear more and more about our strategy there as it develops and as we continue to go down the journey. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. That was actually a lot of detail, just one quick follow-up on that. And this fall mainly has to do with domestic versus international and this micro opportunity. A lot of the focus and the commentary has been focused on domestic deployment of micro data centers, but what about international, right? There are clearly big differences in terms of how the network looks abroad. And do you see edge being a much bigger opportunity abroad versus domestic at least within the next two to three years? Or is it going to be predominantly focused on domestic opportunities for now? Tom Bartlett : As I mentioned before, traditionally our international markets are a couple of technologies behind where they are in the United States. Having said that though, I think one of the real advantages that we bring to a venture is our global reach and the lack of really processing capability in many of our emerging markets that we have today. And so, while I think the strategy will probably more \u2013 will initially develop in the United States. I think the real value, ultimately, particularly as the \u2013 as the world shrinks. And as the cloud learns \u2013 we'll connect this off and does move to the edge. I think that our global reach is actually a real interesting element to what, as I said, we bring to the party. And so, it's difficult to say how the outside of the United States market might develop. We might find in certain markets that it may develop more quickly and that the kind of the edge compute capability turns into more than just in edge. You may be able to cluster certain edges to provide more of a metro data facility. Again \u2013 and particularly in areas of the world where there really isn't a lot of data center presence. So it will be very interesting question and one we're kind of getting our arms around and understanding exactly what are the benefits as a result of having that global reach? I think candidly that they're significant and we'll try to leverage that as much as we possibly can. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you very much. Tom Bartlett : You bet. Operator : And our final question comes from Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great, thank you. A couple of follow ups on the T-Mobile MLA again. I think you adjusted the straight line for this year, $20 million higher than the original guidance. What drove that? And second in terms of, as you look at the T-Mobile deployment, you have a pretty good insight into their long-term network span. Would you be able to provide some color if you think that you took a larger share of T-Mobile's future activity with this long-term contract? And also to the extent that T-Mobile acquires more spectrum or builds more sites, do you \u2013 can you give us some commentary in terms of could there be upsides to this existing MLA or is it mostly captured at least for the next few years? Tom Bartlett : Yes. No, thanks. Let me start and Rod to get in to add any additional color. On the straight line, I mean, it's \u2013 we're just refining the calculations as you might expect. It's a very complicated calculation. And so, it was just a kind of refinement of the calculation as that we were able to do. So there's nothing remarkable, I think, going on with regards to the actual straight line calculation. And with regards to your other question, I mean, all of our contracts are designed to take more than our fair share of the business. And as I mentioned before, historically in the United States we've captured over 50% of the new business in the United States. And so our contracts are designed to do that, but in a way that's providing a meaningful capability and service to our customers. And so with regards to the agreement that we put in T-Mobile, we are absolutely, we believe more strategic to them. We're working side-by-side with them on a number of different initiatives as we typically do when we enter into these types of relationships. Clearly, there is a desire for them to one to put more equipment on our sites as a result of the fact that they're already paying for it. And so, as a result of that, we would think that we would get an outsized part of their business. And so this is no different. And so to the extent that there's acceleration, there are different initiatives that they're looking to undertake, which knowing T-Mobile, we would expect so. We would hope that we would be really in the catbird seat in terms of being able to pick up a lot of that incremental business. And that's, as I said, historically, what these kinds of comprehensive holistic master lease agreements have really positioned us to be able to take advantage of that we hope so. Batya Levi : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And Mr. Khislavsky, I'll turn the call back over to you. Igor Khislavsky : Great. Thanks, Leah. Thank you everybody for joining this morning and have a great rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your Investor Relations host, Kate Ruppe. Please go ahead. Kate Ruppe : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also, on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of our full earnings release, which can be found on the Investor Relations pages of our Web site at coresite.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I will cover our 2020 highlights and discuss our 2021 priorities. I'll be followed by Steve and Jeff's more in depth discussion of sales and financial matters. Our 2020 highlights include new and expansion sales of $37.6 million of annualized GAAP rent, which marks a record year for retail and small scale leasing. Operating revenues of $606.8 million, representing 6% year-over-year growth. FFO per share of $5.31, representing a year-over-year increase of $0.21 per share or 4.1%. Delivery of 192,000 net rentable square feet or 22 megawatts of total new capacity, including the opening of two new data centers and seven-nines of power and cooling uptime. These achievements enabled us to execute on our 2020 goals of developing more capacity and completing projects on time, translating new and vacant capacity into sales, attracting quality new logos that value our campus ecosystems, thoughtfully expanding our products to assist enterprises with their hybrid and multi cloud needs and maintaining high levels of facility performance and customer service. Overall, I am pleased with the team's ability to successfully execute these priorities amidst the backdrop of the global pandemic. We delivered SV8 Phase 3, NY2 Phase 3 and the first phases of new data centers at CH2 and LA3. As a result, we finished 2020 with 40 megawatts of available capacity to sell compared to 23 megawatts at the end of 2019. Examples of translating new capacity into higher sales included leasing 75% of SV8 Phase 3 and 80% of LA3 Phase 1 and accelerating leasing in Northern Virginia, our best year in terms of annualized GAAP rent in that market since 2015. While sales cycles for enterprises were elongated probably due to the economic and other uncertainties related to the virus, we continue to attract high quality new logos, especially in the financial services industry at NY2. We also expanded our connectivity options during the year, including adding Google Partner Interconnect and Oracle Cloud infrastructure to the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange, increasing bandwidth for AWS hosted connections on the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange in our Chicago campus; adding multimarket peering to our enhanced NE2 exchange; and as recently announced, adding access to Google Cloud using dedicated interconnect in Northern Virginia. In addition to these 2020 accomplishments, as we announced earlier this week, we appointed a new director to our Board, Mr. Michael Milligan. Mike brings us valuable telecommunications experience as well as noteworthy Board experience, which will be a tremendous asset to CoreSite as we continue our pattern of expanding our talent pool through increasing diversity. I also want to thank Jim Atwood and David Thompson for their Board service over the last 10 years. They have both served since the company's IPO in September 2010, and their contributions were many. Jim and David will continue to serve until our annual meeting in May. But as part of our periodic Board rotation, will voluntarily not seek reelection this year. We are very grateful for the service they have provided to CoreSite, its shareholders and its employees and customers and wish them the best in their future endeavors. As we move forward to 2021, our goals are similar to our 2020 goals as we build on last year's successes. Our ability to meet those goals is enhanced by greater available capacity to sell and the strong enterprise funnel that has been building up due to elongated sales cycles we saw for the enterprise vertical in 2020. One notable difference is that while we will continue being proactive for future developments, we do not need and do not have any new ground up data centers planned to come online in 2021. In closing, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us, and we believe our priorities and our other operating objectives will continue to drive long-term value to our customers, employees and shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith : Thanks, Paul, and hello, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter sales results and then talk further about some of our key 2020 successes and drivers. Turning to our quarterly sales results. We delivered new and expansion sales of $9.7 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter. Please note that as of this earnings report and going forward, we have modified our reporting of new and expansion leases signed by deployment size included on Page 14 of our supplemental information. This revision reports our signed leases per period based on leased kilowatts rather than net rentable square feet. The change more closely aligns with how we manage sales activity internally and it is intended to provide greater visibility. New and expansion sales for the quarter included $4.4 million of annualized GAAP rent from retail leases, $3.7 million of GAAP rent from small scale leases and $1.5 million of GAAP rent from large scale leases. Our new and expansion sales were comprised of 54,000 net rentable square feet, reflecting an average annual GAAP rate of $180 per square foot and included an impressive 45 new logos, all with opportunities for future growth, our highest count since the first quarter of 2018. Looking more closely at new logos, the 45 new logos represents $0.8 million of annualized GAAP rent or approximately 8.5% of our total annualized GAAP rents signed during the quarter and were strongest in the enterprise vertical. Enhancing the ecosystem while diversifying the customer base through attracting and winning new customers remains a key area of focus, and it's great to see 45 new brands become part of that story. Next, I'll share some highlights from our sales wins. As Paul mentioned, during 2020, we executed $37.6 million of new and expansion sales in annualized GAAP rent, which marks a record year for retail and small scale leasing. It also represents an 18% increase in retail and small scale leasing compared to 2019. Driving our new and expansion sales this year were several key factors, including more available contiguous capacity to meet a broader range of customer requirements, ongoing strength in attracting and winning high quality new logo sales, strategic expansions from existing customers and a robust sustainable sales pipeline that includes customers looking to accelerate their digital transformation by deploying high performance hybrid cloud architectures. Let me expand on these drivers. Our new logo annualized GAAP rent for the full year was $4.3 million, which demonstrates the progress made against our goal to attract high quality new customers that value our platform, which will help drive future growth. As to strategic expansions with existing customers, our existing customers accounted for approximately 89% of the full year 2020 annualized GAAP rent signed, including expansions into additional markets. In summary, we are pleased with our sales execution during the year. We exited 2020 with ample contiguous capacity to support future sales opportunities as illustrated by the new capacity graph at the top of Page 18 of our supplemental information. We're optimistic about the fundamental market drivers supporting our strategy. The increasing need for enterprises to leverage technology in a seamless, high performance, hybrid multi cloud environment bodes well for the unique position of our network dense, cloud enabled campuses located in top enterprise markets. These market drivers align well with our ongoing product and services development, which are targeted easing the transition of enterprise with becoming customers by making data integration and application interoperability seamless. Our focus going forward will be to continue improving our ability to help customers solve their IT challenges as they address the changing dynamic needs of their industries and their customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results, discuss our balance sheet, including leverage and liquidity and conclude with our financial outlook and guidance for 2021. Looking at our financial results. For the full year, operating revenues grew to $606.8 million, a 6% year-over-year increase, including interconnection revenue of $84.1 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $324.5 million, an increase of 5.3% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.5%, consistent with the trailing 12 month average. FFO per share was $5.31, which represents 4.1% year-over-year growth. And we declared dividends of $4.89 per share, representing an increase of 2.7%. For the quarter, operating revenues were $154.9 million, which represents 6.1% growth year-over-year and consistent sequentially, including growth in interconnection revenue of 12.7% year-over-year, 3.8% sequentially. Customer lease renewals, equaling $15.8 million of annualized GAAP rent, which represents a cash rent mark-to-market of 1%, and we reported churn of 5.4%. Commencement of new and expansion leases of $20.4 million of annualized GAAP rent. Our revenue backlog as of December 31st consisted of $7.8 million of annualized GAAP rent or $21.4 million on a cash basis for leases signed but not yet commenced. We expect approximately 60% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the first quarter of 2021 and substantially all of the remaining GAAP backlog to commence in the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $82.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 4.7% year-over-year and 1.6% sequentially. Net income was $0.46 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.05 year-over-year and $0.04 sequentially. FFO per share was $1.34, an increase of $0.04 or 3.1% year-over-year and $0.01 or 0.8% sequentially. Moving to our balance sheet. Our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA was 5.2 times at year end, slightly lower-than-anticipated and inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 5.1 times. We ended the quarter with approximately $301 million of liquidity, providing us the ability to fully fund our 2021 business plan. In addition, we finished the year with 91% fixed rate debt. We expect our fixed rate debt percentage to decrease to approximately 80% by the end of 2021, absent any new debt or derivative instruments. I will now address our 2021 guidance. We ended the year at 81.9% occupancy in our data center portfolio and 40 megawatts of available capacity to sell. In addition, we have the ability to bring on consistent amounts of capacity through incremental computer rooms and infrastructure development within our existing data centers as needed and as anticipated absorption dictates. We reported elevated churn during 2020, slightly ahead of the high end of our guidance, with Q4 results slightly elevated due to a couple of customer move outs, accelerating their timing from Q1 2021. The following 2021 guidance is based on our outlook on current economic conditions, internal assumptions about our customer base and our view of supply and demand dynamics in our markets. It does not include the impact of any future financing, investment or disposition activities beyond what has already been disclosed. I will cover the highlights of our 2021 guidance, but I will refer you to our complete guidance on Page 22 of our fourth quarter supplemental information for further details. Operating revenue is estimated to be $642 million to $652 million, representing 6.6% year-over-year revenue growth at the midpoint. Our 2021 churn is estimated to be 6.5% to 8.5%, inclusive of the 200 basis points related to that specific Bay Area customer during the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect cash rent growth on data center renewals to be 0% to 2% growth for the year. Interconnection revenue is estimated to be $87 million to $93 million, representing 7% growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $336 million to $346 million, which implies a 52.7% adjusted EBITDA margin and 5.1% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. FFO per diluted share and operating unit is estimated to be $5.42 to $5.52, reflecting 3% growth at the midpoint. Based on our expectations and estimates related to leasing, net absorption and timing of commencements, we anticipate the year-over-year growth rates to accelerate in the second half of 2021 for revenue adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share. Lastly, capital expenditures are consistent with our original guidance provided in October and estimated to be $185 million to $225 million. In closing, we are pleased with our execution in 2020 and we look forward to the opportunities ahead to further help our customers solve their it needs and challenges as they accelerate their digital transformation. With that, operator, we would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. SamiBadri: First question for Paul, maybe for Steve, I want to talk about the elongated sales cycles. And we know we could see and draw the connection between elongated sales cycles and the effects of the pandemic. But are you starting to see changes or any kind of behavioral movements that are happening that can better explain what you think might happen in 2021 as far as how enterprises age, the outsourced data center industry from where we are today? PaulSzurek: I do think we're starting to see some movement and it's hard to generalize because it's idiosyncratic to so many customers and even some regions like, for example, I think in New York, in New Jersey, we would have had better performance if it were for the uncertainty about the proposed transaction tax and some other industries things were moving along and then suddenly some additional acquisitions were taking place. And so the opportunity had to be resized. But for a lot of the customers, it's just them working through what their economic future looks like. There are growth opportunities. For some, it's accelerated digital transformation. For others that's accelerated the process of outlining and planning for digital transformation, but not quite gotten to the point where they're ready to pull the trigger. I do think with 2021, started off a little bit -- it wasn't exactly like the calendar turned and everything turned rosy and there were some bumps nationally and economically in the first month or so. But there appears to be some strong economic optimism going forward. And I think that, that will have a positive impact on sales cycles. Steve, anything you'd add? SteveSmith: No, I think you covered it well, Paul. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, we feel like we're well positioned for the overall market trends, and that is really, any enterprise out there has become more interested in how they leverage technology to run their business. And the hybrid multi cloud environment is becoming more and more commonplace for a lot of enterprises. It is complex as to how they navigate that and we're working to try to make that as simple for them as possible, but that's part of what drives that elongated cycle. So it's all the things that Paul mentioned as well as just the overall complexity of how they manage that migration. So overall, I think customers are getting used to whatever the new normal is and working through those complications, but we feel like we're well positioned to support that. SamiBadri: I want to just shift to Jeff. Jeff, you talked about the backlog and the backlog commencement. I think if I heard you right, 1Q and 2Q 2021 should see the current backlog to commence. Now just to kind of triangulate the commencement schedule with the full year guidance. Does the full year guidance also called for relatively strong productivity in the sales force to bring in deals and do inter-quarter execution and deployment, or the full year guidance says very little on incremental execution and sales with productivity as we go through the year? JeffFinnin: Sami, yes, just to confirm, you heard correctly in regards to the commencement of the backlog. So again, 60% Q1, about 40% in Q2. And in terms of sales execution, I think is what you were gearing your question around. We would clearly believe that kind of, as Paul alluded to, that we would have good execution throughout the year. The only thing that I would add is we'll see some benefits from an expense perspective. If you just see the percentages we're guiding to, I think we'll see some decreases in our overall sales as a percentage of revenue during the year. I don't know if that's directly addressing your question, Sami or was there something else we could add? SamiBadri: Just if you think about how much incremental leasing that you guys imagine you need to make that guidance. Are you guys expecting meaningful incremental leasing activity to take place to make that guidance number, or are you relatively well rounded out as existing [Indiscernible] backlog? JeffFinnin: No, it's going to require some meaningful sales execution just as every year requires it. And I think when you look at where we ended the year this past year at just below $40 million, I think realistically, we would expect and anticipate somewhere being north of that $40 million as we think about this year, just to give you some idea. Obviously, I don't want to get into too many specifics because we don't generally guide to that. But that gives you some sense for what we're thinking about as we head into 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. JonathanAtkin: I was interested in the interconnect business, and if you don't mind drilling down a little bit on the drivers or pressures you're seeing in that segment. You've got a lot of different products that you offer. There's bilateral cross connects as well and then you've got the cloud operators and the on ramps and the carriers and the enterprises and then partners as well on the SDN side. And I just wondered, is there anything that kind of jumps out in terms of what's going particularly well, or where the growth rate might be slowing a little bit in that area? JeffFinnin: Let me give you a little bit of color, Jon, and then I'll ask Steve just to add any incremental color he sees obviously on the front lines. But when you look at 2020 and from a volume perspective, overall volume increases was about 7.7% for 2020. And as you saw on the revenue, overall revenue increases year-over-year was 11%. So those percentages are fairly consistent with generally what drives that revenue increases, which is about two thirds coming from volume increases, about another third of it coming from customers migrating from lower priced to higher-priced products and some price increases as customers roll or just general price increases. So that relationship has stayed fairly consistent in 2020. We saw really good growth in the fiber cross connects last year as well as our Open Cloud Exchange. And I think some of that may have been spawned on by the pandemic that we walked through and lived through in 2020. Obviously, when you look at our guide for this year, we're guiding to growth of about 7%. And so I think it's unclear at this point whether we're going to see that continued level of volume increases for 2021, it's something we're going to watch closely. But at this point, we think it will moderate slightly just given where we've guided the street to at this point in time. Steve, anything else? SteveSmith: I guess, I'd just add as far as trending and where we're seeing customer adoption and so forth. I mean, we're fortunate in that we were one of the -- in fact, I think, the first public data center provider to offer an OCX type of offering and Open Cloud Exchange, where it's basically an Ethernet backbone that allows customers to virtually connect to many different services on that backbone. We've made significant enhancements to that over the last several years. That's positioned us well for really where we see the trend going in the future, which is really kind of that end to end serviceability over SDN like network. So I think you'll continue to see more adoption of that and more services come available on that same platform, and that's part of what we're driving towards our product development. JonathanAtkin: And then secondly, on M&A and just noticed that there's a lot of activity kind of at the asset level in this sector, including in markets where you don't really have a presence. And I wonder to what extent -- if you can maybe just remind us of the sorts of things that you look at when you think about maybe entering a new kind of core data center, Internet gateway type market that you're not in because there were recently some opportunities. And I just wondered, are you looking to partner with people as you enter those markets? Is that entirely on balance sheet? Is it just not of interest, relative to maybe deploying capital where you already are? Maybe just kind of refresh us on your thinking there. PaulSzurek: We look at a lot of things, as we've said in the past, and our guidance is strategic fit, which really means what type of revenue synergies can we generate an above standard growth, if we do make the investment and then return on invested capital. Does it benefit our shareholders in the intermediate and long term, and hopefully, the short-term as well or does it not? We're not averse to partnering if that makes sense and the opportunity is there. But generally, that can be more complicated than it sounds at first glance. Again, we've looked at a lot of things. And when those criteria are met, we'll do something. When they're not, we won't. JonathanAtkin: And then lastly, is there any kind of an update on the Stender campus in Santa Clara, SV9 seems like that's ready to break ground, and there's been obviously some increased occupancy at SV8. And maybe just kind of give us some color on the demand pipeline that you think the market is seeing and what's happening with kind of overall absorption. There's been, I think, a lot of activity in that market away from you. And I wondered to what extent you might think Santa Clara might drive some of your growth this year? PaulSzurek: So I'll let Steve address supply and demand in that market. Although I will tell you, I feel good about it. SV9, as we said last quarter, we are targeting having our permits and everything by the end of the first quarter. So far, the processes are trending that way. But in that market, and Jon, you probably know the dynamics of permitting and power there as well as anybody. You can't really say it's done until it's done. So we still have a couple more things we've got to finish up. And hopefully, we'll get those finished up and have it shovel ready by the end of this quarter. SteveSmith: And I would just add, as far as the overall supply demand dynamics are concerned, we continue to see strong demand in the market. And so we're bullish on where we're heading with those investments, where we sit with our overall capacity and pipeline in that space. So overall, we're confident with where we sit today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg. NateCrossett: More of a big picture question. How are you guys thinking about the edge, is it a risk to your business at all? And have you guys done any analysis in terms of whether workloads that are currently in your campuses could move closer to the edge over time? PaulSzurek: We have. I don't think anyone can say right now that with certainty, they know exactly what's going to evolve. But our expectation is that there's minimal exposure for us of workloads that are currently in our data centers going to the edge exclusively. And there's probably a good opportunity for our data centers as core peering places in the central markets to benefit it through the increased products and services that are offered at the further edge through 5G, IoT, things like that, just because of -- the beautiful thing about data is that it works when there's a lot of it pooled together, and you'll see a lot of that necessary for those applications. So that's our high-level view of it. We continue to monitor it closely and evaluate potential product help in those areas and partners to work with. But at a high level, we think it will be ultimately beneficial. SteveSmith: And I guess the last thing I would just add there is the edge can be defined by a lot of different people in a lot of different ways. And we feel like we're well positioned in a lot of edge markets. I mean, if you look at the key metro areas that we're in, where there's a lot of eyeballs, a lot of enterprises that are in very low latency proximity to our data center campuses. In many definitions, that is edge because we're right next to where those eyeballs and enterprises locate. Nate Crossett : And then I just had one question on pricing. The renewal guidance is 0% to 2% and if you're looking forward, kind of the next four years, it looks like the lease expirations are at a higher rate than what you did in 2020. So I'm just kind of wondering, should we expect kind of pressure on pricing going forward? Can that 0% to 2% range, even go negative? JeffFinnin: Nate, I'll just offer a little bit there. Obviously, the pricing in full you're looking at is on a per square foot basis. And on the renewal pricing, when you look at what we did this year, the dollars per square foot were compressed largely due to the density inside those deployments. So the density really plays into the fact and when we're obviously competing and having those conversations with customers, pricing is going to be on a kilowatt basis. And so I wouldn't read too much into that on a per square foot basis. There's just a lot of variables, density being the largest in terms of what's going to ultimately resolve in that pricing. But obviously, as we head into 2021, you saw where we ended 2020 right about in the middle of our guidance for our mark to market at 0.8%, and we expect to be somewhere in between that 0% and 2% as we work our way through this year. And then obviously, we'll continue to watch it beyond that and give you additional color as needed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. JordanSadler: So I wanted to just follow-up on sort of the pipeline and Santa Clara. It felt previously like you guys were pretty constructive and optimistic about the ability to backfill the outbound tenant there. What are your sort of most current thoughts there? PaulSzurek: Jordan, current thoughts haven't changed. We're still optimistic about backfilling that space in SV7. JordanSadler: Is that kind of to do list for the front half of '21 or could that take longer? PaulSzurek: I mean, we typically don't give previews of when like something might be signed. But when it is signed, we'll announce it. JordanSadler: And then in terms of the churn, Jeff, you did talk about maybe pull forward from 1Q. Can you maybe talk about what the source, the types of tenants that you would drop the reacceleration of churn up to? And did they have anything to do with the decisions around what you're doing with the US colo space in LA1, LA4? JeffFinnin: As it relates to the churn in the fourth quarter, we had about 60 to 70 basis points incremental churn in the fourth quarter that really moved essentially from January of '21 when we anticipated up to December here in the fourth quarter of this last year. So not a real big economic impact. It really is just a shift in the timing. Again, that was about 60 to 70 basis points. And it was really with three customers, one of them happened to be in probably the largest percentage. It was just another reseller that was in our portfolio that we had anticipated to move out and did it roughly 30 days prior to when we anticipated. And so hopefully, that gives you some additional color. And then what was the second half of the question, Jordan? PaulSzurek: Whether LA4\u2026 Jeff Finnin : No, it's as it relates to LA4, I appreciate you picking up on that in some of the disclosures there. Obviously, that LA4 is a location that's in close proximity to LA1 and LA2 and LA3. And obviously, our objective is to drive business into our owned assets and there's just much better longer term, better assets to drive business to. And we're currently in process migrating over all those businesses that we can from LA4 into LA2. And so we've already done some of that. And our team in LA is working on getting the lion's share of that completed here this year. But that churn that I commented earlier had nothing to do with LA4. At this point, that's still in process and we'll work through that in 2021. JordanSadler: And then as you look through to the 2021 guide on churn, I noticed that came down 50 basis points or so at the midpoint, 100 at the low end, I assume due to this pull forward. Is there anything else to potentially be worried about, and what are you guys doing to sort of get your arms around this guide? JeffFinnin: Well, as you think about it, obviously, as we've pointed out, we've got about 200 of that coming from the single customer at SV7, that will occur in the second half of this year. And in terms of what are we doing to get our arms around it, I can tell you that between my team and Steve's team, it's something that we address on a weekly basis, trying to continue to look as far forward as we can, both through conversations and relationships we're having as well as looking at incremental data around each of those deployments to better understand ultimately what that information is telling us on customer behavior to help give us a point on which direction those are ultimately going to go. And from a customer service perspective, it's always been a very high part of our business, and I would say we're continuing to even elevate it to a higher level under the guide of our operations team, and it's something we're continuing to get out in front of. We want to make sure we retain those customers every time we can and when it makes sense. And hopefully, avoid any of the surprises like we had in the past. But based on where we sit today and what we know today, we think that 6.5% to 8.5% for 2021 is a good number and is in right in line with what we anticipated. PaulSzurek: Jordan, the only thing I'd add to what Jeff said is that the categories of customers that drove churn over the last couple of years are now a very, very small percentage of our portfolio, and those are business models that have been especially disrupted by cloud. JordanSadler: Yes, I mean the reason I ask, obviously, this has been a little bit of a sort of a thorn on your side. I think the churn number over the past couple of years, and you've got 29% of your annual rent expiring in '21, and 1,277 different leases a lot. And so I kind of -- I guess it doesn't seem outside of the one known move out, the larger move out, you have a ton of wiggle room in the 7.5%, because that's the nonmove out, you're basically looking at, I don't know, 1.25% churn on a normalized basis. So outside of the nonmove out, that seems like a low number relative to at least the last four quarters. And I don't know why it would be particularly low next year or this year? PaulSzurek: I mean, we've had numbers that low or even lower in prior years. And again, it relates to the cyclicality of some of these business models or actually, I should say, the secular changes that affect some of these business models. Again, that's our guidance. We wouldn't put it out there if we didn't feel that it was the right range to put out there. SteveSmith: And the other thing, I guess, I would just add is roughly 30% of our base renewing in the year is not a normal. It's very typical for us actually. And if you look at the average length of our leases of roughly three to four years, that's what you can expect, I think. JordanSadler: No, and I appreciate that. I didn't mean to insinuate that it was sort of outside of the ordinary. I just feel like it's a big number and maybe the churn number of 5.5 outside of the nonmove out was a little bit low relative to history. Is that unfair? PaulSzurek: Well, I mean, it depends on which history. And as I said, we certainly have numbers that low in previous years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. DaveRodgers: I think Jordan hit the renewal side of the equation. Maybe I wanted to go back to the idea of sales cycle elongated. But Jeff, in your comments, you also said you expect leasing to accelerate. So maybe I'd ask you, Steve, to talk more about what's in the funnel. Last year, you guys were pretty positive about the funnel as well. Can you talk about lease touring activity, any of those kind of early indicators that are going to give us that confidence that we'll see this acceleration in leasing this year that's behind the themes that you have already mentioned? SteveSmith: Well, I think it starts with kind of the fundamentals of our platform really, as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks around available capacity. And it's not just the amount of capacity, it's the fact that we have it consistently across really all of our top markets. So historically, we've had some capacity, but it's really been in a couple of markets and to make sure that we're really accelerating were in that specific market. So now we have more opportunity, I think, across the portfolio to have better sales. And then as I look at the pipeline, the pipeline has been consistently strong, heading into the pandemic, but holding that strength and continuing even through the end of the year. So it's hard to foretell exactly what that pipeline will result in. Jeff has mentioned our guidance already. So I think I'll let that speak for itself. But we feel like between the volume of the pipeline, customers getting more, I think familiar, as I mentioned earlier with how they make these business decisions and navigate the complexities of hybrid multi cloud that the combination of all those things bodes well for the overall sales forecast for the year. DaveRodgers: Is there any evidence in there that you're losing more customers or winning more of those deals that you're pursuing? It sounds like the funnel is bigger, which is great. But some of those win versus loss metrics that you might track? SteveSmith: We track the win loss ratios very closely and try to manage beneath the numbers to find out where we can improve on that. There's a balance between, in some cases, winning too many versus obviously losing too many. If you're winning too many then maybe you're giving away pricing or doing something wrong. But we try to make sure we are targeting, first of all, the right customers to value our platform and then ensure that we are getting the most return for our shareholders at the same time, providing valuable service to our customers. So it's that balance of all three of those things that we're working towards. And overall, I would say that the sales team has gotten better and better over time as they've now got better in their skill set, but we've continued to try to, as I call it, deepen the moat on our competitiveness and what makes us unique compared to our peers out there. So I think that all adds up into us being more competitive and being able to win the right opportunities that truly do value our ecosystem. I don't know if that answers your question, but I guess the short answer is yes. DaveRodgers: Jeff, maybe on you. I think 12 of your leases make up is 26% of the revenues and 15% of square feet, that's kind of what you call that hyperscale. As we look out, either this year as part of the larger expirations or into the next year or two, do we see any of those at risk or any of those expiring? JeffFinnin: Yes. Obviously, it's a big percentage from a square foot perspective as you look at the number of leases there being the 12, as you pointed out. And as I sit here today, I don't think there's a significant risk given where they are on each of those. And it's just something we're going to have to watch closely as we work our way through the year. Obviously, one of those is included in our churn guidance for this year. So take that one out of the equation, the remaining 11 are the ones that I would refer to. And obviously, something that we'll continue to watch closely. I think we've always had a history of any time we see something on the horizon that is sizable like one of those, we'll try and give you guys some heads up on that if and when that becomes clearer. But at this point in time, we don't see anything that we need to raise at this point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen. ColbySynesael: As it relates to SV7, do you feel that you can backfill that with just one or two customers, or is your current expectation to use that space more for retail deployments? And then as part of that, what have you actually assumed in your guidance as it relates to the potential backfill opportunity with SV7? In other words, does guidance assume zero revenue from that through the course of the year? Have you assumed that maybe by the midpoint of the year, you backfilled it? Just any color so we can get a sense of what the baseline assumption is in the guidance would be helpful. And then my second question has to do with margins. Margins are expected to be down about 80 basis points year-over-year 2021 versus 2020. Can you just give us a little bit of color of what's the primary driver of that and whether or not that might start to reverse as we move to the back half of this year and then into next year? Thank you. PaulSzurek: Our current plan is to backfill SV7 with one or two customers, and Jeff can confirm. But I believe there is some revenue from that in the guidance, but I know we don't give specifics about individual leases, and Jeff can confirm this as well. But margins are simply -- the good news is we got 40 megawatts of capacity that we can lease. But that has a margin impact, because with baking capacity, you're still paying all the expenses but without offsetting revenue. So there is definitely an opportunity to expand margins as we lease up that 40 megawatts. JeffFinnin: Colby, just to confirm, Paul has confirmed, we do have some level of revenue associated with SV7 in our guidance. And I would point you to it, it's probably in the back half of this year versus the first half. And then in terms of those margins, we do have some drag, especially here in the first half as we go through the lease-up of, for instance, CH2 where we're obviously incurring those expenses and not only operating expenses, but the additional property tax insurance expenses associated with bringing those on. And until we get those two, call it, roughly 35% lease is probably about the breakeven point for us. There's going to be some drag as we work through the bottom level of that J curve. And so we would expect those to improve over time as that asset and others lease up. PaulSzurek: It gives us an opportunity to accelerate our growth rate in the back half of the year if we're successful with our sales. ColbySynesael: Would the margins also then subsequently go up in the back half of the year? PaulSzurek: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citigroup. MichaelRollins: So just to follow-on that. Are those extra carrying expenses partly in the G&A line? Because I noticed in the guidance that the growth, I believe, of G&A was like 11%, I think at the midpoint. And just separately, different topic on the balance sheet, was curious if you could just provide a little bit more color of what the guidance infers for net debt leverage over the course of the year? Are you still trying to get below 5 times leverage net debt to EBITDA over time and over what time frame do you see that happening? Thanks. JeffFinnin: Mike, in terms of the carry cost that are impacting those margins, most of those carry costs are going to be up in our operating expenses line item, that's where our data center teams get aggregated in terms of the expense recognition. In terms of the G&A growth of 11%, basically, most of that is being driven by some noncash compensation increases. And then some of that's being driven by expected increases in our travel and entertainment, as we expect to get back to, I guess, some normal sense of the level of whatever that looks like in 2021. And just to give you some sense, we anticipate the first quarter to continue to be at some very low levels of travel. But as we work our way through the year, anticipating some of that to start coming back and being introduced into the business, and we'll just see how things perform is and whether or not things open up to that extent. But that gives you some idea of what's driving the G&A. In terms of leverage, we finished the year at 5.2 times. And if you think about 2021, based on our anticipated capital needs and the timing of that capital deployment, I would imagine we would oscillate somewhere between 5.2 and 5.4 times during 2021, as we work our way through the year. And so obviously, a topic we always talk with our Board about and us here at the management team as well as our Board, we're comfortable continuing to let that reside in those levels here in the near term. So that's kind of what we expect for 2021. MichaelRollins: If you wrap these kind of two questions together on the margin front with the balance sheet front, and you're looking at the FFO per share growth rate that's been below revenue for the last couple of years. When does that reverse in total? When you take into account what you're trying to do with the balance sheet with the operating business? When can FFO per share show the underlying operating and financial leverage that's typically built into the data center business model? PaulSzurek: I may be wrong about this, and Jeff can correct me. But I think because of the capital intensity of the data center business and you either have to issue shares or stock, that once you get to a certain level of maturity and occupancy, you're always going to see lower FFO per share growth, then you see an FFO growth, then you see revenue growth, because you've got to cover the cost of financing the capital expansion. We've certainly seen that as we've looked across the industry generally. But I do think, I mean, getting back to your point, Mike, it's a good one. And I'd circle back to the 40 megawatts versus 23 megawatts. We've just got more occupancy that we have the opportunity to fulfill. As we do that will have a positive impact on our margins and our growth rate and our flow through to FFO. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. NickDelDeo: First, just a follow-up on that leverage question. It sounds like you expect the leverage ratio to kind of remain in the same zone as it is today over the course of 2021. Now as we look out a little further and kind of bake in the potential cost of SV9, is there any potential for equity issuances or do you feel comfortable that, that would not be required? JeffFinnin: Nick, obviously, in 2021, it's not currently in our business plan just based upon capital needs and where our leverage is. Obviously, beyond that, it remains to be seen. But as Paul alluded to, we sit at 81.9% occupancy here at year end. And as we work to drive that north, call it, to somewhere in the mid to upper 80%, that EBITDA growth can drive not only a lot of value inside this organization but obviously, will help us with that leverage. And then as we continue to look out in terms of when we're going to need capital, whether it's for SV9 or some incremental computer rooms. But near term, most of our capital is going to be directed towards those second and third phases of some of the new builds we've just completed and the EBITDA growth relative to capital deployed in those scenarios are much, much higher EBITDA growth, resulting just because of the low levels of capital needed to bring that capacity to the market, since we've spent roughly 50% of it already. So I think that's where we are in the cycle. And we'll continue to disclose what we can as we get closer to the need for bringing on more capacity. So that's kind of how we're viewing things near term. NickDelDeo: And then maybe one more on Northern Virginia. I think you guys mentioned that leasing in that market was the best since -- I believe you said 2015. Can you comment on how you feel about the sustainability of that performance and how the return attributes of the deals you've been signing there have been trending since that's something you've noted has presented some challenges in the past? SteveSmith: Nick, yes, we're pleased with how 2020 ended up in Virginia. We had some strong leasing there. And if you look at the leasing, none of it is hyperscale. It's all retail and scale leasing, which is really the core of our business and where we've been focused over time. So really to execute well against that core piece of the business is great to see, given that that market is very much measured and oftentimes by hyperscale leasing. So we still have the ability to take down some of those larger leases if they fit the profile that we've discussed earlier, as far as those that add to the ecosystem and value the ecosystem. But overall, it seems like that market is stabilizing and we feel like we're in a good position to continue to execute on that retail scale, but also well positioned for the right types of larger leases that may come along. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. TimLong: Two, if I could. First one is a quick one. Just talk a little bit about the maintenance CapEx. It looks like it's spiking next year. Is that just some catch up or is there something else going on there? And then second, I just want to touch again on the connectivity focus. You mentioned a lot of initiatives that you guys have gone through. Could you just let us know kind of what other type of areas are there opportunities for CoreSite to expand those offerings? And in the areas where you have invested in better connectivity, what has that meant for you as far as churns, or churn, or win rates, or pricing, or anything -- any color you can give us on the benefits of that, that would be great. Thank you. JeffFinnin: Tim, let me just address the question on the maintenance CapEx, first of all. Yes, we are anticipating elevated maintenance CapEx for 2021. And what's really driving that inside the data center business is we're replacing a chiller facility in Boston that has hit the end of life. And so we're replacing and then enhancing that to handle the entire facility there, which should drive us some very good savings as we bring that on. And that will all occur here in the first half of 2021. Secondly, I just want to point out, there is some additional recurring CapEx that we've anticipated in our office business. Not something we talk about often here at CoreSite, but we have signed an office lease at SV1 in Downtown San Jose, which we are going to spend some dollars to bring that space up to what's needed before that tenant commences its lease here in the first half of 2021 as well. Steve? SteveSmith: As far as the connectivity solutions are concerned, Paul mentioned a little bit about this in his opening remarks as to some of the, I think, milestones that we've made during 2020 in attracting additional cloud providers, some of the enhancements to our peering exchange, higher speeds that we're able to accommodate customers, for example, on AWS Direct Connect in Chicago. Those are just some examples of what we've done already but I mean, as you mentioned, your question around win rates or churn and those kind of things. Last year, we announced that we implemented our Inter-Site Connectivity, which really connects all of our markets together. And we've seen some strong uptake from that, in some cases where we won opportunities because we had that service. So we continue to look at those types of services and how we can continue to enhance the OCX, for example, to provide more end to end provisioning of customers and the trade-offs of demand versus the cost to enhance some of those features. Those type of things, I think, are continuing to be top of mind for us and our customers. We announced earlier this year that we rolled out our DCI visibility to give customers visibility on as to what's going on in their environment over the portal, and that's been very well received. So it's all of those kind of things. It's really kind of easing the path for customers to become customers and making that interoperability a lot more seamless for them. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. AriKlein: And maybe just going back to the churn and [indiscernible], it seems like if we adjust for some of the moving parts this year, it will be somewhere in the range of 5% to 7%. Is that kind of the right way to think about it moving forward beyond this year as far as churn? JeffFinnin: Ari, I think as you look at several of the years, since we basically come public in 2010, I mean, you saw churn ranging from, I think, one year, we were down at 5.5% and then, obviously, this year would have been high at 11.6%. But when you look at and take away some of the highs and lows, on average, we were somewhere right around 7.5% to 8% on a regular basis. And so that's the way I'd probably think of it, somewhere around 1% to 2% per quarter is really what we would classify as fairly typical for us. As you think about 2021, to give you some sense for where we see that, I would anticipate our churn being somewhere between 1% and 1.5% in each of the first and second quarters, and then it would be a little bit elevated in the back half, probably 2% to 2.5% in the back half of the year, as we have the one customer moving out and some in September and some in October. Just to give you some sense for how we think the year will shape up for 2021. AriKlein: And then maybe just on the capacity front, you seem to be in a much better position today than you were maybe last year. But how are you thinking about the need, or how much capacity kind of do you want to have on hand moving forward? A lot of it will obviously be dictated by the leasing that's done, but is there a right amount of capacity that you consistently want to have on hand and available? PaulSzurek: It's a good question, Ari. I think it's more looked at by market but I would say we're a little bit over what we would ideally want right now. And primarily, that's because we haven't been as successful out of the gate with CH2 as we would have liked to. We've gone into the reasons for that in the past. But we're still very happy with that asset and we think it's going to perform well, and it has a good enterprise pipeline. But so far it's been a little bit slower than we expected. Ideally, we'd lease up at a faster pace this year. And I think somewhere in the 25 to 30 megawatts of capacity plus the ability to expand in existing data centers with new computer rooms and ready to develop land so that we have the optionality to expand capacity, that's probably the right way to think about the business model for our current size. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Choe with JP Morgan. RichardChoe: A lot of the business last year came from existing customers. For guidance this year, are you still expecting most of the business to come from existing, or is that mix going to change a little bit and how should we think about it going through the year? SteveSmith: As we mentioned on the call, I think we had 89% come from existing customers in the last Q. And that's not unnatural for us, I mean, which is really part of the reason why there's such a focus for me and my team on driving new logos, because as we win those new logos and they come in, the likelihood of them landing and expanding becomes much greater. So not relying on just the base to continue to expand over and over and over again. So the ratios are probably fairly consistent, although, we look to try to overweight more in that new logo category. But as you look over time, I think anywhere from 70% to 90% in expansion is not uncommon. RichardChoe: And then in terms of the small scale and retail, is there any difference on how quickly those signings turn to revenue, or are they both about the same time frame? SteveSmith: I would say they're both pretty similar, as you get to the higher end of the scale, those can be a bit more complex in private cages that take a little bit more time to deploy. But they're all relatively in the same time period. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. FrankLouthan: I wanted to circle back again on the sales cycle a little bit. Can you give us a little more insight here. Is it a function of customers and how they're reacting broadly, or do you think it's something more specific to how you're trying to sell them? Are you trying to engage with larger initial deals, or workloads, or applications that are generally taking longer than the traditional mix that you've had with enterprise customers? Or is it just something about the market in general, are you seeing the sales cycles lengthen? SteveSmith: I'll just start, I guess, with the simple answer of yes. It's all of that. I will tell you that we are trying to get into sales cycles earlier, which is part of the reason they become protractive because we're in earlier. So therefore, we're in them longer. But they're also more complex, as I mentioned earlier. So as we look to really try to communicate our overall value and messaging to the marketplace around not just the nuts and bolts of the data center but the value that they can extract from the data center and the ecosystem that is embedded within it, that will hopefully allow us to position ourselves better with those enterprises earlier that may actually elongate those sales cycles as we've seen but hopefully, better position us for more opportunities and give us a better position at the table as they make those decisions. FrankLouthan: I mean had you identified where maybe you were missing out on this in the past, and at what point does this sort of normalize and result in maybe higher growth going forward? SteveSmith: Well, I think it continues to normalize. I mean, it's hard to know what normal is in today's environment. But I think the process, as I mentioned earlier, has become more normalized. It's still a long process. And frankly, we still have more work to do with our sales team to get better and better at this and get better at our messaging. And as I mentioned earlier, try to deepen our moat on our value. So I don't think it's a static thing that we ever say mission accomplished. It's always trying to get better at trying to get in more deals and work them more efficiently. So it's hard to say that you can expect the status quo going forward because I don't think there ever will be in the high tech sector. PaulSzurek: I would only add that some of our most valuable customers that Steve and his team have brought in and added, which have these some of the longer sales cycles are the ones who are going to come in, and they're going to use multiple clouds, multiple networks, probably some of the cloud adjacent storage and other cloud adjacent utilities and they're moving typically out of a traditional kind of on premises environment. So there's just a lot more moving parts for them and a lot more work with solution partners and our solution architects to make sure we get their initial deployment and setup right, so that they can have the ability to expand and add new features as they grow into their hybrid multi cloud architecture. FrankLouthan: And have you seen any incremental activity or interest from any of the Chinese hyperscalers since November? SteveSmith: Nothing that's abnormal, I would say, pretty consistent. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Guarino with Green Street. DavidGuarino: I noticed CoreSite stopped providing property level disclosure, and they now show market level disclosure in the supplemental. Can you just talk about why the company thinks providing investors with less disclosures is fine in the portfolio? Is it the best way to communicate the story? JeffFinnin: Every year we go through a process of looking at the information we disclose and how it's being received and how it's being utilized. And we're always looking for ways to enhance the message by giving good and many times more transparency in certain situations like this one. We felt summarizing the information just felt and gave, and tried to simplify the message. We did the same thing in our debt disclosure table. But the debt, you can go to our 10-K and get all the nitty gritty details that you need. And as Steve pointed out, adding some additional disclosures around how we're managing the business from a sales perspective, we think helps with transparency and aligns it much better. So we're always looking for ways to improve upon it. Specific to your question, trying to simplify it, David. And if there's something in there that's meaningful and is causing some real issues, let me know what it is, and we'll see if we can help you out. DavidGuarino: Okay, that's great. And maybe we can talk offline about that. And just a second question on the Chicago market, we didn't touch a lot on that, but still limited activity there again this quarter. But it looks like there were two pretty large leases signed by some private data center operators during Q4. So could you maybe give us an idea, I guess, of how you view the supply and demand dynamics in that market and then just kind of your expectations surrounding when that space might be leased in CH2? PaulSzurek: So we're positive on the market. It was in 2020, much more almost entirely a hyperscaler market. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, both of those two leases you mentioned were with one hyperscale customer. But it's traditionally been a very strong enterprise market. We actually had good leasing in that market. Our leasing in Chicago was our best since 2016. It was 19% ahead of 2019 levels. We brought our occupancy in CH1 up from 81% to 87%. And we have a good funnel of enterprises with larger scale requirements that hopefully will start bearing fruit this year in 2021. Steve, anything you'd add? SteveSmith: No, just minor correction. It was 13% over 2019, but in the ballpark, to be accurate. But yes, it was a good year. We'd like to do more. I mean, I would like to see more. We've got a beautiful building there that now we can extend all the value that we've had, our 427 LaSalle location and we're optimistic about the opportunity there. But as Paul mentioned, we did have good leasing and we expect that to accelerate as we go into 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho Securities. OmotayoOkusanya: In your earlier comments, you discussed the proposed New Jersey tax on financial service transactions kind of causing some delay or some uncertainty in the New Jersey, New York market. Could you talk a little bit about, one, what the latest is with that proposed tax? And then two, if you've seen any other kind of major markets thinking of doing something like that as all these municipalities are all trying to shore up their revenues post the pandemic? PaulSzurek: So we don't have any real updated information. It almost seems like there's a little bit of pause. The proposal has been reduced but hasn't gone away completely and who knows it may be tied to bigger fiscal things going on relative to Washington and the COVID Relief/Stimulus Bill, but honestly I don't have very good tea leaves into the political situation tale. So I can't really address that. We haven't seen anything similar in other markets. I recall vaguely three, four years ago, Chicago floated something like that. And then when they saw what the impact would be on business in their state and their community, they shut it down. So I mean, I think all these municipalities are focused on the fact that, that business and that activity is portable to other jurisdictions. And so they have to make a judgment as to whether they're cutting off the nose to spite their face, if they implement a tax like that. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Michael Funk with Bank of America. MichaelFunk: Quickly, circling back interconnection of your comments earlier, hoping you can pull apart on what's in your guidance for 2021. You mentioned that a number of moving pieces there, volume growth helped in 2020, migration to higher capacity, price increases. So does your '21 guidance, does that assume lower volume growth, lower level of migration, pruning by customers or less ability to increase pricing? JeffFinnin: Michael, in terms of 2021 guidance, as I mentioned earlier, our overall volume increases in 2020 were 7.7%. We actually expect volume increases for 2021 to be around 7%, which is right in line with where our revenue growth is guided to at this point in time. So what we're not certain of and haven't baked into the guidance is how much incremental revenue growth we would receive from customers as they're rolling over on their new lease terms or any migration to those higher priced products. We saw a lot of that activity in 2020 and at this point, have expected that to be fairly muted for 2021. And we'll just see how that rolls out as we go through the year. MichaelFunk: And then one more, if I could, on capital allocation. You slowed the dividend growth recently. You gave a target for leverage for 2021. What does it take to get back to the historic level of dividend growth? JeffFinnin: Well, I would simply say we continue to target that AFFO payout ratio of somewhere around 90%, 92%. And you can see we're just a little bit higher than that currently over the last trailing 12 months. But I don't anticipate that payout ratio increasing, that's the level we're comfortable with at this point in time. And so dividend increases are going to be very highly correlated to cash flow growth. So I would say look closely at the AFFO growth and that's really going to give you a better indication on what that dividend growth is going to look like longer term. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Paul Szurek for any closing comments. Paul Szurek : Thank you. Thank you all for your interest and your time and learning more about CoreSite today. I'll tell you I learned many good things about our team during the challenges of 2021. My colleagues have an increased appreciation for how conscientious, agile and innovative they are, not only to make the adjustments necessary to succeed in 2020, but to continue to build a better platform for how we go forward. They make me very optimistic that we can perform well with our strong business model and the abundant capacity that we have coming into this year. So I look forward to 2021 and hope you all have a great rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. If you\u2019d like to ask a question, please press 110. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Igor Khislavsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Igor Khislavsky : Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We\u2019ve posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning\u2019s call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO will provide a strategic update on our U.S. business, and then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer will discuss our Q1 2021 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I\u2019ll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2021 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance, our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19, our expectations regarding the impacts of the AGR decision in India, our expectations regarding our pending Telxius acquisition, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning\u2019s earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thanks Igor. Good morning everyone. As is typical in our first quarter call, the focus of my comments today will be on our foundational U.S. business, which represented nearly 58% of our total property revenue and more than two thirds of our consolidated property segment operating profit in Q1 while accounting for about three quarters of our $60 billion in contractually committed revenue. The overall NOI yield of our U.S. property segment now stands at 11.5% [indiscernible] the portfolio for at least 10 years, generating more than 20%. These metrics reflect our long track record of driving strong, profitable, recurring cash flow growth in the U.S., and we remain confident in our ability to extend that track record long into the future. This confidence is inspired not only by the exceptional visibility we have into our long-term organic growth rate through our existing comprehensive master lease agreement, but also due to a number of favorable industry trends that we expect to drive our business forward. These trends in large part center on our customers\u2019 5G network deployments, which we expect to meaningfully accelerate over the next several years giving rise to a more developed 5G world. On the demand side of the equation, mobile data usage growth shows no signs of slowing. The average smartphone user in the U.S. is currently consuming more than 15 gigabits per month and is expected to be using more than 50 gigabits on a monthly basis by 2026, reflecting a CAGR of nearly 30%. The proliferation of value-added streaming services, mobile video conferencing, and other content-rich bandwidth intensive applications continues to stress existing 4G wireless networks, creating the need for more material additional network capital investments, and emerging AR and VR applications and other next gen capabilities are contributing virtually nothing to mobile data usage today given the limited coverage and low 5G device penetration, but we don\u2019t think that will be the case for long. The 5G network revolution is under way and it\u2019s quite possible, perhaps even likely the current growth projections for U.S. mobile data usage will prove to be conservative, much like what we\u2019ve seen in the past. The development of 5G-related, low-latency applications and services, additional growth from enterprise accounts, and even fixed wireless applications in the home could all drive usage much higher over time. We expect that the increased availability of spectrum in the marketplace, particularly on the midband side, will help enable this usage growth going forward. Spectrum has always been the lifeblood of the wireless industry, and given the capacity necessary to provide users a true 5G experience, it is more important today than ever before. Particularly significant in our view are midband spectrum assets like 2.5 Gig and the newly acquired C-band frequencies as they provide our customers with a crucial middle ground between the attractive propagation characteristics of low band spectrum and the deep capacity characteristics of higher band. We believe the results of the most recently completed C-band auction underscore the importance of this spectrum to our customers as they look to monetize the benefits of 5G. Importantly, as the carriers emphasized in their public comments after the auction, we expect this spectrum to be deployed quickly. The wireless industry is in a strong financial position and numerous steps have been taken by the carriers to not only fund the upfront purchase price of the spectrum but also to effectively deploy it. In fact, we are already seeing sizeable increases in activity in our own services segment, and consistent with our long-term outlook expectations, we expect to see higher levels of gross new business in our property segment beginning later this year, particularly in \u201922 and beyond. Part of this uptick in activity is in rural areas as stimulus funds from the government support smaller companies to effectively deploy wireless internet services, and as the major operators continue to fill in the white spaces in their network. The deployment of fixed wireless for households around the country using midband spectrum, as our customers are planning, could also provide further opportunities for us going forward. Taking all of these factors into account, we believe we have a highly attractive, long-term monetization opportunity in front of us as the carriers further densify their networks and add more equipment to existing lease sites to support their incremental capacity needs. A significant portion of this growth is locked into our existing contractual relationships. Other components of the growth may be more variable. Either way, we expect to see higher levels of activity in the marketplace accompanied by increasing wireless capex spend. On this point, analysts are projecting more than $35 billion in average annual capital spending from our customers over the next several years, which would represent industry record. With that in perspective, that average annual rate is more than double what the carriers spent back when 2G was actually deployed. While each of our customers have slightly different strategies to deploy 5G, we are confident that they will be successful in doing so. We also believe that our macro tower oriented U.S. portfolio of over 43,000 sites is optimally positioned to benefit from these accelerating deployments. Macro sites continue to be by far the most cost effective RF-efficient network engineering option and are also optimally located to help deliver coverage and capacity for hundreds of millions of people nationwide. As a result, we continue to believe that the vast majority of midband deployments in the U.S. for the foreseeable future will be on macro towers, and as our network infrastructure was ideally suited for our customers\u2019 needs for 2G, 3G, and 4G, and we have no reason to believe that 5G will be any different. What we do expect to be unique to 5G is the added use of massive MIMO technology for midband spectrum deployments on our macro towers, which should provide operators with more dynamic coverage and capacity capabilities. The race to nationwide 5G with the use of massive MIMO will require more fiber connections to antennas, increased DC power, and enough capacity to accommodate the size and weight of these more intelligent RF solutions. To prepare for these requirements, we have been proactively investing in more efficient and scalable power solutions at many of our sites. We\u2019ve also upgraded the capacity of many of our tower structures over the last decade, installed energy efficient LED lighting on many sites, and invested in site hardening initiatives where appropriate. Simply put, we stand ready to service our customers as they accelerate their 5G deployments. Importantly, macro sites may even be more critical today given the incremental density networks will require to support a 5G architecture, and because only one of our existing tenants is on more than half of our sites today, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive incremental lease-up at and capacity utilization as densification initiatives ramp up. As has been our experience, we would expect that roughly $0.90 of every dollar we generate from this organic leasing activity will flow straight to the bottom line. As a result, we expect to continue to drive strong operating leverage in the business along with modest capital intensity, reflecting two of the hallmarks of our last several decades [indiscernible]. Additionally, we expect to continue to generate strong operating profit margins, including more than 78% in 2021. All of these factors contribute to our confidence in our ability to drive average annual U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth of at least 5% in 2027, normalized for the sprint churn impact, and at least 6% from \u201923 to \u201927 specifically calculated on the same basis. Importantly, more than two-thirds of this growth is now contractually locked in, given the signing of our MLA with Dish in the first quarter. Embedded with these expectations is the assumption that our portfolio of wireless towers will be our fastest growing asset, as has been the case over the last five years, and our organic tenant billings growth was an average of roughly 40 basis points higher than our overall U.S. metrics. This resilient trend, in our view, was another point of validation that macro tower will continue to be the focal point of modern wireless networks, generating the best economics across the telecommunications real estate universe. Going forward, we expect these economics to get even better. Margins will benefit from densification driven leasing activity and continued amendments, while costs will remain largely fixed and capital intensity should continue to be low. Existing leases will escalate at historical rates of at least 3% and normal course churn should be quite modest, likely trending down over time particularly once we work through the Sprint cancellations over the next few years. We intend to remain laser focused on maximizing our sustainable cash flow growth from these fundamental 5G drivers.  We also believe that the economics of our U.S. business and specifically of our macro tower sites can be further enhanced through the implementation of collective platform expansion initiatives. Chief among them is edge compute, which is starting to come into clear view as true 5G becomes a reality for consumers, and perhaps even more importantly for the enterprise segment. We expect the key drivers of demand for edge compute solutions to be the emerging need for incremental Cloud-RAN locations and lower latency applications processing in a 5G environment. As more and more data processing evolves to the network edge to support those needs, we anticipate that new micro edge data center architecture will be necessary to complement the existing regional framework. Select locations within our nationwide macro tower asset base, which by definition are at the mobile network edge, are positioned to play a meaningful role in this evolution. The underlying thesis supporting this belief is the concept that, as it has been for the last two decades in the deployment of wireless networks, shared neutral host infrastructure will be the most cost effective and efficient way to rapidly deploy cloud-native 5G applications at scale. Given that our attractively located tower sites have existing access to fiber and power while already hosting multiple communications providers, they are a natural candidate to represent hub locations for these low latency wireless edge data centers.  Scale deployment of a true mobile edge remains several years away, but in our view the TAM could be quite significant, running well into the billions of dollars annually. In the meantime, we have some half dozen ongoing small scale distributed commute trials at our tower sites, creating a beachhead to larger scale true mobile edge deployments. Additionally, our Colo Atl facility continues to outperform our expectations and we are having meaningful conversations with a number of key stakeholders across the data center and cloud sectors regarding the optimal requirements for the 5G edge. As we\u2019ve noted previously, we intend to explore global joint ventures or partnerships to effectively leverage these inherent opportunities, and we continue to work through a number of different scenarios on that front. The early data points we are seeing throughout the industry all suggest that this can be a meaningful, scalable opportunity that can represent solid upside for us in due time, and we are devoting resources internally to ensure that we are in a position to be opportunistic and agile. In the context of the long term outlook we discussed last quarter, we believe that mobile edge compute could eventually represent meaningful potential upside. Having said that, we are going to remain disciplined from a capital deployment perspective, as you would expect. Recurring revenue, strong long term growth prospects, healthy ROIC and an attractive margin profile are all prerequisites for us to deploy meaningful capital anywhere, and that includes our efforts on the platform expansion side. Our preliminary assessments indicate that the edge opportunity fits nicely into our framework, but we will need to prove out this thesis going forward.  Taking into account the strong underlying baseline growth path we have in the U.S. for the next decade, we are in a position to be thoughtful, deliberate and strategic with these types of initiatives. Additionally, while we are laser focused on driving incremental value in the U.S., we expect to have attractive opportunities to deploy capital internationally where high quality, scaled macro tower portfolios are likely to come to market, and while my comments today are focused on our U.S. operation and marketplace, the exact same approach can be duplicated globally. Whether it\u2019s growth, platform expansion opportunities, or margin expansion, the messages globally are identical. With our roughly 220,000 sites pro forma for the Telxius acquisition, we have an unmatched presence in some of the fastest growing wireless broadband markets - period, and we can offer to a number of different parties a one-stop capability that is second to none. While we would expect to expand the depth of this presence over time so as not to be complacent, we believe that it already gives us a significant competitive advantage As we have always done on a global basis, we will be seeking to maximize long term growth in AFFO per share while maintaining attractive returns on invested capital. We also continue to invest in our people, our systems and processes and remain focused on numerous ESG initiatives while dedicating ourselves to ensuring a diverse and inclusive culture throughout the company. To summarize, I want to reiterate our excitement about the U.S. market. We are in the very early stages of a transformation period in U.S. wireless technology, one that has the potential to fundamentally alter how we live, work and play while opening up tremendous new possibilities across numerous industries. Our extensive portfolio of communications real estate across the country sits at the cross-section of the elements that can make this transformation a reality, and as a result we are positioned to drive compelling long term stockholder returns while continuing to provide industry-leading service levels to both existing and new customers. Finally, I want to recognize our nearly 6,000 employees around the world who are working tirelessly for all of us. Achieving the types of results Rod is going to walk you through now, particularly through this horrific pandemic, is really remarkable, and I want them to know just how much we all appreciate their dedication and hard work. With that, let me hand the call over to Rod to discuss our first quarter results and updated outlook. Rod? Rod Smith : Thanks Tom, and thanks everyone for joining today\u2019s call. I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. As you saw in today\u2019s press release, we\u2019re off to a strong start in 2021 as 5G ramps up in the U.S. and as carriers in our international markets deploy significant capital towards their network enhancement initiatives. Before getting into the details of our Q1 results and revised outlook, I want to touch on a few highlights for the quarter. First, we announced the acquisition of Telxius, which we believe will be transformational for our European business. We also signed a master lease agreement with Dish which locks in attractive multi-year growth in cash property revenue for us, beginning in 2022. Second, demand for our towers continues to be strong throughout our global footprint and we saw this reflected in both our solid tenant billings growth and in the high volume of new bills in the quarter. Third, we continue to leverage the capital markets to support our investment grade balance sheet, issuing $1.4 billion in senior unsecured notes and refinancing existing debt at highly attractive rates. Finally, we made good progress regarding the financing plan for our expanding European business, including private capital. We expect to communicate specific details of our plan prior to closing the first tranche of towers, which we anticipate will be later this quarter. With that, please turn to Slide 6 and I\u2019ll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, our Q1 consolidated property revenue of $2.130 billion grew by 7.9% or nearly 10% on an FX-neutral basis over the prior year period. This included U.S. property revenue growth of 13% and international property revenue growth of 1.7%, or 5.8% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations. These growth rates were right in line with our expectations and continue to reflect the essential nature of mobile services and the importance of our tower portfolio throughout our served markets. Moving to the right side of the slide, organic growth was once again a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth. On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billing growth was 4.1%, including 3.6% in our U.S. and Canada segment and 5% in our international markets. In the U.S., we had a solid quarter of gross new business commencement, as expected, and churn was right in the middle of our historical 1% to 2% range. Escalators were 2.6%, impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLA with T-Mobile. For the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. Meanwhile, international organic tenant billings growth was particularly strong in Latin America, coming in at 7.9%, and was also quite solid in Africa where we generated growth of 7.4%. In both regions, we are continuing to see our tenants actively deploying equipment across their networks as mobile data consumption grows rapidly. Activity in Nigeria was a highlight once again, and we continue to expect growth in that market to ramp up going forward.  We also had a strong quarter in Europe, particularly in Germany where gross new leasing growth was around 7% driven by accelerating 5G deployments and continuing investments in 4G. In India, we saw an organic tenant billings growth decline of 1.6%, in line with our expectations as we continue to work through the latter stages of AGR and consolidated related churn in the market.  On the gross new business side, we saw another solid quarter which was further complemented by contributions from the more than 5,000 sites we have constructed in the market since the beginning of 2020. Notably, global commenced monthly new business in the quarter, including contributions from new build, was more than $11 million, up about 17% versus the prior year period and representing a new ATC record level. Turning to Slide 7, our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 13.3% or 14.9% on an FX-neutral basis to $1.440 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 66.7%, up nearly three full percentage points over the prior year driven by continued organic growth and prudent cost controls throughout the business, as well as the benefits of straight line revenue related to the T-Mobile MLA signed late last year.  Cash SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was 6.6% for the quarter as significant scale across our footprint continued to yield benefits along with some bad debt reversals in India.  Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share each grew by about 24%. These growth rates included the benefit of the non-recurrence of about $63 million in one-time cash interest expense booked in Q1 of last year associated with our purchase of MTN\u2019s minority stake in our Ghana and Uganda businesses. Normalizing for that item, growth would have been around 16%, the highest rate in several years. This was driven by high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower than expected cash interest, non-recurring cash tax refund, and seasonally low maintenance capex.  I will note that the cash tax and maintenance capex trends we saw this quarter are largely attributable to timing, so these lines are expected to pick back up over the rest of the year. As a result, we expect that Q1 will be the highest level of quarterly consolidated AFFO per share that we see in 2021. Finally, on an FX-neutral basis, consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share growth for the quarter would have been right around 26%.  Let\u2019s now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I\u2019ll start by reviewing a few of the key high level drivers. First, due to the negative impacts of translational FX fluctuations in some of our international markets, we are reducing our property revenue outlook by $25 million at the midpoint. On an FX-neutral basis, we would be increasing our property revenue expectations due to higher pass through and straight line revenue internationally. Second, despite these FX headwinds, we are raising our outlook for both adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO. The adjusted EBITDA outperformance is primarily attributable to higher expected contributions from our services segment driven by pre-construction site acquisition zoning and permitting work for our customers as well as slightly more favorable SG&A trends in the business. Regarding our improved AFFO expectation, in addition to the services outperformance we are anticipating lower cash taxes and cash interest expense for the year. Finally, per our historical practice, our revised outlook continues to exclude the impacts of our pending Telxius transaction and its associated financing. We expect the transaction to close in multiple tranches, beginning with the majority of the European sites later in the second quarter and with some of the German rooftops and the Latin American sites in Q3. Once the assets begin to close, we will update further iterations of our guidance to include these contributions. We look forward to quickly integrating the portfolio and, as previously noted, expect the deal to be immediately accretive to consolidated AFFO per share. With that, let\u2019s turn into the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, we are now projecting consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of 7.5% at the midpoint. The decline as compared to the prior guidance is due to approximately $48 million in negative translational FX impact, which is being partially offset by about $23 million in additional international pass through and straight line revenue.  Moving to Slide 9, you\u2019ll see that we are reiterating our organic tenant billings growth projections across all regions as the global leasing environment remains consistent with our prior expectations across our footprint. We continue to expect consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 3% to 4% in 2021. In the U.S., as Tom outlined earlier, we anticipate a prolonged period of strong growth driven by 5G related densification initiatives by the carriers as they roll out multiple spectrum bands. We continue to expect that gross new business activity will accelerate through the year and into 2022. Looking to Latin America, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be roughly 7% for the year. Despite some challenges around COVID trends in the region, carrier activity remains consistent as customers continue to increase their mobile data usage and carriers respond with incremental network investments. In Africa, we expect to generate organic tenant billings growth in excess of 8%, driven primarily by spending on 4G deployments.  We are seeing especially strong growth in Nigeria where new business trends continue to inflect positively and where our contract structures with key tenants are supporting growth. As we move into the back of the year, we anticipate that Africa organic tenant billings growth will accelerate to above 9%.  In Europe, we continue to expect organic tenant billings growth of over 3% for the full year and are seeing solid trends, particularly on the gross new business side. We\u2019re especially encouraged by what we are seeing in Germany, where organic tenant billings growth excluding churn hit 7% in Q1 for the first time. We expect positive new business trends to continue going forward as incumbent carriers accelerate their 5G initiatives and as a new tenant begins to roll out its network. Finally in India, we continue to expect roughly flat organic tenant billings for the year. While we believe we\u2019re in the very late stages of the consolidation process, we maintain our expectation that we will see elevated churn this year as the post-AGR environment sorts itself out. With that said, we remain optimistic that the long term growth trajectory in the market should be more favorable, particularly given that the structural framework of the wireless sector today is probably the most constructive it has been in the last decade. Moving to Slide 10, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook and now expect year-over-year growth of 9.6% despite about $30 million in negative translational FX impacts as compared to our prior outlook. Around $33 million in incrementally expected services gross margin, $3 million or so in net straight line favorability, and about $4 million in lower cash SG&A is enabling us to more than offset the FX headwinds. The services activity we are seeing is broad-based and spread across multiple tenants, and in our view another indication that U.S. network investment activity is in the early stages of a sustainable acceleration.  Turning to Slide 11, we are also raising our expectations for full year consolidated AFFO and now expect year-over-year growth of over 9% with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.25 per share. Services segment outperformance as well as about $13 million in net cash interest and cash tax favorability are driving this upside and enabling us to absorb about $25 million in unfavorable FX impact. On a per-share basis, we expect growth of 9% for the year and continue to drive towards our goal of delivering double-digit growth. Moving onto Slide 12, let\u2019s review our capital deployment expectations for 2021, which are broadly consistent with our prior outlook and reflect our continuing focus on driving strong, sustainable growth in consolidated AFFO per share. Distributing capital to our common shareholders remains our top capital allocation priority and we continue to expect to allocate approximately $2.3 billion towards our dividend in 2021, implying a year-over-year growth rate of around 15% subject to our board\u2019s approval.  Regarding capex, we are raising our projections by $25 million at the midpoint due to some additional expected U.S. land investments and a modest increase in start-up capex internationally. On the acquisition front, we spent around $115 million in the first quarter and continue to expect to deploy over $9 billion for the Telxius transaction later this year.  As I mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress on the financing plan for our European business and our acquisition of the Telxius assets. This includes on the private capital front, where we continue to remain confident that we can bring in one or more high quality strategic counterparties to purchase minority stakes in our European business not only to help us finance the Telxius transaction but also to collaborate on future European expansion opportunities.  On the debt side of the equation, we continue to expect to take our net leverage up to the high five times range. Having completed a U.S. dollar denominated senior unsecured notes offering in Q1, we anticipate that other near term debt issuances are likely to be euro denominated. This is consistent with our expected material expansion of euro-based revenues in our business and will enable us to take advantage of highly attractive financing rates. Finally, any remaining funding need that isn\u2019t covered by debt issuances or private capital will be in the form of equity through a common equity issuance and/or a mandatory convertible preferred issuance. Our goal continues to be to fund this transaction in a way that is not only optimal from a capital structure perspective but also enables us to optimize shareholder return. Turning to Slide 13, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes on our new build program, which has accelerated over the last few years to meet increasing demand for new sites by a number of our key international tenants. As you can see, since 2016 and including our expectations for this year, we will have added over 23,000 sites to our portfolio through new construction. In 2020, we built over 5,800 towers, a new American Tower record, and we\u2019re off to a great start in 2021, adding nearly 2,000 sites in our international markets for the quarter, a level of activity only exceeded by that of Q4 2020. Moving to the middle of the slide, you can see that we are seeing highly attractive returns on capital deployed towards new sites. In Q1, average day one new build NOI yields were around 12%. In our APAC region where we added over 1,300 sites, we saw highly attractive yields of around 15%, and in Africa where we added more than 500 sites, we averaged day one returns of over 10%. We\u2019re anticipating another record year of new builds in 2021 with 6,500 sites at the midpoint of our outlook. The majority of these deployments will be focused across these same APAC and Africa regions, where we expect to drive the most attractive new build returns and where the vast majority of new build activity is for investment grade anchor tenants. Looking beyond 2021, we expect this trend of increasing demand for incremental wireless infrastructure to continue as carriers in markets with fast growing populations and surging demand for mobile data work to enhance their networks. We believe that our existing global scale, track record of providing best-in-class service levels and strong relationships with MNOs place American Tower in a favorable position to act as a preferred partner for these large scale deployments. As such, we\u2019ll look to take advantage of the opportunity to continue growing our international portfolio by deploying capital for high return new build projects, and as Tom noted on last quarter\u2019s call, based on the demand we are seeing for new sites internationally, we are targeting the construction of 40,000 to 50,000 new sites over the next five years. Finally on Slide 14 and in summary, Q1 was another quarter of solid organic growth, margin expansion, dividend growth, and strong new build activity. We were able to secure a transformational deal in Europe with the pending Telxius transaction, signed a value-additive long term MLA in the U.S., continued to enhance our balance sheet through opportunistic refinancing, and remained focused on cost controls and driving sustainable recurring growth. We are excited about the global demand for tower space and look forward to making additional progress on many fronts through the rest of the year as we seek to deliver compelling total returns to our shareholders. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the Operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Thank you very much, good morning. Tom Bartlett : Hey Simon. Simon Flannery : How are you? Thanks for the overview on the U.S. portfolio - very helpful. It does seem like you\u2019re also becoming more constructive on Europe. We have the Telxius transaction and to Rod\u2019s comments about looking for partners, it seems like that extends beyond this deal. So, perhaps you\u2019d just give us a little bit more color on what you see in Europe now. It seems like Germany in particular is very strong, but are you open to that becoming an even bigger part of your future beyond the Telxius deal, and what exactly are you looking for in these partnerships as opposed to raising straight equity or debt, given the attractive capital markets there? Tom Bartlett : Thanks Simon, thanks for the question. You know, we\u2019ve been looking at the European market for the better part of a dozen years, and we did create a couple beachhead properties, if you will, in France and Germany, pretty small, in kind of the 4,000 to 5,000 sites a number of years ago, and we\u2019ve continued to look in those particular markets to see if there are opportunities. One of the challenges that we always saw in those markets were who the counterparty was, what the capital would be that required to upgrade the sites themselves, and really what were the long-term growth projections and opportunities in the marketplace, and so as such, we were never successful in terms of kind of landing any particular transactions up until the transaction that we\u2019re just about ready to close with Telxius. A lot of that is a function of the relationship, I think, that we\u2019ve built with Telefonica over so many years and have--you know, they have such credibility, and I think we have a lot of credibility with them. We were able to put our hands on this particular portfolio, and I think in particular for those very reasons that I mentioned before that got in the way of us being able to close things, is that the portfolio itself is very solid, it\u2019s a terrific set of assets, terrifically located, as I said good counterparty, and now what we\u2019re starting to see in the marketplace, as Rod talked about, was really the evolution of 5G. We\u2019re starting to see more spectrum being deployed to support 5G and we\u2019re really, I think, just on the front end of what that 5G deployment is going to look like. We see it accelerating particularly in markets like Germany, and we see the opportunity for a new entrant who is going to be coming into the marketplace, and so we think it really rounds out our overall portfolio. I think we have a significant competitive advantage in that we have a presence in so many different -- very, very important markets around the globe, and this just increases the overall presence we have and what was kind of a hole, if you will, in our portfolio given the size of the assets that we had before. And so now, we\u2019re going to have 30,000 sites in the marketplace, terrific counterparty, and as I said right in the beginning part of what we think is going to be a long-term growth trajectory in the region, and so we\u2019ll use that as a way to be able to continue to grow if it makes sense and if we find good assets, good opportunities in the region. I think we\u2019re positioning ourselves with some very interesting private capital, and so that will increase the overall platform for our ability to grow in the market. I mean, they\u2019re very passive - we\u2019re operating it. They\u2019re minority partners, as you would expect, but they are very interested also in growing their portfolios in our base of assets, and hopefully they\u2019ll be able to participate in future potential investments with us. I think that this is all coming together quite nicely for us, and we\u2019ve received the approvals to be able to move forward with the transaction in all due respects, and so we\u2019re excited about what the region has in front of us. As I said, equally as important, we\u2019re excited now about what that brings to our overall global footprint and how important that could be to TSBs, hyper scalers, who knows who might be looking for kind of a one-stop shop, if you will, in looking at our over 200,000 sites in these key markets, and we look to continue to grow that. Rod talked about the 40,000 to 50,000 new builds that we\u2019re looking at, and so we very much have our sights on increasing our footprint globally, and I think this is a great step. Simon Flannery : Great, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks, good morning guys. Tom Bartlett : Hey Ric. Ric Prentiss : Hey. I\u2019m going to follow on Simon\u2019s question a little bit there. Tom, if the private capital makes sense in Europe, does it make sense in other areas outside of Europe to come onboard with you guys? Tom Bartlett : It very well may, Ric. You know, we\u2019ve had JV partners in the form of MNOs in the past, as you well know - with MTN, who were a great partner, and it very well may. We\u2019ll look at it on a case-by-case basis and look at the opportunities. We think we have a good playbook, if you will, that we\u2019ve created as a result of the work that we\u2019ve done on this particular transaction, and there\u2019s definitely a lot of interest, and so we\u2019ll look at that as perhaps the means to create a broader platform for our ability to grow. So, it\u2019s very possible, and as you know, we\u2019ll look at everything on an individual basis, a case-by-case basis. Ric Prentiss : Makes sense. You also pointed obviously to some excitement about a new entrant in Germany - I assume that\u2019s the Drillisch folks. What can you tell us about their aspirations or what type of network they\u2019re thinking of building? Tom Bartlett : I think that\u2019s probably a better question for them in terms of what they\u2019re actually looking for. They recently, though, have executed a roaming agreement with Telefonica, so they have a very strong relationship, I think, with TEF in the market, which we\u2019ll then be able to hopefully take advantage of. I think that will unfold over the year as they\u2019ve said publicly, in terms of putting that all together. They are looking to roll out 5G, urban markets first, and so this is where our rooftop penetration, rooftop assets in that market as we\u2019ve talked about has just been so incredibly valuable, and that\u2019s a particular asset base that we just didn\u2019t have before. We were quite rural in terms of the portfolio we had before, so this really takes it up a few notches in terms of our ability to be successful in the marketplace, and my sense is they will take advantage of the rooftop assets probably out of the gate. Ric Prentiss : Okay, and thinking of MLAs, we\u2019re getting a lot of questions with Verizon having signed MLAs with Crown and SBAC. You guys have the Verizon portfolio towers from a transaction a few years ago. Talk just a little bit about what the path--the give and the take is on an MLA with Verizon with you guys. Tom Bartlett : Well, as you know, Ric, we already have a long term master lease agreement in place with Verizon, and so it wasn\u2019t one where it needed to be extended from that perspective. We have a terrific relationship with Verizon. We\u2019re in conversations with them, I\u2019m in conversations with them on quite a regular basis, not just on this but on a lot of broader issues in the marketplace, and so we have a holistic rate that we have right now with them that expires at the end of the year, and that\u2019s just one element of this broader, long term master lease agreement with the, and whether that continues or not, who knows, but we\u2019re, I think, providing excellent service for Verizon. They are being very aggressive on rollout of 5G and C-band, and we\u2019ll be there every step of the way for them. Ric Prentiss : Okay. Last one from me, it looks like you\u2019ve removed the work aspirational from just having your target on AFFO per share be double-digit. Does that mean--you know, obviously it\u2019s a goal, but it\u2019s not--I think aspirational kind of scared some people last time around. Tom Bartlett : Well, it is a goal. I mean, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s aspirational or whatever, whatever word you want, but my compensation is driven on AFFO per share growth and return on invested capital, and our shareholders require that too, so we very much have an objective of that double-digit. Now, it\u2019s not going to happen maybe in every year, it\u2019s long term, but we\u2019ve been able to be very successful in terms of driving that kind of performance over the last 10 years and we\u2019re very focused on continually driving to that kind of performance going forward. 2022, you know, we do have the churn impact associated with the Sprint assets, so could that be a challenge? Perhaps, but our goal is still the same, so I think we have a number of levers. We\u2019re going to be bringing on the Telxius assets, which I think we\u2019ll be very happy with those results and what that kind of accretion should be to take advantage of the markets, and we\u2019ll have our normal solid growth that we see going on in the business. We just increased our overall EBITDA performance for 2021, and so we\u2019ll remain laser focused on all of our costs, including all of our capital being spent. Again, our goal is to drive that kind of performance. Ric Prentiss : Makes sense, thanks Tom. Everybody stay well. Tom Bartlett : You too, Ric. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Atkin from RBC. Please go ahead. John Atkin : Thanks. I wanted to ask about Telxius, and you talked about strategic counterparties. At a high level, can you talk a little bit about the types of things that are factoring into your--with respect to governance, valuation or just other factors that are going to play a role in how this shakes out?  Then it\u2019s been a couple of conference calls since you mentioned fiber, and I just wondered if there\u2019s an update there or is that less of a focus these days in some of your Latin American properties. Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Maybe I\u2019ll ask Rod to address the first question and I\u2019ll take the second one, John. Rod Smith : Sure Tom, that sounds great. Thanks Jonathan for the question. Hope you\u2019re doing well. From a high level in terms of our Telxius financing, our plan has not changed, and we continue to make very good progress on the path that we originally announced, when we announced that we were entering into the transaction itself. There\u2019s a few broad principles that we\u2019re looking for. One is we expect to finance this deal in a way that\u2019s consistent with our investment grade credit. That still is the focus. Our aim is to minimize the dilution of our current common stockholders, so continue to be focused on that as well, and we expect to finance this transaction in a way that supports it being immediately accretive, which is what we said early on and that\u2019s continuing to be our focus and our expectation here as we move forward. A couple of things in terms of the internal workings of the financing plan. I don\u2019t want to get into details around the governance and valuation and those sorts of things, but one thing I would say valuation-wise, it\u2019s very consistent with the valuation of what we\u2019re doing with Telxius. In terms of the minority stakes that we are selling, we\u2019re selling minority stakes potentially in our European business not just to Telxius, but we will be putting our legacy businesses, combining that with the Telxius assets, so one key point is we do expect our debt to come up to the high five times - we\u2019ve said that before, we\u2019re still very comfortable in that range, and we do believe that that\u2019s consistent with our investment grade credit rating. We\u2019ve had many discussions with the credit agencies and we do not expect any risk of downgrades or outlook changes, or anything from that perspective. Additionally, near term senior notes that we may issue in order to fund the Telxius transaction are likely to be denominated in euro currency, and that will allow us to take into the very attractive rates that we see in the euro market certainly.  Then on the private capital front, as Tom alluded to and I mentioned in comments, we continue to progress along that path, and we\u2019re very confident that we can bring in one or more very strategic investors. We certainly are talking to the world\u2019s premier investors and certainly folks that understand this base, that understand the European market and other markets, quite frankly, as well as have relationships with some of our biggest customers around the globe, so there may be more than just financial benefits here to our shareholders but also strategic and kind of broader partnership benefits as well. Certainly that\u2019s a key focus. Then the final piece of the financing plan will come in the form of equity, so whatever is not funded through the increased net leverage that I talked about and through the euro debt offerings and private capital, we expect to go into the market and issue some equity.  In terms of timing, we do expect the transaction to begin to close in the second quarter probably as early as late May for some of the European markets. The Latin American markets, we\u2019re originally expecting that they would close probably sometime in Q3. There is a chance that Brazil and some of the other markets could close as early as the end of May or at some point in Q2, but we\u2019ll continue to work through the timing there. There will be some assets, particularly some select rooftops that will close in Europe in Q3, not in Q2, so we will have multiple closings across Q2 and across Q3. That\u2019s kind of the way that it shakes out, and again we remain very confident that this financing plan and our patience in putting it together and managing through the details I really going to pay off for our shareholders, and we\u2019re in very good shape to begin to execute on this in the month of May as we prepare to close the first tranches of the Telxius transaction. Tom Bartlett : Then John, with regard to your second question with where we are with fiber as one of our platform extension initiatives, first of all where we are, we have a six country fiber footprint - Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, SA and India, and we cover over 30,000 route kilometres. We actually passed 1.25 million homes in those markets, and the networks themselves are a mix of active long haul, metro, some B2B in Mexico and Brazil, and a concentration of fiber to passive optical networks in SA, Colombia, Brazil and Argentina.  We\u2019ve spent just over a billion dollars of capex over the past four years in those markets - $700 million for acquisitions and $300 million for development and redevelopment capex, so we\u2019ve been monitoring it very closely. From a revenue perspective, I think we generated about $100 million in 2020, and our ROIC for those particular investments collectively is in kind of the 5%, 5.5% kind of range. Interesting, the SA assets, the return on invested capital is probably double that.  So what we\u2019re thinking about strategically, again we\u2019re looking at this from an initiative perspective, a platform initiative perspective. Some of the underlying elements of it, the foundations of it, again go back to how we\u2019re looking at the overall tower model - multi service, multi tenant, long term anchor contract, escalators, exclusive real estate rights, a way for us to really be able to create a competitive advantage and really complement the power returns that we\u2019ve been experiencing for the last 10 years or so.  Our strategy really has kind of two prongs. I would say the first is to pivot and transform our current fiber businesses in Mexico and Brazil into wholesale long term contracts. We\u2019ll be looking to do this through long term contracts with Tier 1 carriers, also could involve some strategic inorganic transactions like we were just talking about before, and the focus is clearly creating a competitive, long term strategic asset in those markets. Then the second strategy really entails reaching certain economics in these deployments, particularly in SA and Brazil, and a focus on future investments in some of our emerging neutral host open access networks. We\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic where it obviously makes sense, be monitoring it very closely, but we do see that we\u2019ll see kind of a shift to open passive optical and multi-tenant access networks over time - we think that\u2019s a great way to be able to improve the return on invested capital, and our regional focus is currently right now on Latin America where most of the assets are and leveraging our existing M&O relationships. We think we can create that model in LatAm and then be able to scale it globally. I mean, that\u2019s kind of where we are. It\u2019s still a work in progress, but I think we\u2019ve learned a lot and I think we\u2019re making great progress on the strategy. John Atkin : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey guys, thank you for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. One on the services sides, if you can give us any updates in terms of how we should think about the cadence of revenues and services margin in the next couple quarters, and then I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of the breadth of the strength. I think in the prior remarks, you mentioned pretty diverse in terms of contribution, so if you can give us any color there.  Then secondly on the SG&A front in India, it looks like you\u2019re moving past some of the elevated bad debt that hit you a year ago, so just trying to get a better sense of how we should think about that in terms of whether there\u2019s any incremental bad debt you anticipate in that region, or whether you\u2019ve moved past that. Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Yes Matt, I\u2019ll let Rod get into that. Rod Smith : Yes, thanks Tom. Thanks Matt, hope you\u2019re doing well. Thanks for the question. With regards to our services business, as you saw in the comments earlier and I think Tom alluded to it, we are seeing a significant uplift in our services revenue for the year, so you saw us raise our full-year outlook to about $175 million, up from about $120 million. The margins are broadly consistent year over year, so we\u2019re expecting that mid to just a touch above mid 50% margins - that\u2019s similar to what we saw in 2020, that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting in 2021.  In terms of the timing of the services revenue, we are seeing an acceleration of, let\u2019s say, applications and activity in the market, and we expect that to continue throughout the next couple of quarters, so more than 60% of the revenue of the $175 million is back-end weighted, so we would expect in Q3 and Q4, both of those periods would be north of $50 million per quarter in terms of revenue. That\u2019s kind of the way to think about services. Services, what we\u2019re seeing really is kind of a broad-based increase in services that goes across most all of our large customers, certainly, and it\u2019s focused on [indiscernible] engineering, miles analysis, things like that. Those sorts of activities are generally kind of front-end loaded. That services work happens well before you see leasing activity and any kind of an uplift in leasing revenue, so it\u2019s a really good sign here in terms of the activity level, the services that we see kind of ramping up towards the end of this year and as we transition into 2022.  When you think about India and bad debt, there\u2019s still a few places where we\u2019re watching customers around the globe, a couple in Africa and a couple in India certainly. We\u2019re doing really well. There\u2019s no significant incremental bad debt in our outlook, and our accounts receivable, the way it sits at the end of Q1 is broadly in line with the way that it sat at the end of Q1 last year, so we haven\u2019t had a significant increase in accounts receivable. We continue to collect and be pleased with the way that our customers are paying in India and in the select places in Africa that we\u2019re watching. We did end up unwinding a bad debt reserve in India in Q1 by just under $10 million or so, so that\u2019s certainly a good sign; but with that said, we continue to watch India. There\u2019s a few things that we\u2019re looking for relative to some of our customers there in terms of capital raise projects that they\u2019re in, and certainly the amount of liabilities through the AGR and some of the activity between our customers and the government to try to negotiate those, we watch that quite closely. But that\u2019s really the story on accounts receivable and bad debt, but we\u2019ve had a good quarter, we did well throughout 2020, and we don\u2019t have any significant incremental bad debt in our outlook for 2021. Matt Niknam : That\u2019s great, thank you for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I guess Rod or Tom, obviously the thing that\u2019s going to propel the gross revenue trajectory domestically is the C-band auction and the pursuit of exploiting that opportunity among the carriers. Can you--for the benefit of us generally across this global portfolio that you have, can you kind of maybe tick off the next one, two or three markets where you\u2019re expecting this kind of opportunity to emerge with spectrum options forthcoming?  Then the second question is John Stankey at AT&T kind of said he was, quote-unquote, skittish about the supply chain marketplace, even in the United States. Could you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the supply chain, chip availability specifically, affecting your company\u2019s or customers\u2019 ability to deploy and how you\u2019ve factored that into your thinking about the guide? Thank you. Tom Bartlett : Sure Dave, maybe I\u2019ll start off and Rod can chime in with some additional commentary. What we\u2019re seeing around the globe, as I think both Rod and I mentioned even in our remarks, was just an onslaught of new spectrum coming into the marketplace. We\u2019re seeing in India, we\u2019re seeing clearly in Europe, we\u2019re seeing in Latin America, and they\u2019re wide blocks of spectrum. For 5G to be effective, you need a wider swath of spectrum. It can\u2019t be the 10 meg - you know, you\u2019re looking at 20 to 40 to 60 meg of spectrum, and so that\u2019s the first sign, I think David, that we see because, as I mentioned and as you well know, spectrum is the lifeblood of being able to roll out any of these new technologies, and for 5G to be able to truly realize the full 5G experience in terms of speed and latency, you need significant amounts of it. I look at--and in my comment before on Europe, what we\u2019ve seen in certain of those critical markets, critical countries in Europe really stepping up to launching a lot of new spectrum, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re really now starting to see some outsized growth in those particular markets, something that we hadn\u2019t seen for several years, and that really drove us to looking at some of the growth curves in that market for us to even lean into some of the assets that are there. That\u2019s just kind of the first sign of it, I think. You know, you look at markets like Africa, though - I mean, Africa--I think Rod had mentioned they were kind of in the 8%, looking at growing to 9%, even kind of ending out the year. You look at markets like Nigeria and things like that, where we\u2019re talking kind of double-digit growth rates - that\u2019s just because the wire line presence there just doesn\u2019t exist, and wireless broadband is everything that our customers are investing in, so you have slightly different reasons for some of the growth. Many of the markets are just getting into 4G, so we\u2019re still on the front of that 4G curve, and Latin America, you look at Brazil growth, you look at Mexico growth, they\u2019re in kind of the 7%, 8% growth range, so we\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019re seeing outside of the United States, and what\u2019s really driving it clearly is more spectrum, more wireless penetration. Unfortunately, the pandemic has actually driven even more of a need for connectivity, and so we\u2019re seeing even more wireless usage in those markets in particular, again because the wire line markets are just so poor and non-existent.  We would expect to see Europe kicking in with 5G, Africa continued growth as 4G becomes more of a reality there, Latin America similarly 4G into 5G ultimately, and even in India, the growth there is strong. We\u2019ve got the churn issues that we have to deal with in that particular market and we\u2019re getting our arms around it and making sure that we really nail those there, but it\u2019s not a growth issue. They\u2019ve got new spectrum, they\u2019ve got 4G, you see the likes of Facebook, you see all of the big foreign investment that\u2019s coming into the marketplace, so it\u2019s really an exciting market from a broadband wireless perspective. That kind of gives it on a global scale, and from a supply chain perspective, we don\u2019t see any impacts on our side from a supply chain perspective at this point. Our customers are the ones that are kind of front line with issues that they may have from some of the OEMs and things like that, but at least from our perspective, we\u2019re not seeing any impact from that perspective. David Barden : Okay, great. Thanks Tom, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays. Please go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Was hoping you could talk a little bit more--you\u2019d talked about edge compute a little bit in your prepared remarks. Could you just kind of update us on how you\u2019re thinking about the business model for AMT, and obviously this is a longer term trend, any more views on data center investments and how you think you might monetize that, and then I have a follow-up. Tom Bartlett : Okay. Let me take a step back a little bit. In terms of what we\u2019re seeing from an evolution perspective, if you will, first of all, this whole market is in fact developing. With regards specific to the edge, we are at the beginning and we\u2019re seeing certain elements align, if you will, but we\u2019re really starting to and trying to participate in those, but we really are at the beginning of it. If you start to think about, first of all, the [indiscernible] impact, what the cloud impact is, we just saw some recent announcements in the market relative to cloud layers aligning with some of the MNOs and we\u2019ve seen Verizon doing that over the last year or so, what we\u2019re starting to see is if you think about kind of the 4G low, midband power market and what it looks like at the site level, as we move into the 5G and lowband, midband, what we\u2019re starting to see at the site, for example, is a lot of--you know, MIMO is going to be starting to be deployed, a lot of antenna arrays, a lot of new fiber that\u2019s going up the pole themselves, five to 10 times more fiber strands needed, higher power, more heat, and so there\u2019s a lot of elements that are going on actually at the site itself, which is going to drive more and more equipment improvements to the public radio interface on the front hole which connects, actually, the tower to the base band unit itself. Now what we\u2019re starting to see is we\u2019re seeing Cloud-RAN and O-RAN. From an O-RAN perspective, it\u2019s different types of equipment that our customers are able to put together to be able to load onto the site, and at the base level, at the base band unit, which is where the data center element comes in, we\u2019re starting to see a disaggregation at the base band unit level into the DU and into the CU level, and that\u2019s giving our customers the ability and us to be able to look at where in fact we might be able to expand and be able to enjoy some of this additional compute capability that\u2019s going to exist out at the edge as the 5G experience becomes more prevalent throughout the country. We continue and expect to see this incremental convergence of this wire line and wireless network. We think it stresses the importance of that first mile network architecture, and so as a result we\u2019re actually very, very excited about the opportunity. It\u2019s a shared neutral host solution, we think it\u2019s going to be very efficient out at the site level, and we actually are exploring and going down the path of really two elements, two ways if you will. We\u2019ve talked about the distribute compute. You know, the enterprise workloads continue to move onto the public cloud, and so there\u2019s a growing near term market segment that\u2019s in use of that kind of off-prem cloud computing, it\u2019s really a hybrid solution, and so we\u2019re located on some [indiscernible], if you will, of our sites and you\u2019ll see them - there are shelters there, there\u2019s power, there\u2019s capability to be able to offer this kind of a capability to these kind of midsized enterprise accounts, and they\u2019re actually being quite successful. They\u2019re loading up very quickly and, believe me, they\u2019re not meaningful from an AMT perspective but they are absolutely meaningful from an experience perspective and learning exactly what our customers are going to be looking for. The bigger opportunity for us is still at the mobile edge compute side, and so that will become, we believe, more of a reality as that 5G world becomes more developed, so we have a number of MOUs with a number of different players focused on solutions to the MNOs, as well as focused on solutions to the cloud service providers. We\u2019re exploring those, putting those in front of those particular accounts and looking at what the ultimate opportunity would be, and the site is a perfect location for being able to expand our customers\u2019 edge compute capability, not just within the United States but on a global basis. If we can bring in 500 kilowatts of power into a particular site with a number of shelters that exist in the site to be able to load up racks and servers, we think--and give that cloud ramp, which will actually exist in that DU, so that\u2019s why that disaggregation is so important between those two particular elements of the RAN, we think that we can enjoy some significant opportunity upside here from this whole initiative. It is an extension of our existing platform - again, neutral host, but it really provides ultimately that cloud ramp which we think is going to be needed to be able to enjoy that kind of latency that our enterprise accounts and customers are going to be looking for. Tim Long : Okay, thank you. I just wanted to follow up - when you think about Africa and particularly India, obviously some aggressive tower build plans over the next few years, but could you just talk a little bit about this year and potential COVID-related risks to those builds and any other risks to the business because of the pandemic? Thank you. Tom Bartlett : Yes, I think that the build itself--you know, our plan, our outlook I think has been the 6,000 to 7,000 sites. There could be some timing issues associated with the build. The need is there, I\u2019m certain that the sites are going to be built, but particularly in a market like India who are suffering so significantly right now, there can be a timing issue in terms of having essential people out in the marketplace to be able to build. Clearly lives saved is more important than towers built, so there could be some timing issues there, but ultimately over that five-year period, we are seeing the demand for that 40,000 to 50,000 sites that Rod laid out, and our forecast right now is for that 6,000 to 7,000 sites, there could be some timing issues associated with particularly the sites in India. I\u2019m not seeing the same implications in Africa at this point in time. By the way, our overall 6,000 to 7,000 sites, that outlook already includes some carving back of what we are expecting overall in the marketplace.  Relative to COVID overall, as we\u2019ve seen over the last year, our business is quite resilient. People need connectivity - I think that\u2019s been more obvious than ever over this past year, particularly in many of our global markets, and so our customers are doing everything possible that they can to be able to maintain that kind of connectivity. We\u2019re doing everything we possibly can to be able to support them, to be able to ensure that kind of connectivity, so we\u2019re working our tails off with our customers to make sure that we can do that. Tim Long : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great, thank you. A couple questions. First on the U.S., as you think about your long term guidance, can you tell us what it assumes in terms of the mix of amendments versus new collocation, and the new site build program that you have, what percent of that would be in the U.S.? As the carriers deploy CDMA, do you have any indication that they\u2019re leaning more towards new leases as well? Then maybe just a follow-up on the escalator, Rod, if you can tell us a little bit more why it stepped down, and then when it will go back to 3%, and also if the Dish MLA, if you can confirm that\u2019s a 3% escalator as well. Thank you. Tom Bartlett : I thought you said there were just a couple questions! Batya Levi : I know. I thought we should take this call longer. Tom Bartlett : No, it\u2019s great. Thanks for being here, and thanks for the questions. I\u2019ll let Rod run with it. Rod Smith : Yes, thanks for the questions, Batya. I\u2019ll try to remember all of the different aspects here, but if I miss anything, just remind me. Maybe I\u2019ll start at the end and work backwards a little bit. The escalator in the U.S., you saw our escalator for Q1 was about 2.6% - that really was driven by the impact of timing mechanics within the T-Mobile MLA, so as we signed a new MLA with T-Mobile, the escalator shifted from one period to another, and that affected the volume of escalator in Q1. But for the full year, we do expect the escalator to be right in that 3% range, 3% or just above potentially, and Q2 we do expect the escalator for the U.S. to be 3.1%. There\u2019s no structural change, there\u2019s no permanent shift, it really is just a timing issue.  I\u2019ll also point out, it\u2019s a little ahead of time, but in 2022 you may see some lumpiness as well with the escalator, given the time shift here, but again for 2022 for the full year, we anticipate the escalator to be right in that 3% range, 3% or just above as usual, so nothing to be concerned there. We haven\u2019t had any philosophy shift and no kind of contractual change in terms of what the escalator is. It remains at 3%, as it always has in the U.S. Then I think your next question was relative to the long term guidance, and maybe I\u2019ll just take a minute to remind the folks on the call of what that is. We\u2019re looking at over the next seven years, we\u2019ve put out guidance at least 4% organic tenant billings growth on average over that time period. That includes the Sprint churn, which will begin to roll off of our billing later this year in Q4, in the beginning of October. If you normalize for that, we\u2019re looking at that long term organic growth rate in the U.S. of about 5%. The other thing that I would point out here is if you look at just the first couple years, \u201921 and \u201922 on a Sprint impacted basis, where we\u2019ll see that churn again beginning in Q4 of 2021, the expected organic tenant billings including that will be around 2%, but normalizing that it will be around 5%. Once we get clear from that, when we get out to \u201923 and beyond, so \u201923 out to \u201927, even with the impact of the Sprint churn, we\u2019re predicting organic tenant billings growth north of 5%, and on a normalized basis for that same time period north of about 6%, so we are very excited and confident about the future in the U.S. We are seeing an acceleration of gross new biz. We\u2019re seeing that today, we expect that to continue, and that really is fueling these very solid organic tenant billings predictions over a long period of time - again, that seven years. Just a couple of key components here. I\u2019d remind you, 23% or two thirds of this, two thirds of this revenue that we need to hit these things are already contracted in our long term agreements and in some of these holistic deals, so that\u2019s key. That includes Dish being in here in the assumptions with some modest activity, which potentially could outperform depending on the pace and the level of their network build over that time period. Some of the C-band spectrum deployments for some carriers in some of the years may be in addition here and outside of the traditional holistics, so we\u2019re looking to that potentially as an upside. Then in terms of the collocation amendment mix, we\u2019re currently still at heavy amendment, 80% and 20% collocation - that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been for a little while. It may vary from carrier to carrier, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s been consistently, and we expect that that will be the case for a couple years. But going out longer term, it will vary. We do expect that it could be a higher percentage of collocations than we\u2019ve traditionally seen as the carriers deploy this higher band spectrum and they have a need to densify their network builds over time, so we\u2019re certainly planning for some of that as well but it\u2019s probably too early to predict that with too much specificity in terms of what that would be in terms of the mix in the out years. Was there another piece in your question, Batya, that I didn\u2019t address? Batya Levi : Just the Dish MLA, does it have a 3% escalator? Rod Smith : Yes, the Dish MLA has the 3% in there, so the escalator is consistent with everything else that we do and consistent with our philosophy here in the U.S. Then in terms of timing of the revenues, I\u2019ll just maybe highlight for folks that we do expect revenue to begin in 2022, and it will be modest in that year and then it will ramp up going forward, and we\u2019ll be working with Dish to help them roll out their network over an extended period of time. Batya Levi : Awesome, thanks so much. Rod Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Igor Khislavsky : Okay, great. Well, thank you everybody for joining this morning. That will wrap it up. Hope everyone is doing well, and we\u2019ll talk to you soon. Rod Smith : Thanks everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kate Ruppe, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kate Ruppe : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to CoreSite's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Paul Szurek, President and CEO; Steve Smith, Chief Revenue Officer; and Jeff Finnin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks on today's call may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws, including statements addressing projections, plans or future expectations. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and can give no assurance that the expectations will be obtained. Detailed information about these risks is included in our filings with the SEC. Also on this conference call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as funds from operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information that is part of our full earnings release, which can be found on the Investor Relations pages of our Web site at coresite.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Szurek : Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Today, I will cover the quarter's highlights, and Steve and Jeff will discuss sales and financial results in more detail. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results, including operating revenues of $162 million, resulting in 7.7% year-over-year growth and FFO per share as adjusted of $1.42, which is year-over-year growth of 5.2%, excluding the impact of a onetime benefit of $0.06 per share that Jeff will discuss later. Second quarter sales results included new and expansion leases of $7.8 million of annualized GAAP rent, which consisted of $7 million of retail colocation and small scale leasing, above the trailing 12 month average and $0.8 million of large-scale leasing. We are pleased with our retail and small-scale leasing so far this year. And as Steve will discuss, we expect more volume in large-scale leases in future months as the funnel of these longer cycle opportunities should bear fruit. Our sales trends confirm the findings in the 2021 state of the Data Center Survey that International Data Group recently published, which shows colocation emerging as a key element for modern IT enterprises, bridging multiple cloud and service providers to provide a robust foundation for driving innovation. The full survey is available on our Web site. Turning to our property development. The LA3 Phase 2 construction project remains on track for Q4 2021 delivery, and we completed a pre-lease for a scale deployment this quarter to an existing customer. We also achieved a lease percentage of 89% at LA3 Phase 1, reflecting the strength of our position in the Los Angeles market and solid sales activity. In addition, we placed a new 4-megawatt computer room at NY2 under development with an estimated Q1 2022 delivery date. We continue to see strong demand in the New York market, particularly in the financial services industry. The new Boston chiller plant project has been completed. We expect the chiller to provide a positive return on investment through improved power efficiency and utilization. As you know from our 2020 sustainability report, energy efficiency is a key focus for CoreSite. And finally, we received zoning approval from the Santa Clara City Council for our SV9 development, an important entitlement, and we continue to work through the remaining pre-construction activities to bring SV9 to a shovel ready state. We achieved a valuable milestone at our SV8 data center, which reached stabilization during the quarter at 98% occupancy, less than two years from the delivery of Phase 1 with financial returns expected to achieve our underwriting with some additional time and maturation. On the connectivity front, we recently announced on-net availability to Google Cloud natively on our Chicago and Silicon Valley campuses, further supporting Google's partner interconnect and validating the importance attributed to our portfolio by key cloud partners. In summary, we have solid accomplishments for the first half of the year, and Jeff will discuss their positive impact on guidance. We are executing well on our 2021 goals to translate our new and vacant capacity into sales opportunities to attract high quality logos that value our campus ecosystems, to expand our connectivity options and relationships to assist enterprises with their hybrid and multi cloud needs and to return to mid to high single digit growth in revenues, earnings and FFO per share. We remain optimistic about the fundamental market drivers supporting our go-to-market strategy, technology requiring low latency, high performance, hybrid cloud IT architectures continue to play an increasingly important role in the success of businesses. And CoreSite is well positioned to capture an attractive share of the edge needs in our major metropolitan markets. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith : Thanks, Paul, and hello, everyone. I will start by recapping our second quarter sales results and then discuss some key themes and notable wins. As Paul mentioned, we delivered new and expansion sales of $7.8 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, which included $3.4 million annualized GAAP rent from retail colocation leases and $4.4 million of GAAP rent from scale leases. Our new and expansion sales were comprised of 33,000 net rentable square feet, reflecting an average annualized GAAP rate of $235 per square foot, as well as 26 new logos that were added to our customer ecosystem with opportunities for future growth. I will highlight a few specific use cases from these new logos in a moment. New and expansion pricing on a kilowatt basis this quarter was above the trailing 12 month average by low to mid-teens, reflecting the unique use cases and mix of both size and location of leases signed this quarter. Contributing to this, our new and expansion sales of retail and small scale leasing was also above the trailing 12 month average. These leasing categories are a primary focus as they often represent performance sensitive applications requiring high interoperability and hybrid cloud architectures. These deployments also typically drive incremental power margin in interconnection revenues, improving profitability while enhancing the ecosystem. To supplement the retail and small scale sales results, our team is working hard to deliver more value add, large scale and hyperscale leasing throughout the second half of 2021, although, actual timing can be affected by the complexities and longer sales cycles of these larger deployments. Consistent with our strategy, we saw strong organic growth and demand from existing customers, who accounted for 86% of annualized GAAP rents signed during the second quarter as their digital architectures evolved and expand. Noteworthy expansions from existing customers included scaled edge deployments from a digital content customer and a public cloud customer expanding their footprints in the Los Angeles market to support their growing customer demand; a scaled expansion from a higher education customer in the New York market leading to support its high performance research computing; and scaled expansions from a financial derivatives exchange and a global investment management firm, enhancing our high quality financial services ecosystem in the New York market. From a geographic perspective, our strongest markets for new and expansion leases in terms of annualized GAAP rents signed were Los Angeles, New York and Northern Virginia, which combined represented 75% of our annualized GAAP rent signed during the quarter. Turning to notable new customer wins. The 26 new logos signed represents $1.1 million of annualized GAAP rent or approximately 14% of our sales during the quarter, including six new customers executing multi-market contracts. We effectively competed for and won 15 separate deployments across multiple markets from these six customers as they looked to solve for their distributed technical requirements, including high interoperability, robust security and enhanced reliability. Attracting high-quality new logos looking for this type of interoperability further strengthens the flywheel effect of our densely interconnected campus model and portfolio ecosystem. Enterprises contributed 93% of new logo annualized GAAP rents signed during this quarter and included an investment management firm join our rising financial services ecosystem in the New York market and another prominent law firm, known for its strategic work for major enterprises deploying in both New York and the Northern Virginia markets. Finally, we ended the second quarter at 84.1% of total data center occupancy, increasing our occupancy by 220 basis points since the beginning of the year and furthering our progress towards our targeted goal in the high 80s range. As we look to the second half of 2021, we are well positioned to capture the demand for edge use cases with high performance, hybrid and multi-cloud IT requirements, which we expect to drive significant value to the lease-up of our available capacity. We are working on attractive large scale and selective hyperscale opportunities that align with our campus value and shareholder objectives, and we remain optimistic about the sales funnel for the second half of 2021. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Finnin : Thanks, Steve. Today, I will review our second quarter financial results, balance sheet, leverage and liquidity, and then review our financial outlook and updated 2021 guidance. We achieved another strong quarter of financial results. Operating revenues were $162.1 million, an increase of 7.7% year-over-year. Year-to-date through Q2, the three components of data center revenues, rents, power and interconnection revenues, increased year-over-year at 6%, 10% and 9% respectively. As a reminder, our reported new and expansion sales results only include the rental revenue component of the new leases. Lease renewals equaling $20.4 million of annualized GAAP rent were finalized during the quarter, resulting in cash rent mark-to-market of 4.2% and GAAP mark-to-market of 7.1%. Year-to-date, our cash rent mark-to-market equals 3.4%, exceeding our initial guidance range. We also incurred churn of 1.3% for the quarter within our more normal historical range as we expected. Commencement of new and expansion leases of $8.4 million of annualized GAAP rent, revenue backlog consisting of $8.1 million of annualized GAAP rent or $15.6 million on a cash basis for leases signed but not yet commenced. The difference between the GAAP and cash backlog is primarily driven by a handful of scale leases with power ramps in the early portion of their lease terms. We expect approximately 70% of the GAAP backlog to commence in the third quarter of 2021 and substantially all of the remaining GAAP backlog to commence during the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $87.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 7.1% year-over-year. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA has increased 8.2%, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.3%, also an improvement over the guidance provided at the beginning of the year. Net income was $0.59 per diluted share, an increase of $0.07 year-over-year and $0.08 sequentially. FFO per share was $1.48. I recommend you look at the FFO per share results on an adjusted basis of $1.42 per share, which removes the impact of a onetime benefit of $3.1 million or $0.06 per share, resulting from the release of a tax liability that we no longer expect to be incurred. FFO per share as adjusted of $1.42 is an increase of $0.07 or 5.2% year-over-year. Year-to-date, FFO per share as adjusted increased 6.8%. Moving to our balance sheet. Our debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA decreased to 5 times as of June 30th. We saw organic deleveraging again this quarter as we continue to lease the capacity we developed over the last few years and realize the corresponding adjusted EBITDA growth. Inclusive of the current GAAP backlog mentioned earlier, our leverage ratio is 4.9 times. We ended the quarter with approximately $264.3 million of liquidity and therefore, the capital to fully fund our 2021 business plan. Turning to 2021 guidance. We are increasing our guidance related to net income attributable to common diluted shares to our new range of $1.99 to $2.07 per share. In addition, our guidance related to 2021 FFO per share as adjusted has been increased from our previous range of $5.42 to $5.52 per share to our new guidance range of $5.52 to $5.6 per share. The increase of $0.09 at the midpoint or approximately 1.6% is largely driven by an increase in operating revenues, improved adjusted EBITDA margins and to a lesser extent by lower than anticipated interest expense. We also increased our cash rent mark-to-market guidance to a range of 2% to 4% from our previous range of 0% to 2%. Other than the changes noted here and those on Page 21 of our supplemental, our 2021 guidance and related drivers remain unchanged. A few items to keep in mind related to our capital expenditures guidance. A portion of expansion capital spend in the second half of 2021 is dependent on the timing of our development at SV9, which could push into 2022, resulting in lower than anticipated capital spend this year. And with the completion of our investments in the SV1 office floor build-out and the Boston cooling infrastructure, both of which are expected to generate attractive returns on investment, our recurring CapEx will decrease and return to more normal levels in the second half of this year. And therefore, increase our AFFO to FFO ratio prospectively. In closing, as we move into the second half of 2021, we will continue to focus on our goal to lease-up our available capacity to achieve a portfolio occupancy percentage in the high 80s. As Steve said, we increased occupancy 220 basis points since the beginning of the year. We expect the increase in occupancy to create better revenue growth flow through and incremental margin expansion, ultimately resulting in incremental value for our shareholders. The incremental NOI resulting from ongoing lease-up highlights the value creation of our development and the implicit value of our currently available and buildable capacity. We remain focused on thoughtfully balancing future capacity development with customer opportunities. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have plenty of liquidity and we believe we are well positioned to drive long-term value creation. With that, operator, we would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : One thing that I really want to address is the cash renewal spreads and how you guys see those moving up. And what I really kind of want to understand is what is functionally happening at the customer level that's allowing CoreSite to push these price increases or kind of negotiate these price increases. I'm just trying to understand your structurally what is happening like in the demand environment and kind of like what the customers -- how they're reacting, how you guys are executing this? Just so we can understand the shift. Jeff Finnin : Sami, let me just give you maybe something to keep in mind, and then I'll let Steve answer a little bit more color on the actual conversations and a little bit more in tune with what you're asking about. But I just think, in general, when you look at the past several years as a public company our mark-to-market -- our rent growth has historically been somewhere between that 2% to 5%. And last year, we were lower than that and we started out the year expecting it to be a little bit lower and obviously, have been able to execute higher than what we anticipated headed into the year. So overall, I think that that 2% to 5% range is something to think about as we continue to execute on those renewals, but Steve can give you a little bit more color and commentary specific to your question. Steve Smith : Yes, I think the 2% to 5% spread is the right thing to focus on. And there are some variables that come into play in any given quarter. Obviously, our goal is to remain market -- make sure that we're in line with what the market supports out there, what customers value and that's what we strive for. What we also strive for is creating unique value for our customers that they're willing to pay for. So it's striking that balance of where we are with our customer, where their history is coming from as far as where they're coming off of their leases, and it's that overall mix that plays into that spread. But I think it's more important to just stay focused on the spread that Jeff mentioned. Sami Badri : And maybe just customer level conversations. I mean, we started off the year with a much different cash rent growth profile. And I hear you guys on the typical spread. But I think like what I'm really trying to understand is, has something functionally changed in the industry and the supply demand dynamic that enabled this revision and outlook. Steve Smith : No, I don't think so. I don't think anything has changed dramatically as far as supply demand or anything like that. I do think that our market and our model, and how we really try to provide more embedded services around interconnection and the stickiness of that helps overall. So as much as we can differentiate our portfolio from others, I think that provides additional value and stickiness and ability to hopefully have that be reflected in the rate. But it's also important for us to maintain that win-win scenario with our customers and make sure that we're being here with the market. Operator : Your next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Can you talk to us a little bit about the impacts of inflation, both on how you're looking at current jobs you're bidding for currently and how you've maybe protected yourself on the backlog and so forth, and how you're viewing that over the next 12 or 18 months? Paul Szurek : I'll talk about construction and then pass it over to Jeff to cover the rest of the question, Frank, and thanks for it. I mean, I think we're, like all the other data center builders and builders in general that we are expecting increases in prices on future projects. SV9 would probably be the first major one where we would deal with that. All of our current projects were already bought out and we don't see any issues there. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be, because some things are, as Chairman Powell says, transitory and others may not be, but I know that our construction team will work hard to manage those cost increases down. And I expect that all of our peers will be facing the same and that may have some impact on market pricing as well. So there's a lot of variables and we'll just try to manage our way through it as best we can. Jeff Finnin : And Frank, the only other thing I would add is maybe just three real quick items, in addition to the construction side that Paul alluded to. Obviously, we watch closely on the impact to our cost structure, salaries and related costs and it's something we're continuing to watch. And we obviously work with our HR team and advisers as to what we need to do there. Secondly, customers, we got to be aware of what it does from a customer standpoint. Our typical lease three to four years, it does give us that opportunity to renegotiate where those economics are fairly -- in a fairly near-term basis. So I don't see a significant impact from that perspective. And then third, the other area that we're obviously watching and paying attention to is the extent that we do start seeing that inflation on a consistent basis, what does that do to interest rates and then how does that impact our overall timing associated with our capital needs and plans there. Paul Szurek : The only other thing I'd add is that as it relates to the buildings that we've already built, a lot of the inflation risk is taken out as we just need to build out additional floors and computer rooms. Operator : Your next question, Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Nate Crossett : I just wanted to go back to the re-leasing spread question again. I get the 2% to 5% is what you've historically done. But if I'm looking at kind of the expiration schedule over the next few years, it kind of looks like the rates that are expiring are pretty similar to what you've done year to date. So I'm just curious, after this year, what are you kind of thinking for what renewal spreads could look like? Jeff Finnin : Nate, let me try and address that as best as I can. But I think the best way to think of it is in line with what Steve talked about from an analytical perspective. I think our best data point is how we've been able to execute in the past. The thing that will impact that positively and/or negatively ultimately is the types of customer and leases that we're renewing, i.e. is it more of our retail and scale versus large scale and hyperscale. Those do play some impact. And then the geographical dispersion of where those leases are being renewed, how is the supply and demand look in each of those markets and how hard is it really to lift and shift some of this deployment. So those are other things that enter into and factor into how we're able to execute there. Hard to say where that's going to head here over the next couple of years, but obviously, we'll provide additional details as we get closer to next year. Nate Crossett : I think in the prepared remarks, there was kind of an allusion to larger deals maybe in the back half. I'm just curious if any of those looking at SV7, what's the update there? And then I think it sounded like there was a move forward of the SV9 after a council meeting. So I'm just wondering what exactly are the next steps for that project? Steve Smith : Just to give you some color on SV7. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're excited to see where SV8 has come and reaching 98% occupancy. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, I think it's important to take a look at the campus overall as to how we manage space and try to drive efficient use of that, and maximizing shareholder value throughout the campus. So as we have now filled up really all of SV8, we now turn to the remaining larger spaces that are available, including SV7 and look to populate that with customer demand. So the pipeline still is encouraging in the Santa Clara market. And without saying too much, I think we're well positioned. So that's where I just believe SV7 and I guess as far as SV9 is concerned, Paul, I don't know if you wanted to mention anything that's on SV9? Paul Szurek : So we were very glad to receive the unanimous approval of the Santa Clara City Council. And that's probably the biggest step in the process but there are a couple of other steps. We've got to complete the detailed permitting, finalizing the power station plan. But meanwhile, with this zoning entitlement, we can do a lot of pre-construction work that will shorten the put once we start construction. When that start will occur will depend upon market conditions, so i.e., supply and demand in the market, what our absorption rate and funnel looks like in the Santa Clara market, as well as what kind of pre-construction commitments we can achieve to accelerate that. So I can't really predict when we'll start construction, but we'll have a lot more optionality around that with this zoning approval behind us. Jeff Finnin : Nate, one more thing I should also address with you, specific to your questions on lease spreads, as I'm thinking more about your question. In this quarter, we did sign and renew a power shale customer inside one of our locations. That did bring that rate down, as you know, power shale rates are lower than our typical turnkey. So just so you're aware, as you think about that $1.49 for this quarter, you exclude that one power shale deal, those rates would be much more in line with what we've done over the last several quarters. So just to give you some additional insight there and thinking about for the next couple of years. Nate Crossett : And just on the deals for the end of the year. Is part of that funnel for kind of immediate take-up of space or could some of that kind of be funneled toward an eventual SV9? Steve Smith : Our goal is to maximize the space that we have before we start building new. We obviously don't want to go dark in a market but we've got good runway. And if you look at the historical absorption that we've seen in that market, we typically sold roughly 6 megawatts in a year in Santa Clara and we've got room to run there. So we'll sell the capacity that we have while we work on building SV9. Operator : The next question, Jon Atkin with RBC. Jon Atkin : So I was interested in asking you kind of just more broadly about the inventory -- the start of the year, you talked about 40 megawatts to sell still where are we on that and are you confident just selling -- are you confident of kind of selling the 40 million, I guess? And then as you look across the markets where you've got some substantial capacity, whether it's West Coast, Chicago or Virginia, where do you feel kind of most positive about the supply demand dynamics? Jeff Finnin : Jon, just to answer your first part of your question, we ended the quarter with 37 megawatts of capacity we can sell into the marketplace. That includes the 4 megawatts that will be vacated here at the end of the third quarter/early fourth quarter from SV7. And when you look at the distribution of those 37 megawatts, it is in large part in our top five markets. So think about the Bay Area, where I think we've got about 12 megawatts. LA, Chicago, New York and Virginia each have somewhere between 4 to 6, just depending on the market. Steve Smith : And ironically, as I look to the overall supply demand and overall customer\u2019s requirements in each of those markets, I would say that is a good position to be in, because we've seen good growth in each of those markets, a good opportunity, I would say. As you look at New York, we've seen good growth in the financial sector there and continue to see good momentum there and have good capacity to build additional growth there. Santa Clara between SV7 and SV9, we've got good capacity there and the market continues to support that. We saw good growth out of LA in additional phases there. So I think across the board, we've got good capacity where we built out and where the customer demand is. And overall, I think the supply and demand dynamics remain in balance. So Virginia also remains, I think, a good opportunity for us. So collectively, I think we're in a better position than we have been in the past where we've really had just kind of spotty capacity in certain markets and now we're able to address that in multiple markets, which is a nice place to be. Jon Atkin : And then as you talked about the sales pipeline, any way to qualitatively give a little bit more color at historically the upper end of the range or record levels, near record levels, or kind of on par with historical levels as you think about late stage sales pipeline? Steve Smith : I think the overall size of the pipeline has remained fairly consistent over the last several quarters. I think the quality of the pipeline has actually gotten better. And as you look at our retail and small scale leasing being above the 12 month trail, I think that's a representation of that. And as I already mentioned, I think as we go forward, we look to build on that and then also execute opportunistically around that large-scale and hyperscale opportunity as they present themselves and either contribute value to the ecosystem or value what we bring to them. So we'll play that out as it goes. Operator : Next question, Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : So I just wanted to follow-up. So Jeff, I think on maybe the fourth quarter call, we talked a little bit about commencements and the potential for you guys to be or see something north of $40 million in this year in commencements. So you're sitting at $14 million or so year-to-date. Is that still on the table? Jeff Finnin : Jordan, I'm not sure if we mentioned commencements or more specific, I think it was just to our sales targets for the year that Steve just alluded to. So I think that's what\u2026 Jordan Sadler : Sales execution, right. Yes. Steve Smith : I'll just give you a little comment there, Jordan. I mean, as you look to where we pay so far, I think we're we're pacing towards that. And we expect some lumps as we go through the second half of the year. I think the $40 million is a general target and that can be north of that or slightly less of that depending upon the mix of opportunities and the profitability and the flow through. So as you saw in some of the pricing and the smaller scale and retail sales that have been generated, we'll see how that overall mix plays out. But so far, we're still targeting that $40 million. Jordan Sadler : And then coming back to the lease spreads in the quarter, obviously, a good number historically when you've seen something unusual you flagged it. But was this plus 4%, plus 7% on the cash and GAAP renewals, was that broad based on the 330 leases or was there a big lease or two that kind of drove the upside? Paul Szurek : Jordan, it was fairly dispersed across all of our markets, nothing in which we would point out that was unusually high or low in the market or in the quarter. So overall, it was pretty well dispersed throughout all the renewals we did this quarter. Jordan Sadler : And then lastly, maybe, Jeff, while I have you, the chiller replacement, I'm trying to better understand this. Is this maintenance CapEx or is it revenue or return generating Capex? And maybe you can walk us through the ROIC math on this chiller plant, total cost versus savings? Jeff Finnin : No, that investment we made is included in our recurring CapEx dollars. So that overall investment is inside there and some of it is in expansion, just to give you some idea. Since the chiller will facilitate cooling in the entire data center, the portion that replaces current cooling infrastructure is going through maintenance capital, anything for new infrastructure is going through our expansion capital. But we've got about, in total, through several quarters here over the last three quarters, about $15 million going through recurring. Overall investment, I think, was somewhere right around $25 million. And returns are expected, Paul could clarify, but it's somewhere in the mid to upper teens overall once it gets up and running. Paul Szurek : And just to add to what Jeff said. When we did this chiller replacement, we actually replaced some chillers that were quite at end of life, but it just made a whole lot more sense to replace them now, build a chiller with tremendously greater economies of scale and efficiency. And it's the energy savings that primarily drives return but it also enables us to better utilize the power throughout the data center, because of the cooling capacity it provides. And on top of everything else, it tremendously strengthens the resiliency of that facility, especially from a cooling perspective because the new chiller plant is dramatically more effective in that regard than what we had before. So I mean these are small projects. I hate to sound overly excited about them but they make a big difference. I love it when we get one of these done. Operator : Next question, Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : A couple of questions, first is, if you were to take the bookings and results from the retail and the small scale and look at the revenue that, that creates from rent, power, interconnection. What is that revenue stream growing at within your overall portfolio revenue versus the large and hyperscale? And just a second one, if I could, just with regards to the topic on pricing. Are there any significant leases that you may have or groups of leases at some point down the road where we just need to be mindful that for whatever the reason, those rents got to be significantly above market? Jeff Finnin : Michael, the answer to your first question, here's probably the best way to think about it. When you look at the rent component of our sales during the quarter, as Steve alluded to, $7.8 million and focus just on those smaller two components, the retail and small scale, on average, our rent makes up about 55% of our overall revenue associated with those deals. So the other 45% is going to be comprised of power, generally around 25% to 30% and then the rest of it is going to be interconnection. The important thing then to understand is the overall economics that flow down to the bottom line, obviously, as we refer to it as RPX, which is rent, power margin and cross connect revenue. And those are the deals where we get better power margins on them, because most of those deals are not on a metered power model. So they are, overall, as Steve alluded to, better economics for us. In terms of overall growth, I have to get back on a specific number but that gives you some idea how to gauge the math around each of those deals. In terms of your other question around leases longer term on pricing, nothing we would highlight today. The only other thing I would add is, as you think about our business, maybe relative to some of our peers, where there's been some concern on some rent roll downs. Keep in mind, our business being much different. We've only got 12 hyperscale leases in the entire portfolio. And that's the area that I think has received most of that commentary out to the marketplace. And it's just a different business model. Obviously, as you saw, we've increased our rent growth guidance for this year, as Steve and his team continue to execute on those lease renewals coming up through the rest of the year. But just keep that in mind as you think about us relative to what else you might be hearing in the industry. Operator : Next question, Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Erik Rasmussen : It sounds like with SV8 near full capacity, you have a good opportunity to focus on SV7. Can we expect to hear of an update soon regarding sort of backfilling this space? And at this point, are you still expecting to do that with smaller retail leases rather than scale type deals? Steve Smith : I mean, overall, that is the space, the larger space that we have to sell on the campus at this point. So it can be anywhere from 6 to 9 megawatts, depending upon the mix and the density. But that is the space that we're selling into today. So you can expect to see some leasing in that space and it will be likely multi-tenant. So that's probably the best color I can give you. Paul Szurek : The only thing I'd add, though, is that we haven't in the past said it would be focused on retail. We've said multi-tenant and we do expect some of that to be scale. Erik Rasmussen : And then maybe just my follow-up. So it's been addressed, the large-scale has been sort of challenged the last couple of quarters. Any hurdles to winning this business, or is it we now at a point where there's enough momentum and it's more of just a timing issue based on some of the sales funnel commentary that you've talked about? Steve Smith : It's really more of a timing issue and a fit issue more than anything else. As you look at the trailing two years really around our leasing trend, you pull out the three hyperscale deals that we've done over the past two years and the sales results are actually up, I think, 5% or so. So they are lumpy. Those three deals make the difference in the averages. And we do expect more lumps as we go forward, but the timing of those and how they fit our portfolio, and as I mentioned, bring either more value to our ecosystem or value the ecosystem we've already built that is not -- every hyperscale deal that's out there, so we won't compete on all of them, but the ones that do meet that criteria, we expect to win and they are out there. So we're actively pursuing several of those and we'll see how they play out. Operator : Next question, Colby Synesael with Cowen. Colby Synesael : Two questions. One, for Silicon Valley 9, great to see the the local board approval. But one of the things that we've heard of is just there's the power constraints, particularly Silicon Valley power. Is that a real concern for you? Do you think that when you finally get to that point, you will be allocated power or is that potentially a long pole in the tent that could delay the project by a pretty material amount of time, months, if not quarters? And then secondly, you mentioned the word edge a few times. I'm just curious if you could be a little bit more descriptive in terms of what you mean by you're seeing edge deployments and how these might be different than what you've historically seen from these types of customers? Paul Szurek : I'll let Steve handle the second part of that question. Colby, good question about power. We've obviously been working with the local utility extensively through the process. We won't start the construction, as you implied, until we have secure power for the facility. Our discussions are going well from what we've seen of their path to providing the power. It looks very reasonable and achievable. The I's need to be dotted and the T's crossed. But so far, the time line for that should not lead to a significant delay. But as you know, in that market you can be surprised. Steve Smith : As far as the edge piece is concerned, Colby, as you've heard from us and I think you're seeing broad base across the market. The hybrid multi-cloud edge use cases continue to grow and become more commonplace with enterprises and with them become more demand for close proximity of cloud adjacent types of services. So we're seeing more build out and more demand around that. They may not be hyperscale type of deployments but they are more resident in the campus where customers can gain close access to them and in many cases, on ramps. You may have seen some of the press releases earlier this quarter around GCI having their native deployments, both in Chicago and the Bay Area. And we also had Express Route from Microsoft be delivered in Chicago as well. So having those two on-ramps being native in our Chicago campus, we feel like really bolsters those edge type of deployments and the overall ecosystem there. Operator : Next question David Guarino with Green Street. David Guarino : Going back to the chiller plant project in Boston and I think you did one in LA a couple of years ago. How much of that maintenance CapEx is being driven by CoreSite's desires versus tenants desires? And have you had any conversations with some of your larger customers that are pushing you towards upgrading equipment in order to meet some of their environmental goals? Paul Szurek : Honestly, we pushed these two projects and they weren't responsive to customer requests. But if you look at our ESG report on our Web site, you'll see that energy efficiency is one of our big focuses. And I think we stack up pretty well compared to the rest of the industry and what we've achieved and how we've improved over the last few years. There is a lot of customer desire for their vendors to continue to work on improved energy efficiency and other elements of the environmental matrix and we continue to move forward on those, as well as wanting to make sure that facilities are resilient and have the right infrastructure and are operated well. And we continue to -- I think our team does a great job in that respect. And meanwhile, we continue to look for where we need to invest to make it easier for them to do that job. David Guarino : And do you anticipate a trend, I guess, of maybe customers pushing more towards upgrading data centers? Is that something you guys are thinking about over the next few years? Paul Szurek : Honestly, we're not hearing it significantly from most customers, and it's something that we're already doing and focused on anyway. So I don't know that we would feel the pressure as much as others would. David Guarino : And then maybe just one last one. Following up on those comments you made, I think you might have been -- Jeff on re-leasing rates holding up better for CoreSite's portfolio relative to some of the hyperscale focused portfolios. Is that a similar trend across the entire retail colocation market or is your portfolio just outperforming? And I guess, how do those customer negotiations work? Do they come to the table with some data points and say, here's what market rents are that we see and this is what we want and you guys push back. It would be great to just kind of hear some color on how those negotiations work. Jeff Finnin : David, I would just say, obviously, we try to watch what our peers are doing in this space, especially those that are more aligned with some of the retail colocation that we offer at the same time, I do think you're -- it's not going to be complete to apples-to-apples, just given the differences in our assets and some of the network dense and kind of the cloud enabled data centers that we have. So it's not going to be completely apples to apple but something we clearly watch. I really can't tell you, at least for the private ones, how they're doing. But we feel very comfortable and confident in our ability to get paid for the value that has been built in our differentiating platform. But Steve can give you some additional color on those conversations. Steve Smith : As far as the conversations are concerned, it's really customer-by-customer and what their deployment looks like, what their use case is, how long they've been with us, their historical rent role and how that is relative to market. So all of that comes into play in each customer conversation and they're all different. So we manage those accordingly based off of the market dynamics and the customer situation, and that's probably the best, I guess, color I can give you as to how those conversations go. Operator : Next question, Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Richard Choe : The retail business has been pretty steady but the small-scale business has kind of ramped from under $2 million a quarter to well over that. Can you let us know what's going on there in terms of the strength? And then also, is that return profile any different than the retail, small scale versus retail? Steve Smith : It really depends on the deployment. But overall, we kind of lump those into similar buckets, I would say. And it's good to look at those individually. The use cases can be similar. So most of our leasing, as I mentioned earlier, especially the new leasing was around enterprise sales and that's the primary focus of the team is driving new logos in that are enterprise and that are contributing or valuing the ecosystem. So I don't know if there's any radical trends there other than you're seeing, I think, more enterprises kind of go towards that hybrid multi-cloud environment where they establish their own footprint in our data center and then leverage cloud on-ramps in order to kind of build out that overall cloud architecture. So I don't think there's any massive shift there other than just -- we're executing better against the enterprise. And I think the enterprise is continuing to kind of rationalize that cloud versus on-prem model. Richard Choe : And it seems like overall strength has been pretty good, if not better than expected. Does that kind of -- I know churn guidance hasn't changed, but it seems like that might put less pressure on churn overall. Any comments there? Steve Smith : No, I don't think so. Our guidance is our guidance because it's the best estimate that we have. So we'll continue to monitor it. And as I mentioned earlier, our goal is to sell unique value that customers want to come and stay. And once they do build out their architecture, it is a bit more complex than a single network connection that makes it easier to leave. So if we can provide more value that makes them want to stay longer then hopefully, that reduces the churn risk long term, but we'll see how that plays out. Operator : The next question, Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Brendan Lynch : It sounded like you had about 26 new logos in the quarter and six with multi metro deployments. If you can just put this in the context of what has been your traditional historical run rate? Steve Smith : As far as the number of logos at 26, it's a little bit lower than the trail. Typically, we're in the roughly 30-ish range is probably the best way to think of the numbers. But if you look at the dollars that are contributing from those logos, it's actually one of our higher quarters in terms of true dollars. So the size has come up a bit. I think the quality has come up a bit. The actual numbers was a little lower but not outside the trail. Brendan Lynch : I think some of your peers have suggested that they're starting to see more new logos kind of emerging post pandemic. Is that something you're seeing as well that these customers have kind of been on the sidelines, but they're coming back more aggressively at this point? Steve Smith : Overall, the pipeline is strong, as I mentioned earlier. It's been strong for the last year and half, I would say, as we entered the pandemic, it really highlighted those enterprises that were challenged with distributed work, how they manage their supply chain, how they sell remotely. So it's been at the forefront for a lot of enterprises. And now that they're kind of coming out of it, we'll see how the latest dynamics play out. But they're really trying to figure out how they rationalize that for their long-term strategy. And all of the trends that we see, the analysts that we talk to, point towards this hybrid multi-cloud environment, which we think we're well positioned for. So yes, we're encouraged with where things are headed. Operator : Next question, Nick del Deo with MoffetNathanson. Nick del Deo : I guess, first, there's obviously been a lot of noise regarding new regulations on Chinese tech companies and the kind of general friction between the US and China. I was wondering if you could update us on your exposure to to China based companies, whether they've contributed all to leasing in recent periods? And whether you've observed any shift in tone or commentary regarding their intentions to remain in the US or exit the market? Paul Szurek : Obviously, there has been some noise and we watch it closely as well. I would just point you to some information we had put into one of our investor presentations in early 2020. I want to say maybe second quarter 2020. Kate's shaking her head. So I think that's it. Whereby we quantified what that exposure is from some of our Chinese or I should say, our customers domiciled in China and that was 7% at that time. It has not materially changed from that point in time. Obviously, something we continue to watch closely. Nick del Deo : Any qualitative commentary regarding how customer intentions may have changed since then or nothing to update on? Steve Smith : Nick, I would say that as far as overall demand is concerned, I think that has a bit muted over the last year, I would say, maybe a bit longer. Some of that gets absorbed by other partners that we have that also support that market. So collectively, that helps us in that regard. But I think some of the larger players, the hyperscale providers, that's not really the market that we played in, in many cases anyway. So I think we're a bit removed from direct impact of what that might be anyway. Nick del Deo : And then, Steve, maybe to follow-up on one comment you made earlier in the call. You noted that the quality of your scale funnel, you thought had improved over time, even though the size was roughly the same. How do you define quality? Is it the quality of the customers? Is it their potential contribution to your ecosystem, is it the likelihood of the deal closing or some other measure? Steve Smith : I think it's all of that. I think you summed it up well. I mean there's a lot of larger opportunities and frankly, even smaller opportunities that just are not a good fit that are looking for the lowest cost provider out there with a network connection. And we're probably not a great fit for them. For those customers that are looking for high resiliency, high performance, interconnection, to multi-cloud types of architectures and multi markets that they can connect to, were a better fit for us. So that does not hold true for every single opportunity that's out there. But those that do value us, that's what we're really striving for. So I think our messaging is better on how we attract those. Our funnel is, I think, cleaner and better quality. And you're seeing some of that show up, I think. So we'll see how it all plays out but we're encouraged by it so far. Operator : Next question, Michael Funk with Bank of America. Michael Funk : First, on interconnection, I think last year, maybe third quarter, you mentioned that you thought maybe some demand got pulled forward into 2020 and we did see a sequential deceleration in the rate of growth there this quarter. Is that part of what you're seeing? And if not, do you expect that growth rate to pick back up exiting 2021? Jeff Finnin : Michael, I think as we came into 2021 what we anticipated, I should say, what we've seen historically is roughly two thirds of that. Revenue growth was really just coming from pure increase in volumes but the other third increases in rates around renewals, people migrating from a lower priced product to a higher priced product, et cetera. We felt as though that second portion, that one third contribution would be more muted this year as we headed into 2021 just given some of the activity we've seen over the last couple of years. I think it has trended towards that direction, probably not as quickly as we anticipated. And so we're still getting about 85% of our revenue growth coming from pure increase in volumes. The other roughly 15% is coming from those customers who are migrating to higher priced products as they expand their business or price increases on renewals with some of our customers, et cetera. I don't think about going forward [Multiple Speakers] your second part of your question, as you think about going forward. I don't know how that plays out for 2022 yet. We're still evaluating what that looks like based on behavior of the rest of the year and the types of deployments we have. But we'll give some further clarification on it as we get a little bit closer. Michael Funk : And then on churn, the churn dynamics. Are you seeing different drivers of customer churn today versus a couple of years ago? Meaning either more customers remain in your facility but handing back some space or more customers that are fully vacating. Has there been a shift in the driver of churn or is that pretty consistent with where it has been historically? Jeff Finnin : The only thing I would add and maybe comment on, and we may have talked about this earlier, is that a couple of years ago we just saw some of that elevated churn resulting from those business models that we felt were a little bit more compromised from the cloud than others. And that is largely left our portfolio at this point. I think we got about 1% out. And what I'm talking about are some of those resellers and managed service providers, many of which we used to have in our portfolio. That's the only thing I would point to in terms of changing. I don't think the behavior themselves have changed. Customers are always looking to either grow or maybe shrink their portfolio based on what's going on with their individual applications. But I think that's been going on for years. I don't think that, that dynamic has changed, unless Steve has anything else to add there. Steve Smith : No, I don't think so either. And I think we've often been asked, I think, less often now. Is cloud friend or foe? And I think the the answer at this point is yes. But overall, I would say it's friend. And as you look at just the overall adoption of technology across any business that technology ends up in a data center somewhere, even those resellers or cloud providers, they end up in a data center and many times our data center. So the use cases may change, how they deploy them may change but the overall pie continues to grow. And so we think we're well positioned to capture that. Operator : Thank you. I will turn the call back to Paul Szurek for a few closing comments. Please go ahead. Paul Szurek : Well, thank you all for your time and your interest in CoreSite. We're really glad for this quarter and we're looking forward to the future. Our business is built on the concept that in our data centers, enterprises doing hybrid and multi-cloud architectures can realize significant performance and agility improvements and overall cost savings by taking advantage of our campus ecosystems, as well as the fact that our network dense data centers provide a tremendous location for servicing the customers in our major edge markets. I'm really grateful for the colleagues that I work with, that we all work with. They do a tremendous job and they're the reason that we're able to continue to perform, and I expect them to enable us to continue to perform well going forward.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Igor Khislavsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Igor Khislavsky : Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower 's third quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We've posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www. americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will discuss current technology trends and how we're positioned to benefit from continued wireless technology evolution. And then Rob Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO, and Treasurer, will discuss our Q3 2021 results and revised full-year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2021 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance. Our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19. And any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release.  Those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2020, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Igor. Good morning, everyone. Consistent with our prior Q3 callSteward, my comments today will center on the key trends driving our business now, and how we think the technological landscape will develop in the future. I'll touch on how we're positioned to benefit as 5G deployments accelerate in cloud-native applications in the edge of all, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, I'll spend some time discussing our European markets, where we now have a scaled presence and are poised to create further value as technology evolves there and then briefly cover what we are seeing in our earlier stage international markets. Finally, I'll outline some of the progress we've made in some of those same emerging markets and the platform expansion side, particularly with respect to our investments in sustainability and renewable energy as we continue to lead the industry into a greener future.  At a high level, much of my commentary today will sound familiar to those of you who have listened in on prior technology-focused calls, and we view that as a positive. Technology is evolving and advancing right in line with our expectations. And the long-term secular trends that have driven and continue Steward to drive our business remains strong. There are also new developments in the marketplace around the overall digital ecosystem that we're excited about, and our tenants continue to power ahead with their network augmentation and expansion activities. Taken together, this is a backdrop that we expect will lead to sustained attractive growth for us over the long term. Central to this belief is the view that our core global macro tower business will be the foundation of our success, and the main driver of our cash flows for the foreseeable future as macro towers should remain the most cost, and technology efficient network deployment solution in most topographies worldwide. Our conviction in this regard has only grown stronger over time, supported by our customers' significant investments in new spectrum assets, record levels of wireless capex spending in markets like the United States, and numerous public statements by them indicating their intention to utilize macro sites to drive aggressive deployments of 5G and other wireless technologies globally. We continue to view mid-band spectrum, which includes the recently auctioned C-band and the 2.5 gig band currently being deployed in the U.S, as the workhorse of the true 5G experience.  And we believe to be the fundamental enabler of the immersive next-generation 5G applications and use cases that are set to emerge as coverage improves and advanced devices penetrate the market. Importantly, we continue to expect the propagation characteristics of these sub-6-gig frequencies compared to traditionally deployed mobile spectrum, to necessitate significant network densification over the long term supporting a multi-year period of strong growth on our tower sitesSteward. We're seeing the leading edge of this activity in the U.S. today, generating record services revenues, driven by all of the major carriers as they accelerate the early stages of their respective 5G deployments. Further, application volumes within our property business are strong, supported by expected wireless CapEx spend in the mid-$30 billion range this year. Industry experts anticipate that these elevated levels of capital spending will be sustained for a number of years driven by a mobile data usage growth CAGR of more than 25% over the next five years. Amazingly, this follows a more than 25% CAGR for the last five years, and cumulative growth of approximately 7,500% over the last decade. This compelling demand backdrop, coupled with the long-term non-cancelable leases that comprise our more than $60 billion global contractual backlog gives us confidence in our ability to drive organic tenant billings growth in the mid-single-digit range on average in the U.S. through 2027, and to drive higher growth rates abroad in that same period. I will touch on this further in a few minutes, but as a quick reminder, these baseline growth expectations exclude any material contributions from our various platform expansion initiatives. What they do include are expectations for an extended period of solid growth in our European markets, where we are seeing similar network growth trends in the United StatesSteward with early-stage 5G deployments set to accelerate in the coming years. We expect that our newly scaled European presence will allow us to drive long-term value creation as the explosion of mobile data usage across the region continues and the need for communications infrastructure accelerates as a result.  Across Germany, Spain, and France, where 5G mobile subscriptions currently make up less than 5% of the total user base, we expect mobile data usage per smartphone to grow by more than 25% annually for the next five years, similar to the United States, and consequently expect CapEx spend across the three markets to exceed $11 billion annually over a similar time period. And as happened in the U.S. we're already seeing this acceleration in network investment translate into elevated activity. In fact, in the third quarter, normalizing for the impacts of Telxius Steward deal, co-locationSteward and amendment contributions to European organic tenant billings growth rose by around 200 basis points year-over-year.  Although we expect a significant portion of initial 5G investments to be focused in urban locations across our European footprint where Steward roughly 80% of the population resides, we anticipate urban-oriented consumer demand to be complemented by an ongoing push from European regulators to deliver rural connectivity, which will represent another opportunity for us to drive co-location on our tower sites in those areas. We believe our balance of rural and recently expanded urban assets positions us well to capture significant market share of upcoming 5G deployments over the next decade.  Finally, in our earlier stage, markets across Latin America, Asia, and Africa, we continue to see solid demand for our critical infrastructure, largely driven by deployment of legacy network technologies, particularly 4G. Whether looking at Brazil, Mexico, India, or Nigeria, consumers are rapidly increasing their utilization of smartphones, thereby driving mobile data usage growth higher. In many of these regions, existing network infrastructure is insufficient to support this deluge Stewardof usage as cell-site Steward performance is challenged with increased levels of network load. In response to these trends, we are aggressively marketing our existing assets and continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities to bolster our footprint in these markets.  But at the same time, we have significantly ramped up our new build program given the tremendous need for entirely new infrastructure. In fact, if you take the nearly 5,900 sites we built last year and add our expected 7,000 sites at the midpoint of our outlook to be constructed this year, it would represent almost as many sites as the previous 5-years combined. And as we laid out a few quarters ago, we are targeting the construction of up to 40,000 to 50,000 new sites over the next 5 years. With day one NOI yields on these builds continuing to average above 10%, we are excited about deploying significant capital to these initiatives going forward, as we capitalize on the advancement of network technology across the emerging world. While helping to connect billions of people. In addition, to the core secular growth trends driving our Global Tower business, we're seeing indications, particularly in more mature markets like the U.S., of a broad evolution within the overall wireless ecosystem, as Evolution is closely intertwined with 5G and includes an increased prevalence of cloud native network solutions. More emphasis on the various permutations of the network edge. And an ever-increasing intersection of the wired and wireless portions of today's converged network architecture. As networks virtualize O-RAN or Open RAN, is expected to become a more important option to improve their economics.  We are now starting to see this phenomenon with DISH in the U.S. and in Germany were 1&1 is spoken extensively about its intent to utilize this technology. By utilizing O-RAN, carriers have the potential to optimize network design and drive cost efficiencies, freeing up incremental capital to invest in densification and other network enhancements that help drive growth in site deployments in co-locations. Importantly, the role of the Tower in this evolving network design is as critical as ever. While base station functionality will likely continue to evolve to be cloud native software Agile, the radio equipment that is placed on the tower itself, which has always driven our revenue, will continue to reside on the Tower.  Importantly, we believe we can leverage our extensive global distributed real estate portfolio to not only drive continued strong growth within our core Tower business, but also to take advantage of other emerging opportunities as Networks virtualize. This may include multi-access edge computing, and potential other Edge Cloud permutations of neutral host infrastructure. At the end of the day, modern software driven networks are becoming smarter, faster, more capable, and more dynamic. And we're focused on ensuring that American Tower has a meaningful role to play in this context on the infrastructure and real estate side of the equation. One of the areas we focused on is the development of the network edge. Or more accurately, the development of multiple layers of the network edge, with the need for lower latency expected to become more and more critical over time with applications like AR, VR telemedicine, real-time analytics, autonomous driving, entertainment streaming.  You name it, and many others are beginning to merge. We continue to believe that this can be a meaningful opportunity for American Tower. As we've done more work on the evolution of the Edge, the concept of multiple edge layers has come into better focus. Today, for example, by far the most prevalent layer is the regional Metro edge owned for the most part by the large data center companies where vast amounts of data processing is in centralized. These locations provide access to cloud on-ramps and are absolutely critical within today's networks. We expect this need to be the case for the foreseeable future. In fact, if the volume of data carried across networks continues to explode, we anticipate the demand for these types of large scale facilities will only grow. The upside of these locations is their size and capacity. The downside, which to this point hasn't been all that relevant, is the fairly significant network transit costs in latency built into reaching the central compute functions. As the data often has to travel hundreds of miles to reach these destinations. These transit costs and latency considerations, which we expect to become more important in the future, will necessitate more edge locations as up linked data increases from IOT use cases and demands for distributed computing advance. The next layer beyond the Metro edge in our view, will be the aggregation edge. Here you're likely to host Syrian hubs in future MEK applications as network virtualization advances, along with distributed data processing, AI inferencing, and other compute functions, which will need reduced latency. The major hyper-scalars continue to evolve their edge cloud platforms, so that they can extend computing capabilities deeper into the mobile access network at the aggregation edge. The next layer beyond this, which we term the access edge, is where our existing tower sites are located today, offering an opportunity to meaningfully enhance the value of our legacy real estate.  We expect to eventually see V-RAD and O-RAN network functions, AI inferencing, Data Cashing, and a variety of other next-generation AR and VR cloud-native, ultra-low latency applications residing at these locations. Finally, we've also identified the on-premise edge, which would lie beyond even our tower sites and could eventually help support private networks, smart factories, and a host of other applications located at the end-user's site. The end of the day, our 20,000 foot view is that all of these edge elements will need to fit together to provide a cohesive framework for full scale 5G across the network ecosystem. The goal for us is to figure out what the optimal linkages between the layers look like.  Who the key players will be. And what elements of the edge we may want to own in order to further enhance the strong long-term growth we expect from our core existing business. To date, as we seek to connect the dots, we've been active with a number of trial edge compute sites at the access edge, while also operating our COLO-ATL Metro Data Center interconnection facility in Atlanta. Through these investments, we have built relationships with key existing and potential future customers. I've learned a tremendous amount about key demand trends, and I've had a front row seat for the beginning stages of the convergence of wireless and wireline networks that I alluded to earlier.  More recently, we acquired DataSite, a data center Company consisting of two multi-tenant data centers in the Atlanta area and in Orlando. In addition to strengthening our existing position in Atlanta, the addition of a network dense carrier hotel facility in Orlando, provides us with a strong Southeastern presence, with a profile and characteristics that we believe will be critical in the early evolution of the Metro edge, as we evaluate its role in the mobile networks of the future. We expect these facilities, which have 18 megawatts of combined power and additional 4.5 megawatts of expansion capacity, to effectively complement COLO-ATL and enable us to enhance our ability to develop neutral host, multi-operator, multi-cloud data centers to support the broader Quarta Edge connectivity evolution in the U.S.. We continue to believe that while a scaled, application, driven edge oriented business model, is still likely several years away, it has the potential to be a sizable market opportunity with meaningful potential upside. Not only in the U.S., but also on a global basis. Leading global M&O's are now positioning their networks with Release 16, 5G stand-alone core features to explore Edge Cloud opportunities. And with our distributed macro side presence, key markets around the world, we think we're well-positioned to potentially be a provider of choice on the edge, particularly for large multinational M&O's, and other categories of customers who maybe looking for a multi-market solution.  Switching gears a bit, while we believe edge compute will eventually also be relevant in emerging markets, it is unlikely to happen in the immediate future. Consequently, we have focused our platform expansion efforts across our developing regions in other areas, most notably on increasing the sustainability and efficiency of power provisioning in our sites. As we highlighted in our recently published 2020 corporate sustainability report. We've continued to make progress toward our goal of reducing diesel-related greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2027, from a 2017 baseline. In 2020, we achieved an additional 8% reduction from 2019 reaching 53% of the 10-year of goal.  We're continuing to make solid progress in 2021 with an expectation to spend an additional $80 million or its energy efficient solutions primarily in lithium, Ion, and solar power across our Africa footprint, which will bring our cumulative spend to nearly $250 million. And as we announced earlier this week, we are furthering our commitment to combat climate change by adopting science-based targets, which we expect to help inform our future investments and sustainability. In addition to the positive environmental benefits from these investments, we are also delivering shareholder value through AFFO per share accretion. Lithium-ion batteries provide significant energy efficiency, density, and lifespan improvements over legacy solutions.  And while to-date, AFFO benefits to American Tower have largely come through fuel savings, we anticipate over time that our yields on these investments will further expand as we are able to lengthen battery and generator replacement cycles. Having already expanded our lithium-ion powered site count from 4500 in 2019 to 6700 in 2020, we are targeting another 8,000 sites by the end of 2022. And recently signed a multi-million dollar bulk battery purchase agreement in Africa in support of this goal. Importantly, we believe that energy efficiency, the use of renewables and sustainability in our broader sense, can represent an important competitive advantage for us.  Not only from the flow through to AFFO, but also the differentiation and service quality for our customers. We continue to view sustainability as a critical component of our Company culture and will be highlighting our continued progress in future sustainability reports, which I encourage all of you to read by the way. In closing, our excitement around 5G on a global basis continues to grow. Consumers and enterprises are using more advanced devices for more things, resulting in consistent elevated growth in mobile data usage, which in turn strains existing wireless networks and necessitates incremental densification and network improvement. Considerable new spectrum is being deployed, new entrants and select markets are building Greenfield networks.  And our macro Tower oriented portfolio remains well-positioned to capture a significant portion of wireless investment activity. In addition, through our platform expansion strategy, we are focused on ensuring that the Company benefits from the ongoing convergence of wireless and wireline and the associated expansion of virtualization in cloud native applications throughout the network ecosystem. Importantly, as we optimize our core business, and look for ways to further enhance our growth path in the broader digital infrastructure world. We are as committed as ever to driving profitability, sustainability, and recurring growth. We're energized by the future and are excited to be in a vibrant industry that is helping to connect the world. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our third quarter results and updated full-year 2021 outlook. Rod. Rod Smith : Thanks, Tom and thank you, everyone for joining today's call. I hope you and your families are well. Q3 was another quarter of strong performance for us. And as you heard from Tom, we are as encouraged as ever by the technological trends that underpin our long-term growth potential. Before digging into the details of our results and raised outlook, I'd like to touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, we closed on our strategic partnership agreements with CDPQ and Allianz, through which they purchased an aggregate of 48% of our ATC Europe business for total consideration of around EUR 2.6 billion. In addition, we closed the remaining 4,000 Telsey's communication sites in Germany back in August. With the transaction now fully closed and funded, our teams are working to rapidly integrate the assets and we're already seeing encouraging activity on the portfolio.  Second, we continued to strengthen our Balance Sheet, raising roughly $3 billion in senior unsecured notes, including our euro offering earlier this month. Through our financing transactions, we've been able to maintain an attractive weighted average cost of debt while also continuing to extend our maturities. As a result of this activity, along with the benefit from a non-recurring advanced payment received from a tenant during the quarter, we finished Q3 with net leverage of 4.9 times. While we expect net leverage to increase back into the low 5 times range in the fourth quarter, we are right on track with our overall post healthiest delevering path. And lastly, we saw another quarter of record services activity in the U.S. as carriers accelerated 5G related projects. We view this as a leading indicator of strong levels of gross leasing in our property segment as we head into 2022 and beyond. And with that, please turn to slide six and I'll review our Q3 property revenue in organic tenant billings, growth. As you can see, our consolidated property revenue grew by over 19% year-over-year or over 18% on an FX -neutral basis to nearly $2.4 billion. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of around 10% and international property revenue growth of over 31% or 13% when excluding the impacts of the Telxius acquisition. This strong performance is indicative of a continuation of the long-term secular trends driving demand for our infrastructure, assets across the globe. Moving to the right side of the slide, we also had a solid quarter of organic tenant billings growth throughout the business. On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billings growth was nearly 5% for a second consecutive quarter. As expected, U.S. 5G investments from the major carriers drove healthy activity levels, leading to organic tenant billings growth in our U.S. and Canada segment of over 4%. Contributions from co-location and amendments were more than 3%, escalators came in at 3.2%, and churn was just over 2%. Moving to our international operations, we drove organic tenant billings growth of nearly 6%, reflecting a sequential acceleration of around 60 basis points. Africa was our fastest-growing region in the quarter, posting organic tenant billings growth of well over 9%, led by Nigeria, where we continue to see 4G investment driving both co-location activity and new site construction.  We also saw a consistent quarter in Latin America, where organic tenant billings growth was right around 7%, driven by solid new business and higher escalators, primarily in Brazil. Meanwhile, European organic tenant billings growth accelerated by around 100 basis points sequentially to nearly 5.5% as expected. Excluding impacts from the Telxius acquisition, organic tenant billings growth in the region would've been over 4.5% in the quarter, more than 200 basis points higher than the year-ago period, driven primarily by new business contributions. This positive trend reflects both ongoing 4G activity and early 5G investments, leading to solid growth from both co-locations and amendments.  Looking to Germany, in particular, we saw a more than 300 basis point increase in co-location and amendment contributions in our legacy business as compared to the prior year period, resulting in organic tenant billings growth of over 5.5% up from 5.2% in the second quarter. Finally, in Asia-Pacific, we saw organic tenant billings growth of 0.7% up roughly 200 basis points as compared to Q2. This reflects a modest acceleration in gross new business activity coupled with a more than 2% sequential decline in churn, which was in line with our expectations.  Turning to Slide 7, our third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew more than 19% or over 18% on an FX neutral basis to nearly $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.2%, which was down compared to Q3 2020. As a result of adding new lower initial tenancy assets to our portfolio, which we believe will drive strong organic growth and therefore margin expansion in the future. Cash SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was around 7.3%, a roughly 40 basis points sequential improvement. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated AFFO growth was over 13%, with consolidated AFFO per share of $2.53, reflecting a per-share growth of nearly 11%.  This was driven by strong performance in our core business, contributions from new assets and around $13 million in year-over-year FX favorability. Our performance also reflected the benefits of our commitment to driving efficiency throughout our operations and minimizing financing costs, despite growing the portfolio by nearly 38,000 sites over the last year. And finally, AFFO per share attributable to AMT common stockholders, was $2.49, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of nearly 12%. Let's now turn to our updated outlook for the full year. I'll start by reviewing a few of the key updated assumptions. First, our expectations for organic growth across the business are consistent with our prior outlook. Carriers continued to deploy meaningful capital as they invest in network quality. And we're seeing numerous bands of spectrum being deployed for both 4G and 5G. We are also slightly increasing our expectations for services revenue for the year to around $235 million as a result of an out-sized third quarter. Although this implies that services volumes will moderate somewhat in Q4. Second, as a result of our focus on operational efficiency and cost controls, along with some one-time benefits, we expect to be able to take some costs out of the business as compared to our prior expectations. Combined with current services gross marginal performance, this will drive our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations higher for the balance of the year. Third, in India, we are encouraged by recent regulatory reforms, which we believe can provide some much needed breathing room for capital constraint carriers in the marketplace and improve the telecom environment overall. While we believe this is a clear positive first step towards market recovery, we continue to expect flat 2021 organic tenant billings growth in the region as we further evaluate the long-term impacts of these developments on the sector. Finally, incorporating the latest FX projections, our current outlook reflects negative FX impacts of $30 million for property revenue, $20 million for adjusted EBITDA, and $15 million for consolidated AFFO as compared to our prior expectations. With that, let's move to the details of our revised full-year outlook. Looking at Slide 8, as expected, leasing trends remain strong across our global business. And as a result of an increase in pass-through together with some modest core property revenue out-performance, we are raising our property revenue outlook by $10 million. This represents 14% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and includes $30 million in unfavorable trans - lational FX impacts as compared to our prior outlook. Moving to slide 9, you'll see that we are reiterating our organic tenant billings growth expectations of approximately 4% on a consolidated basis. This includes roughly 3% growth in our U.S. and Canada segment where 5G deployments are driving solid activity levels as we exit the year.  As a reminder, we expect the 1st and largest tranche of contractual sprint churn to hit our run rate in the fourth quarter of this year. And while we expect gross activity to remain solid, our guide implies a Q4 U.S organic tenant billings growth rate of -1% as we communicated previously. On the international side, we continue to anticipate organic tenant billings growth in the range of 5% to 6% as carriers continue to focus their efforts on enhancing indensifying wireless networks in the face of ever-rising mobile data demand. Moving to Slide 10, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by approximately $50 million and now expect year-over-year growth of nearly 16%. This increase reflects continued strength in our services segment, where we now expect to see roughly $145 million in services gross margin for the year up from the $123 million implied in our prior guidance with year-over-year growth of more than 180%. On the cost side of the equation, we continue to maintain cost discipline globally, helping to drive adjusted EBITDA margins up by around 40 basis points for the full year as compared to prior expectations. Turning to slide 11, we are also raising our full-year AFFO expectations, and now expect year-over-year growth in consolidated AFFO of roughly 15%, with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.64 per share.  The flow-through of incremental cash adjusted EBITDA, coupled with the continued cash tax and net cash interest benefits as compared to the prior expectations, are being partially offset by around $15 million in negative translational FX impacts. on a per-share basis, we now expect growth of approximately 14% for the year consistent with our long-term growth ambitions that we highlighted at the start of the year. Finally, AFFO, attributable to ATC common stockholders per share is expected to grow by nearly 12% versus 2020, incorporating the minority interest impacts of our strategic partnership with CDPQ and Allianz in Europe.  Moving onto slide 12, let's review our capital deployment expectations for 2021. As you can see, we remain focused on deploying capital towards assets that drive strong sustainable growth in AFFO per share, coupled with a growing dividend providing our investors with a compelling combination of growth plus yields. Working our way through the specific categories. Our first priority remains our dividend. For the full year, we continue to expect to distribute $2.3 billion subject to board approval, which implies a roughly 15% year-over-year per-share growth rate. As a reminder, our dividend growth will continue to be driven by underlying growth in our re-taxable income, incorporating the impacts of MLA, and other moving pieces in the business.  Consistent with our prior comments, we anticipate growing our dividend by at least 10% annually in the coming years. Moving on to CapEx, we reiterate our expectations of spending nearly $1.6 billion at the midpoint with nearly 90% being discretionary in nature. Driving a good portion of this discretionary CapEx is our continued expectation to construct 7,000 sites at the midpoint this year, with the vast majority in our international markets. Turning to acquisitions, including contributions from minority partners, we have deployed around $10 billion so far this year, primarily for the Telxius transaction.  As well as for smaller transactions including data site. In total of our nearly $14 billion in expected capital deployments for the year, we expect over 80% to be composed of discretionary growth CapEx and MLA. Moving to the center of the slide, you can see the composition of our $35 billion in cumulative capital deployments since the start of 2017, including our 2021 full-year expectations. We continue to augment our developed market presence, which we believe positions us optimally to drive value from accelerating 5G deployments and next-generation technology evolutions as Tom laid out earlier. We are also allocating capital towards higher growth, earlier stage markets that are typically at least 5 years behind the U.S. and Europe in their network deployments. Taken together, we believe that our global footprint positions us to capture multiple waves of investments across the globe over a sustained period of time. Finally, you can see that more than a quarter or around $9.5 billion of our deployed capital in the last 5 years has been distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  We continue to view these components as critical to total shareholder returns. Moving to the right side of the chart, supporting this phase of significant investment and growth has been our investment-grade Balance Sheet. We believe that our access to low-cost diversified sources of financing has been a key differentiator and are proactively working to extend this critical competitive advantage into the future. In fact, incorporating our latest financing efforts, we now have a weighted average cost of debt of around 2.4%. A weighted average tenor of debt of approximately seven years, and over 85% of our Balance Sheet locked into fixed rate instruments.  Finally, on Slide 13, and in summary, in Q3, we continue to capitalize on a strong global demand backdrop, delivering our highest quarter of consolidated AFFO per share on record. This was driven by solid organic growth, record-setting services volumes, disciplined cost controls, strategic balance sheet management, and a creative portfolio expansion. As we look ahead, we believe our existing global real estate portfolio is well positioned to drive long-term recurring growth as carriers augment and extend their networks.  And with the strength of our investment-grade Balance Sheet and diversified pool of funding sources, we expect to continue to deploy capital towards creative investments that can enhance our growth path, and enable us to create additional value. Given our positioning at the intersection of real estate and technology, in an ever more interconnected world, we are excited to continue to deliver connectivity to billions of people worldwide in a sustainable way, while driving compelling total returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Michael Rollins with Citi, please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. TwoSteward questions if I could. The first question is on the domestic environment. Just curious if you can give us an update on U.S leasing, how it compared to your prior expectations entering into this year? And what that means for the average of organic tenant billings growth guidance that you provided? I think the average for '21 and '22 was about 2% on a reported basis and about 5% on a normalized basis. And then just, Tom to follow up on your comments on the edge in data centers, is it inevitable that American Tower needs to either partner with a larger data center portfolio or directly ownSteward a larger data center portfolio? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Michael. Maybe, Rod, why don't you take the first part of the question. Rod Smith : Yeah. Tom Bartlett : And then I'll fill in on the second piece. Rod Smith : Okay. Great. Good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. In terms of the U.S. leasing environment, we're seeing a very strong environment. Certainly all the major carriers have been active. You've seen that show up most notably in our services environment. We've seen a tick up in the contribution from colocation and amendment activity into our organic tenant billings growth, so that's been accelerating through each of the last 3 quarters, just as we expected from the outset in the year. So, in terms of our expectations, everything really is right in line with what we expected. I don't want to get too deep into the second part of your question around growth and activity when it comes to 2022, but I will just reiterate a couple of points that we've already made, so directionally your comments are correct.  We guided to an average organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. for '21 and '22 of around 2%. So, you can see we are coming in here in '21 at around 3%. That suggests around 1% organic tenant billings growth for 2022 in the U.S., so that's where we would expect to be. And again, I'm not providing guidance for next year, just reiterating the components of our long-term plan. And maybe one thing that I will highlight here just briefly is that Sprint churn hit us in Q4 for the first time, that first tranche, as you heard in my comments, so Sprint churn, now that it's active, I will just give you the numbers there again, 2021 we are rolling off 195 million of annual Sprint revenue in churn, in 2022, we'll roll off an additional 60, 2023 we'll roll off another 50 million, in 2024 we'll roll-off another 70 million. So that's Sprint churn, and that's what's really causing the lower organic growth rate within our U.S. business. Next year, the gross growth, we see the environment being very strong, accelerating through 2021, and we expect that to continue going in. Just to give you a couple of the piece parts in terms of the impact it will have on the fourth quarter, you will see organic tenant billings growth rates in the U.S. around a negative 1%, and that will include churn for the quarter of about 6.6%, and embedded within that is about 4.5% just from the Sprint churn.  And of course, all of this will have an impact on AFFO in terms of going forward into future years. So, we've guided that our goal is to hit double-digit AFFO growth on average from 2021 through 2027. And of course, some years it will be higher, some years it will be lower. The goal really is an average. And when you think about 2022 and this first tranche of Sprint churn kind of rolling through, that's a year that I would say that would be challenging to get to 10%. I'll also say, Michael, we haven't given up on it. There are certain levers that we can pull and things that we can do with the business to maximize AFFO and AFFO per share growth. And we're doing all of those -- all of those things. So that kind of puts a little bit of context around the U.S. activity for this year and rolling into next year. Tom Bartlett : And Michael, relative to your second question, you can tell that we're obviously energized and excited about the opportunity at the edge. I mean the impetus right now is really 5G and driving all of these lower latency types of applications and needs out further into the market closer and closer to the end user. We've always said from a digital transformation perspective, it's going to be cloud-based, it's going to be connected, and it's going to be distributed. And we think we're in a very good competitive position given the vast amount of distribution that we have in the 25 markets that we\u2019re Steward servicing.  So we're trying to position ourselves inSteward this broader market to be able to take advantage of the opportunity. We're going to do it intelligently. Our execution strategy continues to evolve. We think we've done it intelligently in terms of picking up some of the Metro sites, building out our own sites. We have some market agreements in place to drive access into those sites, and this is going to evolve. This is not going to happen overnight as you well know. And so, we've got partnerships in place to be able to look at this. We're going to be able to hopefully leverage Steward some of those partnerships, and we'll just continue to monitor the best approach in terms of being able to best position ourselves, to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.  We've done that in the past in terms of being smart in terms of how we allocate capital to these types of investments. Will it take the form of partnerships owning -- further owning more metro sites, unclear at this point in time. That will continue to evolve as the market continues to evolve, but we do think we're in a really good position in terms of being able to leverage our real estate -- our exclusive real estate and to be able to take advantage of that neutral host model. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Tom Bartlett : You bet. Operator : Next we move on to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. [Operator Instructions] Simon Flannery : Thank you. Good morning. First, Rod, I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on the advanced payment looks like close to a billion dollars. What's going on there? Is that something that we will see again? And then there's been a lot of talk about supply chain. We're seeing higher inflation, particularly in markets like Brazil. Are you seeing any pressure on your customers in terms of their ability to source radios, to source Tower crews, and the cost of that, that might impact some of the installs and do your MLA's protect you from any delayed installs, any color around that would be great. Rod Smith : Great. Thanks for the question and good morning. And thanks for being on this call. So with advanced prepayment, I'm not going to provide details around that. I will say it was a little over $1 billion from one of our customers. It really is just a prepayment for lease payments going out over, let's say the next 12 months, so it will kind of run through our financial statements pretty quickly. And there's nothing more to it than just a prepayment of the next 12 months, kind of leasing fees. So from our perspective is it's not a big deal that helps with liquidity, brought our leverage down a little bit. You thought we ended a little bit below five times in terms of leverage. So it wasn't a bad thing for us to do, but it's a pretty simple transaction and I wouldn't want you to read any more into it than that.  In terms of supply chain, Tom may want to add a few comments here, but from a supply chain, we see no major impacts at this point, certainly across our business. As you can see in our services business, we continue to hit higher and higher levels of activity and bringing our outlook up again for another consecutive quarter here. We've got access to the cruise. You've also seen our margins expanding in the services business in particular, and in the U.S. we're not building a tremendous amount of Tower, so we certainly don't have any restrictions or challenges from that perspective.  One place I would say going into 2022, we will be keeping our eye on crew availability and labor and things like that. If the environment stays the way it is, we should be fine if things get worse, we'll need to keep our eye on it. We do buy a lot of generators. We have generated orders out that are already in place. That brings us out into the beginning to the middle of 2022. So from that perspective, we know we're going to get some materials we need or we expect to get the materials we need and feel pretty good about that.  But in the second half of 2022, again, we'll continue to watch the supply chain issues. And to the extent that there are any issues that get worse, we'll continue. to keep an eye on it and kind of pull the levers, but from where we sit now, we don't think we'll -- we don't see anything hitting us right now. We don't expect any challenges through the middle of 2022, and beyond that, it's too early to comment. We'll just keep our eye on it. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. One on India, I guess there's some better organic growth this quarter return to positive growth, I think for the first time since 2Q '20. So can you maybe talk a little bit more about the overall demand backdrop across your carrier customers and whether -- I guess maybe to drill in a little bit more, churn was about a couple million lower than what we've seen in terms of recent run rate. And so I'm wondering if the $14 million we saw this quarter is maybe a better run rate to now think about and start modeling going forward. Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Yes, thanks for the question and good morning. So we did see organic tenant billings in Asia kind of turned a corner here and gets a positive. So we posted a 0.7% positive growth rate. We're still looking for the full year to be right around 0. And as we look at the market, we remain optimistic in terms of the gross activity. So the way that even that 0.7 organic tenant billings for the quarter, I will give you a little bit of the breakdown there. So we're seeing high single-digits, nearly double-digit organic new business that's been pretty consistent for at least 6 to 8 consecutive quarters. And based on where they are in their development kind of transitioning from 3G to 4G networks. We expect that that gross demand should continue, the escalators are locked in right around 2 to 2.2% or so we have that to count on.  We have seen a moderation and a pretty sharp decline here year-over-year in terms of the churn rate. So a year ago, Q3 churn in India was about 13.5%, it's down now about 7.5%. We think that's certainly a very favorable sign and one that we expected to see, and we hope to continue to see that going forward. In terms of the -- we did see that there was some good news from the government in terms of regulatory support for the industry. And we think that that will help the market in general, the whole sector as well as the carriers, particularly the ones with the AGR dues.  But all the carriers, even with just spectrum fees, strengthen their own Balance Sheet, kind of regroup and gear up for competition in this sector there and to invest in their networks. So we are optimistic about going forward growth rates there, but we would expect, let's call it high single-digit organic growth with churn levels there, in the mid-single-digits and hopefully moderating down over time. Matt Niknam : Rod, can I just follow-up, 1 other question I wanted to sneak in is on capital improvement CapEx. It's been trending lower, I think year-to-date. You've already done around 100 million, but I think the guide is for about a 185 million for the year. I'm just wondering what's been driving the lower capital improving CapEx year-to-date and then was it was it fair to assume then a much larger step-up that could weigh on AFFO in 4Q? Thanks. Rod Smith : Yeah, so the cap maintenance there is going to pop up in Q4. I think you see that you just mentioned in terms of our guide. It really is just timing, and it's a timing issue that we've seen in prior years. So if you look back at our last year, spread and maintenance CapEx, you'll see kind of the same sort of cycle. It is a Cash CapEx number, so it does lag a little bit in terms of the activity. So you see this kind of spike in leasing activity that's going -- that's running through our services revenue. And then you kind of see following on from that, you'll see an uptick in the maintenance CapEx that we run through to support the towers and maintain everything out of the tower sites. So it really is just a timing issue, Matt. Matt Niknam : Great. Thank you. Operator : And next we have a question from Eric Lukow with Wells Fargo Please go ahead. Eric Lukow : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Perhaps you could talk about Verizon real quickly. I think your holistic pricing structure with them expires at the end of this year. So wondering if you could update us on the nature of conversations with them around that aspect of the MLA. And then secondly, on the European side, is nice to see the improvement in organic tenant billings growth. Could you just talk about how the outperformance is coming from, whether that's churn from Telefonica versus new bookings, and then on the new bookings front? Any update on conversations with one-by-one as they contemplate the new build and how you think your position there. Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Yes, thanks for the question. I'll take the first part there and so from when you look at our business over in Europe, we are very pleased with the trajectory of the growth rates over they you've seen a couple of sequential quarters of increased organic growth rates, just as we expected to see now that the market has seen a reduction in churn, they're gearing up for 5G deployments, so that's been really good to see. In terms of the piece parts of the organic tenant billings, certainly the Telefonica, additional sites plays a role in there. One of the biggest ways that it plays in early on, it's still very early in terms of bringing those assets in, but I think we've talked before about the assets there in Europe that they basically have a long-term contract and there on other tenant material, other tenants on there.  So there's really very little churn that will -- that's possible on that portfolio. So we have very low turn expectations on that portfolio and it's a big chunk of revenue, that certainly helps inflect the growth rates to go up higher. And then in terms of the question with drilage one-on-one, we really don't want to comment on ongoing negotiations, but negotiations continue there I can assure you. Operator : And we will move on to the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. First, Rod, just to follow-up on the Europe situation at our conference last month, you kind of talked a little bit about how you perceive the European marketplace being right for incremental consolidation. I was wondering if you or Tom could elaborate a little bit on how you see the European market evolving as it matures from a Tower third-party infrastructure provider perspective. And then second, if you could elaborate a little bit on what is going on now with Telefonica in Mexico, and its network sharing agreement with AT&T and how that relationship between the two of them is evolving for them. Tom Bartlett : Hey David, if Tom, I can start and Rod can add in. With regards to Europe, we think we have a really solid position in them. And a few of the critical markets, we've got good scale in the markets we've got a great relationship, obviously with Telefonic and O-RAN in particular, and so we're, energized by the type of growth that we are now seeing in the marketplace. But we continue to look at opportunities to further build scale, not just in the 3 markets that we're in, but also if there are other opportunities, but only if it makes sense, like everything else that we do. And so there are, I think, a lot of opportunities in the region, and we're evaluating them as you would expect. And to the extent that there's some opportunities there to secure some of that portfolio to gain further scale even in the markets that we're in.  And relationships with key customers, we'll clearly look to do that. And so Europe is -- as we've said, an area or part of the world that we look to continue to further develop if it makes sense. With regards to Telefonica, again, we've got a great global relationship with them. They are positioning to an MVNO as you all know, and they're going to have some time for that to be able to -- for that to occur. There will be some churn over time, but the contract that we have with them, I think goes out for several years at this point in time. And so we'll continue to monitor that and we've managed these types of events. I think quite well over -- over our history. And I'm sure we will do that here. David Barden : Thanks, Tom. Tom Bartlett : Sure, Dave. Operator : And our next question is from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Good morning. Tom Bartlett : Hi, Ric. Ric Prentiss : Hey. Couple questions, you guys. First, appreciate you guys breaking out the attributable AFFO I think that is important to focus investors on cash to comment, and you continue to exclude non-cash amortization on your organic ratio, so I appreciate that, accounting stuff. First question, we get a lot on interest rates and inflation. Can you talk a little bit about how you guys are viewing the interest rate environment and inflation environment? How it affects your financials, any potential deals like David was just asking about, and just the fundamentals of the business? So little bit primmer on interest rates and inflation as you see it. Rod Smith : Yeah. Sure, Ric. I'll -- good morning. Thanks for the question. I'll take that one. So let's say the interest rates are -- so you've seen us, Ric, over the last several quarters, even the last couple of years, very active in the capital markets, very active in terms of our debt structure, capital structure, and in different things like that. We've been focused on strengthening our balance sheet in a very proactive way. We now have our average maturities out over about 7 years with an average cost of debt down to about 2.4% or so. And 85% of our debt is now fixed out over the long term. So that's a heavier weighting towards fixed to variable compared to our kind of standard financial policy.  So we've been preparing for an environment where interest rates may tick up so we think from an interest rate perspective, our Balance Sheet is very solid and ready for it. There's nothing we can do about preventing interest rates from rising. We do think they may rise over time modestly, but we're very well prepared for it. The other thing I would add is in terms of global capital allocation, and looking to invest capital, the strength of our Balance Sheet really does represent a competitive advantage for us, particularly in a time when interest rates may be rising. So we'll keep an eye on that and look to be very opportunistic as we go forward from that perspective.  And then when you think about inflation rates, one of the ways you will see that run through our businesses is many of our contracts internationally, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are all geared towards inflation rates and the escalator is adjusted based on inflation rate. So as and when we see higher levels of inflation in the international markets, we'll see higher levels of growth as well in the U.S. And remind you that our escalators are fixed at around 3%. That's been consistent for a long time. So we're pretty well insulated from interest rates rising in the U.S. from a balance sheet perspective, but we still lock in that revenue growth of 3% on the U.S. escalator. Ric Prentiss : I think in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about acquisition opportunities, even outside of Europe. David was asking about Europe. As you think about how you view the potential opportunities in Africa, Latin America or other markets as far as portfolio is coming up, and what makes for attractive intelligent decisions as you kind of alluded to? Tom Bartlett : Ric, it comes back to the same model that we've been executing for the last decade. It's looking to build up scale, looking at the counter party, looking at the market itself, and then looking at the transaction itself, what additional capital has got to go into the portfolio to be able to ensure it, so we can support a second or third 10, and what is the growth profile look like. They're probably a dozen different elements of that evaluation that go into deciding whether in fact we would be interested, and then driving what that price is.  We've used the same 10-year discounted cash flow approach and continue to use it. Obviously, the variables change but largely -- I meant the actual numbers, but largely the variables themselves from a qualification perspective are the same. And so we'll look at those and look at all of those opportunities, we think about globally how to allocate capital. Ric Prentiss : Is there any change in the pipeline as far as deals going on and what might be changing that pipeline as far as potential deals? Tom Bartlett : You talked about the pipeline of transactions? Ric Prentiss : Yes. Tom Bartlett : Yes. I mean, it's been very consistent. I mean, the pipeline itself there are -- there's more activity as you've seen, and as you report on in Western Europe. And, but in terms of the pipeline, in terms of the opportunities, they remain relatively consistent. Overall, if you look at our total portfolio, the last count I did we owned about a third of the inventory and all of the markets. And so there's still a lot of opportunity in the markets that we're in. Given how carriers, our existing customers, carriers are looking at continually looking at trying to monetize their portfolio. Smaller tower co's are looking for opportunities to exit. There was private capital involved in some of those smaller tower co's.  And so, they're looking to monetize some of their funds. Some increased opportunity in Southeast Asia that's going on as we speak, as you've well seen. But it's been -- the pipeline has been very consistent. I would say where it's a little bit out sized is probably the all of the noise is going on in Western Europe. And there just seems to be a lot of activity going on there as you've seen, as we've seen in the -- all of the public comments. And so it's probably a bit of an out-sized pipeline in that region, but other than that, it's been very consistent. Ric Prentiss : [Indiscernible] never dull [Indiscernible] Tom Bartlett : Great. Rod Smith : Hey, Ric, you mentioned attributable. Maybe I'll just give you a couple of data points there because we have -- you've seen over the last quarter or so, we've had a few moving pieces with closing the Telxius transaction in numerous tranches. We also brought in private capital. It may be a good time to just level set that. So for the full year, we're looking -- you can see in our presentation, in terms of AFFO attributable to our minority, shareholders is about 100 million, and that breaks down 75 million roughly for the European business and about 25 million for the India business. The way our partners breakdown is, you know CDPQ owns 30% of our European business and Aliansce owns about 18% of that business.  PGGM holds about 17% in Germany, and about 13% in Spain. We have Macquarie as a partner over in India, they own about 8%. Now is a good time to kind of think about the run rate aspect of that minority interest. When you look at Q4, now that all the dust has settled, we think the run rate -- a good ballpark run rate is about 40 million for Q4. So if you annualize that, you get a range of 150 to 160, that would be attributable to the minority interest partners. The one word, actually I would say is, we will -- we did receive the put from a core where you've seen that in our filings. So we will eventually close on that and that'll be an adjustment to the numbers at that -- at that time. Ric Prentiss : That really helps. Thanks, Rod. I really think it's important to focus on that. Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to the line of Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. Jon Atkin : Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about Latin America. I'm hearing an echo here. The churn has ticked up in recent quarters, and I imagine some of that might be Telefonica. But I wonder if you can provide some color on what's driving that? Tom Bartlett : Yeah, Jonathan. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I don't want to go through the churn carrier-by-carrier. But I think you do know that there are a few customers in Latin America that are exiting the businesses or that have been consolidated. So we do have the next exit down in the Brazil area. We do have Telefonica transitioning to the MVNO in that -- in the Mexico market and moving onto the AT&T site. Some of that churns began. You've seen a bump up in our non-run rate activity in Latin America for some decommissioning in Brazil that is related to the next cell sites coming down that will continue into next year. So you'll see a bump up in churn, and then you will also see a bump up in that non-run rate as well. And then there are -- you will see some benefits to some of the churn that come through a settlement payment. And there are a few other smaller customers, but that probably gives you a flavor of who's there, and what's happening in Latin America from a churn perspective. Jon Atkin : And then on Nigeria, I just was hoping that you could give us a little bit about qualitative view as to the tailwinds and headwinds to expect as it pertains to organic growth, you obviously have a little bit of a different portfolio than IHS given how you entered the market. But how do you think about -- what are the factors to keep in mind around organic growth in Nigeria going forward? Tom Bartlett : I think in Nigeria, we've seen very strong growth for the last several quarters here. We expect that to continue. We've got a great portfolio in Nigeria was a solid anchor tenant with MTN in there as a partner of ours. So that's been really good. I would say that as long as the economy, and the economy in Nigeria is largely driven by fuel prices, as long as that's good, I think we're in really good shape because we've got a great portfolio in the country. and the carriers will continue to invest capital and build out sites. We've got a pretty robust build program there, so you've seen the guide with 7,000 thousand sites that we expect to build as a good chunk of those in Africa. And in Africa, a lot of them they're in Nigeria.  So I would say that we are very bullish on Nigeria in terms of the growth rates we're seeing high single-digit, if not double-digit, organic growth rates in Nigeria. As long as the economy there continues to roll forward I think we're in really good shape and that's largely, I believe, based on fuel pricing. Jon Atkin : Lastly, I think you were asked about realizing the holistic MLA and I wondered if you had any kind of response to that. Tom Bartlett : Hey, John. It's consistent with what we've said in the past. We've got I think a terrific relationship with Verizon. I can't comment on anything specifically relative to negotiations or those types of things. But we want to be able to service our customers and be strategic to them, as makes sense for them. And so we'll look to continue dialog if they're looking for more of our card type of pricing we'll go in that direction. If they're looking for renewal for realistic will go in that direction. More to come, but they're very active in the marketplace. They're very aggressive in terms of building out their network, and I think we've seen it. They talked about it. And they are doing a terrific job, and we're here to support them however best we can. Jon Atkin : Thank you. Operator : Next we go to Nick Del Deo with Moffett Nathanson, please go ahead. Nick Del Deo : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. One on Telxius and then one on domestic spectrum deployment. So first, how long does it take you to typically get acquired, carrier-owned sites or I guess in the case of Telxius quasi carrier-owned sites, kind of plugged into your systems and effectively marketed so that you really see the lease improvements from being independently-owned flow-through. And will it happen faster than normal for Telxius since again, they were kind of quasi-independent before you pick them up? And then second in the U.S., we often times talked about urban markets seen activity first, with spectrum deployments, especially for like the upper mid-band spectrum that the carriers at a point today enforce. Are you seeing that play out in practice, across your portfolio or is it more even than we might suspect? Tom Bartlett : On Telxius I can tell you day one, we were marketing those sites. Tom Bartlett : Okay. So we're as aggressively as we possibly can in terms of providing those sites out to our customers. The integration has gone really well. And it takes time from a system perspective and getting that organized, getting them into systems and integrating systems and things like that, that can I can take 6 months to a year. but that doesn't prevent us from marketing those sides to our customers and making them available to all of our customers will be aggressive from a capital perspective, to the extent that there are some sites that we need to attend to, from a structural perspective, to be able to support them. But I've said all along, and this was a really terrifically built portfolio, and that was one of the attractions to the portfolio to begin with.  So we're being as aggressively as we can to really be able to take advantage of these sites, particularly markets like Germany and Spain, where 5G is really picking up. From a U.S. perspective, you're right. If you go back to even old analog days, the markets were generally built up from your urban markets, because that's where you're able to get the best bang for the buck when you're rolling out capital. This one though, I would say, with 5G is broader. It is a goal to get nationwide coverage for all the customers. And then to continue to fill it in as demand and as capacity requirements are required. What's not a surprise to us, and I reiterated in my comments, the macro towers is the main asset that our customers are deploying 5G on. And I never had any doubts of that, simply because I've been involved in the industry for 30 years. So the macro tower is just the best way for our customers to get that signal out to their customers. And so we're seeing that, but we are seeing it more across the entire country. Again, as customers are really trying to be able to get to that nationwide coverage. Nick Del Deo : Got it. Thanks, Tom. Tom Bartlett : You bet. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question. That's tom -- excuse me. Tim Horan with Oppenheimer, please go ahead. Tim Horan : Thanks, guys. Just a clarification and one question. Do companies pay when they install the equipment? Or with MLA, do you have to pay regardless of whether or not being installed equipment one? Secondly, come on -- you've been able to kind of raise prices in the U.S. about double the inflation rate, historically now, right now it's almost half the inflation rate. Do you think over time you would have the ability to kind of increase prices faster than inflation? And then lastly, I know you mentioned a lot of new technologies out there, are any of that you think are a risk to the business model that you're concerned about at watching. Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Sure, Tim. Go ahead, Rod, you take that first. Rod Smith : Yeah, I'll get the first one, Tom, around the payment cycle and equipment installation. Tim, I would say that it really works in a variety of ways depending on which contracts you're talking about and how it's structured. Certainly on a pay by the drink type of in all our contract, carriers would pay us lease by lease as and when they install the equipment, or probably better, more precisely said, when the contract gets executed and the commencement date is triggered, and that's typically when the building permit is pulled and construction starts or certainly by the time that the equipment is installed, if you looking at more of a holistic transaction, then there is a disconnection between fees and exactly when equipment is put on.  You've heard us say it before, and the holistic type of environment we price out activity over a multiyear period. We know exactly what the carriers want to do and what they are willing to pay for. We give them those rights and we put a payment cycle to it as well, which we spread out over time and a little bit more of a consistent manner so it's not as volatile as the activity. So in that context, you may see payments hit before equipment is installed and you can also see payments that after the equipment is installed. It really depends on the payment timeline that's in the holistic deal. Tom Bartlett : Yeah, and Tim on the other two questions, relative to technology, we have a number of technology consultants that we can -- we use, that I talk with weekly, as well as all of our own internal. We continue as I said before, I believe that macro site is the most efficient way for customers worldwide to be able to deploy their, networks and continue to be so, and as I just mentioned, is what you've seen from our customers talking about rolling out 5G. It's all on the macro sites. So the answer to the question on the, on the technology side is, no, we don't see any competing technologies that we'll get in our way there. From an inflation perspective, 95% of our contracts in the U.S. are on a fixed escalator.  And my sense is that that's it's a very important element of our agreements and that's going to continue to stay. There are going to be some years when it may be a bit higher, although it hasn't been for many, many years. And so generally it's underneath it, but it's also consistent with how we look at our land in terms of the landlords as well. So it's a balance as well between the land -- landlords as well as our customers. So I don't think that there's any unique opportunity to be able to really change that as you well know. We were really -- priced our contracts where it makes sense for our customers to want to be on our sites. And so we continue to look at our pricing along those lines. Tim Horan : Thank you. Operator : And I'll turn this back to the speakers for any final closing comments. Tom Bartlett : Great. Thanks, Leah. And thank you, everyone for joining the call. Have a good rest of your day. Thanks everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation in for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Adam Smith : Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our Stand and Deliver strategy. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our 2021 results and 2022 outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2022 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the financing plan for the CoreSite acquisition; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release; those that will be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021; and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in today's press release, we generated strong results in 2021, while strategically deploying capital to assets that we believe will further enhance our future growth trajectory and augment our ability to continue to deliver compelling total shareholder returns for many years to come. The strength of our operational and financial results reflects the high-quality nature of our tower business model, the dedication of our talented global teams and our commitment to provide best-in-class service to our customers. It also reflects our commitment to sustainability and being a good corporate citizen which provides additional purpose and continues to be a focus at every level of the organization. Last year at this time, we presented multiyear targets for U.S. organic tenant billings growth and AFFO per share growth. And I'm pleased to be able to say that we're exactly where we thought we would be today as it relates to those targets. We continue to expect to average at least 4% in U.S. organic tenant billings growth from 2021 through 2027 on a reported basis, implying an average of at least 5%, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. And as part of these projections, we anticipate an acceleration in U.S. organic tenant billings growth between 2023 and 2027, when we are targeting growth rates of at least 5% on a reported basis and at least 6%, excluding the Sprint churn. Similarly, on the AFFO side of the equation, we believe we are on track to average at least 10% growth in AFFO per share, on average through 2027. This includes a year of more subdued growth in 2022, as expected but also a recovery in growth rates in 2023 and beyond as the Sprint churn impacts fade and global secular growth tailwinds continue. 5G is probably the most significant of these growth drivers. And in 2021, we saw the early stages of transformational 5G network upgrades in multiple markets, including nearly $105 billion spent by U.S. carriers for critical mid-band spectrum and over $65 billion in CapEx deployed by carriers into network investments across our global footprint. With mobile data consumption expected to grow at an average annual rate of more than 25% over the next five years in the United States and at even higher rates in some of our international markets, we anticipate prolonged network investment cycles to drive compelling, sustained growth rates across our regions. And while we believe our macro tower assets will continue to drive the vast majority of growth and returns for the company as 5G advances, we're also excited about additional opportunities that we expect to arise from the accelerating cloud-based interconnected and globally distributed digital transformation that is in it's early stages today. We expect our recently closed CoreSite acquisition to augment our ability to capture potential upside from this transformation while enhancing the value of our existing portfolio of distributed communications real estate over time. We anticipate these expectations to be underpinned by the continued execution of the four strategic pillars in our Stand and Deliver strategy, growing our assets and capabilities, driving industry leadership, operational efficiency and extending our platform. As part of our commitment to growing our assets and capabilities to meet our customers' needs, we deployed more than $10 billion for tower M&A in 2021 focused on Europe, where we have meaningfully improved our long-term strategic positioning. We saw accelerated organic growth trends in the region throughout the last year and we expect those trends to continue, supported by data growth projected at a CAGR of 26% over the next five years across our major European markets. Separately, we added strategic financial partners, CDPQ and Allianz, who joined our existing partner, PGGM, creating a solid platform for future growth and investment ahead of what we anticipate being an exciting decade in the European marketplace. In addition to expanding through M&A, we further grew our asset base through our internal CapEx program by investing $1.4 billion, primarily to construct a record of nearly 6,400 new communication sites, along with deploying nearly $120 million towards our energy efficiency investments, primarily in Africa. These investments continue to generate returns that are among the highest in our portfolio. Through our talented teams and operational expertise, we expect to remain a preferred partner to support customers as they execute on their network build-outs which we expect to drive continued acceleration in our new site construction for the next several years, while advancing our sustainability efforts and commitment to a greener mobile future. Through our commitment to enhance our industry leadership, we've continued our focus on sustainability by accelerating our efforts to combat climate change, as evidenced by our recent adoption of science-based targets for carbon emission reductions. These targets represent direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of at least 40% by 2035 against the 2019 baseline, as well as targets to reduce indirect supply chain emissions by at least 40%. To date, we've invested over $275 million in CapEx towards energy efficiency and reduction solutions which directly support our committed targets and initiatives. Concurrent with our emissions reduction targets and renewable energy investments, we are actively working on various land stewardship and social impact initiatives. We're a member of the World Economic Forum's EDISON Alliance 1 Billion Lives Challenge which aims to spur development of affordable and accessible digital solutions across health, finance and education to the underserved. Through our involvement, we engaged with an array of high-level country and regional platforms and committed our time, expertise and ideas to make digital access a top priority for all. Also this past year, American Tower was awarded a 2021 World Summit on the Information Society prize for our digital communities program which spans across India, Africa and Latin America and seeks to improve the quality of life and increase economic opportunity through connectivity. At the end of 2021, we reached a significant milestone of launching our 200th digital community in India and have set a goal to grow to 2,000 digital communities globally over the next five years, focusing on education, health care access, financial inclusion and career development. Finally, we advanced our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion by implementing customized plans focused on talent development, recruitment and education to enhance our inclusive culture across our global footprint. We also continued our partnership with HBCU supporting critical infrastructure enhancement projects and engaging in academic and professional development opportunities for their talented students. Further, we extended our leadership position and NAREIT's Dividends Through Diversity, Equity and Inclusion CEO Council which addresses opportunities related to DE&I in the REIT and publicly traded real estate industry. Also, we stay on top of the best ESG practices, policies and actions within the REIT sector through active participation on NAREIT councils and initiatives. These accomplishments and areas of focus are reflections of our unwavering commitment to operating our global business in a sustainable way while guided by our core principles. We are also steadfast in driving operational efficiency throughout the business. Over the past several years, we've implemented shared service center model, executed on various cost control and process improvement initiatives and implemented site level enhancements that not only drive value to American Tower but also for our customers. An example of these initiatives is our use of drone technology to help us ensure the structural integrity of our sites. In 2021, our U.S. team demonstrated it's capabilities to scale up driving service revenue to it's highest level in over a decade supporting major carrier activity in preparation for 5G deployments. Looking ahead, we believe the investments we have made in the operating structures and processes that have been put in place are competitive advantages that will facilitate scalable expansion while converting meaningful top line growth to AFFO. At the same time, through our platform expansion initiatives, we've evaluated a range of new communications' real estate model to identify long-term growth opportunities that could complement and leverage our global tower presence, further advance our position as a market leader ahead of emerging technological trends and create attractive returns for our stakeholders. Through this process, we believe advanced wireless network technologies, in conjunction with the shift of computing power from the core to the edge, will accelerate digital transformation across many industries. We've only begun to understand the true capabilities and performance of widespread 5G coverage. And with new applications on the horizon, we think mobile edge computing will become a critical component of converged neutral host infrastructure. We believe today's 5G Edge, deployed in public or private networks with regional site hosting, will evolve to distributed tower-centric locations. We think future AI and machine learning, edge-optimized solutions supporting massive IoT devices and immersive experiences enabled with AR and VR, such as gaming, health care and education, will drive latency-sensitive edge deployments across our strategically positioned set of assets. We expect this evolution and these deployments to drive a meaningful TAM with our distributed macro tower assets ideally located to host such computing infrastructure and an integrated grid that enhances our competitive position and service offerings. Together with the CoreSite and our other data center assets, we have the scale to enable a richly interconnected hub-and-spoke edge-computing model that extends today's data center multi-cloud ecosystem out to our distributed neutral host sites, greatly enhancing our probability of success at the edge. On that note, I'd like to welcome the CoreSite team to the American Tower family. And together, I look forward to executing on our long-term development plan, while driving meaningful incremental value to our macro tower sites over time. As we move forward, we remain focused on further enhancing our investment-grade balance sheet which has been a critical element that has enabled us to grow and we expect it to remain an important component of our future success as well. We are committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. And with the strength of our balance sheet as our foundation, we will continue to apply our Stand and Deliver strategic framework to capture value as 5G and growing mobile demand present compelling growth opportunities for American Tower. In closing, we believe that our comprehensive global portfolio, strong balance sheet, prudent capital allocation strategy and continued focus on sustainability position us to extend our track record of driving solid growth and returns as we embark upon an exciting new era of digital transformation enabled by 5G. We will continue to execute on our Stand and Deliver strategy and follow the same values and discipline that have fueled our track record over the last two decades. As we continue to build and strengthen our diverse comprehensive portfolio, while enhancing our operational capabilities, we believe American Tower is well positioned to support our global customer base as we enter a hyper-connected, digitally driven world. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our 2021 results and the details of our 2022 outlook. Rod? Rod Smith : Thanks, Tom and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I hope you and your families are well. As you just heard from Tom, American Tower had another year of solid performance which included strong Q4 results throughout our global business. Before we dive into the details of our expectations for 2022, I'll briefly review our Q4 and full year 2021 results. To start, I'd like to highlight a few key accomplishments from the past year. First, 2021 marked another year of strong overachievement against our initial AFFO per share targets. For the full year, we posted consolidated and attributable AFFO per share growth of 13.7% and 11.7%, respectively. This is a demonstration of our ability to deliver solid total revenue growth, tightly manage operating costs and execute on strategically important M&A transactions, all while maintaining a thoughtful and disciplined approach to our capital structure. I'll also note, this is a great start towards achieving our previously stated objective of delivering, on average, double-digit AFFO per share growth between 2021 and 2027. Second, we delivered our third consecutive year of record new builds. As we've discussed previously, these newly constructed sites continue to be amongst our best uses of capital. And in 2021, we saw average day 1 NOI yield of nearly 12% over the nearly 6,400 sites we constructed. Finally, during 2021, we completed two strategic M&A transactions and, as a result, strengthened our position in the United States and Europe, two critically important markets for us. With that, let's dive into the details of our Q4 and full year 2021 results. Turning to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, our consolidated property revenues grew by more than 13% year-over-year or over 14% on an FX-neutral basis. In our U.S. and Canada segment, property revenue grew 1.2%. This included an organic tenant billings growth decline of 0.5% or an increase of over 4% when excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. As a reminder, over half of the total Sprint churn commenced in 2021, primarily on October 1, as expected. International property revenues grew over 28%, with nearly 20% driven by contributions from our Telxius assets. International organic tenant billings growth was 5.7%, led by Latin America at 7.4%, followed by Africa at 7.3% and Europe at 6.6%. APAC grew for the second consecutive quarter, coming in at 1.3%. This was complemented by the addition of nearly 1,900 high-yielding, newly constructed sites across our international markets. Moving to adjusted EBITDA; growth was over 10% in the quarter, while the impacts of Sprint churn, combined with the addition of newer, lower-tenancy assets, drove a decline in adjusted EBITDA margin to 62%. Finally, consolidated AFFO per share grew 3.8% in the quarter or 4.3%, excluding the negative impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. This included nearly $140 million of year-on-year cash-adjusted EBITDA growth which was partially offset by the higher net cash interest expense, along with higher cash taxes and maintenance costs. As anticipated, the timing of these expenses was heavily back-end weighted in 2021, resulting in a material impact to the year-over-year growth rates in Q4. Meanwhile, AFFO per share attributable to American Tower common stockholders grew by 1.4% in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Full year consolidated property revenue growth was 14.5%, including organic tenant billings growth of 3.8% and total tenant billings growth of 11.3%. U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was nearly 9%, with organic tenant billings growth of 2.9%. This included contributions from co-locations and amendments of 3.2%; another 3% in growth from escalators; around 0.2% in negative impacts from other run rate items; and churn of 3% which consisted of around 1.8% in normal cost churn and the balance driven by Sprint. This was complemented by new asset contributions to tenant billings of 4.1% and approximately $144 million in higher straight-line revenues as compared to 2020. Our international property revenue grew by over 21% with organic tenant billings growth of 5.5% for the year. Overall colocation and amendment growth was 5.9%, while 3.8% came from escalators and 0.3% from other run rate items, all of which was partially offset by 4.5% of churn. This elevated churn was primarily concentrated in India, where more recently, we have started to see the churn rate moderate. Finally, with our recent expanded data center portfolio, we have introduced a new data center segment within total property, consisting of the newly acquired CoreSite and DataSite assets along with our existing Colo ATL facility. This segment contributed approximately $23 million to our total property revenue in 2021. Turning to Slide 10; adjusted EBITDA grew 16% for the year to nearly $6 billion. This included strong flow-through of organic tenant billings growth; $100 million in incremental services gross margin versus 2020; over $140 million in net straight-line growth, as well as around $300 million in contributions to growth from newly acquired assets, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. On a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were down around 20 basis points as compared to 2020, primarily due to the impacts of Sprint churn in the U.S. and the addition of newer lower tenancy international assets which we believe are well positioned to drive meaningful margin expansion over time. We also grew consolidated AFFO by 15.4% and consolidated AFFO per share by 13.7% in 2021, with over $680 million in cash adjusted EBITDA growth from the drivers I just mentioned. This growth was partially offset by higher financing costs associated with our recent strategic M&A as well as a modest increase in maintenance CapEx and higher cash tax expense as compared to 2020. Finally, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders per share grew 11.7% year-over-year. With that, let's turn to our outlook for 2022. I'll start by highlighting a few key assumptions underlying our projections. First, we expect a strong year of new leasing activity across our operations, with anticipated gross new business contributions to total tenant billings growth nearly 7% higher than what we saw in 2021. This expectation is being driven by a few key items. In the U.S., the comprehensive MLAs we've signed over the last few years are continuing to result in solid levels of new business activity. In Europe, we expect an exceptionally strong year, boosted by our larger presence following the Telxius transaction. And across our developing market footprint, the demand for site continues to rise as next-generation network deployments advance. Second, we expect churn to be higher than historical levels in 2022. In the United States, this will be driven by Sprint churn we've discussed previously, with about $160 million in year-over-year impacts in 2022 versus 2021. Additionally, in select international markets, a handful of carrier consolidation events are temporarily driving churn higher. Third, we've layered in some preliminary assumptions related to our CoreSite financing. And finally, our initial outlook reflects estimated negative translational FX impacts of approximately $125 million for property revenue, $70 million for adjusted EBITDA and $55 million for consolidated AFFO versus 2021. Moving into the details on Slide 11, you can see we expect total property revenues of over $10.3 billion at the midpoint, representing growth of 13% or nearly 15% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes expected property revenue growth of less than 1% in the U.S. and Canada and over 14% of FX-neutral growth in our international regions. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $705 million of growth in cash revenue to the Property segment in 2022. Turning to Slide 12 and unpacking the property revenue growth assumptions a bit, you'll see our expected organic tenant billings growth rates for 2022. I'd like to note here that our tenant billings metrics do not include contributions from the data centers segment. Looking at the United States and Canada, we anticipate growth of approximately 1%, in line with the 2022 expectations implied in the long-term projections we presented last year. This includes contributions to growth from colocations and amendments of roughly $150 million, representing solid double-digit growth versus 2021. We expect this to be partially offset by churn of over 5% which includes a 3.7% impact associated with Sprint. Turning to Latin America; we expect organic tenant billings growth of greater than 6% for the year, supported by solid gross colocation and amendment activity as well as additional growth from our CPI-based escalators which we anticipate to be around 300 basis points higher than in 2021. These items are being partially offset by higher churn in 2022, primarily related to Telefonica in Mexico as well as the continuation of Nextel churn in Brazil. With both events, we expect to receive settlement payments over the course of 2022, compensating us for the early termination of leases ahead of their expiration, where applicable. As is typical, these payments will fall outside of the organic tenant billings growth metrics. Moving to Africa; organic tenant billings growth is expected to be in the 6% range. We continue to see strong demand for our macro tower assets driving colocation and amendment growth of around 6.5% for the year. In addition, we expect escalators to be up as compared to 2021 by roughly 90 basis points. This will be partially offset by an expectation for elevated churn as carrier consolidation and some smaller market exit events from Q4 of 2021 work their way through our 2022 financial metrics. Meanwhile, in Europe, we're seeing the benefits of added scale from the Telxius acquisition, the early stages of 5G rollouts and low churn, all driving expected organic tenant billings growth of approximately 9% in 2022. This includes roughly 6% in contributions from colocations and amendments and escalators of around 4.5%. These higher escalators are being driven by the combination of higher CPI and the mechanics of having the Telxius assets in our numbers for the full year of 2022. Churn is expected to decline to around 1.5% as we benefit from the lower-churn Telxius assets and reduced cancellations across our legacy business as carrier consolidation events wind down. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we're guiding to 2% to 3% organic tenant billings growth in 2022, including churn of around 5%, representing less than half of the 2021 churn rate. At the same time, our outlook does imply a reduction to gross colocation and amendment growth contributions relative to 2021 levels as carriers in the marketplace continue to digest recent developments. With that said, we are encouraged by the market reforms aimed at improving the overall health of the telecom sector as well as more recent steps taken by the carriers to rationalize pricing and improve overall profitability in the marketplace. We think these steps could bode well for the long-term growth picture in India. Turning to Slide 13; at the midpoint of our outlook, we're projecting adjusted EBITDA of over $6.5 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 10% or nearly 11% on a constant currency basis. We continue to drive solid organic growth conversion rates and are complementing this through growth on assets acquired in 2021, including approximately $360 million in expected adjusted EBITDA from CoreSite in 2022. We are seeing some margin compression in 2022. This is primarily the result of Sprint churn in the U.S., along with the full year impact of the slightly lower-margin CoreSite and Telxius assets. That said, the benefits of our continued focus on operational efficiency are taking hold in our regional legacy businesses, particularly in Africa, where our commitment to sustainable energy solutions and strong cost controls are driving meaningful expansions in margins. Turning to Slide 14; we expect consolidated AFFO to grow by more than $380 million to over $4.7 billion, despite absorbing approximately $160 million in negative impacts to AFFO from Sprint churn. This includes $675 million in FX-neutral cash-adjusted EBITDA growth and the expectation for maintenance CapEx to be more or less flat as compared to 2021 as capital intensity remains in the 2% range. We expect this to be partially offset by approximately $55 million in higher cash taxes and $185 million in incremental cash interest expense, primarily associated with our preliminary CoreSite financing assumption as well as roughly $55 million in expected negative translational FX impacts. Additionally, we've layered in a common stock issuance assumption for the purposes of outlook in the first half of 2022, again, tied to the CoreSite transaction. Taking these assumptions into account, we expect our consolidated AFFO per share for the year to be $10.05, reflecting growth of 4%, or roughly 8%, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. Finally, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders is expected to grow approximately 3% year-over-year to $9.70 per share in 2022. This includes an assumption of approximately $165 million in minority interest impacts related to our partnerships in Europe. Moving on to Slide 15, let's review our capital deployment in 2021 and expectations for 2022. In 2021, we declared nearly $2.4 billion of common dividend distributions, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 15%. We spent another $1.4 billion through our CapEx programs, over $500 million of which was dedicated to our development projects, including the construction of nearly 6,400 new sites across the globe. Finally, we deployed over $20 billion, including the assumption of debt to acquire the Telxius and CoreSite assets as well as a handful of smaller transactions around the world. We expect these new assets to drive meaningful accretion and shareholder value over time. Looking to 2022, our dividend remains a top priority. And subject to board approval, we expect to distribute approximately $2.8 billion to our shareholders, as we continue to increase the dividend in line with our stated long-term, double-digit growth targets. We also expect to deploy roughly $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, over 90% of which will be discretionary. Of our total discretionary capital spending, we expect approximately $270 million to be directed towards attractive organic development opportunities in our data center segment. On the tower side, we expect to deploy roughly $565 million in development CapEx, primarily for the construction of 6,500 sites in our International segment. Similar to 2021, we anticipate driving average day 1 NOI yields on these new builds of nearly 12%. As you can see on the chart to the right, these international new site investments have driven exceptional returns over time. In our earliest vintage, we're seeing average NOI yields of 46%. Sites built between 2010 and 2014 are yielding around 26%. And on the more than 26,000 sites we've constructed since the start of 2015, we're seeing yields in the 20% range, with room to expand as we continue to drive lease-up on these lower-tenured sites. Looking forward, we believe our international new-build program presents a significant opportunity to continue adding meaningful portfolio scale while achieving highly attractive returns. And we'll continue to prioritize site development opportunities as a key part of our capital allocation strategy over the long term. Turning now to Slide 16, we've laid out our current thoughts around the permanent financing strategy for our CoreSite acquisition. As always, the primary objective is for us to finance this transaction in a way that optimizes our capital structure within our investment-grade framework, minimizes dilution to our common stockholders and positions us to continue to opportunistically deploy capital in ways that maximize value creation for our shareholders over the long term. At a high level, we expect to get there through a combination of debt and equity issuances. The debt markets remain attractive. And as we have done in the past, we expect to be opportunistic as we seek to term out revolver and term loan borrowings into longer-term fixed rate instruments. On the equity side, we anticipate evaluating a number of alternatives, including common equity, mandatory convertible preferreds and private capital partnerships, much like we did for the Telxius acquisition in 2021. With that said, for the purposes of our initial 2022 outlook, we have assumed that roughly half of the $10 billion purchase price will be financed through a common equity issuance assumed to occur in the first half of 2022. As you can see on the slide, we anticipate that this will bring our leverage back down to the high 5x range while putting us on track to get back to 5x or below over the slightly longer term. Importantly, we remain committed to our investment-grade rating and have been working closely with the rating agencies throughout this process. As we continue to evaluate a number of potential options, particularly on the equity side, we will plan to keep you all updated as to our progress. In the meantime, we believe that the baseline case we have incorporated in our current outlook positions us well as we create long-term shareholder value with the CoreSite assets. Turning now to Slide 17 and in summary, we drove strong results in 2021, including compelling double-digit AFFO per share growth, record new build activity prudent, balance sheet management and the completion of several transactions that we believe will enhance American Tower's leading global position. As we look across our global footprint, we're encouraged by what we see as a long tailwind of secular technology trends that are expected to drive continued strong recurring demand for our critical communication infrastructure assets. In the U.S. and Europe, we're well positioned to support a continued acceleration in 5G activity as carriers deploy new spectrum assets and build out greenfield networks. Meanwhile, in our early-stage markets, we expect to benefit as operators look to upgrade and densify their mobile networks to meet ever-increasing mobile data demand, all of which we believe will translate into meaningful growth and attractive total shareholder returns at American Tower for many years to come. And with that, operator, we can open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much and good morning. Tom, I think you talked about some of the deals you've been doing over 2021. And I wanted to get a sense of your -- how do you think about M&A from here. There's a lot of portfolios available in Europe. Obviously, the public equity valuations have pulled back. So I'm not sure if there's been an adjustment on the private side as well. But how are you thinking about the opportunities out there to continue to build your business? And about what the optimal mix between regions and assets are over the medium term? And then just a housekeeping question for you, Rod. You talked about some of the churn in Latin America. You didn't call out Oi. Any update on what the recent Oi transaction and the regulatory approvals means for this year and beyond? Tom Bartlett : Sure. Simon, I'll do the first and then, Rob, you can talk about Latin America. Simon, with regards to M&A, I mean, it's no different than we've been looking at things for the last two decades. We are -- because of our sheer size and our presence, we get invited into looking at just about every transaction that we see going on around the planet. And we evaluate them. We have business development teams in every one of our markets. Clearly, the focus for us right now is looking at opportunities in Europe. But it's -- as a result of the Telxius transaction and what we've done there before, we do have terrific scale in some of the critical markets in that region. And as you saw Rod just talk about, we're seeing really -- as we expected, given where the markets are from a 5G perspective, it's really outsized growth in 2022 going forward as the spectrum is deployed and as 5G gets rolled out. And as you said, there are a lot of portfolios there. And we are looking at all of them. A lot of it, we've seen it in the public realm and we've had ongoing discussions. But clearly, we're looking at it very, very carefully, looking at what would be the real opportunity there going forward, a very disciplined look in terms of valuation. So, it's really impossible at this point in time to speculate in terms of success in those. But we will clearly evaluate them and look at them and determine whether we can create long-term value as a result of those transactions. We have a very diverse portfolio which has really proven to be, I think, very valuable over the last 10 years as we've looked at the growth across the regions that we have. And Europe had been that particular market where we did not have the significant presence. And now we do and we're taking advantage of that growth. So we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities. And as I said, it's really difficult to predict what the outcomes might be but we'll continue to take a very disciplined review of those options. Rod Smith : Simon, thanks for the question. I hope you're doing well. So in Latin America, just to recap here, we're guiding towards just above 6% organic tenant billings growth. And that's really driven by solid organic new bids. So we've got about 3.3% or so contributing from an organic new builds perspective. And we're also seeing outsized escalators. So we've got escalators in above 8% in that market. So nice strong escalators there. And that really is sort of an inflation hedge that we have in the Latin American markets. But we are seeing temporary elevated churn. So we've got about 5% churn coming out of Latin America. The churn that's in the outlook for 2022 is primarily Telefonica up in Mexico and then Nextel down in Brazil. Oi doesn't really play into the equation quite yet. We do have a long-term contract with Oi. So that will play out over the next seven years or so. And we'll see where that goes. I don't want to get ahead of anything that may happen in the market there from a regulatory perspective. But it's not really a main component in our 2022 numbers and we've got protection there out over seven years. And the Oi revenue is in and around 1% of our total revenue. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you, Rod. Operator : And our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. I'm curious if you could unpack a little bit more of the domestic levels. And with AT&T talking about starting to deploy in the second half for mid-band, DISH deploying their network and Verizon continuing to build out the C-band, T-Mobile expanding and integrating, can you give us a sense of sort of what activity levels or activity assumptions are in the number? And if there's some opportunity, depending on how these expertise work their way through the system to influence performance this year and heading into next year? Rod Smith : Nice to have you on the call. Thanks for joining us and thanks for the question. So the U.S. market in terms of organic growth or organic new builds is really quite strong. We continue to see all of the major carriers being very active. And the place that, that shows up initially, maybe as an early indicator here, is within our services business. So once again, we're guiding towards services revenue above $220 million, so still well above kind of historical levels, a little bit below where we were in 2021 but still a nice solid level of services activity. And the margins there are still coming in at 55% right where they normally do. And then when you think about the U.S. organic growth here, we're guiding towards 1% or so. And I'll give you the piece parts there. So organic new business is slightly up from where it was from the prior year in terms of a percentage basis; so that's about 3.3%. Escalators are holding very firm, slightly ahead of where they were in 2021. They're coming in at 3.1%. And then we have cancellations coming in at about five -- a little over 5% and that is primarily driven -- at least the outsized churn there is primarily driven through the Sprint churn that we've all talked about. In terms of going forward, you do know that we've got MLAs with most of our carriers, where we've got kind of lock-in revenue as well as revenue growth. So 3/4 of the ramp is in there. Even in our long-term guide, we do have about 2/3 or so of not only the underlying revenue in the guide but the actual growth locked up in MLA. So nice really clear visibility in terms of the growth that we see going out. We do have one customer that's on an \u00e0 la carte basis. So as they begin to deploy, we do expect that to ramp towards the back half of the year. And we also have the agreement with DISH which we've talked about in the past, that is beginning to produce revenue for us this year. That will escalate through the year, so we'll see a ramp-up during the year from that. And then it will continue to ramp over time. And that's what really gives us the confidence to put out the long-term growth rates that Tom talked about and getting back up into that mid-single-digit growth rate sustainably in the U.S. And then the final point that I would make is the colocation and amendment contributions to organic new business. For the year, we're guiding around $150 -- $150 million. And that's up from the level in 2021 which is close to about $130 million or so. And that represents a solid 15% year-on-year growth rate. So we're quite pleased with what we see in the U.S. from a gross growth. And the churn that we're seeing is temporary will subside and then we think growth will return into that mid-single digits in the U.S. over the long term. Michael Rollins : And just a follow up briefly. So for the national carriers that you have MLAs with, is mid-band 5G covered under those MLAs? Or might that be something that has to get figured out in the future? Rod Smith : No, I think when you think about the MLAs that we have, it's based on use rights and a use-right fee that's all incorporated. So to the extent that their activity level fits within the use right bucket, then it's covered. To the extent that their activity level goes beyond what was contemplated and what was granted to them in the use right, then that would be upside. And certainly, anyone that's on an \u00e0 la carte basis, it's a pay as you go. And there's certainly upside there, depending on how quickly they deploy, how best they deploy. And we do see in the U.S. that things are continuing to heat up. We're expecting north of $30 billion once again in terms of carrier CapEx and that bodes very well for our short-term as well as long-term tenant leases here. So we -- and we're excited about 5G in the U.S. and all the C-band spectrum that's been auctioned off and that is out there that will eventually be deployed and we're seeing lots of activity as well. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Rod Smith : Thanks, Michael. Operator : And our next question is from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glad you guys are doing well. I hope you continue to stay well. A couple of questions. First, I appreciate the color on what your assumption is as far as the equity component, about half of the $10 billion total, about $5 billion equity rates common as an assumption. How should we think about the gating factors of what would -- what are you waiting for to go to market? Obviously, there's some overhang on the stock as we wait for the offering. How should we think about what are the gating factors on go-to-market? And update us a little bit on what might be going on with private capital in that aspect. Tom Bartlett : Sure, Ric. So the gating item is really sorting through the kind of the different options that we have ahead of us. There may be an element of common equity that we deploy here. And for modeling purposes, for outlook purposes, we are assuming that it's half of the $10 billion. Certainly, when you think about that equity offering, we did go through a tender offer. That tender offer resulted in us closing right at the end of the year and then we deal with open windows and closed windows and when, as a company, we can go out to market. And that kind of pushed us into January which was beyond Q4. And then looking at the way Q4 rolled out, we couldn't go out with equity at that point. So there's a lot of complicating factors kind of in there. But certainly, we have windows that open up here shortly and then again in Q2. But with that said, we're focused on the long-term value creation from CoreSite which is a high-quality, very interconnected network and cloud-centric set of assets that we think, over the long term, is going to drive a lot of value. So we want to make sure that we put the right financing together. And if that takes a little bit more time to get the right pieces put together, then that's what we'll do. And with that said, the common equity that we have in the assumption is an assumption. We're also out looking at private capital partnerships. We're also looking at mandatory convertible preferred instruments. And we'll make the best decisions based on market conditions, terms and conditions of any potential private capital and we'll make those decisions. Again, as I said in the prepared remarks, always with the -- in the best interest of the shareholders in mind and minimizing dilution is always important to us. So we take that very seriously. And then also making sure whatever we do stay solidly within the framework of investment-grade credit. That's another thing that's very important to us. Ric Prentiss : A lot in the calculus. I want to follow up on one of Simon's questions also. As Tom, you mentioned there's a lot of portfolios discussed out there. What about other asset classes, fiber, data centers, beside towers in Europe or other venues, how interested are you in fibers or data centers outside the U.S.? And we get the question a lot with CoreSite, do you need to spend a lot on kind of replicating in Europe the data center concept of what you've gotten with CoreSite? Tom Bartlett : Yes. No, thanks, Ric. I mean outside of the United States, our focuses are clearly tower portfolio. We do have some initiatives going on with regards to fiber down in Latin America. We actually do have some smaller data centers, candidly down in -- down in Latin America as well on a very small scale. The reason for, clearly, the CoreSite acquisition was really in the United States, that's where we think that edge grid is really going to be developed first. And we'll look at that as clearly the market to develop that strategy and then evaluate options to be able to expand that, to the extent that it makes sense outside of the United States. So the platforms that we're really seeking outside are largely driven by the tower. We have a lot of tower and fuel initiatives going on, particularly in Africa as well as in India. So we consider that a platform extension, if you will, Ric, where we're really trying to reduce the overall carbon footprint, improve the quality of the site, reduce our overall diesel consumption similar to -- really consistent with what we're trying to do with our science-based targets but offering even more value to our customers through our more efficient power and fuel initiatives. But we will really develop the kind of that data center model, the interconnected model with our tower portfolio within the United States. And so outside of the United States, it clearly is a tower focus. Ric Prentiss : Great, that helps. Appreciate it guys. Stay well. Rod Smith : Thanks, Ric. Operator : And our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just if I could do a couple of quick ones. I guess, first, Tom, could you maybe talk us through, at the end of the day, who the new leadership team is for the CoreSite asset? And then, Rod, just to follow up on Ric's question. Given the valuation you guys paid was very strategic and a kind of a very competitive process and the markets pulled back, is it plausible to believe that there is private capital out there that would want to pay what you paid for a stake in that business? And then I guess my last follow-up, if I could, Rod, was you mentioned that you're going to be getting some termination fees coming from Latin America. Could you kind of put some numbers around that for 2022? Tom Bartlett : Yes, Dave, I'll just take the first one. It's a quick one. I mean Steve Vondran, who is President of our U.S. business, is responsible for the CoreSite investment in the business. Juan Font who is within the business, who's a terrific leader, is actually responsible for running the CoreSite business, working directly for Steve? Rod. Rod Smith : Yes and David, I'll tackle the next two. So on the private capital side, yes, I think it's absolutely plausible to think that there are investors out there that see the long-term value and value creation within the CoreSite assets. We do believe that the CoreSite set of assets is amongst and of the highest quality portfolio of highly interconnected, cloud-centric, network-centric data center-type assets out in the U.S. and they're strategically placed across the country from West Coast to Central, over to the East Coast as well. So the locations are perfect in terms of being able to tie into lots of our towers across the globe. So as we look at this and we look through kind of short-term volatility in the equity markets as well as even with interest rates and things like that, I think it's very plausible. And we're very encouraged by the fact that there are a number of investors out there that see the long-term value and value creation here and believe in the transition of some of these data center assets into more distributed cloud on-ramps, more distributed compute power and tying that up with tower companies and the traditional tower company customers. So that's a long way of saying, yes, absolutely, I think people would be interested in this. But with that said, our options are all kind of open and on the board and we'll be evaluating that over the coming period of time. And then in terms of the termination fees, it's in the range of $40 million that you'll see kind of come through the numbers in 2022, really kind of flat with what we experienced in 2021 as well as in terms of termination fees. David Barden : All right, awesome. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Rod Smith : Thanks, David. Operator : And our next question is from Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. First, just to go back to data centers. We're about two months in post-deal close. I'm just wondering if you can share maybe the initial playbook for those assets, the CoreSite assets and more specifically, plans on potentially expanding the footprint beyond either the existing markets domestically or internationally. And then secondly, just to pivot to India because that's the one region I believe has not come up yet in Q&A. Can you just talk about what's driving the improvement in the outlook there in 2022? And maybe more broadly, give us any updates you're seeing in terms of the overall demand backdrop there for the carrier customers. Tom Bartlett : Matt, let me take the first one and Rod can take the second one on India. Yes, we are. We're about two months into the transaction. CoreSite had a strong finish to 2021 and we expect even a stronger set of growth metrics for in 2022. I mean there, we're moving through the integration process, as you would expect. Rod talked about the financing element of it. And we have teams looking at all of the opportunities to create synergies between the tower business as well as the data center business. But we're going to enjoy all the underlying growth that's coming from the business itself. We're integrating the data center companies that we had, albeit on a small scale, clearly compared to CoreSite into the CoreSite business. So there are a lot of activities going on from an integration perspective. On the commercial side, there are a significant amount of customer conversations, discussions, proof of concepts that are being developed and worked through on a number of different fronts with a number of different types of customers, the cloud service providers, the MNOs. And so there are continued initiatives going on to look at the opportunities to be able to bring our vision to the market. And it's not going to happen overnight. But in the meantime, we have the ability to really enjoy the underlying growth and the positioning that CoreSite has. And they have some development that's going on within their own portfolio this year in terms of building out some of the data centers that they've got. But as I said, the underlying growth trends are greater than they were in 2021. So we're really excited about the leadership team that we've got in place and the opportunities that we're going to see -- come to fruition over the next couple of years. Rod Smith : And Matt, in terms of your question around India, I'll hit a couple of highlights here. So in India, I think you're probably aware that the backdrop of the telecom environment is improving quite a bit and has done so in the last several -- certainly the last several quarters. The government has really stepped up and shown support for the wireless segment and the telecom segment. In addition, the carriers themselves have increased the tariff. So there, they've got healthier businesses as they go forward. And specifically to Voda, you've seen probably just recently even their intentions to monetize part of their stake in the India's portfolio to improve liquidity. They also chose to have some of the interest on their spectrum do's and their AGR fees going back to transitioning that from a liability to the government and swapping it for some equity. So they've greatly improved kind of their balance sheet. And now they have a much longer runway. Really, the whole sector has a much longer runway to kind of sort through the environment there. Because of those things, we are seeing churn subside in the marketplace and we've seen that over the last several years. So in India, specifically, we're guiding to 2% to 3% positive organic tenant billings growth. That comes with 5% gross organic growth, a 2% escalator which is contractual throughout all of our leases there and about 4.5% churn. That churn rate is down from over 10% in 2021. So that's where you see sort of the biggest improvement there. And the other thing I would say is we think the India marketplace is going to be very constructive here over the long term. Certainly, there's a large population. The networks are in early stage of development. They need a lot more infrastructure and the Indian subscribers really do consume lots of data in there. So we think that the market is still trying to absorb some of these positive changes that they've seen. And once that happens and all the carriers kind of get used to the new environment there, we should see churn continue to decline over time as well as gross new business increase over time. And those are the things that kind of get us back to that upper single-digit growth rate potentially. But as of now, we're fairly cautious around India in terms of our outlook and projections. And even in the long-term guide that Tom talked about earlier, that 10% AFFO per share growth, we have fairly modest improvements built in there for India, not getting back up to that full upper single-digit growth rate. So there's upside from that perspective if India continues to improve over the coming quarters and years. Matt Niknam : Very helpful. Thank you, Rod. Rod Smith : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question is from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Brandon Nispel : Awesome. Thank you for taking the question. You guys gave the $150 million in colocation amendment guidance for the U.S. business in '22. It's clearly up year-over-year but still well below 2018 and 2019. I was hoping you could help us understand the primary differences between what was happening in 2018 and 2019 versus your 2022 guidance and maybe where we're going. Then in relation to that $150 million number specifically, could you help us understand what percentage of that is fully contracted versus your expectations for billings coming in more \u00e0 la carte? Rod Smith : Sure, Brandon. So in terms of looking backwards to 2018, I don't want to go through too much detail between the two. But certainly, back in 2018, there was an explosion of activity in the U.S. from all the carriers. That was a time when we had all the carriers, including Sprint, investing heavily and contributing to our revenues in a pretty heavy way. So Sprint was a big contributor back then. And it was at a time when AT&T was also aggressively building out the FirstNet network. So those two things were kind of unique around 2018 and those aren't repeating. So we're very happy with where we are in terms of the colocation amendment contributions in 2022. We do see that accelerating into the back half of 2022 and we expect that acceleration to continue going out. And again, a lot of that growth, even beyond '22, is contracted in the holistic MLAs that we have. So we have visibility to that growth. So we do think we're entering a multiyear cycle of acceleration when it comes to that organic new biz, the colocation and amendment piece of it. And what was the other question that you had? The $150 million... Tom Bartlett : Rod, I would just... Rod Smith : Would you like to add on? Tom Bartlett : Yes, I would just add on that one particular piece. When you think about kind of '17, '18, '19, it was kind of at the latter end of kind of the heavy 4G investments. And you would typically see that with new technologies going in place. So my sense is that that's what we would start to see when we think about 5G. We're just in the early stages. The carriers are starting to clear and roll out C-band. I mean, we'll start to see it even the end of this year when we start to get into ramp up on the organic growth rates. But as 5G takes hold and continues to develop and densifies, we would expect that similar type of growth ramp up clearly with 5G. And yes, as Rod said, Sprint was very active back at that point in time, obviously, not around any longer. But with DISH now in it's place, hopefully, they would be able to be that kind of fourth agent there and really driving that kind of growth. Rod Smith : And Brandon, I think your other question was around the percentage of the $150 million that was contracted; it's in around 3/4. Brandon Nispel : Okay, thank you. Operator : And next, we have a question from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks very much. So in the slide deck, you talked about Telxius driving a lot of growth in international. I wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on contributions and which particular markets that, that came from? And then maybe related to the very first question around M&A but you talked a lot about kind of 5G and edge. And I wondered how does that affect your prospective CapEx profile across which sorts of assets? You also have fiber which hasn't come up a lot on this call in LatAm, for instance. So across assets and regions, how does 5G and Edge kind of affect your incremental CapEx going forward as well as affecting the types of assets that you might look at a little bit more seriously going forward compared to in the past? Tom Bartlett : Sure. No, Jonathan, I mean let me start and Rod can add in. But from a European perspective, clearly, much of the growth is coming in Germany, where they've been very aggressive in terms of rolling out 5G as well as in Spain. So I mean those are our two critical markets there. But Germany is really going to be, I think, really driving a lot of it and we're seeing a lot of activity in Spain as well. From a CapEx perspective, maybe you can take a look at even our projections for 2022. I mean, it's largely driven by our tower portfolio. There are certain development activities within the data center assets in the United States building out but it pales in comparison to what we're expecting on the tower CapEx side. We're looking at a major generator rollout for a large customer in the United States which is a piece of it. And we're also looking to build another 6,000 to 7,000 sites. So if you look at over the last several years, we've built probably cumulatively about 20,000 sites and we have significant expectations for continuing that kind of a trend and '22 is no different. And so as 4G and as 5G is developed around the world, we continue to see the need for new build-to-suits and that is the best use of our capital. With regards to fiber and some of the other assets, John, I'd tell you it's de minimis. I mean it's very, very small. And in many cases, they were just science projects, where we're still trying to see if there's really an opportunity in those markets. But -- and I would see that trend candidly for the next several years, that the direction for capital is going to be driven to the tower base of assets, again, largely driven to the development side of building out new sites and very little spend on some of the fiber portfolios or fiber assets outside of the United States. And John... Jonathan Atkin : Go ahead, yes. Rod Smith : Sorry, Jonathan, I'll hit the question on Europe and Telxius. So as you saw from the prepared remarks and in the slides, we are looking at about 9% organic tenant billings growth in Europe; so a real strong upper single-digit number. That compares to 2021 which was around 5%; a couple of the drivers there. We are seeing solid organic new biz up around 6% or so for the market. The escalators are up a bit, so we're up at around 4.5%. Escalators, the churn is down from 2.4 in 2021 down to 1.4 in 2022. A lot of that is directly driven by the Telxius assets which are very low to no churn assets the way the contracts are written and kind of from a structural standpoint. So that reduction in churn, at 100 basis points, you can really ascribe back to Telxius. And that gives you the 9% organic growth rate. I would say, we're seeing our best growth here in Germany. But even if you pull away the Telxius assets that are adding to the overall growth here, we're still seeing north of 6% or so of growth in the legacy business kind of across Europe. A couple of things that I would point out. In terms of the 9%, we do expect that to moderate throughout the year and be lower in the back half of the year after we kind of lap having Telxius on for a full year. So we're looking at about 7% organic growth in the back half of 2021. And then beyond that, we are looking at Europe not being at 9% but being kind of in that mid-single digits and upper single digits. So in Germany, we're still looking at 6% to 7% organic tenant billings growth in that market. And across all of Europe, we're looking at mid-single digits, let's call it, 5% to 6% organic growth in Europe even beyond 2022. Jonathan Atkin : And then just in terms of potential private capital partnerships, any kind of a refresh that you could give us on just the criteria that you would have from, whether it's a governance standpoint or strategic, what they bring strategically to the table or the financial criteria that you employ when you evaluate potential private capital partners? Rod Smith : Yes, Jonathan, I'll keep it at a fairly high level here. And I don't want to over emphasize the private capital or any of these different elements because we're still working through the process. And when we do land on our optimal financial plan here, we'll let you know. But in terms of our criteria, we certainly look well beyond just capital. So as we did with Telxius, we want to know that we've got world-class, large investors with us that have the same or similar mindset around the specific assets, the region and the future of those assets. Because additional capital and really having a partner that wants to grow in terms of this asset, it's going to be around exploiting this asset in terms of that cloud distribution, that heavy interconnection and then eventually moving to the edge or the metro edge. So we certainly want someone at the table with us that has a similar vision there, that is excited about that and again, doesn't get too wrapped up in a short-term equity volatility but see for long-term investment. And certainly, the investors that we would talk to, just like in the Telxius process, are long-term investors. They're 15-year to 30-year investors. They're not 5-years and also that's what we -- that's what we wanted. And we also really like investors that are very experienced and investing. We like having people at the table with us talking about ways to grow, how to grow. And we find a real value to that. So I would just maybe emphasize the fact that our partnerships in Europe with CDPQ, Allianz and PGGM has been very good for us, not just for the capital but for a lot of other reasons. So we couldn't be more pleased with the way that partnership has unfolded. And if we were to do something in the U.S., it would be -- we would be equally as optimistic around the good relationship, the shared vision and those sorts of things. And of course, governance in terms and conditions are always important to us in value. It's something we take seriously. So we'll certainly be working through that but that will be a criteria that will be on the table. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. Rod Smith : You're welcome. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great, thank you. Two quick follow-ups. Can you provide the geographic mix of the 6,500 new builds this year? And just the -- on the U.S., $150 million of new colo amendment. What's the colo versus amendment mix? And how should we think about the pacing through the year? Rod Smith : Yes, Batya. So I'll hit the first one here for you. So we're looking at around, for 2022, about 6,500 new builds. As in the past, it's heavily concentrated in the India region. So north of 4,000 roughly and these will be rough numbers in India. The next largest region is going to be in Africa which is going to be in the range of 1,900 or so, then we drop. And Latin America and Europe are pretty equal at around 500 sites each. And I'll just remind you that in Europe, we're building a lot of towers there through the Telxius transaction, came with a 10-year build-to-suit commitment of 3,000 sites over that time period. So we're actively building those assets. We're also building assets for Orange across Europe which the way they show up in our numbers, it kind of comes through as more in terms of an acquisition because they build them and kind of flipping to us but it really is sort of a build-to-suit program as well. So we couldn't be more pleased with the way that our build-to-suit program is working and unfolding. We continue to see double-digit NOI yields kind of across the mix here of all these regions which is really good. So we are solidly kind of on track to hit that 40,000 to 50,000 new builds that Tom had talked about in the past. And then in terms of your other question, when it comes to the split between amendments and colos, there's not a lot of detail that I'll get into from that perspective. A lot of our revenue is under the MLA agreements which again is more used rights than fixed fees and not so much ascribed to a colo versant amendment. We're still seeing heavy amendments in the industry by and large. Certainly, there's one carrier that might be a little bit more weighted towards co-location. But we're still seeing in terms of the activity level, heavily weighted towards amendments but I wouldn't want to try to split the $150 million because that's not the way that our contracts work in terms of the revenue. Batya Levi : Got it. Thank you. Rod Smith : You're welcome. Operator : And speakers, I'll turn the conference back to you for any closing comments. Tom Bartlett : Thank you very much, everyone, for joining us this morning. I know there's a lot of news around the world. I hope you all stay safe and well. And again, just appreciate you all being here this morning. To the extent you have any further follow-ups, please give us a call. We are clearly by the phones waiting to talk. So, thank you all. Rod Smith : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Adam Smith : Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.  On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our U.S. business. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q1 2022 results and revise full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2022 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the financing plan for the CoreSite acquisition; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release; those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021; and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Adam. And thank you everyone for joining our call this morning. In line with our traditional first quarter practice, my comments on this call will primarily focus on our core U.S. and Canadian tower business, which together with our U.S. based data center segment, made up approximately 54% of our total property revenues, and 65% of our total property segment operating profit in the first quarter.  Growth in our foundational U.S. and Canadian business continues to be propelled by the rapid acceleration in mobile data consumption that we've seen over the last decade plus. Back in 2017, the average smartphone in the U.S. was consuming roughly six gigabytes of data per month. And today, in the early stages of 5G uptake by consumers, that number has grown by a staggering 240% to over 20 gigabytes on a monthly basis.  As both 5G handsets and coverage become increasingly pervasive, this upward trend is expected to continue, with industry estimates now forecasting an average monthly consumption rate of 54 gigabytes by 2027. To meet this expected demand, carriers are aggressively deploying mid-band spectrum to provide ubiquitous 5G mobile services.  Historically, annual carrier CapEx in the U.S. has grown by approximately $5 billion to $6 billion, with every newG as MNOs deploy capital to maintain service quality on their increasingly strained networks, and provide incremental capacity and density to meet consumer demand for enhanced network performance.  Early evidence in the 5G cycle suggest this will continue to be the case. In fact, in 2021, we saw carriers increase aggregate network CapEx to approximately $34 billion up from the roughly $30 billion annually, we saw during the 4G cycle. And independent industry reports suggest that this number should continue in the $35 billion range on average going forward.  Further, as we've seen with prior network technology deployments, we expect a prolonged 5G investment cycle that will extend over the next decade. Today, carriers are in the earlier stages of upgrading sites with new equipment to provide broad contiguous 5G coverage across their respective subscriber basis. And given the propagation characteristics of mid-band spectrum, and ever increasing mobile data consumption paired with incremental low latency requirements arising from 5G enabled used cases, we would expect an extended period of investment aimed at delivering greater cell site density and stronger performance across networks for many years to come.  Importantly, it is clear that macro towers will continue to be crucial infrastructure for the long runway of carrier network investments that lie ahead. Macro sites have historically been the most cost effective means for carriers to provide broad base network coverage to the vast majority of the U.S. populace, and evidence suggests that remains unchanged in a 5G world.  To support this point over the last five years, our backlog of contractually guaranteed revenues in the U.S. is more than doubled on a per site basis. This speaks not only to our team's capacity to secure long-term, profitable cash flow growth from more than 43,000 distributed sites, but also to the long-term value our tenants place on our macro tower assets as a critical component of their network deployment strategy for 5G and beyond. These trends along with the guaranteed growth secure through our comprehensive MLAs support our expectation for strong growth on our tower assets, both in the near and longer term. In 2022, we expect another year of accelerating gross new business growth in the U.S. and Canada. And as we've previously communicated, growth from colocations and amendments, is expected to ramp in the back half of the year with the expectation that we'll exit 2022 on a high point.  With colocation and amendment contributions accelerating and the impacts of the Sprint churn beginning to come off their peaks we are well positioned to execute on a return to strong mid-single digit organic tenant billings growth in 2023 and beyond. On the operational front, our U.S. teams remain focused on driving efficiencies throughout the business. That allow us to quickly scale up to meet customer needs and maximize the flow through of top-line growth to the bottom line. Over the last few years, we progressed on process and IT initiatives designed to deliver best-in-class cycle times and introduce technology innovations in the field that improves site monitoring and data collection capabilities, while lowering site level operating costs and providing efficiency benefits for our tenants.  In addition, our focus on cost controls has driven cash SG&A as a percent of property revenue in the segment to well below 4%, on a consistent basis, a trend we expect to continue in 2022 and beyond. As a result, we've been able to continue extending on the significant operating leverage inherent to the tower business model. At the midpoint of our 2022 outlook, we expect an operating profit margin of 78.8%, representing a 370 basis point expansion in the segment over the last five years, even while absorbing the significant impacts of Sprint churn more recently.  This strong conversion of top line growth to profit margin, combined with the low capital intensity of just over 1% positions our U.S. and Canadian business to continue its decades long track record of delivering strong free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond.  With that, I'd like to shift gears for a moment to our data center segment, which we expect to benefit from many of the same long-term technological trends that are driving attractive growth in our tower business. We're off to a great start in our first full quarter of ownership of the CoreSite business. In Q1 is expected the CoreSite team delivered a very strong quarter of new and expansion sales, as these interconnection rich network and cloud dense data center campuses continue to attract strong demand from enterprises to cloud, the network and IT service providers in key U.S. markets.  Looking forward, we expect to continue to see accelerating Hybrid IT and multi-cloud deployments drive increasing demand for a highly interconnected portfolio, which should result in opportunities to selectively deploy capital toward high yield development projects.  Additionally, as the 5G revolution begins to unlock new capabilities, we're beginning to see incremental deployments resulting from AR, VR, gaming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other next generation use cases which require lower latency. We would only expect this trend to accelerate and drive more demand for our data center campuses over the coming years, while pushing storage and compute requirements further out to the network edge.  And when we combine our differentiated data center portfolio, CSP and network operator relationships with our distributed U.S. macro tower portfolio, and long standing MNO partnerships, we believe we have a significantly enhanced option to create value as the edge evolves over the coming years.  In summary, we're more excited than ever for the opportunity to extend on our long track record of strong profitable growth in the U.S. As the 5G environment continues to take shape, we believe we're uniquely positioned to drive continued long-term value for shareholders, while playing a critical role as an industry leader in this evolving 5G landscape. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the horrific events unfolding in Ukraine today. It's hard for any of us to comprehend the suffering of those affected by this humanitarian crisis. And while we do not have operations or employees in Ukraine, our thoughts and prayers go out to all those we have lost, and to all those who continue to be subjected to this crisis. We like many global organizations are focused on finding ways to help them millions of people who are suffering, both within the country and those who are now refugees elsewhere. And we will look to join with others to contribute to the relief efforts underway. With that, let me hand the call over to Rod to discuss our first quarter results and updated 2022 outlook. Rod? Rod Smith : Thanks, Tom. And thanks, everyone for joining today's call. As you saw in today's press release, we're off to a great start in 2022, delivering another quarter of strong performance across our global business. Before getting into the details of our Q1 results and revised outlook, I want to touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, demand for our towers continues to be strong throughout our global footprint, evidenced by the sequential acceleration of organic tenant billings growth across each of our reported segments. Additionally, organic leasing activity was complemented with nearly 1,450 newly constructed sites in Q1, our eleventh quarter of over 1000 new builds in the last three years, a milestone that was only achieved once prior to 2019.  Second, growth from our recently acquired premier assets Telxius and CoreSite is at the high end of our initial expectations. As a result, we are modestly raising guidance for Europe organic tenant billings growth and the midpoint of our datacenter segment revenues.  Additionally, in Europe, we recently signed an agreement with 1&1 in Germany, establishing a leasing framework to support their network rollout, which we expect to be another solid catalyst for growth in an already strong leasing market. We believe this further speaks to the quality and strategic positioning of our acquired Telxius assets, the opportune timing of the transaction and our optimism for the future.  And finally, we continue to leverage the capital markets to support our investment grade balance sheet. And we're able to issue $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes on attractive terms, right after the end of the first quarter. With proceeds used to term out a portion of our floating rate debt.  Looking ahead, and as it relates to our CoreSite financing plan, we continue to explore options that are aimed at maximizing shareholder value while supporting our investment grade credit ratings. Consistent with our prior outlook, we are targeting to finance the $10 billion plus purchase price roughly equally between debt and equity, the latter potentially being satisfied through issuances of common equity, mandatory preferred equity, or other convertible instruments or private capital or a well-balanced combination.  With that, please turn to Slide six and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, our Q1 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion grew by 22% or over 23% on an FX neutral basis over the prior year period, which included a contribution of approximately 17% in growth from Telxius and CoreSite.  In the U.S. and Canada, property revenue grew under 1% due to the impacts of Sprint churn, while international growth stood at roughly 32% or nearly 35%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations. Additionally, our newly expanded U.S. datacenter business contributed over $180 million of growth in the quarter. These growth rates across our property segments continued to reflect the essential nature of digital services and our communications real estate throughout our served markets.  Moving to the right side of the slide, you'll see our organic tenant billings growth for the quarter, with consolidated growth standing at 3%. In the United States and Canada, while growth was 0.6%, we saw an acceleration of gross organic new business on dollar basis, posting our highest quarter since Q1 of 2020, resulting in a 3.3% contribution to growth. Given the mechanics of our MLAs and the timing of certain use fees in 2021, we will see a decline in gross organic new business in the second quarter before ramping up in the back half of the year, which was all contemplated in our original 2022 guidance.  Escalators were 3.5%, which is also impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs. Though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was largely offset by the impacts of Sprint churn. On the international side, growth was 7.4%, and we saw improvements across each of our reported segments. Starting with Latin America, growth came in at roughly 8.7%. This includes approximately 8.5% from escalations, which represents an acceleration of 300 basis points as compared to Q4 2021. Additionally, relatively consistent growth organic leasing trends were largely offset by churn primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreements as highlighted on our Q4 2021 earnings call. In Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 8%, which includes 7% in gross organic new business contributions, our second highest quarter on record. This strong new leasing activity was complemented by the construction of over 600 sites in the quarter, as we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth and returns across the region. We have now constructed over 3,800 sites in Africa since the start of 2020, around the time we closed the Eaton Tower transaction, which meaningfully augmented our scale and enhanced the existing MNO relationships in the region. As a point of reference, prior to the Eaton transaction, we had constructed less than 2,200 sites in the preceding nine years of operations in Africa combined. Turning to Europe. We saw growth of 18.8%, reflecting pronounced contributions from the Telxius portfolio, which was not in our Q1 2021 base. Absent Telxius, our legacy European business grew over 6%, an expansion of 300 basis points as compared to our Q1 2021 growth rate. As we look to the back half of 2022, where we'll have more comparable year-over-year results with Telxius included, we expect to see strong organic tenant billings growth in the mid-7% range, driven by accelerating 5G deployments and continuing investments in 4G. In APAC, we saw growth of 2.1%, a continuation of the improvements we have seen over the past several quarters as churn further moderates in the India market. In fact, churn is now down to the mid-6% range, the lowest we've seen in nearly five years, which we project to further improve over the course of 2022. Turning to Slide seven. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 13% or nearly 14% on an FX-neutral basis to $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 61%, down over 5 percentage points over the prior year, driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of commenced Sprint churn, along with the higher pass-through revenue resulting from rising fuel costs. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by roughly 6% and nearly 4% respectively. Growth was meaningfully impacted by the timing of cash taxes and maintenance CapEx in 2021, which was heavily back-end weighted. The contributions of these two line items provided a negative year-over-year growth headwind of approximately 5% on AFFO in the quarter. Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, due to higher pass-through revenue associated with rising fuel costs, strong underlying trends in the business and modest FX improvements, we're increasing our property revenue outlook by $75 million at the midpoint. It's important to note that we continue to apply our standard methodology for projecting FX across our regions, taking the more conservative of the trailing 30-day spot rate averages and an aggregation of bank estimates. When applying current spot rates, we would actually see improvement beyond these revised assumptions, although we believe it's prudent to continue with our standard approach. Second, through solid conversion of our top line upside, the carryforward of some cost benefits and strong services performance in Q1, we are raising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA by $55 million. At an attributable AFFO per share level, we are raising our guide at the midpoint to $9.72, an increase of $0.02. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our prior guidance assumptions around the equity financing for CoreSite. With that, let's move into the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on Slide eight, we are now projecting consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of 14% at the midpoint. The increase, as compared to prior guidance, is due to approximately $66 million in additional international pass-through and straight-line revenue, $7 million in core property revenue outperformance, along with another $2 million in FX benefits. Moving to Slide nine, you'll see our revised organic tenant billings growth expectations for 2022. With the leasing environment remaining largely consistent across our footprint, we are reiterating our prior growth rates for Latin America, APAC, international, U.S. and Canada and on a total consolidated basis. We are modestly raising our expectations for Africa, driven by stronger new business in Europe mainly due to higher CPI-driven escalation contributions. As such, we now expect organic growth of greater than 6% and greater than 9% in Africa and Europe, respectively. Moving to Slide 10. And as noted earlier, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $55 million and now expect year-over-year growth of roughly 10.5%. These revised expectations include $26 million from cash gross margin outperformance, driven by the increase in our revenue guidance and some services margin expansion, partially offset by higher pass-through expenses. We also now expect an additional $19 million in net straight line and another $10 million associated with revised FX assumptions. Turning to Slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $10 million at the midpoint. As the benefits from the operational and FX upside I just mentioned are being partially offset by higher interest expenses, the result of an elevated rate curve since our last call. This translates to an increase of $0.02 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.72. As I mentioned earlier, and consistent with our initial outlook, our AFFO guidance includes an assumption for the CoreSite equity financing, which, for modeling purposes, assumes a common equity issuance by midyear. However, we continue to evaluate several potential sources, including common equity, mandatory convertible preferred equity and other convertible instruments and also private capital partnerships, where discussions continue to progress as a result of strong interest from leading private investors for a minority stake in our U.S. data center business. That said, we remain flexible in our approach, with the final mix ultimately depending upon what course offers the most attractive cost of capital terms and operational flexibility. Finally, with respect to the balance sheet management, following our recent senior unsecured note issuance, which I highlighted earlier, and pro forma for executing our equity financing, we will have termed out a significant balance of our floating rate debt and would expect to bring our net leverage to the high 5 times range, with a clear path to returning to our target range of 3 to 5 times over the next couple of years. Moving on to Slide 12, let's review our capital deployment expectations for 2022, which are consistent with our prior outlook and reflect our continued focus on driving strong, sustainable AFFO per share growth. As always, distributing capital to our common shareholders remains our top priority, and we continue to expect to allocate, subject to Board approval, approximately $2.8 billion towards our dividend in 2022. On a per share basis, this equates to approximately 12.5% in year-over-year growth, consistent with our double-digit target. On the CapEx front, we are reiterating our prior outlook midpoints across all categories. This plan supports our initial expectations to construct approximately 6,500 new sites across our international footprint and includes roughly $300 million towards our data center business, $270 million of which is tied to development projects.  We will continue to prioritize our development opportunities across our global footprint given its strong return profile and our ability to largely fund these initiatives through locally generated cash flows. In fact, of the nearly 1,450 sites we constructed in Q1, we saw an average day 01 NOI yield of 14%, at the high end of the double-digit initial return rates we've seen through our build program historically. Looking ahead, our development pipeline remains strong, with opportunities afforded by our scale, market positions, customer relationships, operational capabilities and solid underlying secular trends, which continue to drive strong demand across the portfolio. Finally, on Slide 13 and in summary, Q1 was a fantastic start to the year, with organic tenant billings growth accelerating sequentially across each of our reported segments as 5G deployments, 4G densification initiatives and the benefits of our comprehensive MLA agreements drive strong organic new leasing and increasing demand for newly constructed sites. We see the same secular trends driving solid performance on the datacenter front, and we could not be happier with the assets and team we've added through the CoreSite and data site acquisitions. We continue to be encouraged by the demand trends across our global portfolio of distributed communications real estate and look forward to executing on a number of strategic initiatives, including finalizing our CoreSite financing through the rest of the year, as we aim to deliver compelling total returns to our stockholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please. Matthew Niknam : Hey guys, thank you for taking the question. Just two, if I could. First, on Europe. So we've heard a lot of press around larger carrier portfolios coming to market there. I'm wondering how you think about the prospects of scaling up in Europe further through the lens of either full ownership versus partnering with a financial sponsor as you've done in the past? And then already in light of leverage, sitting at 6.4 turns right now. And then secondly, on CoreSite, obviously, this was the first full quarter with CoreSite under your belt. I'm wondering if there are any positive or negative surprises you can share. And then, Rod, I think you alluded to maybe a little bit of an increased outlook for the data center business, if there's any color or additional detail you can give? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Matt, let me start off, and Rod can add in as he see. First of all, within Europe, we're -- first of all, both Telxius as well as our CoreSite acquisition are hitting on all cylinders. They're both outperforming our expectations kind of right out of the gate. And so in Europe, we're very focused on really realizing the full potential with Telxius. As Rod said, we just landed the transaction with 1&1. So our focus is really on the final integration steps with Telxius and really leveraging that capability in the markets that we're in. So we're really pleased with the teams there and the contracts there and the relationship with Telefonica. With regards to CoreSite, they had a record retail and scale quarter. And so we're really pleased with what we've seen there. We've got a terrific management team in place, a good balance between activity between the retail scale and hyperscale types of business. I've got our sights set on building out some of the existing infrastructure that we have available to us. So on both transactions, we couldn't be more pleased with the activity that we're seeing right out of the gate. Rod Smith : Yes, good morning Matt. Thanks for joining us, and thanks for the question. I'll add a couple of points on CoreSite. So we are seeing positive trends in CoreSite. You've heard us say it before, we continue to view the asset as a very unique high-quality asset, and we're seeing the quality of the asset come through early on here in the financials. So we did have a terrific end of the year last year in terms of new and expansion revenue being added. We do see that accelerating into 2022. So that's really positive. That allowed us to increase the midpoint of the revenues by about $5 million. And we have seen the backlog for that measure kind of come up. We're sitting at about $19 million backlog versus a year ago same period where it was around $9 million. So that's up about $10 million. And we -- across the major metrics here, we think the business is really strong. In terms of revenue growth, the range we look at is between 6% and 8%. We're looking at the high end of that range, maybe even a touch above that range here. The escalators are in the range of 2% to 4%. Interconnection growth, our target range is between 6% and 8%, and again, we'll be at the high end of that range. We believe cash mark-to-market in the range of 2.3. We'll have to see exactly where that ends up. It always can be affected by kind of unique renewals from certain customers, with the range there is about 2% to 3% on an ongoing basis. The monthly recurring revenue per cabinet, we look at growth rates of 4% to 6% range. Again, we're in the mid-single digits for this year. So that is compelling. The churn rate is the right where we expected them to be in the middle of the range, the range is 6% to 8%. So we're taking on all cylinders with the business. I think it really demonstrates the quality of the asset. The fact customers of this business really do enjoy the interconnection nature and the cloud-centric nature of these assets. And from a CapEx perspective, we put in about 2% of revenue back in maintenance CapEx. And for growth CapEx, we've got about $300 million going into the business this year, really to build out additional capacity. Hopefully, that gives you some color, Matt. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on the 1&1 relationship, the new MLA you signed. Is that kind of driving a faster organic growth outlook in Europe than you previously had anticipated? And then secondly, I just wanted to take your temperature on the potential to do future data center M&A. Obviously, CoreSite only in eight markets. Are you seeing some opportunities out there, whether internationally or perhaps in secondary markets in the U.S. that might be interesting to further scale that platform? Thank you. Tom Bartlett : Yes. Let me -- I'll take the first -- or the second one, Rod, you could take the first one on 1&1. First of all, with regards to the data centers, we're really leveraging what we have acquired at the end of last year. And we're very focused on further developing that business, working very much on just the fundamentals of expanding sales, extending distribution, developing the campuses, market expansion, leveraging the interconnection capabilities that they have. And then secondly, looking at unlocking the opportunities at the edge. And so I think what you will see in the CoreSite transaction, yes, there will be further build-out of existing resources. There are expansions into -- up in Silicon Valley, we have a fairly sizable new asset that we're looking to build up there. And really just trying to, again, unlock the edge and work jointly with both of our customer sets on figuring out how we can play a meaningful role in that development. So the U.S. is our first project in terms of trying to work through all of these opportunities here. We remain really excited about the opportunity there. The kinds of conversations that we're having with the various potential customers are really exciting for us. It's going to take a while for this to unfold. But that's really where our focus is. And so we don't see -- our towers are our business. That's the reason that we did this transaction to begin with, to further develop the revenue that we're going to be able to enjoy at the tower side. And so that's where our focus is going to be. And then on 1&1, Rod? Rod Smith : Yes. Thanks, Tom, and thanks, Eric. So with 1&1, we are pleased that we have the agreement with 1&1. We're really looking forward to help them build out their greenfield 5G network across Germany. So that really is very exciting. The deal that we struck really is a framework around how the two parties will work together contractually. It also kind of lays out and gives 1&1 kind of that framework to access our sites. So that's exciting. There are long-term contracts kind of embedded in there. So we'll work through that. It's not really driving additional growth in our 2022 organic tenant billings yet, although we do think it's a very exciting development that will provide growth over the long-term and maybe even pick up in the back half of this year a little bit. But maybe, Eric, I'll hit a couple of points on the growth rates here in Europe. So you saw the announcement earlier in the presentation. We did have organic tenant billings growth in Europe in the high teens. A lot of that is driven by the Telxius assets, which is, again, a really high-quality asset across Europe, particularly in Germany. We do expect that momentum to continue, at least in terms of the leasing activity, but the -- when you get out into the back half of the year, when you bring the Telxius base revenue into the equation, we expect organic tenant billings growth for Europe to moderate and drop down into the 7% range, maybe between 7% and 8%. So still very strong growth. If you exclude Telxius and you just look at Germany -- I mean, just look at Europe legacy business, that business for Q1 grew greater than 6% on an organic tenant billings growth basis. That compares to a year ago same period at only 3%, 3.5%. So we're seeing really good growth momentum in Europe on the OTP metric on the legacy business as well as being assisted with the high-quality assets from Telxius. And we do think 1&1 will be a kind of a multiyear additional benefit as we go forward. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. Just curious if you could talk a little bit more about the domestic leasing environment in terms of that multiyear visibility that you previously been speaking to? And how that visibility is evolving for the business? Rod Smith : Yes, sure. Thanks for joining us. So I'll just remind you in terms of the long-term guidance that we have out there, it was over a 7-year average really going out to 2027, and we were looking at, at least 4% growth over that time on average reported and on a normalized basis, excluding the impact -- the negative impact of the profit would be up 5%. You know what that metric looked like in '21, and now you see kind of where we're guiding in '22. We'll hit an average of about 2% for those two years on a reported basis. And if you exclude, again, normalized for the Sprint churn, that would be up around 5%. And we're actually seeing that in Q1 in terms of our U.S. organic growth, which came in at about 0.6% for the quarter. And that did have an impact from Sprint churn that was pretty close to 4%. So that would have been up in the mid- to upper 4s if you normalize through the Sprint churn. So that's certainly where we expect to hit. If you look at the '23 to '27-time period, we would look at reported organic tenant billings growth being greater than 5%, greater than or equal to 5%. And on a normalized basis, around 6% greater than or equal to 6%. So we do see that acceleration kind of in momentum. We think we're in for a nice run here a really stable long-term healthy growth in the U.S. business once we work through the Sprint churn. And in these numbers, it's important to point out that two-thirds of the -- not just the underlying revenue, but also the growth is already contracted in the MLAs that we have the holistic MLAs. And it does include the acceleration and the partnership we have with DISH in terms of that agreement where revenue begins this year. It accelerates through the year, and then it will be there over the long-term. So hopefully, that gives you a little color, Michael, in terms of the U.S. growth rates. Operator : Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Alex Waters : Hi, good morning, Rod. This is Alex Waters on for Dave. Maybe just my first one here. Rod, you hit on a -- in your prepared remarks, but could you elaborate a little bit more on the plans for the size and the timing of the CoreSite equity raise? I think in the past you said it was 2Q and nice tip into 3Q? And then how have the plans evolved to include private capital there? Rod Smith : Yes. Thanks, Alex. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us. So we're working through the financing plan. We're very excited at the prospects and the different opportunities we have. As I said in our prepared remarks, we're looking at equity and equity component. That's really the final piece of the entire CoreSite financing. We ended the quarter here at about 4.6 times leverage. Our target range is between 3 and 5 times. And we do have a plan to delever over the next couple of years. So we expect by the end of the year to get into the mid- to upper 5 times. So that's where the equity component comes in. We're looking at raising about $5 billion from an equity transaction. That's what's in our base model. And the outlook just to reiterate here, the base plan, assumes that we're going to do a common equity issuance for the $5 billion, at roughly $235 a share. That's what's in our 2022 guidance for AFFO and AFFO per share growth. But with that said, we're also looking at other forms of equity. So complementing the common equity with some preferred convertible equity instruments, other kinds of convertible instruments and private capital. So we are looking at private capital options. Much of that has come from inbound inquiries that we've had. When people heard that we were buying CoreSite, I think there was a lot of excitement in the marketplace in terms of the high-quality nature of those assets. So there was a lot of inbound interest there. We also went out with some outbound inquiries, and we've been working through a process. So -- the other thing I would just clarify here, Alex, I think I mixed up the numbers on the leverage. We're ending at 6.4 and I think I may have said 4.6. So again, we're getting back down into the mid- to upper 5s by the end of the year. I think you made a comment in your question that we might be pushing the equity financing into Q3. I'm not sure that's correct, but we're working through the process. There's a good chance that we could have it wrapped up in Q2, like we initially said at the outset of the year. Tom Bartlett : And I guess, Rod, I would just add, we chose not to change the outlook assumptions. So at the time when we issued that initial outlook, we had the equity at that $5 billion level at the price point level. And as I said, just for clarity, I just want to make sure that we just kept at the same going forward. And obviously, we'll adjust that when Rod finally closes this whole transaction, which, again, we would expect in Q2. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks and good morning everybody. I appreciate you guys have been available. First question is down in Brazil, looks like it's finally making it to the final positioning. Can you update us a little bit about how you see the Oi getting carved into the other three operators as far as what it means to that market? And just what your exposure is? Tom Bartlett : Sure. Rob, do you want to -- I can... Rod Smith : Yes, Ric. So -- Oi has kind of finished their process of exiting the market and splitting their business up into the other three remaining carriers. So we do see that as a positive event, taking that -- those leases and putting them with carriers that are financially secure and kind of in a healthy competition in that market. So we think that is certainly going to be productive. We do have a chunk of revenue from Oi. We have about 6.7 -- just about seven years remaining on average on those leases. Ric, in terms of the, the revenue impact to our business, it's less than 1% of our revenues globally that we have with Oi down in Brazil. Even though we have that nearly seven years on average, that's an average, so there could be some leases that come up a little bit earlier than that. And we may see churn beginning as early as next year and kind of moving through the next few years. So we'll be working through that process. But in general, we think it's a healthy thing for the industry there in Brazil. We've been working through kind of the process as Oi has for the last couple of years. So I think it's good to get that behind us and get it behind the wireless segment there in Brazil, so everyone can move forward. Tom Bartlett : And Ric, I'd just reiterate that I think they're candidly, a very positive event, putting these assets in the hands of Tim Claro and Vivo. And they're very focused on building out further 4G and 5G. So I think this is a real positive for the market. Operator : We'll move on to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc. Go ahead Brandon Nispel : I want to follow up on Mike's question. Do you guys continue to expect to be at $150 million in colocation and amendments in the U.S. in '22? And then how should we think about the exit rate in terms of colocation and amendments for modeling purposes for 2023? Is that going to be a good run rate? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Yes, Brendan, thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us. So we are targeting about $150 million of contribution to organic tenant billings growth through colocation and amendment. The metric for the quarter was about $36 million. So that's an acceleration over the exit out of 2021, and it's higher than any quarter we had in 2021. So we are seeing that acceleration in that gross leasing activity in the U.S. As I said in my prepared remarks, we will see a slight pullback in Q2 in that metric, really just around the mechanics of the way the M&As work in the U.S. But when you get to Q3 and Q4, we'll be above the Q1 total here. So we'll be exiting at a higher level going into next year. I don't want to talk about next year too specifically here and give guidance, but we are seeing an acceleration in that metric. We expected to see that, and we are seeing that. And it's all very constructive and kind of in line with our longer-term organic tenant billings growth guidance for the U.S. Operator : We'll move on to the line of Jon Atkin with RBC. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks very much. A couple of questions. I noticed that the -- you talked about $120 million of asset acquisitions, $30 million of which were towers. Can you talk to us a little bit about what comprised the rest? Rod Smith : Sure, Jonathan. I can give you that. It's really just a variety of small acquisitions on the tower side. Many of them were in Europe. We do have an arrangement with a carrier in Europe, where we consistently buy a number of sites throughout the -- throughout each quarter in Europe. We're also buying a few down in in Latin America, 1s and 2s here and there. We also always have a pipeline in the U.S. where we're rolling up a few acquisitions here and there. And then there's some payments that are related to the prior year deals that we acquired. So there's really not a ton going on. We think about it in terms of Europe and in Latin America, primarily. Jonathan Atkin : And just interested in the -- SunGuard announced the bankruptcy earlier in April. And I think CoreSite, as a stand-alone company, had kind of alluded to some events around the prepackaged bankruptcy. But now that we're kind of going through the next phase of that, I wondered what impacts you're seeing on your data center business from that type of event? Rod Smith : No, Jon, we're not expecting anything material from that perspective. We don't see it -- we don't see any real negatives. Nothing meaningful to note. So we're committed and kind of confident in the growth rates that I outlined a little earlier in the call. Operator : And our next question will be from Batya Levi with UBS. Go ahead. Batya Levi : Thank you. In the U.S., can you talk a little bit about the activity you're seeing from DISH? And fixed wireless is ramping faster than we had expected. I know it's still very small, and the carriers have a lot of hollowed capacity. But anecdotally, do you see any change in carrier activity on the side where usage is increasing significantly? I want to get your thoughts on that. And then another question on -- in terms of the pulse build, you have a significant build program this year on development CapEx. Can you talk about your sort of what you're seeing in terms of the cost versus your expectations and any delays? Tom Bartlett : Yes, thank you Batya. On the continued build-out in the U.S., I mean, yes, there are -- I think the carriers have all said they're interested in continually building out fixed wireless, but that's not getting in the way in terms of their capital spend on really building out 5G. And so we would expect, again, kind of the continued acceleration of that 5G build really accelerating, as Rod said, kind of in the second half of the year. Spectra being cleared and being able to be put in place. We're excited about the prospects for that 5G build. I don't think the carriers are going to let anything get in the way of that opportunity going forward. And on the build side, I just want to say, this is of the last 12 quarters, 11 of them have built over 1,000 new builds. And that's going to contribute significantly to our overall growth rate in '22 as it has in '21. We've laid out a path of looking at north of 40,000 builds over the next several years, and have visibility into contracts with all of our existing customers to do so. Rod mentioned the build that's going on in Africa. We see equally build going on in Europe, clearly in India as well as in Latin America. So we're really excited about the build program. We're looking at over 6,000 new builds in '22. And as I mentioned, I'm hoping that, that will continue to accelerate going forward. Rod Smith : And Batya, I'll give you a couple of specific numbers here. On the costs -- you mentioned the cost of the builds. They're coming in at a little less than 100,000 on average, maybe closer to 75,000 on average per site. And we are continuing to see the targeted NOI yields being in the low to mid-teens. So we're in the range of about 14% now, which is great. Regarding to your question on DISH, we are seeing activity from DISH in the U.S., we did last year, as you know, and that continues this year. We see it mostly showing up in our financials through our services business. So we're continuing to have strong volume and activity in our services business. We're projecting in and around $225 million to $230 million in services revenue for this year. Last year, it was up to about $250 million. So there's a slight pullback there. But if you think about our services activity for the first quarter of 2022, it's almost 100% growth over that same time period in last year. And certainly, the DISH greenfield build is a big part of that. And if you rewind back to 2020, our services business was driving less than $100 million in revenue. So we've seen that step up in our services, which really highlights the level of activity that we're seeing in the U.S. And again, DISH is part of that. We'll begin to see leasing revenue here this year from DISH, and that will ramp in the back half of the year. And we'll exit at, of course, a much high level of leasing revenue from DISH than we entered the year. And then that will ramp and continue for years to come. Operator : We'll go now to the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Philip Cusick : Hey guys, thanks. A couple, if I can. First, if you can -- if I can follow up on the capital raise report site. If you were working on a large European deal, would that be material enough that it would be hard to raise public equity in the meantime? Or is that not something that's an issue? And then second, can you dig into your comments about the expected decline in gross organic new business in the second quarter before you said ramping up in the back half of the year? And is that alluding to the Verizon MLA expiration? It doesn't seem like that impacted the first quarter at all? Rod Smith : Yes. Thanks, Phil. Thanks for joining the call and thanks for the question. So in terms of the capital raise, I mean, I don't want to get into too much hypothetical there. A lot of different deals over in Europe, a lot of different stuff. I don't want to guess in terms of the level of capital that potentially could be needed. I would tell you, our equities are really strong. We've got a lot of support in the equity markets. If we wanted to go out and raise equity, we're very confident that we can do that for the right value accretive deal for our shareholders. So that's what I would say in terms of the potential for any other acquisitions and in issuing equity. Certainly, we'll continue to be active and looking around. We like the transaction that we have in Europe. We like what we're seeing in the Telxius business. We think that was a high-quality set of assets with really good contracts, and we purchased it at the right time. So from a European perspective, we like exactly where we sit today, and we are focused on financing the CoreSite opportunity as well. Jumping over to the deceleration from Q1 to Q2 in our OTBG contributions from colocations and amendments, it's dropping down from like the mid-30s for Q1 into the low 30s for Q2. It's not Verizon-driven, it's really just mechanics of the MLAs and where some use right fees kick in early in the year. And then we do see that ramping up, and we expect it to be in the range of 40 plus each of the final two quarters in the year. So that's kind of the way to think about that ramp. There's nothing concerning about the step down in Q2. It's all just MLA mechanics, and we feel very good about the level of activity in the position of our U.S. portfolio. Tom Bartlett : Phil, let me just reiterate, As I said all along, the CoreSite capital raise is not impacting how we think at all about future tower opportunities. We'll stop. Operator : We have time for one final question. That will come from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Sami Badri : Thank you very much for the question. First, I wanted to just get a better sense on how you think about the CoreSite business from a pricing and renewal perspective. And I know you mentioned that business for retail colo and other parts also were very strong last quarter, but what is kind of the strategy at A&T? Are you guys looking to kind of just take a bigger share out of the market by lowering pricing a little bit and winning a bigger chunk? Or are you maintaining pricing discipline as legacy CoreSite and seeing kind of the revisions and renewals as kind of as strong as what CoreSite was reported for they were taken out by you guys? Just trying to get a better idea on the strategy and the vision of CoreSite under AMT. Tom Bartlett : And let me just -- I can start, and Rod can get it. We're very focused on pricing discipline. I mean the assets that they have and what the business is doing with its own fabric within, we think can support this high single-digit, low double-digit kind of growth rate going forward. And so the team is very focused on extending distribution into all its 3 major pieces, really driving new and expansion sales, working on those renewals, developing the campus and market expansion, leveraging interconnection. So really driving organic growth from existing customers and bring -- getting new business from high-quality new ones and driving new logos within the business. So no change at all in terms of the direction and the discipline that the team brings to the marketplace. We are -- have increased some of the funding to be able to accelerate some of the build-out so that there's more opportunity for growth. But the underlying discipline in terms of how they have approached the business is what we acquired. And we're very excited about continuing that same type of discipline going forward. Operator : And with that, we'll turn the conference call back over to your host. Adam Smith : Thanks, everyone, for joining today's call.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Adam Smith : Good morning. Thank you for joining American Tower's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our international business. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q2 2022 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2022 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the financing plan for the CoreSite acquisition; including the closing of our Stonepeak minority investment in our U.S. data center business, our expectations regarding the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release; those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021; and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thanks Adam. And good morning everyone. In line with our historical practice for our second quarter earnings call, my comments today will be focused on American Towers international business, before diving into the trends that we see driving a long runway of growth in our international segment, I'd like to take a moment to review the principles that have underpinned our international expansion strategy over the last two decades. Since we first started expanding outside of the United States, entering Mexico and Brazil in 1999, and 2000, respectively, we've been guided by the belief that the secular demand trends and fundamentals of the tower business model that would drive tremendous value in the U.S. over a multi decade period would be replicated internationally. Central to this thesis was that the anticipated proliferation of wireless networks and resulting rapid growth and mobile data demand would necessitate neutral host shared wireless infrastructure across the globe. We also believe that by leveraging our core capabilities developed here in the United States, we could position American Tower as a premier global provider of communications, real estate, and a prime beneficiary of these trends. Further given the relative lack of fixed line infrastructure, accelerating population growth, and earlier stages of network technology evolution in many parts of the world, we believe we could both augment and extend our overall consolidated growth trajectory. So we set out to construct a geographically diverse platform of communication assets in the world's largest democratic economies, while establishing relationships with the leading global wireless carriers, achieved primarily through the acquisition of high quality portfolios with compelling underlying organic growth and risk adjusted return profiles. We then sought to leverage our scale, customer relationships and capabilities to execute on high return new build opportunities, and innovative solutions like power as a service that have strengthened our competitive positioning, and supported our customers in meeting their network needs, all while driving, increasing shareholder value. As a result of these efforts today, our global platform includes an international portfolio that fits in over 170,000 sites and contributes approximately 45% of our property revenues and approximately 36% of our property segment operating profit. Focusing in our international new build program for a moment, we've constructed approximately 40,000 sites since launching our international operations over two decades ago, just over 22,000 of those sites being built since the start of 2018 alone. We credit this recent acceleration to our enhanced market positioning ahead of major network deployments, demonstrated operational capabilities and strong cross national MNO partnerships, all afforded to previous strategic M&A expansion initiatives. In total, these 40,000 American Tower build sites are driving an attractive NOI yield of 25% owing to the strong demand we've seen for our infrastructure, and the operating leverage inherent to the shared tower model across the globe. As sites looking forward we\u2019ll continue driving toward our ambition to add another 40,000 sites to 50,000 sites to our international portfolio over the next several years. With that, let's take a few minutes to discuss each of our international regions and the key trends developing across our footprint. First, I'll touch on Europe; we have a portfolio of over 30,000 sites, and strong scaled positions in Germany and Spain, which are benefiting from many of the same trends driving strong growth in the United States, including the early stage of 5G rollouts, and a new entrant. As many of you know, we've taken a consistently measured approach to achieving scale on the continent. We started through a modest acquisition in Germany in 2012. We then spent the better part of the following decade evaluating various opportunities, who are disciplined approach to capital allocation, which led to our entry into France in 2017, and later a small scale entry to Poland. However, it wasn't until the Telxius transaction in 2021, that we found an opportunity to add significant scale to a portfolio that met the standards of our global underwriting framework. These characteristics include high quality, strategically located assets that stand to benefit from continued network investments and attractive contractual terms and conditions, such as CPI based escalators, which act as a natural hedge against local inflation, along with a low churn profile, which taken together drive compelling risk adjusted returns for American Tower and our shareholders. From a timing perspective, we couldn't be happier with our acquisition of the Telxius tower portfolio, across Germany and Spain, we've seen several quarters of accelerating activity as carriers begin lighting up low and mid band spectrum with new 5G equipment, while continuing to invest to support growth data consumption on their existing 4G networks. At the same time, in Germany, new entrant 1&1 is rolling out a Greenfield 5G network and we believe our portfolio of nearly 15,000 sites, primarily located in urban centers across the country is in a strong position to support their network bill. Earlier this year, we signed a framework agreement with 1&1 through which we can provide value to the carrier while benefiting from incremental growth associated with the relationship for many years to come. As a result of these factors, we're seeing strong leasing activity on our assets, as well as demand for new builds, particularly in white and gray spot areas where carriers are working to meet coverage requirements and provide critical connectivity in areas that hadn't historically been underserved. In 2022, we plan to double our previous record and build approximately 400 sites across Europe. And we expect this trend of elevated new build activities continue. Thanks to the demand driven by such initiatives, the pipeline secure through the Telxius transaction in our position as a leading independent power operator on the continent, with a global reputation for operational excellence. With that let's turn to our regions that are in relatively earlier stages of network technology, and where we see an opportunity to capitalize on a strong persistent demand environment for an extended period. There's probably no region where the benefits of local scale and the operational expertise gained is a premier independent operator are more pronounced than an Africa, where we're seeing these benefits play out across essentially every facet of the business. In recent years, we've seen the proliferation of affordable smart devices and consumer uptake of mobile application use cases drive outsize growth in mobile data usage. And our multinational carrier customers across the region have been working to rollout and enhance their 4G networks in response. For ATC Africa, this has resulted in average organic kind of billings growth in the high single digit range over the last several years, coupled with five consecutive years of record new build activity. This trend has continued unabated into 2022. And as a result, we've built over 1000 sites across Africa in the first half alone, up over 30%, compared to the first half of 2021, and nearly double the volumes achieved in the same period in 2020. These sites continue to demonstrate very attractive average day one NOI yields with our year-to-date builds producing more than 13%. And we expect to continue to execute on opportunities to add critical scale and earn strong returns in key markets throughout the region over the next several years. While the trends supporting a strong growth environment in the region are expected to persist, there are operational challenges to create unique opportunities in the African market, particularly in the context of a global supply chain disruptions, power grid availability and reliability and on-going macro volatility. It's here that the scale of our African business shared learnings of a global organization and an entrenched culture of innovation have resulted in a resilient, differentiated business across the region. For example, we've been able to leverage global supply chain learnings from the peak of the pandemic, as well as the resources afforded by our investment grade balance sheet and strong international cash flows to produce materials for a new build program several quarters in advance. Not only does this result in cost savings in an inflationary environment, but also derisk operational challenges in a core sector of high yield growth for American Tower, while bolstering our reputation as a preferred partner, who is capable of delivering new sites when we say we're going to. This forward thinking approach to the procurement of critical resources is also been applied to an area of our Africa business that we are perhaps most proud of our power program, where we've accelerated our innovative efforts across the region in recent years. Today, we've deployed roughly $300 million in the region to equip nearly 16,000 sites with the capability to source power from renewables, and more energy efficient resources, including lithium ion batteries, and solar arrays, and in our new build program, where we're working toward making the majority of our newly constructed towers operationally zero, or near zero greenhouse gas emission sites. In fact, as of the end of the second quarter, we've installed lithium ion batteries and solar panels at nearly 70% in over 40% of our sites in the region respectively, which has driven a reduction in our reliance on fossil fuel power generators, accommodated our potential to increasingly rely on intermittent renewable sources, and supported our progress toward meeting our GHG emission reduction targets. More recently, we've been able to leverage our position in the region to form a strategic partnership with a vendor in our energy supply chain. This alliance brings product assembly to the region, as we look to augment our delivery of environmentally and economically sustainable power solutions that are sites where power availability and access to efficient and reliable sources can often be a challenge. Additionally, this local partnership will facilitate the acceleration of our progress toward meeting our emission targets, reducing our supply chain risks, lowering the overall carbon footprint and cost of our procurement process and supporting the local economy and the communities we serve, which we are particularly proud of. Let's turn to Latin America, which was our first region of international expansion, and where we've seen upper single digit average organic tenant billings growth over the last several years. On a consolidated basis our nearly 49,000 sites earning a double digit NOI yield in our earlier vintage in the region, which consists of assets built or acquired prior to 2010 were seeing a U.S. dollar yield of over 40%. Today, M&O's in the region are in advanced stages of 4G, and in the early innings of 5G network deployments to driving a significant need for additional cell sites. As a result, we continue to see solid activity on our existing sites, as well as growth through new infrastructure to improve both coverage and capacity. Although we expect to see the on-going effects of industry restructuring impact net organic growth in the midterm, we believe the portfolio we've developed across the continent over the last two decades will be critical for our customers as they continue to invest in their networks. Looking at Brazil, specifically our largest market in the region in terms of site count revenue, we're seeing the final stages of a consolidation process that has resulted in a Transfer Network assets in the hands of large multinational operators, with the capabilities and financial firepower to build out enhanced next generation networks on a nationwide basis. Further with 5G auction now complete, our local scale positions American Tower as a strategic partner to our customers as they transform their networks, while allowing us to maximize the opportunities provided by consolidation, and increased carrier investment obligations. Although we're at the very early stages of a network upgrade investment cycle, we're already seeing incremental demand for infrastructure capturing a large share of the initial urban amendment cycle. We expect this amendment cycle to be followed by a period of new site deployments, aimed at improving capacity and performance, similar to the cadence we anticipate in the U.S. over the course of the next decade, which would translate to solid growth for American Tower in the region over a multiyear period. Finally, let's turn to Asia Pacific. Our portfolio in the region predominantly consists of our scaled footprint across India, as well as our more recently established presence in the Philippines and Bangladesh, where we've leveraged our management site deployment expertise to prudently evaluate opportunities in the region to high yield build programs, resulting in over 400 sites being constructed across the two markets combined year-to-date. In India, we continue to be encouraged by the improvements in market structure, carrier health, and government reforms aimed at easing the near term financial burden of operators and ensuring a multiplayer competitive ecosystem, all of which is driving incrementally constructive trends across the communications infrastructure landscape. And with the carrier consolidation cycle, and associated elevated churn largely complete, a full year outlook includes an expectation for positive organic tenant billings growth in the region for the first time in several years. While challenges certainly remain in the market, and we could see some variability in growth from period to period, our optimism around the longer term opportunity presented in India remains. With an attractive backdrop of a growing population of over 1.4 billion people it's driving accelerated mobile data usage and a government is demonstrating a commitment to a digital transformation of the economy, we see a need for thousands of new cell sites to serve 4G, and eventually future 5G networks. We expect these catalysts to drive a period of sustained attractive, gross growth, as well as a continued acceleration of our new build program, where we're seeing low to mid double digit day one NOI yields on average, and taken together with a moderating churn environment, we remain optimistic that India and the Asia Pacific region can be a solid contributor toward achieving our longer term growth targets on a consolidated basis. In summary, we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing across our international footprint, with an acceleration in mobile data consumption, driving sustained customer investments on current and next generation networks globally. Over the past two decades, we followed a consistent and disciplined approach to market and asset selection demonstrated a consistent track record of operational excellence, and developed the scale presence and strong customer partnerships across a geographically diverse and globally distributed footprint, which we believe places this at a distinct competitive advantage in a 5G world and beyond. While we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to further enhance our scale to the same discipline lens, we remained focused on leveraging our position and capabilities to drive incremental value across our served markets. We believe our well balanced international platform, combined with our highly complementary foundational U.S. business, provides American Tower with an unmatched global portfolio that's optimally positioned to benefit from multiple network technology evolutions, and digital transformation opportunities for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Rod to take you through our latest quarterly results, and updated outlook. Rod? Rod Smith : Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As you saw in today's press release, we delivered another quarter of strong performance across our global business. Before walking through the details of our Q2 results and revised outlook, I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter along with the financing initiatives we've executed over the last several months. First, we've announced and partially closed our plans to raise approximately $4.8 billion in equity financing in support of our core site acquisition, beginning with our common equity issuance in early June, and later, through our announced agreement was Stonepeak in our U.S. data center business. With these two transactions, not only have we addressed our equity financing requirements for CoreSite, but we've accomplished it in a manner that maximizes shareholder value and supports our investment grade credit ratings further through our partnership with Stonepeak, who brings tremendous expertise and communications infrastructure, and if they like minded long term investment philosophy, we've created a platform to further evaluate and finance growth opportunities across our U.S. datacenter business as the 5G ecosystem further develops. Moreover, we believe Stonepeak\u2019s investment represents a full valuation relative to what we have invested in our U.S. data center portfolio today, and allows American Tower to retain operational control, as well as the flexibility to execute on our mobile edge strategy. I'll discuss this transaction in more detail later. Second, we also continue to strengthen our balance sheet by leveraging the debt capital markets, raising $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes at attractive terms. As a result of our Q2 financing activities in pro forma for our private capital proceeds, which we expect to use to pay down short term floating rate debt, we will increase our percentage of fixed debt to nearly 80%, up from 66% as of the end of Q1, and bring pro forma net leverage down to approximately 5.5 times. With our CoreSite financing now largely complete, we remain committed to organically delivering back below five times over the next couple of years. Third, we see strong secular trends driving increased network coverage and densification initiatives among our customers, continuing to translate into solid gross new business globally, including the need for more cell sites internationally as Tom just highlighted. Evidenced by the success of our new builds program, we constructed over 1500 sites in Q2, representing the 12 quarter of over 1000 new builds since the start of 2019, a demonstration of the success of our capabilities and expertise, scaled to market positions, and strong customer relationships. Additionally, demand remains robust for our differentiated interconnection rich U.S. data center campuses, as customers leverage the dynamically scalable solutions and interoperability provided by CoreSite\u2019s national ecosystem, leading to another strong quarter of new and expansion leasing. And finally, our first half performance and confidence in our full year outlook and long term targets amid heightened market volatility, rising inflation and operational challenges is a testament to the resiliency of our business and the stability of the earnings we consistently generate. This is made possible through operational excellence and service dependability, our investment grade balance sheet, the strength of our underlying contracts, including international revenue supported by CPI linked escalators, the ability to pass through a substantial portion of our direct costs across our international regions, and the matching of escalator terms in the U.S. between customer and land leases, and more importantly, the mobile data trends driving unabated demand for our communications assets. With that, please turn to slide six and I'll review our Q2 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. As you can see, our Q2 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion grew by over 17% and nearly 19% on an FX neutral basis over the prior year period. In the U.S. and Canada, property revenue was roughly flat due to the continued effects of Sprint churn, while international growth stood at roughly 19% or nearly 23%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and includes about 12% contributed by the Telxius assets. In addition, our U.S. data center business contributed nearly $190 million of growth in the quarter. These growth rates are indicative of the strong secular demand drivers that underpin growth on our communications infrastructure assets across the globe as 4G and 5G deployments continue. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see we achieved consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 2.6% for the quarter. In the U.S. and Canada, as expected, organic growth was slightly negative at 0.4% including a sequential step down and gross organic new business on $1 basis associated with the timing of certain MLA use V commencements in 2021 which we guided to during our Q1 call, we continue to expect a reacceleration and gross new business in the back half of the year. Escalators were 2.8%, which as we also highlighted last quarter, were impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was offset by the impacts of Sprint churn, which continues to drive over 4% of negative headwind year-over-year. On the international side, organic growth was 7.8%. Starting with Europe we saw growth of 11.2%, which remains elevated given contributions from the Telxius portfolio, which were only partially included in our Q2 2021 base. Absent Telxius our legacy European business grew roughly 6% and expansion of approximately 160 basis points as compared to our Q2 2021 growth rates. In Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 9%, which includes 8% in gross organic new business contributions, our highest quarter on record the continued strength and new leasing activity in the region was complemented by the construction of just over 400 sites in the quarter. As we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth in returns across the region. Moving to Latin America, organic growth was 8.3%, which includes approximately 8.7% from escalations. Consistent gross organic leasing growth was offset by expected elevated churn primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreements, as highlighted on previous earnings calls. For both Africa and Latin America as we look to the second half of the year, we expect a step down relative to the first half in net organic growth rates due to anticipated consolidation driven churn, which remains consistent with our prior outlook assumptions. In APAC, we saw organic growth of 3.9% in line with our expectations and representing our fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth, which comes alongside a continuation of solid new build activity with nearly 1000 sites constructed during the quarter. It's important to note that although we remain encouraged by the positive trends we're seeing in our APAC growth rates, we do anticipate a modest sequential step down in Q3 to the low single digit range before recovery in Q4 to near that upper end of our 2% to 3% full year guide, which remains unchanged. Turning to slide seven, our second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew just over 13% or over 14% on an FX neutral basis to approximately $1.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 62.5%, down 170 basis points over the prior year, driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of commenced sprint churn along with higher pasture revenue, resulting from rising fuel costs. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 7% and 5%, respectively. Growth was meaningfully impacted by sprint churn and the timing of cash taxes, which together provided a negative headwind of nearly 7%. Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high level drivers. First, our core operating performance remains strong across our business, allowing us to raise our AFFO per share guidance for the year and increase our expectations on an FX neutral basis for property revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Second, we have revised our FX assumptions using our standard methodology, which has resulted in Outlook to Outlook headwinds of approximately 100 million, nearly 50 million, 40 million and roughly $0.08 for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO, and AFFO per share, respectively. Finally, we have updated our CoreSite financing assumptions to reflect our completed common equity issuance, and our anticipated close of private capital funding. This update has resulted in a reduction in our total equity requirement balanced with the incremental debt and associated interest costs. Additionally, we have contemplated the minority interest impacts related to the Stonepeak partnership and updated closing assumptions, all of which I will address in more detail in a moment. With that, let's discuss the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on slide eight, we are continuing to project consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of nearly 14% at the midpoint. The $15 million decrease relative to prior guidance is driven by the FX headwinds I previously mentioned, which were partially offset by over $40 million in core property revenue outperformance taking the benefits of CPI in our international escalators and accelerated decommissioning related settlements, together with upside in our U.S. and Canada in data center segments and over $40 million and other outperformance primarily driven by higher international passer revenue due to elevated fuel costs. Moving to slide nine, you will see our organic tenant billings growth projections, which have been slightly revised since our last earnings call. While our expectations remain consistent in the U.S. and Canada, international, and on a consolidated basis, we have made some adjustments within our specific international segments. In Europe, we have adjusted our growth back to approximately 9% reflecting our expectations for temporary shift and new business commencement timing, from the back half of 2022 into 2023. Demand remains very solid in the region, setting us up well as we exit 2022. You will also see that we have modestly raised the guidance for Latin America to approximately 7% in Africa to approximately 6.5% both up from previous expectations of greater than 6% reflecting a continuation of escalation benefits from CPI. Moving to slide 10, we are lowering our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $20 million as compared to our prior outlook, driven again by negative FX impacts, with expected growth of approximately 10% year-over-year. While we are seeing a strong conversion of core property revenue upside to cash margin outperformance we have taken a revised view on SG&A, notably on bad debt reversal expectations for the year. Although collection trends were solid in Q2, we have pushed out some of our assumptions related to the incremental collections associated with previously reserve balances that we continue to expect to collect in time. Turning to slide 11, we are raising our attributable AFFO per share guidance to $9.74 from $9.72, despite absorbing the negative effects from FX and a continued rise in interest rates. To better understand the components in our revised outlook bridge, I'd like to spend a moment to walk through the moving pieces of the guidance associated with our updated Equity Plan and the mechanics of our Stonepeak partnership, which consists of 1.75 billion in common equity, and 750 million in mandatory convertible preferred equity for a total ownership interest of 29% on a fully convertible basis in our U.S. datacenter business. First, as I mentioned, we were able to reduce our total equity requirement from approximately $5.5 billion to $4.8 billion, including $2.3 billion of common equity proceeds, which meaningfully reduced our share issuance to approximately 9.2 million shares. The reduction in equity resulted in an increase to our debt balances, which together with the revised timing of the equity raise, along with the elevated interest rates has driven an increase to our interest expense outlook, which largely makes up the over $50 million other reduction to AFFO as compared to our prior outlook. Next, regarding our Stonepeak partnership, the financial impacts for their minority investment will appear in two places. First, a coupon of $750 million of mandatorily convertible preferred equity with a cost in the mid-single digit percent range will be recognized as a deduction to the AFFO generated by our data center segment and reflected in our consolidated AFFO, which represents approximately $14 million in our 2022 guide, as shown on the slide. Second, until conversion of their preferred equity, which is expected to occur four years from the date of closing, Stonepeaks initial common equity stake in our data center business will stand at 23% which contemplates approximately $2 billion of net debt on the U.S. data center business and will be considered as a minority interest deduction for attributable AFFO purposes, equating to approximately $20 million in our 2022 outlook. Please note, we have also reduced the European minority interest assumption from $160 million previously to $150 million largely due to FX. Together, we are now guiding to a minority interest adjustment of $170 million in 2022. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, our updated outlook also takes consideration updated equity closing assumptions. We previously assumed they made closing for our common equity issuance, which actually occurred in early June. We also assumed our private capital will close in mid Q3 with plan proceeds to be used to pay down short term floating rate debt. Taken all together, our revised CoreSite financing plan drove approximately $0.06 of incremental accretion relative to our prior attributable AFFO per share outlook, which includes a negative hit of roughly $0.03 driven by higher interest rates on our debt financing relative to our previous assumptions. Moving to slide 12, let's look at our capitol deployment expectations for 2022, which are updated compared to our prior outlook, while continuing to reflect our focus on driving strong, sustainable AFFO per share growth. First, we now expect to dedicate approximately $2.7 billion subject to board approval towards our 2022 dividends. This is down slightly from our previous guidance of $2.8 billion, which is simply a function of our reduced common equity issuance and continues to represent approximately 12.5% in year-over-year growth on a per share basis. In regards to CapEx, we are decreasing our outlook midpoint by $60 million in total, with development CapEx increasing $15 million and with redevelopment capital and land acquisition spend decreasing $25 million and $50 million respectively. Our development plan continues to assume the construction of approximately 6500 new sites globally at attractive returns. In fact, on the nearly 3000 sites constructed in the first half of 2022, we saw a day one NOI yield of roughly 14%. Lastly, we continue to expect to direct roughly $300 million towards our U.S. data center business largely associated with development spend. Now turning to slide 13. In with our CoreSite financing plan largely complete, I will briefly touch on the strength of our investment grade balance sheet, which is fundamental to the execution of our stand and deliver strategy. Our long standing financial policies, including establishing optimal levels of leverage and an appropriate mix of debt instruments guide the management of our capital structure, which together with our strong business fundamentals provide American Tower with continued access to capital markets at attractive terms. As you recall, the American Tower proactively access the debt capital markets in 2021, taking advantage of historically low pricing, raising roughly $3 billion in senior unsecured notes in the second half of the year, at a blended cost of approximately 1.6%. With our fixed debt percentage at the time rising to over 85%, this effectively allowed us to lock in low rate debt for future strategic initiatives including the CoreSite acquisition, which in turn reduce our dependency on the debt markets in 2022 as part of our final financing plan. We believe the strategic and efficient management of our balance sheet puts us in a strong position as we close out 2022 and look beyond. As of the end of the second quarter in pro forma for the close of the Stonepeak investment in our U.S. data center business our average cost of debt stands at about 2.6% with an average remaining tenor of over six years. Since 2010, we have reduced our average cost of debt by approximately 250 basis points and increased our average debt tenure [ph] by about one year by accessing the long part of the yield curve proactively refinancing our debt and capitalizing on low rate environments. In addition, and more recently, we also focused on diversifying and expanding our capital sources and structure by issuing Euro denominated debt, establishing our ATM program and efficiently executing on public equity raises and partnership agreements with leading global private investors. With a strong liquidity position of approximately $6.7 billion on a pro forma basis, inclusive of Stonepeak proceeds and other financing activities subsequent to the quarter end in a staggered maturity profile we feel well positioned moving forward as we focus on organically deleveraging back to within our normal net leverage range over the next couple of years. Taken all together, we see the strength of our financial position as a competitive advantage for American Tower, whether executing on our growth strategy navigating economic downturns or volatility in the financial markets. And we remain focused on and committed to our thoughtfully established financial policies that have guided our financial strategy for the past decade. Finally, on slide 14, and in summary, Q2 was another solid quarter supported by leasing demand across our global portfolio of communication assets, strong execution of capital markets initiatives, including financing for the CoreSite acquisition and meaningful high yielding new asset development activity. Our high quality set of assets and established market positions continue to benefit from secular demand trends driving 4G and 5G initiatives across our global footprint, while the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows, has us well positioned to manage and grow the business through potential market volatility and uncertainty. As we look to the back half of the year, we are excited about our growth trajectory and remain focused on executing on our strategic initiatives, which support our long term double digit AFFO growth aspirations. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you.[Operator Instructions] One moment here. We're going to Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. Two topics, if I could, first on the U.S. curious if you can give a further update on the U.S. leasing environment, and specifically provide an update on how American Tower is tracking against the previously provided growth target of at least 5% organic growth beginning next year. And then also sorry, just one other part of this is just are you seeing any change in the environment with AT&T announcing the acceleration of C band deployment? And then I'll come back to be on in just a second topic on India if I could. Tom Bartlett : Okay, Michael, I can start and Rod can join. We're right on track with our previously planned growth rates going forward. We would expect kind of an acceleration in the back half of 2022, and then even a further acceleration into 2023. So we have so much visibility with regards to our MLAs I think we're in a really good position to be able to track what that growth looks like. But everything is right on track, as we've laid out. And with regards to AT&T, nothing outside of the ordinary. I mean, all the carriers are building at a great pace. And as I said, very consistent with how we've seen the market and how we see it developing over the next several years. Rod Smith : Yes. And Tom, maybe I'll just add in there. In terms of further discussing the on-track comment, we guided to approximately 2% of growth both on average for 2021 and 2022. And as you can see in numbers, Michael, right on track with that 2.2% last year in the U.S. So a little at 1% this year. That puts us right on the back of that 2%. I will remind you that there is a pretty significant headwind from the Sprint churn that is affecting the growth rate. And that does equal about 4% headwind going into this year. So that 1% would have been a lot closer to 5% if it hadn't been for [Technical Difficulty]. And then, the further guidance from 2023 out to 2027 is the -- is around 5% on a reported basis with about 2% adjusted for the Sprint churn kind of coming out of that. And we're well on track for that. We've got about two-thirds of that revenue growth already committed within the framework of our holistic agreement. And we're also seeing that in the co-location and amendment contributions from new biz in the U.S., so we are on track with that metric for this year. That is growth over last year. We do expect Q3 and Q4 to be at higher levels than what we had in Q1. So that's the acceleration we're seeing through this year, and we expect the levels as compared next year based on the way that our holistic deals are struck, the addition of DISH, as well as the acceleration of spend from the carrier. Michael Rollins : Thanks. And just one question on India. I was just cruising over the supplement on and on page 12 the historical power counts. It shows in the APAC region, presumably India that the -- that there's been this negative adjustment in sales or just shutdowns of towers that's been running at an annualized rate of 3% to 5%. And just curious, when this optimization could substantially slow down or conclude and if that then releases a headwind on the growth of this segment. Tom Bartlett : Just quick on the \u2013 sorry Mike I had a little computer difficulty here that I just had to, to address. Yes. So when it comes to the, to the India information, it really is associated with the consolidation that we've seen in the Indian market with the turn that we've had over the last several years, as you're well aware of with that, when we have single tenant towers where we don't see additional lease possibilities in the near term, we did end up taking those down to kind of rationalize the operating expense aspect of kind of what we're what we're doing in India. So as you see churn in India continue to moderate which we've seen to a great extent, over the last couple of years, you'll see commission activity in the tower reduction slowdown as well. And there is usually a little lag between when you see the churn come through our revenue numbers. And then when you see the tower, some towers actually come out of the tower counts. Michael Rollins : Thanks very much. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the data center portfolio. I think you referenced in the slides, outperformance there, it looked like the sequential numbers were good. What are you seeing in terms of bookings, trends, backlog, things like bad industry pricing. And then I think on the European guidance, you talked about pushing some activity from late 2022 into 2023. I think one of the other tower companies in Europe had mentioned something similar, can you just expand on that a little bit and what gives you confidence that it's just a matter of months and other things, given the kind of recession concerns and the impact power prices might be having there? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Hey Simon, maybe I'll take on the data center side. And we had another really strong quarter with all of our data center business. We've largely completed the integration of our legacy centered into intercourse, right. Strong sales, strong backlog, really positive cash MDM, churn is right on contract. So we're really pleased they're outpacing as Rod mentioned, we've actually upgraded our, our guidance relative to the activity that we've seen within CoreSite. So really strong top line growth, new and expanded sales activity, all very, very good mix with new logos with a network, new business, as well as with hyperscale. So really balanced, strong growth and interconnection, as well, which I think is just critical to this the competitive advantage that we are seeing in the business and fully expected. So couldn't be more pleased with, with what the business has been able to generate out of the gate. Rod Smith : Yes, Simon. And I would just add to that, that's competence to undertake a couple of development projects on the data center side. So we have a few of them, two of them going on, that's driving slightly elevated CapEx investments in the data center business. So I think you've seen our numbers, we've got, upwards to 300 million, 320 million of CapEx, which is a little heavier than what we would normally expect to see. But we do have a couple of facilities where the demand goes strong, we've undertaken some additional development opportunities within the campus that that we operate. And then to, to address your question on Europe, we are seeing a little bit of a moderation in terms of the growth in Europe, our previous guidance was to have organic tenant billing growth for the full year to be greater than nine. And we've taken that back a touch to approximately 9%. And that's primarily driven because we do you see some leasing activity that we expected in the second half of 2022, to be pushed into 2023. So we do see a very strong market in Europe, particularly in Germany, with the addition of one on one coming in and the 5G, the initial deployment of 5G networks. And the way that the organic tenant billings Brookfield exit this year is going to be you know approaching 7% sort of SP exit run rate, which is I think is a really strong number for us. We couldn't be more happy with the timing of what we're seeing in Europe and the demand for our assets. Through the Telxius portfolio, we've picked up a lot of really urban centric assets, including a lot of roof tops, and we're finding that very desirable in terms of carrier activity going forward. And that's what's really driving the growth rates there. So it's really just the timing in Europe with the growth rates are really great. Simon Flannery : Great. And on the data center Tom, any updated thoughts on the edge opportunity now that you've owned it for six plus months? Tom Bartlett : Yes, it's I mean, it's yes, there is. I mean, we've actually created internally an Edge Advisory Board, we're setting up an Edge Lab, we've scanned our sites, and we've done the really the full evaluation of, of our sites that can support a megawatt and two megawatts of activity. We're looking by the end of the year to actually establish and start to build out a few of these megawatt facilities. And we're in discussions, with all the potential participants looking to take advantage of the opportunity. So, it's still early days, as you recall that the reason for this particular transaction was the underlying business itself, diversification of our existing business into the broader digital infrastructure, industry, and then the potential for being a major player in terms of developing what that edge would look like. And so we'll have more about this on our third quarter call. We talk more about technology, Simon. Simon Flannery : Thank you. Operator : And next, we go to the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great, thanks for taking the question. First, I wanted to touch on the -- you mentioned some of the churn in Latin America. And maybe you could just expand on that, whether that specific to the oil restructuring in Brazil, kind of how you expect that to flow versus some of the churn you've had in Mexico and how you see that trending into next year. And then, Rod curious on the bad debt reserve, you mentioned any color you can provide in terms of regions that you're closely monitoring in terms of collections or payments activity that would be helpful. Thank you. Rod Smith : Yes. Good morning, Eric. Thanks for joining. So the term that we're seeing Latin America is primarily just telephonic in Mexico is next thing in, in the Brazil market, we have begun to experience the oil churn. So oil has consolidated with [Technical difficulty] the contract that we have with oil actually has six years remaining on average across those, they're on about 7500 bytes or so, and already makes up about 1% of our growth. We've got quite a long time here to kind of work through the term, the oil, the oil restructuring that's happening there. So that's something that you'll see through the next several years, maybe longer than they were certainly with the countries who are picking up those assets, to talk about maybe restructuring those contracts, figuring out the term count. But we are in a pretty good position with oil, because we do have a silver stick over six years left on the contract there. And then in terms of the bad debt, in terms of where we're seeing the bad activity in, really in India and a little bit in Africa, recently here is we've actually reduced our reserves by about $8 million or so in Q2. And we have a plan in the Outlook to further reduce that, for a total of about $20 million. So flexions in Q2 were really quite strong for us around the globe, but particularly in India, where we're happy to see that and based on all the discussions that we have had, indeed to have with our customers, we expect elections in India will remain with those expectations that are in our outlook, which would allow us to the full year to rebuild about $20 [Ph] million of fire bad debt reserves. We did reduce that, you'll see it in the presentation by about 10 million. And that's just based on the timing of reversing some of those reserves that we have moderated. But it's still good news for the year. Eric Luebchow : Great, thanks. Operator : And we can go now to Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks, good morning everyone. Tom Bartlett : Morning, Ric. Ric Prentiss : A couple of questions. First, obviously, I think it's important you guys are focusing on attributable AFFO. Help us understand what a full year impact of the new Stonepeak would be as far as demand out convert $14 million in the current year and the $20 million minority interest? And then I've got two others quick ones. Tom Bartlett : Yes, sure, Ric. So the way that we've got the guidance that next year, or actually in Q4 of this year, the full year kind of utilized run rate of approximately $200 million. $50 million of that has really come -- in the data center business that we have. So that's kind of the exit run rate. The balance, roughly the $150 million, is what we have in Europe. So that's kind of what you can think of from the minority interest piece of our AFFO going into next year. $200 million. $150 million in Europe and about $50 million on the data center side. And that's mandatory, you're going to see that through with deduct to our AFFO. The mandatory is about $750 million mid-single-digit interest rate. So you just calculate the math, and that's what you'll see in terms of the deducts from AFFO from that. Ric Prentiss : Second one is, you guys obviously know I've really focused on removing amortization of prepaid rent from valuation and non-cash items. Interestingly, a number of smaller than crown, crown did put a table out there, talking about what they see, as far as the amortization of prepaid rent going forward, is that something you guys would consider and I\u2019ve got one of the quickie ones? Tom Bartlett : I don't know, Ric, if we would put out a table. But I can tell you this year for the full year, we're looking at about $110 million or so in amortized revenue kind of coming through our numbers. That's down a little bit from last year. Last year, we were about $140 million. I think from a going forward run rate basis, if you think of that line item being around $25 million to $30 million on a quarterly basis. That's what we see. We think it will hold pretty consistent as we go forward. But you can think about our amortized revenue in line with the $25 million to $30 million per quarter, and it's going to be a $100 million this year. Ric Prentiss : That makes sense, unless we lose, we're getting a lot of questions from investors on data center's. We talked about the growth capital opportunity, there that CoreSite. What do you think maintenance CapEx is in the data center business? And one I think unusual question we get that came up is what would cause data centers to become obsolete or individual data centers becoming obsolete? Rod Smith : Yes, maybe I'll take the first one, Tom, and then you can handle the second one. So the maintenance CapEx is about 20 million this year, for us in our data center business. We could take the sense of round about 3%, maybe 4% of the data center revenue. We don't see that changing at all. So that's actually I think about the main FX of the business. Tom Bartlett : And Ric relative to your second question. I mean, it all comes down to really barriers to entry. And if you think of the, the asset that we have with CoreSite, the barriers to entry are incredibly strong, with the interconnection capability with the cloud on ramps. And so, it's hard to think about a world in which, our customers are not going to be still looking at kind of this hybrid environment, to be able to connect with the cloud to be able to really use data centers as a sales channel for themselves as their interconnection within the business. So, we don't anticipate any of that kind of activity you said, but I must say that it's I think this particular asset that we have within CoreSite, and we're building out, really continues to build up those barriers to entry. And, and that's going to be critical. It's much like the tower business. We build up a strong barrier to entry with the foods and pieces of real estate we have, that's our strategy to find those assets, that have those strong barriers that we can continue to develop. Ric Prentiss : That makes sense. Thanks, guys. I love hearing barriers to entry. Tom Bartlett : Thanks Ric. Operator : Next we'll go to David Barton with Bank of America. David Barton : Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking the questions. First, I guess maybe, Rod, you in your script, when you were talking about the partnership with Stonepeak mentioned something to the effect that you were creating a platform for data center investment given Stonepeak\u2019s experience in the common infrastructure space? I think one of the concerns some people have about American Towers foray into data center\u2019s is that it's going to be a big call on Capitol at the margin, and we just don't know how big it's going to be. So if you could kind of clear up a little bit about how you think this platform, might be looking at acquisitions and investments and calls on capital. And then second, maybe, Tom, I don't know if you have a view on this. But with respect to American Tower, not having a holistic MLA with Verizon at this stage. Do you feel that that AMT contributing factor to AMPs kind of domestic same store sales growth performance this year might be that that Verizon is allocating business to its other tower partners in the early stages of its C-build and we need to wait for them to come around to become an A&T customer. Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Hey David. Let me take that one and then I'll let Rod and then I'll come back and add on to that to that to the first one. Relative to how Verizon is building out their seat, man, it's really hard to tell, in terms of whether it's happening with other carriers who have more holistic type of an MLA versus ourselves I don't think so, candidly. I think that Verizon is being very, as they always are measured in terms of how they're rolling out C-band. And I would expect candidly over the next half of the year, and clearly into 2023, some real investments that they're going to be making it to the site. We represent a significant piece of their portfolio, and strategically located in some critical markets, that I know Verizon is going to want to drop in C-band on the site they have to. And I would expect that to see in the second half. Relative to the timing in terms of us not having that it's really difficult to say whether there has been a timing difference in terms of when we're going to see that type of activity, as I said, I don't think so. But more importantly, I would expect to see significant activity really ramping up in the second half and into 2023, which is the more important element. Rod Smith : Yes, and David, with regard to your question on the on the data center spend, this year we do have CapEx in the plan of about $300 million, maybe a touch over was a couple of development projects, that really will not be recurring in May. So we're looking at about $200 million of historical annual investment projects, and total CapEx including the maintenance CapEx. And that's where we expect to stay going forward, that would allow us to keep ahead of kind of a net absorption, forward looking two years, we need to make sure that each of our facilities has a scalable megawatt capacity. And in order to do that, we expect to reinvest about that $200 million, give or take, which is what CoreSite had been doing historically. Maybe ours will be a touch higher, maybe they were closer to 150, between 150 and 200, we'll probably be closer to 200, or maybe a touch, a touch over. So we're not looking to compete on a national scale and the data center business. We really bought CoreSite because of the cloud centric network, dense nature, the inner nature of these assets and kind of the geographical spread throughout the U.S. in really good proximity to our tower sites with his facilities. And in LA, and Silicon Valley, Chicago, Denver, Boston, New York, Northern Virginia, we have, we've got a nice spread of these assets. And because of the high quality nature, that's what's giving us the, the nice growth rates, as I mentioned earlier, up and up in the 10% range, which is well above our underwriting expectations of between 6% and 8%. So we see really strong demand for these high quality. And we're looking to really take these assets, and potentially in the future, connect them to our sales, cloud on ramps and interconnection facility at the tower sites, that's the real significant upside. So with that said, we'll be reinvesting the CoreSite cash flow kind of back into keep ahead of that two years of absorption on the megawatt capacity. And then you may see us add a data center here or there throughout the West, but not a major change in capital allocation certainly. David Barton : That's super helpful, guys. Thank you so much. Operator : And we'll go to Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe to follow up on the prior one around expanding the platform, I guess, more broadly, beyond data centers just thinking about the broader common infrastructure portfolio, are you seeing incremental opportunities internationally, that may not have been as present a year ago. And then secondly, as it relates to India 4% organic growth. This quarter, we noticed a pretty big step down in churn. I'm just wondering if there's any additional color you could share there. And whether that's maybe this quarter is maybe a better run rate to think about, from a churn perspective in India on a go-forward basis? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Hey Matt. I'll take the first one, Rod can take the second one. We're very focused on the U.S. as we said. Yes, there are a lot of opportunities outside of the United States. And, and as a result of the positioning that we have with CoreSite, we get approached by many, many different players to develop, but we're very focused on the U.S. And as Rod said, to the extent that there's outside CapEx, we're going to be incredibly measured about how we spend that, but it will be at the tower sites. Remember the Edge is all about the opportunity at the site itself. And we've identified, largely over 1000 sites that with power and interconnection could support upwards of at least a megawatt of capacity. And so we're going to be looking at that where we can take it to a megawatt where we can take it to two, where we can take it to three. And to the extent that we're able to develop the demand from a customer perspective, we will look at building, that kind of capacity out, but it'd be very measured. It will be based upon demand. And it will largely be in the United States. Rod Smith : And Matt, good morning, thanks for joining the call. So regarding India, we are guiding to 2% to 3% Organic candidate billings growth. In India for the second quarter, we did see a higher number than that close to 4%, which was nice to see. That was driven by consistent sort of stable organic new business, we have the 2% escalator, of course. And then we did see a reduction in churn and Q2 from Q1 and certainly a further reduction from the prior year quarter. So when we go forward, one thing that I will highlight is in Q3, we do see a higher level of churn happening in Q3 compared to Q2. So don't be surprised if you see that organic tenant billings getting pulled back a little bit from the 4% to probably below 2%, maybe approaching 1%. That will be temporary and you'll see it come back up in Q4 up in the 3% range. So I think for now, we are constantly optimistic about India. There are still some churn events that we're working through, and we feel good about a 2% to 3% number for this year. And certainly, as we go forward, we hope to see and expect to see continued moderation on the churn line, solid new business activity that allow us to grow from that 2% to 3% organic billings growth. But of course, we'll address that in next February when we give guidance for 2023. Matthew Niknam : That's great. Thank you both. Operator : And next we can go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Richard [ph] for Phil. Just wanted to follow up on the international tower builds of the 40,000 to 50,000 over the next few years. Wanted to get a sense of how much of that is contracted versus you have a good line of sight into\u2026 Rod Smith : Yes, I would say Richard we have a good line of sight into those. Certainly there are elements of that that are contracted, and the Telxius transaction that we did over in Europe, there are about 3000 sites that will build for Telefonica over time. There's also a building for Orange over time that are contracted. I don't want to put too firm numbers on there in terms of orange piece. When it comes to India, Africa and Latin America, it's more opportunistic. But we do have a really good run rate in terms of building sites. This year we'll build around 6500 towers, that's a little bit above where we were in the prior year. And we see that run rate is being sustainable going forward. And as of course, we highlight this often, those builds are some of our most attractive capital deployment opportunities. And we're seeing double digit NOI yields day one from those, those newly constructed sites around the globe. So we have a high level of confidence in that $40,000 to $50,000 number, some of its contracted, some of its more opportunistic but the pipeline is robust. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And the follow up on that the yields are high on day one, but what kind of colocation, I guess, expectations do you have on those builds over time? Can you give us any color around that? Rod Smith : Yes, I think we would, we would view them to be very similar to the rest of our towers, in be comparable to the market that they're in. Certainly the towers we build, we like to see that they are, multiple entities, of course, and we know that the growth in mobile data consumption around the globe, continues to run at a at a really solid clip in that 30% range or even higher in some markets. So certainly getting additional tenants on those sites is something that's really important that we do have a line of sight to see that. And we see with these new builds, we do see in the north of 20% NOI yields on most of these, most of the assets. Time will tell, but given the demand for tower sites, the critical nature of these power assets globally, and the fact that a lot of these emerging markets, as well as Europe are positioned to new technologies, either building out 4G networks, or in the case of Europe transitioning out of 5G is there's a need in the demand for more and more tasks. So that gives us the confidence that we will be able to attract additional tenants on these site. Unidentified Analyst : And the last follow up for me on the data center side, just to clarify, there's no additional capital coming in from Stonepeak with either, the new builds, but there might be if there's an acquisition a small one or whatnot. Rod Smith : Yes, I think that's right. The way and we announced a $2.5 billion investment which is gives them a minority stake that'll be when their preferred investment is fully burdened, there'll be a 29%, owner of the data center business. And certainly if there's any capital requirements needed to fund our data center business, there will be a capital call to all investors, us and veteran [Ph] on a pro rata share. And then certainly if there's M&A opportunities that require capital calls, of course, again, it'll be the same situation we'll be up and funding that, that together. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we have time for one last question. We've got to line up Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great, thank you. In the U.S., can you provide a little bit more color on the activity you are seeing from DISH? And a question on capital allocation? You typically bring back sharp share buybacks after an issuance or ahead of like mandatory conversion. Going forward, can we expect it to balance maybe debt reduction versus opportunistic buybacks? Thank you. Tom Bartlett : Sure, I'll do the first one. On DISH, they're right where we thought they would be. I mean, they've been very measured in terms of their deployment. They've been very active. Got a couple of critical markets that they are bringing up. And we have a comprehensive MLA with him, and we're seeing good activity across the country. Rod Smith : Yes. And then, relative to the capital allocation question, you've heard us say it many times, but the first priority, of course, is funding our dividend. And not only funding it, growing the dividend. So this year, we'll have a double-digit 12.5% growth rate on the dividend. And in the current environment that we're in, we certainly will be focused on delevering. It's no surprise to anyone on the call, I'm sure, that we are outside a little high of our target range of around 5x, below 5x. So we ended the quarter at about 5.8x. That's about 5.5x of the pro forma the investment from Stonepeak in. So we still have some delevering work to do, which we will be focused on. So we will be focused on organic growth, where we focused on driving 10% AFFO per share growth. We'll be focused on delevering. We'll be focused on our capex plans around the globe, funding the build to suits that can see very good returns on across all the markets that we're currently in. And then, to the extent that there are opportunities to buy back shares at attractive prices from time to time or fund additional M&A from time to time that's accretive and fits within our disciplined approach, we'll balance those to investment opportunities and make the choice that's best for our shareholders and drives the most AFFO per share growth. Batya Levi : Great, thank you. Operator : And speaker\u2019s I hand the call back to you. Adam Smith : Thank you everyone for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to the investor relations team with any questions. Thank you everyone. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude the call for today.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Adam Smith : Good morning and thank you for joining American Tower's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will discuss current technology trends and how we are positioned to benefit from continued wireless technology evolution. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q3 2022 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include : our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2022 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India; the Stonepeak transaction and the expected value and future investment activities of our US data center business; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as updated in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. As is typical for our third quarter call, my comments today will center on the key technology trends we're seeing across the wireless landscape and how our distributed tower portfolio is positioned to benefit from next-generation network deployment and generate sustained resilient growth, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility. Additionally, I'll provide an update on the CoreSite portfolio of assets, our latest view on the evolution of the mobile life and the progress we are making in advancing our edge strategy, which aims to leverage our distributed tower and land assets, in combination with our interconnected data center portfolio to drive incremental value as network technology evolve. Since the start of 2019, 5G spectrum auctions, mainly in the mid band, have collectively driven over $155 billion in purchase price proceeds across our served market. These acquisitions of large swaths of new spectrum have kicked off what we believe will be at least a decade-long period of network investments, aimed at delivering on the promises of 5G's faster and lower latency applications. We anticipate this will result in $5 billion of incremental annual customer CapEx spend in the United States, on average, as compared to the levels we saw throughout the 4G cycle. Additionally, in the US, the visibility we gained through the comprehensive MLAs we put in place with AT&T, T-Mobile, DISH and most recently, Verizon, supports our expectation that these investments will drive a near-term acceleration in organic new business growth and a sustained level of elevated tower activity over a multi-year period. As we saw during the rollout of 4G, we expect this investment cycle to play out in two broad phases. The first being a coverage phase, through which carriers prioritize upgrading their existing footprint to maximize the percentage of the population having 5G access and begin to benefit from the cost efficiencies associated with their network technology upgrades. Over the last year, we've seen carriers leveraging our presence in nationwide scale to efficiently and aggressively upgrade equipment on our sites, both here in the United States and in several markets across our international footprint to meet those 5G build-out objectives. In the second phase, as consumers adopt advanced 5G-enabled mobile devices and applications, carriers will invest in additional capacity through network densification to facilitate increased mobile data consumption and optimized customer experience. We saw this second phase play out after 4G was launched in the United States around 2010. By coupling the provision of higher bandwidth speed and improved network capabilities with the proliferation of advanced smart connected devices with improved user interfaces, 4G unleashed innovative applications, such as video streaming, mobile gaming, as well as industry redefining application, which is mobile-enabled ride sharing and transportation. The introduction of these new data-intensive applications contributed to an annual consumption growth rate of nearly 50% from 2013 to 2018, requiring carriers to meaningfully invest in the densification of their network. Similarly, we expect our customer's 5G network anticipating delivery times of 5 to 10 times lower latency and increased download speeds up to 100 times to further unlock new capabilities, facilitate consumer and enterprise innovations, enable use cases that will necessitate further proliferation of connected devices and drive higher network throughput. Consider emerging augmented and virtual reality technology as an example, video streaming excluded, primarily because of the advancements achieved through 4G, driving extended destination investment in order to provide users with adequate network quality. Currently, video streaming bandwidth requirements range from a few megabits per second to about 8 megabits per second for HD and up to 25 megabits per second for 4K, depending upon the resolution, eventually working to 50 and closer to 100 megabits per second for 8K videos. Depending on compression schemes and the device requirements, looking ahead to the theoretical max specs for potential future applications of mix reality, we would expect multiple gigabits per second. Again, that is gigabits with the G. Compared to 4G, 5G will offer enhanced resolution, rapid refresh rates, real-time raw midstream with low latency and provides 3 times more bits per hertz spectrum efficiency in the 5G mid band. Even when factoring in all these benefits, we believe rapid mobile data consumption growth, along with the shorter propagation characteristics of mid band spectrum. We'll necessitate a massive 5G densification phase of network investment, greater than what we realized in 4G. As a result, we expect this future capacity as to support sustained growth in our tower business. At the same time, we expect the applications driving these densification efforts to present new neutral host infrastructure opportunities, aimed at minimizing latency and reducing traffic burdens on middle mile network. This is a good segue into a discussion about our CoreSite data center activity and the progress we're making in advancing our edge strategy to support these networks of the future. While the tower business certainly remains healthy and staggered deployment of network generation rollouts across our geographically diverse footprint provide a solid runway for growth over the next decade, we remain focused on identifying new opportunities for value creation through the platform expansion pillar of our stand and deliver strategy. A key element of this pillar is identifying new opportunities that leverage our portfolio of communication assets and our capabilities in managing and redeveloping distributed real estate to provide new multi-tenant neutral host infrastructure model that support the demands of next-generation networks and applications. As we previously communicated, the most apparent opportunity of scale that we see over the next decade is out of the mobile edge, which ultimately solidified our decision to acquire CoreSite at the end of 2021. We still believe this acquisition further positions us to take advantage of the emerging digital transformation enabled by 5G. Having now owned CoreSite for more than three quarters, we couldn't be happier with the performance we're seeing across the business and the use cases driving leasing activity, which we expect to serve as growth catalysts well into the future. Importantly, we're extremely encouraged by the consistently positive customer feedback on this acquisition. Customers continue to view CoreSite as a strong operator in hybrid IT solutions provider with a high-quality ecosystem, which under the American Tower umbrella can now provide more predictable scalability and future incremental value through our combined platform capabilities and expertise. So far in 2022, CoreSite has achieved solid new business volumes, a reflection of the strong demand for the company's interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich ecosystem, where over 80% of revenues are derived by customers with a variety of interconnections to at least five different and independent customers. This strong demand demonstrates the differentiated value proposition and resiliency of these strategically located and well-integrated assets. We are pleased to see strong new business volumes from enterprises, prioritizing digital transformation to the implementation of hybrid IT solutions, leading the migrations from an on-premise data centers to co-location data centers in major metros. We are also encouraged to see accelerating demand from leading digital platform, seeking to extend compute functionality closer to their users to enable automation, collaboration and address latency-sensitive applications and early indicators supporting our edge evolution thesis. Critical to CoreSite's interconnection-rich ecosystem value proposition is its open cloud exchange platform or OCX. OCX provides CoreSite customers with quick scalability and represents an essential element, as we seek to expand the ecosystem to more distributed points of presence at the edge development. Today, through this automated Layer 2 Ethernet software-defined networking platform, we connect our customer communities within and between our US data centers, and we connect cloud providers to CoreSite's nationwide portfolio. We continue to invest in improving the platform's features and building out the functionality and reach to enable high-performance, hybrid architectures more quickly and securely and at a lower total cost of operation than alternative solutions. More recently, we launched Layer 3 enhanced network services, including virtual routing, cloud connect tiering to service providers and cloud-to-cloud connectivity to leading cloud providers. These enhanced functionalities simplify an enterprise's network hardware or management resources at a lower total cost of ownership. Through continued innovation over time, CoreSite\u2019s vision is to provide customers with single port access to their entire digital supply chain, which we will also expect to be leveraged and extended as the distributed interconnected edge ecosystem develops over time. While the distinctive characteristics of CoreSite's portfolio, including its enhanced capabilities accorded to its OCX platform, represent the critical attribute in advancing our edge strategy, we also see tremendous value in CoreSite's development pipeline. Coresite continues to execute on opportunities to redeploy their cash flow towards high-yielding development project. Customers require additional scale across our footprint. And consequently, over 20% of our data center development under construction is now pre-leased. We also recently announced the acquisition of a purpose-built data center in Southern Florida, MI2, which will be connected to our existing Miami facility, expanding and strengthening our Southeastern footprint, where we have also integrated our legacy data centers in Atlanta and Orlando into the CoreSite ecosystem. As we look further out, we expect workloads to become even more distributed and localized. Therefore, we see the importance of an interconnection hub like CoreSite, increasing as customers look to future-proof their digital businesses who secure, flexible and scalable solution, enabling agile interoperability as businesses shift to more customized hybrid multi-cloud IT environment and importantly, require an extended edge computing presence to support evolving low latency applications. In turn, the mobile edge is emerging as a critical area in the convergence of wireless and wireline network. Over the past year, these 5G deployments in the US have continued at a rapid pace, we've seen elevated emphasis from select wireless carriers with respect to their edge compute strategies and a forging a partnership with cloud and enterprise technology platform to better prepare for the network demands of the future. We see all of this as incremental data points in support of our vision for forthcoming demand of VA. In our view, much like the adoption of the shared tower model, this digital ecosystem over time will be most efficiently provisioned through a distributed neutral host, multi-tenant interconnected edge infrastructure model, reducing the capital intensity and total cost of ownership among MNOs, cloud, landline and enterprise players and critically, facilitating a seamless universal customer experience for end users. Our tower portfolio, coupled with our US data center business, represents a distributed portfolio of real estate with accessibility to robustly interconnected core network and native access to cloud on rent. We believe the combination of these platforms will be critical as data processing extends from the core to the edge. With that migration, more distributed and localized points of presence, along with transit costs and low latency considerations, will become essential over time, providing American Tower and CoreSite, the potential to win across multiple edge layers. To date, our team has identified over 1,000 sites within our existing US tower portfolio that we see as shovel-ready candidate for mobile edge deployment based on location, parcel footprint, land control and existing fiber and power access. Over the next several months, we plan to break ground on our first 1 megawatt edge facility and an owned tower site to build upon our understanding of market demand and customer requirements, design a blueprint that can be rolled out at scale as the edge ecosystem developed and demonstrate the differentiated value proposition at American Tower and CoreSite can offer potential customers. As always, any future development will go through our disciplined approach to evaluating the market opportunity and economic returns of edge deployments at scale, as well as an evaluation of the best way to finance future deployment, which could potentially include strategic partnerships, financial sponsors or both. In short, the strategic partnerships emerging between the MNOs and cloud service providers, the evolution of latency-driven edge leasing activity within our CoreSite portfolio and our interactions with the architects, the low latency networks of the future have only strengthened our conviction. The edge will represent a meaningful opportunity to drive incremental value to our assets over the long term. Although, this architecture will take time to develop, American Tower is positioning itself as a critical future provider and partner for cloud, MNO and enterprise customers, as wireless and wireline network convergence accelerates over time. In the meantime, we'll seek opportunities to advance our learnings, including through the development of an edge application integrator and our participation in various trials in edge industry form. We are proactively taking the necessary steps to understand emerging trends, network requirements and customer needs. All aimed at strengthening our option to win at the edge over the long term. In closing, demand for wireless connectivity continues to grow across the globe, where despite the dynamic challenges we've all navigated over the past several years, the need for reliable wireless and broadband access has been elevated in importance as a means to advance global economies and the populations they serve. With carriers aggressively deploying their valuable spectrum assets, we will begin to realize the true capabilities of 5G. And with that, we expect to see new innovations that will change the way we live for the next decade and beyond. Our effort to build scale across our global footprint of macro tower assets for over the past two decades, combined with our continuous focus on platform expansion and innovation has position American Tower to support our customers in meeting the continued acceleration in mobile data demand, while leading the way in the development of new infrastructure model that will be essential in meeting the needs of applications of the future and drive incremental value on our assets over time. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our third quarter results and updated full year 2022 cost. Rod? Rod Smith : Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As you heard from Tom, we are very encouraged by the technological trends that we believe will drive continued secular growth in the industry and a long runway of growth for American Tower. Before I walk through the details of our Q3 results and revised outlook, I will first touch on several key trends and developments from the quarter, including the evident strength of leasing demand across our footprint and renewed collections volatility in India. First, we continue to see 4G and 5G investments driving strong demand across our footprint, which translated into solid gross leasing growth in the quarter and we expect this trend to continue and further accelerate, particularly in the US as we approach 2023. We complemented sequential growth in organic leasing with nearly 1,600 newly constructed sites internationally earning on average, low double-digit returns on day one, driven by those same trends. Additionally, demand for hybrid IT solutions optimally suited for our US data center portfolio remains healthy. This resulted in another strong quarter of leasing results, fueled by digital platforms and the continuation of enterprises moving their IT infrastructure from on-premises to interconnection-rich co-location facilities with direct cloud access, such as CoreSite. Next, we closed on Stonepeak's initial $2.5 billion investment in our US data center business in August, which was upsized by another $570 million after quarter end at the same valuation in terms. This further highlights the differentiated characteristics and value of the CoreSite portfolio, while establishing a partnership through which we will execute on our US data center strategy. Also, we signed a new comprehensive MLA with Verizon at the end of August, which is expected to allow Verizon to efficiently accelerate their 5G network deployment over a multiyear period. This agreement is yet another data point, illustrating the fundamental long-term criticality of our portfolio as our customers seek to leverage our scale and capabilities to rapidly deploy nationwide 5G and further provides tangible evidence that our US business should have a solid runway of growth over the next several years. Additionally, we executed a new multi-market MLA with Airtel Africa, our largest customer in the region. Under this new long-term agreement, we've secured attractive terms across our existing Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Niger portfolio, along with a contractually committed, attractive build-to-suit pipeline to support Airtel Africa's 5G deployment, among other opportunities. Importantly, with Airtel Africa, we share a focus on advancing wireless connectivity in a sustainable manner, which is represented in this agreement through a commitment to deploy low-carbon sites and expand our digital communities program. Our agreements with both Verizon and Airtel Africa, two of our largest customers is the latest demonstration of the value our global scale and operational capabilities as a company, both in markets and across borders, can unlock to provide mutually beneficial solutions for American Tower and our partners. With that, I'd like to take a moment to address some uncertainty related to collections arising out of our India operations and how this event has affected our results for Q3 and revised outlook for 2022. In Q3, collections from Vodafone Idea or VIL, fell short of our billings. And the customer has also communicated an expectation for that trend to continue through the balance of this year. As a result, we found it prudent to take certain reserves associated with VIL in Q3 and against the anticipated Q4 billing shortfall in our revised guidance. Consequently, our full year expectations now include approximately $95 million in additional revenue reserves, about half of which was booked in Q3. It also includes the removal of a $30 million bad debt reversal that was assumed in our prior guidance. Together, these result in a reduction in adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO of $125 million. At this time, our revised outlook for net income does not assume any additional impairment charges associated with the goodwill and intangibles that we currently have on the books associated with VIL, as the shortfall in cash flows is being viewed as temporary. It should also be noted that VIL did express a commitment to revert back to 100% payment at the start of 2023 and repay outstanding pass-through balances, which could potentially provide an opportunity to reverse certain reserves we've taken in the future.  VIL has also laid out a set of strategic steps that we will closely monitor on its path to more stabilized and consistent payment, including the conversion of its AGR interest into equity held by the Indian government. However, until then, we expect continued uncertainty in collections for VIL and have reflected those risks in our revised outlook.  In the meantime, we are actively working with VIL on the path forward, which could potentially include converting a portion of its existing AR into optionally convertible notes, which we believe can better secure our receivables. We will incorporate new developments that unfold over the next several months into our guidance for 2023 on this February's call. With that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our Q3 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. As you can see our Q3 consolidated property revenue of $2.6 billion increased by over 10% and over 14% on an FX-neutral basis as compared to the prior year period. Growth was primarily driven by solid organic leasing, execution on our international new build program in contributions from our US data center business, partially offset by headwinds of approximately 2% associated with revenue reserves taken in India during the quarter, as discussed, and another 2% from Sprint related churn. Moving to the right side of the slide, you can see we achieved consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 2.6% for the quarter. In the US and Canada, as expected, net organic growth was slightly positive at 0.3%, including a sequential step-up in gross organic new business of $38 million, a meaningful acceleration from $31 million in Q2 in our highest quarter since Q1 of 2020. As we have indicated throughout the year, we expect this acceleration to continue into Q4 and even further in 2023, where a large portion of our growth will be contractually committed through our comprehensive MLAs. Escalators were 2.8%, which, consistent with last quarter, were impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLAs. Though for the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was offset by the impact of Sprint churn, which continues to drive over 4% of negative headwinds year-over-year and will step down in Q4 as the largest tranche of contractual Sprint churn will have lapped in our year-over-year growth metric. On the international side, organic growth was 6.1%. Starting with Europe, we saw growth of 6%, which is now at a more normalized level with healthy largely in the prior year base. In Africa, we generated organic tenant billings growth of 6.8%, modestly higher than prior expectations due to some delays in anticipated churn now pushed to later in the year. Growth also included another strong quarter of gross organic new business standing at 7.5%, putting Africa on track for its best organic new business year on record and continuing past quarter trends, we saw the strong organic leasing activity complemented with an active new build program, constructing just over 250 sites in the quarter as we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth and returns on our capital deployments across the region.  Moving to Latin America. Organic growth was 8.2%, which includes approximately 9. 7% from escalations. Growth through organic new business and escalations was partially offset by another quarter of elevated churn, primarily associated with certain decommissioning agreement, which we expect to further accelerate in Q4, as highlighted on previous earnings calls. In APAC, we saw organic growth of 1.9%, in line with our expectations, which comes alongside a continuation of solid new build activity with 1,200 sites constructed during the quarter. Turning to slide seven. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 6% or over 8.5% on an FX-neutral basis, to over $1.6 billion, with strong revenue growth and cost controls, partially offset by the negative impacts of Vodafone Idea revenue reserves and Sprint related churn, together representing approximately 6% headwinds to growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 61.5%, down 170 basis points year-over-year, driven by the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, the conversion impacts of Vodafone Idea reserves and Sprint churn, along with higher pass-through revenue resulting from fuel costs. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO, and attributable AFFO per share decreased by approximately 3% and 5%, respectively, with each including a 3% headwind associated with FX. Growth was meaningfully impacted by the Vodafone Idea reserves and Sprint related churn, combining for an over 8% offset to otherwise strong and resilient performance across our global operations. Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, performance remains solid across our portfolio as demand for wireless connectivity and the rollout of next-generation networks are fueling strong new business volumes across our regions. Together with the straight-line benefit from our recently executed MLAs, along with pass-through increases, primarily related to power and fuel, we're raising our property revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Second, we have revised our FX assumptions using our standard methodology, which has resulted in outlook to outlook headwind of $45 million, $22 million and $13 million for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO, respectively. Finally, and as noted earlier, we have incorporated approximately $125 million in incremental reserves relative to our prior outlook, associated with Vodafone Idea. This includes $95 million in revenue reserves, split between Q3 and Q4, and the removal of our previous assumption for incremental bad debt reversals of around $30 million. As I mentioned, Vodafone Idea has communicated its intention to resume full recurring payments in 2023. However, at this time, we believe these adjustments to be appropriate for the current year. With that, let's discuss the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on slide eight, we are raising our property revenue outlook by $70 million at the midpoint. This outperformance includes straight-line upside of approximately $65 million, primarily associated with our recently executed Verizon and Airtel Africa MLAs and $77 million in higher pass-through revenue driven by fuel costs, along with various non-recurring benefits, including accelerated decommissioning-related settlements in Latin America, which we now expect to total approximately $85 million for the full year. Our guidance raise was also supported by a recurring revenue upside across several of our segments, helping to contribute to some modest revisions to our organic tenant billings growth outlook, which I'll touch on shortly. This outperformance was partially offset by the $95 million in incremental revenue reserves related to Vodafone Idea and $45 million in FX. Moving to Slide 9, you will see our organic tenant billings growth expectations, while we are reiterating our prior outlook on a consolidated basis and for the US and Canada as well as APAC segment, we are slightly revising our expectations for International, Europe, Latin America and Africa. For international, we are raising our organic growth to approximately 6.5%, up from approximately 6% previously. In Europe, we have adjusted our organic growth expectations to greater than 8% from approximately 9% in our prior outlook, where we expect new business commencements to shift further into 2023. In Latin America, we are increasing our organic growth expectations to greater than 7%, up modestly from approximately 7% in our prior guidance, reflecting a continuation of the CPI-linked escalation benefits in the region. In Africa, we are increasing our organic growth expectations to greater than 7%, up from approximately 6.5% in our prior guidance, reflecting the delays we're seeing in anticipated churn, as I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, in Latin America and Africa, consistent with prior assumptions, we anticipate consolidation-driven churn events to drive a sequential decline in growth as we exit the year resulting in what we expect to be approximately 4% and 5.5% organic tenant billings growth in Q4, respectively, with some carryover impacts as we head into 2023. Lastly, in the US and Canada, where we are reiterating our prior organic growth outlook, we expect to see Q4 organic tenant billings growth of around 4%, with further improvement in 2023, backstopped by the contractual visibility afforded through our comprehensive MLAs with the big three carriers plus DISH. Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA midpoint by $30 million as compared to our prior outlook, where we're seeing a high conversion of property revenue outperformance delivered through prudent cost controls and continued elevated services volumes, providing meaningful upside as compared to our previous expectations. These benefits are partially offset by the $125 million associated with incremental reserves assumed for Vodafone Idea, as previously discussed along with $22 million in FX. Turning to Slide 11. We are lowering our attributable AFFO guidance by $40 million or $0.09 on a per share basis. This adjustment is attributable to the Vodafone Idea reserves we have taken, which is translating into approximately $0.27 per share of downside, offsetting what was otherwise very strong performance across our business, which represented approximately $0.20 per share outperformance on an FX-neutral basis. Moving to Slide 12. Let's start by taking a look at our capital deployment expectations for the year, which are slightly updated compared to our prior outlook and continue to reflect our focus on driving sustained AFFO per share growth and shareholder returns. Within our capital deployment plan, we are reiterating our expectations to dedicate approximately $2.7 billion, subject to Board approval towards our 2022 dividend. With regard to CapEx, we are reducing our total midpoint by $45 million, with redevelopment decreasing by $35 million and start-up decreasing by $10 million, the result of some timing adjustments and savings as compared to our prior plan. We continue to assume the construction of approximately 6,500 new sites globally and roughly $300 million towards our US data center business, largely associated with development spend. As we've highlighted in the past, we continue to generate exceptional returns through our discretionary CapEx program, which remains largely financed through the redeployment of locally generated cash flows. We view our ability to allocate nearly $1.8 billion towards accretive high yield projects as a strategic benefit after years of building scale and credibility with our global customer base in a compelling way to further build scale and drive accretion for years to come. Finally, although we have not incorporated into our revised guide, I'd like to highlight that with the additional capacity we currently have as we outpace our delevering plan, we expect to opportunistically restart our share buyback program. Given recent market performance and the strong fundamentals we anticipate in our business over the long-term, we see this as a great opportunity to further drive shareholder value particularly against other forms of capital deployment in our current line of sight. Moving to the right side of the slide, I'd like to take a moment to review the progress we have made since the start of the year to shore up our balance sheet and liquidity position, particularly in light of the market volatility and unprecedented rise in rates occurring over the past several months. As you recall, we closed the CoreSite acquisition using our bank facilities and term loans, temporarily moving our leverage to 6.8 times and our floating rate exposure to 31% at the end of 2021. Since that time and against the challenging backdrop, we have strategically termed out short-term borrowings through common equity, private capital and senior unsecured note offerings, all at solid terms and pricing. Today, our leverage stands at 5.5 times ahead of plan with floating rate exposure of around 20%, in line with our long-term target. Looking ahead, we continue to believe this profile is appropriate given the predictable and contractual nature of our cash flows while providing us exposure to pre-payable debt, which offers us financial flexibility as we execute on our delevering path, and access to the typical low rate short-term curve. In addition, a meaningful portion of our floating rate debt is euro denominated, which provides us a natural hedge and diversified capital structure, while also offering pre-payable debt at terms more competitive than those currently available in the US. Although we anticipate 2023 as it appears today, we'll present certain growth challenges stemming from the current rate environment, we feel comfortable with our proven approach to balance sheet management. This includes our ability to manage our upcoming 2023 maturities where we expect our diversified sources of capital and solid liquidity position to provide near-term financing flexibility, allowing us to opportunistically access the markets against a healthy and constructive backdrop. In short, we believe our investment-grade balance sheet and the long-standing policies we've established position us well to navigate various economic cycles, including the challenges we're all facing today. And although we may see certain growth headwinds in the near-term, we believe our investment-grade credit rating and continued access to diversified sources of capital coupled with our focus on maintaining robust liquidity will serve as a more meaningful competitive advantage over the next several years. Finally, on slide 13. And in summary, we had a strong Q3 across our global business with solid operating performance, accelerated leasing and resilient demand even in the face of a challenging economic backdrop. During the quarter, the long-term critical nature of our portfolio of assets in positioning to drive sustained and compelling growth was further highlighted through key customer agreements with Verizon and Airtel Africa and the closing and subsequent upsizing of our Stonepeak partnership in our US data center business. Although, we will likely experience some growth pressure in the near-term associated with the continued rise in interest rates, we see our investment-grade balance sheet, liquidity and diversified sources of capital as a key competitive advantage as we execute on our growth strategy over the next decade and beyond. As we look ahead and over the long term, we are excited about the positioning of our global portfolio of communications assets as our customers augment and extend their networks to meet exploding data-driven demand and believe our global scale and proven capabilities have us positioned to drive incremental sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders for years to come. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Thank you. Good morning. Tom, it was good to hear your discussion about the opportunities from 5G and particularly from CapEx capacity additions as well as the favorable comments around near-term and medium-term US leasing trends. Can you square that with the CapEx trajectory at the likes of Verizon and T-Mobile where they're expecting a significant step down? I know it's not a one-for-one relationship. But how do you expect this to evolve? Because I think there's a sense here that there will be some deceleration as we've seen sort of in prior 4G cycle. So what's the offset to those lower CapEx numbers? Tom Bartlett : Simon, having seen the trends from the carriers for many, many years. I mean, there's always volatility in their overall spend. It will largely be a function of device penetration and application development that will require the further densification that we believe in the \u2013 in their deployment as well. So it's not a kind of a one-for-one type of a \u2013 I think a relationship with our overall growth. And also keep in mind that with our agreements that we have in place, we have these broad comprehensive agreements which really locked in a lot of that revenue growth for us. And so 70%, 80% of our revenue growth, we have tremendous visibility into as a result of those master lease agreements. And I would expect the carriers, as I said, to be investing in their market that demand develops. And I would expect, given the benefits of 5G that each and every one of us are going to be using significantly more levels of spectrum, if you will, over time. So I said it's not a one-for-one. Our MLAs do give us that kind of visibility. And overtime, I would expect higher levels of CapEx being spent on 5G, just as we saw being 4G versus 3G. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks a lot. Tom Bartlett : You bet. Operator : Next question comes from the line of David Barden, Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Two, if I could. The first, Rod just digging into the biggest moving part in the guidance, the Vodafone Idea relationship. I guess two pieces to that. One is, is there's been a lot of press about them versus, say, Bharti, Indus, and maybe trying to renegotiate tower rates to 'soften' the impact on costs? And then, could you kind of talk about what you're willing to give on that front? And then, also, you talked about converting your accounts receivable to notes. I mean, historically, towers have never been impacted by bankruptcies. How is converting accounts receivable to notes a better option than just kind of continuing the way you are as a tower company with your counterparty there? And then I guess the last piece maybe, Tom, on capital allocation, the conversation about buybacks, I'm sure, is welcome, but there's been a lot of conversation over the last two years about AMT's ambitions in Europe and scaling there, and there's obviously some pretty big deals and I think that obviously cost of capital is a huge issue, your equity where it is as an issue. Could you categorically rule in or rule out what your position on expanding Europe is right now? Thanks. Rod Smith : Hey, David. Good morning. Tom Bartlett : Yeah, Rod, why don't you start and take the first couple and then I'll take the third. Rod Smith : Yes, that sounds good. Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. I hope you're doing well. So regarding India and Vodafone and kind of their current situation, their desire to renegotiate some MLAs, I don't want to get into too many of the terms and conditions, certainly not want to talk about things that haven't happened yet in the future. But, I can tell you, they are in a predicament with their balance sheet, which everyone knows about, there's been a lot of press regarding that. So they're looking for a number of things from us in terms of supporting them. Discounts may be one of them, we'll certainly talk about that with them kind of over time. But I don't want to get into the details in terms of what we may or may not be willing to do. If we were to provide any kind of a disc that just run through our churn numbers and would be in our guidance. I don't expect any changes through our organic net billings guidance for this year negotiation or renegotiation with Voda. So -- and if anything changes next year, we'll update you for next year. I guess shifting, David, to the note, we did convert 200 -- or we have the option to convert $200 million of our existing accounts receivable, this is not a new investment, into Voda. I want to make sure that, that's clear. But existing accounts receivable that's on the balance sheet, we have signed an agreement where this $200 million could become a convertible note, but that is contingent on some conditions happening in India, both the government converting their near-term interest into -- I think, everyone is aware of that playing out. So that have to happen first. And if that does happen, then we could convert $200 million of our existing accounts receivable into a convertible note. The reason that's interesting to us, number one, is it helps shore up Voda a little bit. It basically moved the account receivable and, let's say, an MLA default into more of a financial interest and it helps them get some equity and maybe some additional debt on their book. So we want to support them and help them through this difficult time. So that certainly is one reason. The other thing, having this note, it does have predefined payment time frame in it, which is a little bit more certain than what you might see in typical accounts receivable that's hanging on the balance. And then we also have the option, at our option, to convert it to equity, which is another way for us to liquidate that favorable balance. So I think it increases our flexibility. It increases the probability in the near-term to convert it to cash, and that's really the reason we're interested in doing it. So -- and it helps Voda. So all those things, we did really looked at it and it makes a lot of sense for us, and I think it makes sense in terms of our willingness to support them. Tom Bartlett : And I guess, Dave, just regards to your last question on Europe and the opportunistic buyback program that Rod talked to. First of all, with regards to our Celsius asset base and integration, we're really very pleased with what we've experienced over the last year. I mean you've seen the growth rates and the success that we've had there and the relationship that we've actually built with Telefonica. So that's all gone incredibly well. With regards to further scaling, we do have a sizable build-to-suit program that we are in the midst of, and we see even more a build-to-suit opportunity coming forward, I think particularly in Germany. With regards to further M&A, we stepped away really just due to the sellers' expectations of value. There's just a significant delta between the bid and the ask at this time. Now over time, that may change. There's just a lot of volatility economically or obviously, you will know around the world. And so there's just a significant amount of space between the bid and the ask. And so we've really stepped away from those. We're always asked to participate in them. And so you always see in the media that American Tower is doing this or that but -- and I know you well know that we're incredibly disciplined in terms of how we look at valuation. And given the terms and conditions of some of these transactions as well as the expectations of -- from a pricing perspective, we just don't see the value creation in those opportunities at this time. As I said, maybe that will change over time. I would hope over the next 12, 18 months, you might see some change there. But right now, not. And so we're going to continue to not to focus off the organic growth, working with our customers in the region. Drop in our build-to-suit program, which has been an incredibly terrific way for us to be able to grow inorganically within the business. As Rod said, at some very attractive yields. And really support our customers in the market and enjoy the growth that way. David Barden : Perfect. That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you both, Tom and Rod. Thank you. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, David. Rod Smith : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Greg Williams, Cowen. Please go ahead. Greg Williams : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. One is how much of the raise in guidance the $142 million in straight line was related to the Verizon MLA, if any? And second 1 is just dovetailing off of the M&A discussions, what is your appetite for M&A that's not tower-related? Now that you think about augmentor data centers, we've heard possible Asia data centers are of interest or even US fiber. And I'm just curious of your thoughts. Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Hey, Rod, why don't you take the first one, and then I'll take the second. Rod Smith : Yes, thanks. Thanks, Greg, for the question. So the straight line increases that you see in our in our outlook here, we have an increase of straight line of about $65 million built into our property revenue guide. That's really split between the new Verizon deal as well as the deal over in in Africa with Airtel Africa. I don't want to break down that in too much detail and give you the piece parts, but it's really those two deals that make up. Tom Bartlett : And Greg, with regards to M&A on the data center side, as we said all along, we are very focused on developing the US market. I mean CoreSite's got a terrific presence in the United States. And with our tower portfolio here in the United States, we want to be able to enjoy the benefits of the CoreSite activity, as I highlighted, and as Rod highlighted itself, but also really be able to bring together this overall notion that we have in terms of developing that edge capability that we'll be realizing out the sites themselves, at our tower sites themselves. And so when you're seeing all this, again, noise about buying data centers and things outside of the United States, that's not where we're looking. That's not where our focus is. And if you take a look at the capital that's being spent on the business because we do have a fair amount of development going on within the CoreSite, within the data center activity, it's largely driven just from the cash flow that the business is generating. So the $200 million to $300 million that that we're investing back into the data center business in terms of providing more capability going forward, not just in our OCX platform, but also in space itself is just being driven by the $300-plus million of AFFO that the business is generating itself. So US is our chessboard as we speak, relative to our data center activity. Greg Williams : Great. That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you both. Tom Bartlett : Thanks Greg. Operator : The next question is from Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great. Thank you. Can you provide a little bit more color on the carrier activity that you're seeing in Europe, given the macro backdrop, I think some carriers are pulling back on CapEx. How do you think this will drive the growth into next year? And another question on AFFO, I know we'll get full guidance next year, but a lot of moving parts going into 2023 with US accelerating, but higher interest costs and FX. Can you provide a general view on your expectations for your AFFO into next year? Thank you. Rod Smith : Yeah. Thanks, Batya. I'll give you a quick update on Europe here. So we are seeing really strong growth in Europe as you've heard us talk about consistently throughout the balance and the activity is really split across the markets and across the carry. So we're seeing good activity with all the carriers there. I don't want to talk about carrier to carry, but I will just call out that we are seeing 101 begin to build a new park there. We are beginning to see leasing activity. We certainly expect that to ramp up towards the later part of this year and be a much more meaningful contributor next year. The one thing we'll see, we are pulling back our guide a little bit in Europe, but organic in -- growth. That really is just a delay in terms of timing on some certain leases that we have in our pipeline. We're seeing that shift up a little bit into -- later into Q4 and even some of the things later into Q4 shifting into next year. So that's really what you're seeing from that perspective. And remind me the second part of your question was it AFFO guide? Batya Levi : Yeah, into 2023 if you have a general guidance that you expect the AFFO per share to grow double digits. How should we think about 2023? Rod Smith : Yeah. I think -- I mean, I think you should think about 2023 as a challenging year for us. I think everyone knows the interest rates are rising rapidly here, probably more rapidly than most people expected as we head into the end of this year. That is a noticeable material headwind for us in the AFFO line heading into -- so that will be a challenge. That certainly will take us off of our target AFFO growth. I don't want to get into too many specifics. But I think you guys have probably enough information to kind of work the numbers. And when you look at the rate of increase on interest line for us with the interest rates rising that will be a challenge. When we get -- the other challenge for next year is the timing of equity raise, we'll have the full new equity to 10 million shares kind of running in the numbers next year with the early in half of this year. So the comp is a difficult comp from that perspective. I do think when you get out to '24 and beyond, we are seeing really good support for leasing revenue in around the globe. Particularly in the US, you've heard us say we're acceleration of new business from co-location and amendment activity. That acceleration continues. We expect to end this year very strongly coming in very close to that $150 million of co-location new business in the US.  And we're seeing that accelerate into next year on a run rate basis, which is also underpinned by our long-term MLAs. So, we have really high visibility into next year. So we expect to see a meaningful step-up in US co-location and amendment revenue into next year. And that puts us firmly on-track for our long term and particularly to the US organic growth averaging 5% from '23 out to '27.  And that includes some impact from the -- which is about 100 basis points. So without that, you'd be at about 6%. We're firmly on track for that beginning next year and going forward because of that nice acceleration, that strong demand we're seeing in the US. Batya Levi : Thank you. Rod Smith : Thank you. Operator : Question is from Michael Rollins, Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. Just curious, as you're looking out over the next 12 to 24 months, can you frame just some of the friction points around whether it's market consolidation that you're seeing or some of just structural issues for maybe things that customers are working through?  And just how to think about the magnitude and timing of those headwinds, maybe relative to some of the other things that you've noted around the build-to-suit opportunities and the organic improvement in demand? Tom Bartlett : Michael, let me -- maybe I'll -- I can start with that, Rod. I mean that's kind of an open-ended question there. You have when you start to think about what's going on around the world. I think the backdrop here is still the technology, right? And the backdrop is still the demand for broadband wireless. We've seen it through several technology cycles, and that's really driving the ongoing capital that all of our customers are looking to commit over the next several years. And so that provides, I think, a real stable platform for growth. And as Rod kind of went through all the numbers, we're seeing that, right? And we're seeing 5G being deployed in more and more markets. We've seen the growth rates accelerate here in the United States. We expect that to continue into 2023. You've seen the strong growth coming from many of our other markets as well, particularly in Europe and Africa, really a lot of significant activity going on in the market.  You've also seen our customers aligning themselves more closely with us. These longer-term strategic master lease agreements that we put in place, the one that we've talked about with Verizon, the other one that we've talked about with Airtel. I mean these are long-term contracts with well-capitalized companies. There are still spot of churn that we have going on in the market. A lot of activity in Latin America with some consolidation, particularly in Brazil and Mexico that Rod kind of walked through. And so we'll see a heightened level of churn in Latin America over the next 12 months to 18 months. We've seen some consolidation going on in Africa. But then again, we've been able to really largely work through all of that churn and still sizably increase the growth in each one of those markets. So I don't see any seismic shifts, if you will, over the next 12 months to 18 months. Yeah, we are in a rising interest rate environment. We're in an inflationary time around the world. The good news is that, we have long-term contracts and those very high inflationary markets. We've got escalators based on CPI and inflation in those areas. The other element, I think, within our business is we're well diversified. And so while we're perhaps taking a market that might be growing slower in another market, we'll be increasing the growth. And so it's offsetting some of the shortfall that you might see in other markets. I mean, we've talked about this in the past. It our carriers invest kind of like a sine wave, right? I mean, it's heavy investment and then they \u2013 it's less investment as they're tuning their network and then it's a higher investment. We continue to see that. We've seen that through 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, and we'll see that through 5G. Our customers aren't going to be building the networks before they see the demand. And so that's going to be a function of device penetration is going to be a sign of application development. I mean, I talked about the two phases. You well know this, in terms of network deployment, first getting the coverage and then we're going to see further densification and sales splitting as their customers are utilizing the network. And with higher band spectrum, we're going to see an even increased level of densification just because of the propagation characteristics of the bands. So I do think that kind of a long rambling answer for you, perhaps. But I mean, the core is the underlying technology and the desire for our customers and their countries themselves and their citizens to really be able to significantly increase their overall usage in wireless data. And so as a result, that provides, I think, a real kind of protection for us particularly when we're looking at these long-term agreements. Rod Smith : Hey, Michael, this is Rod. I just add... Tom Bartlett : Hopefully, that answers your question. Rod Smith : Yes. And Michael, I'll just add, in terms of the churn, the near-term, one thing that you will see is our churn rates are actually coming down from Q3 to Q4. So globally, we \u2013 in our 2.6% Q3 organic tenant billings growth, it was about $5.5% -- 5.4% that was cancellations or churn. That's going to step down to about 4% in Q4, which will end up driving our organic tenant billings growth for Q4, up from that mid-2s up to over \u2013 well over 4, certainly, which is really good. And that 4.4 in Q4 is what helps us drive that 3% for the full year. And in the US, you're seeing that churn drop in the US. So the good news here is, we're through the big bulk, the initial bulk of Sprint churn, you're going to see organic tenant billings growth for Q4 in the US at around 4%, which will be getting us back to where we really want to be longer term. And then in the international markets, we do have some, as Thomas saying some churn events, some elevated churn. Those churn events will be temporary as certain countries go through a little consolidation. But you will see from Q3 to -- from Q3 to Q4, churn will step up by about 100 basis points, going from about a little under 5% to up end of the 5 churn in the international markets. And the only thing I'd call out specifically is in Latin America, you will see -- that's where a bulk of that temporary churn will begin to hit. So you will see a step up in our churn rates in Latin America going from about 5% in Q3, up to a little over 8% in Q4. And that's all the normal churn that that we've all talked about that you guys know is coming. Some of that will persist into next year as well, particularly in Latin America. Michael Rollins : That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you. Rod Smith : You bet. Thanks, Michael. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ric Prentiss, Raymond James. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Tom Bartlett : Hey, Ric. Good morning. Ric Prentiss : Hey. Hey, I want to follow-up on a couple of questions. One following up on Simon's question about CapEx. If we think about the US. Is part of the reason maybe you guys are so confident that the US leasing goes up in 4Q and then goes up and accelerating to 2023 possibly to do with the timing? Your Verizon MLA, your positioning of when you were getting contracts from DISH and that visibility that you talked about, Tom. Just trying to think, is some of this that it's very visible to you, it's really kind of more timing related? Tom Bartlett : Well, yes, I mean, Ric, absolutely. And as I mentioned with Simon, given kind of the MLA structure we have in place, it's kind of irrelevant in terms of that capital spend from our perspective, right? I mean because we already have the kind of the rates and the pricing kind of locked in for a long-term period. Now having said that, when I back up, I also believe that, that capital is going to be spent over time. And that could be a timing issue as well. It's all a function of customer demand and application development and device penetration. And so when you have those all locked in, you're going to see our customers physically spending on their networks because they have to. They're not going to want to see any decline in quality of service. And so they're going to want to meet this demand and stay ahead of the curve as they traditionally have. And so -- but from an AMP perspective, you're exactly right, timing is not that relevant to us just because of the construct of the agreements that we have in place. Ric Prentiss : Right. And if you're not seeing any air pocket out there that's been some of the concern in the marketplace because of high interest rates or because of inflation, maybe turns into recession at least on the US side and the carrier spend with you, it sounds? Tom Bartlett : No, we haven't. We have not. Ric Prentiss : Okay. And last question for me is a follow-up on some of David's questions. The stock buyback, what would trigger that? What else has to happen to trigger the stock buyback? That obviously will require some funding that could affect back on to the interest rate side. And second question with that is, was your $570 million upsizing from some peak kind of expected in the guidance also? Tom Bartlett : Well, I mean, from our standpoint, and then I'll let kind of Rod step in here. We continue to look at the opportunities to delever as well as to look at supporting our equity. And given the movements candidly in the equity I think that there's some opportunities there to be able to generate some value. And so it will be a balance between the two. We talked about M&A and M&A kind of given the delta between the bid may ask kind of around the world. I think that's less focus, candidly, at this point in time. And so we'll look at our NAV and we'll look at it versus our share price. And well, as we always have, look at the kind of the most attractive ways of being able to drive AFFO per share. Rod Smith : Yes. And Rick, maybe I would add to that, just from a leverage standpoint, we ended the quarter here at 5.5 times levered post this -- the CoreSite acquisition, we were as high as 6.8. So I'll just remind you and everyone else we have. We did start out higher than our target leverage range, which is 3 to 5 times. We work through plans with the rating agencies to delever -- our investment-grade credit rating. That is critical to us. That's very important. We take leverage very seriously. That's why we've been able to delever as quickly as we have, going down from that 6.8 to 5.5. I'd also tell you that the 5.5 is -- we're comfortably lower than the delevering plan that we've agreed with the rating agency. So that puts us in a pretty good position. The plans that we've agreed with the rating agencies did not contemplate or include the $570 million. So that additional capacity that we have to either further delever well, well ahead of the delevering plan, or we can put it to use in a different way. So that's what we'll be looking at. When you think about the $570 million from Stonepeak, that is in our guidance in terms of the mechanics and the way it runs through our numbers. But it's important to point out that it is a benefit when it comes to our ability to delever. And then, of course, when we think about what we do with that capacity or any other capital capacity that we have available to us, we'll always put a share buyback up against our own internally generated net asset value of the company and what we look at in terms of the share value. We're also balancing the analysis around the cost of debt and how we drive better AFFO per share accretion, either paying down our revolving credit lines or buying back shares. So there's a lot of math, as you know, that goes into that. So we expect to be flexible and opportunistic as we evaluate what we do with our capital. And I do think that you could see us do both, continue to delever at a furious pace as well as buy back some shares when we think that's appropriate. Ric Prentiss : Makes sense. Thanks for that extra color. Stay well, guys. Tom Bartlett : Thanks. Rod Smith : Thanks, Rick Operator : And we have a question from the line of Matt Niknam, Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just one housekeeping and one broader question. On the housekeeping side, maybe just to go back to the Stonepeak $570 million raise. How does that impact the minority adjustments? I think it's been about $50 million typically between consolidated and proportionate AFFO. Just wondering how that may change in light of the incremental funding from Stonepeak. And then secondly, I think you've kind of answered this in terms of the US, but I'm wondering more broadly, as you think about tighter financial conditions, stronger US dollar, weaker foreign currencies, is that weighing at all on any international customers or regions investment plans, just given some of the lower presumable purchasing power as they head into 2023? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Rob, do you want to cover the MI question and I can talk more broadly? Rod Smith : Yes. So we took in another $570 million from Stonepeak as an additional investment into our CoreSite business. So the original investment of $2.5 billion gave them basically a current ownership of about 22%, almost 23% of the business there. And then with their additional $570 million, that's going to pop up to about 28% to 29% ownership. And that is for the pieces of those investments that are actually equity from day one. You may recall from some of our disclosures, there are some pieces of those investments that are preferred, which will convert to equity their mandatory converts over a full year period. So they will convert to equity. When that happens, then their ownership will jump up from the 28% to 29% up to about 36%. The way to think about the MI impacts here, when you get to Q4 -- hit the run rate, you're going to see about $150 million of Q4 exit run rate for the European minority then, and you'll see about $60 million or so for the Stonepeak minority interest. That will all run through the minority interest section. On these preferred notes that we have with Stonepeak, you'll see another $45 million that will be interest that will run through the interest line, but you want to keep that in mind as well. So that puts us at a run rate of about a little over $200 million of MI as we exit Q4, $200 million, $210 million. Tom Bartlett : And Matt, on the second question, relative to the impact of what's going on around the world, on our customers outside of the United States. Interestingly enough, we haven't seen anything of significance that would give me the sense that they're going to be slowing down on their build programs around the world. Now who knows what that might look like going into 2023 and 2024. But they have the same level of energy that we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months. Now we are also protected just because of the diversification of markets and diversification of customers. And so as a result of that, we are actually able to avert a particular issue in one area or another. And also keep in mind, as I mentioned in my remarks that our customers have spent almost $160 billion on spectrum. And so they don't -- they want to monetize that $160 billion and be able to get out into the market as fast as they possibly can. So we are seeing, as I said, the continued robust deployment of capital in the markets. And we continue to support them. And we see also -- again, a lot of build to suit activity in the market as well, which is also an indication of their willingness and ability to spend. Matt Niknam : That\u2019s great. Thank you both. Tom Bartlett : You bet. Rod Smith : Thanks Matt. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Phil Cusick, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Choe : Hi. This is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow-up in Latin America. You're expecting a little bit higher churn. Will that impact any new activity, or can you still see new activity growth continue through their -- despite the higher churn? And then also on the services side, it remains pretty solid. Are you seeing anything changing the trajectory of the services business, or do you think it will continue to stay pretty steady? Tom Bartlett : Rod, why don't you take those two? Rod Smith : Yeah, sure. Thanks, Tom. Richard, I think when you talk about Latin America, we are expecting higher levels of churn, but pretty consistent levels of that gross new biz. And we're also complementing that with higher levels of escalator, which are driven by local CPI in the region. So those two things are pretty solid. We'll see where inflation goes and how the trajectory of our escalator in that region may change over time. But there is solid consistent new activity in Latin America despite the fact that there is a little consolidation churn happening in some of the markets there. And then when it comes to services, we're in another great year in services we're going to be up in the mid $200 million, we raised our guidance at the gross margin level by about $20 million. So we are going to be in that mid $200 million range for services revenue. That continues to come through at really nice margins in the mid-50s, 54%, 55% at the gross margin level. So our services business is performing exceptionally well and has proven to be very resilient. And that is because the US carriers continue to be very active. I'm not going to guess in terms of where it's going to go in coming years. But to the extent that the activity levels stay high, we'll continue to see really solid high services. Well, there's a chance I could pull back as the timing of activity from the carriers kind of ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter. So we'll see what happens next. But we're going to be up in the mid-200s this year in services. All the carriers are active, and we're maintaining really healthy margins in the mid-50s. Richard Choe : Great. Thank you. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Richard. Operator : And that concludes our questions. End of Q&A: Adam Smith : Great. Thank you, everyone. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Have a great day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Adam Smith : Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our strategy; and then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our 2022 results and 2023 outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2023 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India; and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those that will be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. Five years ago, when we rolled out the Stand and Deliver strategy that would guide us over the following decade, we emphasized driving the business forward through four key pillars : enhancing operational efficiency, growing our assets and capabilities, investing in innovation and platform extensions and augmenting industry leadership. Since that time, we've seen carriers across our global footprint invest over $300 billion in network assets and methodically deploy next-generation networks to support rapidly increasing data demand in their served markets. Our commitment to execute on each pillar of Stand and Deliver, not only aligns with our customers' needs in this context, but it also enhances American Tower's position to serve as a strategic provider of critical infrastructure for the networks of the future. So before highlighting the key strategic objectives, we'll focus on in 2023 and over the next several years, I'd like to spend a moment reviewing achievements from the past five years that have driven our success to date. On the operational front, we've signed comprehensive master lease agreements with T-Mobile, AT&T, DISH and most recently, Verizon in the United States. These agreements represent a commitment to a mutually beneficial, predictable growth path and strategic alignment between American Tower and its customers, while also demonstrating the value and criticality of our nationwide 43,000-plus site portfolio to support 4G, 5G and future network generations. Such agreements also bring with them efficiency innovations designed to deliver simplicity in leasing processes and accelerated time to market for the carriers. To extend on these benefits, we've invested in technologies to build a holistic standardized data set, mapping the vast majority of our US assets, which can be leveraged to eventually bring application cycle times down to a matter of hours. We believe this type of capability will be a particularly attractive customer value proposition in the context of a 5G densification cycle and one we believe can be scaled across our global footprint over time. Our focus on operational efficiency has extended throughout our international business as well. Notably, since the beginning of 2018, we've invested nearly $350 million, primarily in Africa, on improving site level performance through our Power as a Service program. This includes the installation of lithium-ion batteries and solar arrays for primary and backup power delivery, which has resulted in a sizable reduction in average fuel consumption per site across our African portfolio and has extended the replacement cycles of critical power sources all while providing over a 99.9% average uptime for our customers' networks. At the same time, we've established a centralized procurement organization that aims to drive down material costs. And we've leveraged shared best practices and our scale as a multi-national operator to strengthen our global vendor relationships. By streamlining these critical operational functions, we've been able to continue to drive solid investment returns on our capital deployments and efficiently meet the infrastructure needs of our customers, all against a challenging backdrop of price volatility and supply chain disruptions. In fact, since the start of 2018, we've added nearly 26,000 sites to our international portfolio through new builds, more than two times the volume of the previous five-year period. Today, these sites are contributing approximately $250 million in tower cash flow and an NOI yield of approximately 21%, demonstrating meaningful expansion from the already attractive low double-digit day one yields we typically see on these new build opportunities. On the M&A front, we've executed a number of transactions that have been transformational in terms of delivering additional critical scale in existing and new markets ahead of major network investment cycle, the benefits of which we are seeing in our results and forward-looking expectations today. These include InSite in the United States, the in portfolio in Africa as well as Telxius in Europe and Latin America, which augmented our scale in Germany and provided entry to Spain in a leadership position just as 5G investments were beginning to ramp up on the continent. More recently, through our efforts to selectively expand our platform and position American Tower as a market leader in the next generation of network architecture development, we entered the data center space through the acquisition of CoreSite. CoreSite delivers an interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich platform as well as exposure to a resilient high-demand communications infrastructure business, which we believe will deliver strong performance as demonstrated by a record signed new business in 2022 and provide accretive returns on a standalone basis over time. As importantly, we believe the combination of CoreSite and American Towers platform of distributed tower real estate positions us to enhance the value of our existing assets as the edge proliferates. Finally, I'm particularly proud of the steps we've made towards augmenting our leadership in several areas. Organizationally, we've made ESG core to our operations through initiatives such as our commitment to Science-Based Targets, localized DE&I initiatives designed to facilitate an inclusive organization for our employees and stakeholders and through the growth of our digital communities program, which has now reached more than 400 communities and serves more than 335,000 people across 15 countries. As I mentioned on this call last year, we're also a member of the EDISON Alliance : 1 Billion Lives Challenge, which provides us the opportunity to contribute to the development of affordable and accessible digital healthcare, finance and education solutions for communities in need. Over the past year, we've developed partnerships with healthcare providers that have resulted in the launch of several telehealth locations that provide primary, preventative and specialty teleconsultation services in underserved areas. While this is just one positive first step, we believe that we've achieved over the last year, clearly demonstrates the value we can create and the communities we serve through a commitment to multi-stakeholder collaboration and partnerships. And we hope more organizations will join us in efforts like these over the coming years, which brings us to today and our focus for 2023 and beyond. We believe we're poised to build on and accelerate the successes of Stand and Deliver that we've achieved thus far. As I mentioned in the opening, our teams are focused on key strategic objectives that will continue to guide our operations and management teams in American Tower over the next several years. The first of these is to leverage our premier platform of assets to drive strong recurring growth, both organically and through our disciplined capital allocation framework and our investment-grade balance sheet, as we seek to capture new business opportunities against the backdrop of secular demand trends that remain as strong as ever. We refer to this internally as scale the core. To this end, we expect an acceleration in organic growth in 2023, representing an improvement of around 100 basis points relative to our prior five-year average. Beginning with our US and Canada segment, the benefits of our comprehensive MLAs and ongoing 5G deployments are driving an expectation for organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5% in 2023, including approximately $220 million in year-over-year co-location and amendment growth, which would be a record year for American Tower by a significant margin. We also see a path to solid organic growth in our international segment, led by regions like Europe and Africa, where we're capturing activity from multiple network upgrade and densification cycles and are realizing the benefits of CPI-linked escalators on the vast majority of our leases. This will be complemented by what we expect to be yet another year of solid new build activity, primarily in international markets, where the current 4G and 5G network rollouts continue to drive strong demand for new infrastructure. And in our data centers business, where we're entering 2023 with record backlog, we'll continue to focus on driving increasing growth, both on an organic basis and through high-yield development opportunities that are ongoing today. Operationally, our teams are working to continue to build on the many efficiency and growth initiatives we've developed in recent years, which hits on another key objective within the organization : being the most trusted strategic partner for our customers. The most concrete example of our efforts on this front, probably the long-term multi-market agreement we recently announced with Airtel in Africa, which includes a meaningful new build pipeline, a joint commitment to build in accordance with new low-carbon emissions guidelines, which we're calling green sights and a partnership framework to enhance the impacts of both companies' digital communities and kiosks programs on the continent. This agreement exemplifies the benefits of our scale, best-in-class operations, and ability to deliver innovative solutions, while advancing both American Tower and our customers' long-term sustainability and fossil fuel consumption reduction targets. Going forward, we'll continue to work on building alignments with our global customers to leverage our scale to execute on opportunities to drive growth and maximize shareholder returns in a sustainable and responsible way. This includes an effort to accelerate our platform extensions. As I mentioned previously, demand trends in the data center space remain robust driven by digital platforms, leveraging distributed computing and by the early stages of a sustained enterprise migration from on-prem to hybrid IT and multi-cloud architectures. As a result, we see a long runway of opportunity to drive strong returns by investing in the expansion of our existing CoreSite campuses and leveraging the open cloud exchange to extend their interconnection-rich ecosystem. At the same time, we're working to position our combined platforms for outsized success as demand for the workloads and compute functions are drawn closer to the end users at the mobile edge. And as we evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth through platform extensions going forward, we'll continue to focus on how we can leverage our core competencies in real estate, power provision, and connectivity to drive incremental value to the ecosystem while delivering increasing shareholder returns. Meanwhile, as a management team, we're laser-focused on positioning our global teams for the future, while growing and maintaining a healthy cultural foundation. These together represent perhaps our most critical key objectives as our world-class team members are the most valuable asset in American Tower. As we position the company to be a market leader in an evolving landscape, we recognize that developing, empowering and retaining diverse and talented team members is fundamental to our success as a company. Through this lens, we've renewed our focus on management development and institute region-specific programs designed to support a balanced life for our teams amongst many other initiatives. We also appreciate that facilitating a culture that is inclusive and equitable is not only shown to drive better decision-making in business outcomes, but more importantly, it's the right thing to do for the people who dedicate so much of their time to growing this business and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. In summary, the long-term secular demand trends underpinning growth in our industry remain resilient. We believe we're optimally positioned to capitalize on the successes of our Stand and Deliver strategy to date. And we're more energized than ever as we look to execute on our initiatives in 2023 and deliver strong, sustainable returns for many years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to discuss our 2022 results and expectations for 2023. Rod? Rod Smith : Thanks Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. Before I dive into our 2022 results and expectations for 2023, I would like to highlight a few key accomplishments from the past year and provide an update on several developments in India since our last earnings call. First, demand and operational performance across our global portfolio remain as solid as ever. We closed the year on a positive note with colocation and amendment tenant billings growth contributions of over 4% in Q4. In particular, our US and Canada property segment delivered its strongest quarter since Q1 of 2020, and we have a clear line of sight to continued acceleration into 2023, which I will discuss shortly. Organic growth was complemented by the construction of nearly 7,000 sites, an American Tower record, including over 2,300 sites built in Q4, our highest level over the past eight quarters with an average day one NOI yield of over 12%. Moreover, during its first full year of ownership by American Tower, CoreSite delivered record new business, selling nearly double the number of megawatts compared to the previous trailing two-year average, demonstrating the value of the company's interconnection and cloud on-ramp rich ecosystem. This robust growth was driven by increased demand from high quality new logos and expansions from existing customers, driven by secular tailwinds of digital transformation and the demand for hybrid IT solutions. Furthermore, since the announcement of CoreSite acquisition, we successfully executed on our permanent financing plan at attractive terms, including through the issuance of common equity and senior notes, as well as our strategic partnership with Stonepeak. These financing activities reduced our leverage from 6.8 times at the end of 2021 to 5.4 times at the end of 2022 and moved us closer to our target range of three times to five times. Next, I'd like to take a moment to cover the latest developments in India. As anticipated, Vodafone Idea or VIL continued making partial payments in Q4 of 2022, consistent with our outlook, resulting in total revenue reserves of approximately $38 million for the quarter and around $87 million for the year. Recently, we were pleased to see the completion of the Indian government's conversion of the adjusted gross revenue interest balances to equity in VIL. We view this as a reaffirmation of the government's commitment to support a three-player private carrier telecommunications market and a critical first step towards the possibility of more stabilized collections from VIL. However, although VIL had committed to pay their billings in full in 2023 and make payments for outstanding balances from prior years in early 2023, they have communicated that they would continue to make partial payments. For that reason, we believe it is prudent to include revenue reserves against their annual billings and other contracted obligations in our 2023 outlook, which we've assumed at $75 million. We will, however, remain focused on collecting what we are contractually owed in full over the course of the year. In the meantime, we have worked to incrementally better position American Tower and our receivables balance, while also demonstrating a level of support for VIL and India's wireless market. This includes the expectation to convert approximately $200 million in existing VIL receivables into optionally convertible debentures pending Vodafone Idea shareholder approval. Upon closing this agreement, we would have elevated the seniority of our pre-existing receivables balance and established an additional level of liquid collateral at American Tower's option. And finally, as we remain focused on stabilizing our India business, collecting our outstanding and future receivables in full and assessing the positioning of our global portfolio, we are currently exploring various strategic options, including the potential sale of an equity stake in our India business. As always, any decision taken will include careful consideration of the growth opportunity and risk profile in the market going forward, valuation and the optimal portfolio and capital structure mix for American Tower and its stakeholders. We will certainly keep our investors informed of any developments as we move forward. With that, let's dive into the details of our full year 2022 results. Turning to Slide 6. Full year consolidated property revenue growth was nearly 15% and nearly 18% on an FX-neutral basis, which included a contribution of approximately 11% of growth from Telxius and CoreSite and negative impacts of approximately 2% and 1% from Sprint churn and revenue reserves taken associated with VIL in 2022, respectively. Organic tenant billings growth for the full year came in at 3.2%, in line with expectations, complemented by solid growth from new builds with actual volumes coming in at the upper end of our prior outlook range for the year. In the United States and Canada, property revenue growth was nearly 2% with organic tenant billings growth of just over 1%, in line with expectations, including approximately $150 million or 3.4% from colocations and amendments. Escalators added another 3%, consistent with historical trends. This growth was partially offset by churn of around 5%, which consisted of roughly 1% in normal course churn with the balance being driven by Sprint. Our international property revenue grew by nearly 13%. International organic tenant billings growth was 6.6%, led by Europe at 8.4% and followed by Latin America at 7.9%, Africa at 7.7% and APAC at 2.6%. Overall, colocation and amendment growth for the full year was around 5%, while 6% came from escalators, partially offset by just over 4.5% of churn, the result of decommissioning agreements in Latin America, carrier consolidation in Africa and customer-specific churn in APAC. Finally, our data center segment contributed over $765 million to our total property revenue in 2022, including a record year of new business from CoreSite as I previously mentioned. Moving on, adjusted EBITDA grew around 11% to over $6.6 billion or around 13% on an FX-neutral basis for the year. Growth was supported by solid contributions from Telxius and CoreSite and strong flow-through of top line growth achieved through effective cost management. On a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were down around 190 basis points as compared to 2021, primarily due to the impacts of the VIL reserves and Sprint churn in the US, higher pass-through revenue due to rising fuel costs and the lower margin profile of newly acquired assets, which we believe are well positioned to drive meaningful margin expansion over time. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by approximately 5.6% and 3.5%, respectively, including over 11% growth on a per share basis in Q4. For the year, both metrics included over 2% in headwinds associated with FX. Attributable AFFO per share of $9.76 exceeded the original 2022 outlook midpoint laid out a year ago by $0.06, despite absorbing the negative impacts of incremental VIL reserves, rate-driven interest costs and FX relative to our initial assumptions. Now before I discuss the details of our outlook for 2023, I will start by summarizing a few key highlights and assumptions. First, as we've previously communicated, we expect a meaningful step-up in US and Canada organic tenant billings growth, driven by an acceleration in new business backstopped by the comprehensive MLAs we have signed over the last few years together with the sequential improvement in contracted Sprint churn. Internationally, we expect a strong year of organic tenant billings growth across most of our regions driven by continued strength in organic leasing trends, along with contributions from CPI-based escalators, particularly in Europe and Africa. As we've communicated over the past couple of quarters, growth in Latin America will be moderated by churn headwinds associated with a continuation of Telefonica churn in Mexico and Oi churn in Brazil, where we'll see some staggered impacts over the next several years. Second, and as I mentioned earlier, we have factored into our guide an expectation for a continuation in VIL collections volatility, resulting in an assumption of $75 million in revenue reserves for the year. Third, given the unprecedented rise in interest rates over the course of 2022, which saw the one-month LIBOR increased by more than 400 basis points and 10-year treasuries increased by around 250 basis points from the beginning to the end of the year, we expect 2023 to have one-time outsized negative growth headwinds associated with financing costs. Key components driving this assumption include elevated costs on our floating rate debt and to a lesser extent, the refinancing of our 2023 senior note maturities as well as the full year impacts of our 2022 equity-related initiatives, including our common equity issuance and the incremental minority interest and preferred distributions associated with our partnership with Stonepeak. Taken together, we have assumed a roughly 8% headwind to attributable AFFO per share growth associated with financing costs in 2023. Next, our initial outlook reflects estimated negative translational FX impacts of approximately $150 million for property revenue, $64 million for adjusted EBITDA and $47 million for attributable AFFO as compared to 2022. And finally, looking beyond the challenges I mentioned associated with interest rates, VIL reserves and FX, our core business continues to demonstrate strong performance and resiliency, representing nearly double-digit year-over-year growth at the attributable AFFO level. While this performance is fueled by the solid organic leasing trends we're seeing across our global portfolio, it's further amplified by exceptional conversion rates through AFFO, achieved through a keen focus on cost management across our business. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Moving on to the details of slide 7. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect total property revenues of nearly $10.8 billion, representing growth of approximately 3% or approximately 4% absent the incremental reserves assumed for VIL in 2023. Our guide includes expected cash revenue growth of around $230 million in the US and Canada, and $245 million of FX neutral growth in our international regions, excluding the 2023 VIL reserves of $75 million. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $55 million of growth in cash revenue to the property segment in 2023. Lastly, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we anticipate a modest FX headwind of just under 1.5% to consolidated growth. Turning to slide 8. We expect organic growth to contribute meaningfully to our property revenue growth assumptions. Starting with the US and Canada, we anticipate organic tenant billings growth of approximately 5% or greater than 6% excluding Sprint churn. This expectation includes record levels of year-over-year co-location and amendment growth of around $220 million, a nearly 50% increase over the levels achieved in 2022 and a 60% increase as compared to the trailing three-year average. Of the $220 million, over 90% is locked in through MLA-driven use right fee commencements and carryover growth. On the churn side of the equation, after incurring the largest impact of Sprint churn last year, we expect churn of around 3% in 2023, including an approximate 1% impact associated with Sprint, which would represent a year-over-year improvement of over 200 basis points in the segment. Moving to Latin America. We expect organic tenant billings growth of greater than 2% for the year driven by relatively consistent co-location and amendment activity and continued solid contributions from CPI-based escalators of approximately 8%. This escalator rate does represent a step down from 2022 levels, as we saw inflation in markets like Brazil moderate in 2022 as compared to 2021. As we've previously highlighted, higher churn of around 8% is partially offsetting gross growth due to the expected continuation of Telefonica churn in Mexico and the early part of what we expect to be staggered Oi churn in Brazil. Similar to last year, we do expect to receive some settlement payments from Telefonica over the course of the year, which will be captured outside of the organic tenant billings growth metric. We've assumed approximately $50 million in 2023 payments as compared to the over $80 million we received from Telefonica Mexico and Nextel Brazil in 2022. Turning to Asia Pacific. We are guiding to approximately 4% organic tenant billings growth in 2023, including churn of around 4%, which is around 70 basis points lower than the 2022 churn rate. We expect co-location and amendment growth contributions to ramp up compared to 2022, coming in around 6%, fueled by the rollout of 5G networks. However, it is important to note that the reserves we've assumed for VIL in our guide reside outside of this metric, consistent with past practices. Turning to Europe. 2023 organic tenant billings growth is expected to be 7% to 8%, which is slightly lower than 2022 due to the mathematical benefits realized last year, given Telxius was only in the prior year base for a partial year. However, this does suggest a solid acceleration off our Q4 2022 organic growth rate of around 6%, which represents a more normalized comparison. On the co-location and amendment front, we anticipate 2% to 3% growth, while growth from escalators stand at roughly 6%, reflecting the benefits of CPI-linked escalators across the majority of our European footprint. Churn is expected to decline to around 1%, reaping the benefits of the lower churn profile of our recently acquired Telxius portfolio. Finally, in Africa, we expect a solid acceleration off of 2022, with expected organic tenant billings growth of approximately 9%. This includes co-location and amendment contributions of around 6%, along with escalators of around 10% and expected 450 basis point increase from 2022 levels. This will be partially offset by an expectation of elevated churn of greater than 6%, as carrier consolidation continues to work its way through the financial metrics. Moving on to slide nine. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 4% and around 5%, absent the incremental reserves assumed for VIL in 2023, while absorbing approximately 1% in FX headwinds. We expect this growth to be achieved through solid cash conversion rates of 85% to 90%, the result of prudent cost controls across the business and the expectations for another strong year from our US services business. Turning to slide 10. We expect attributable AFFO per share to decrease by $0.16 on a reported basis, while remaining flat year-over-year absent the impacts of the 2023 VIL revenue reserves. As mentioned, we expect growth to be meaningfully impacted by financing costs, which include a rate-driven increase to cash interest expense along with the incremental full year impact of minority interest and preferred distributions associated with our US data center business. Together with the common equity share issuance in 2022, financing costs are expected to provide a significant one-time growth headwinds of approximately 8% in 2023. As I mentioned earlier, absent the impact of financing costs, FX and the 2023 VIL reserves, our business is demonstrating solid growth contributions of around 9%. Moving on to slide 11, I'll review our capital plans for 2023 and our balance sheet progress and priorities for the upcoming year. In 2023, we will continue to deliver returns to our shareholders through the growth of our dividend. And subject to Board approval, we expect to distribute approximately $3 billion, representing an approximately 10% year-on-year growth rate on a per share basis. In addition, we expect to deploy around $1.7 billion in CapEx, of which 90% will be discretionary. This will largely be spent continuing the success of our new build program internationally, which assumes the construction of around 4,000 sites at the midpoint. We also expect data center capital to increase modestly as we seek to replenish the record capacity sold in 2022 and maintain appropriate levels of sellable capacity. Moving to the right side of the slide. As you can see, we made tremendous progress towards strengthening our balance sheet over the course of 2022, putting us ahead of the deleveraging path we committed to with the rating agencies, which actually afforded us the flexibility to repurchase a modest number of our shares in Q4. Throughout 2023, we will continue to be guided by our long-standing financial policies as we execute on our financing plans. This includes the refinancing of maturing debt, while leveraging our strong liquidity position as needed to remain opportunistic as we access the capital markets. Finally, we remain committed to our investment-grade credit rating. And our priorities over the course of 2023 and into 2024 remain on deleveraging our balance sheet back down to the three to five times range. Consistent with our recent comments, at this time, we do not see any material M&A in our pipeline that would alter these areas of focus. Turning to slide 12. And in summary, we delivered strong results in 2022, demonstrating the resiliency of our business model in the face of various macro-related and customer-specific challenges. Our global portfolio of assets and operational capabilities continue to prove critical in meeting the growing demands of our customers and the customers they serve. We saw record new build volumes internationally and record leasing within our CoreSite business and experienced a steady acceleration in colocation and amendment growth as we exited 2022, which we expect to continue into 2023. As we look ahead, we expect to further build on the successes of the recent years and leverage our portfolio to drive strong recurring growth on the back of consistent secular technology trends for many years to come. With that, operator, we can open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Tom, you talked about scaling the core, and Rod just talked about no material M&A in the pipeline, thanks for that. Just give us a little bit more color, if you could, on how you see the portfolio today. And is this the mix of assets that you want? You've obviously talked about potentially monetizing some of India. But any kind of areas where you feel like you're overexposed or underexposed? And how long is this sort of approach of not doing large deals likely to last? And then you talked about the strong results in CoreSite. You did buy some land there. I've noticed your future development pipeline potential goes up quite significantly, probably as a result of that. Just give us some color as how you think about beyond just incremental capacity, something larger, given the opportunities you see there? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Yes. Sure, Simon. You got a lot going on in that question. But let me try to peel it back and then remind me if I left anything out. With regards to scale of the core, it really comes down to really three pieces. One is to just do what we do every day, that's servicing our customers and driving that organic growth. And we've really been very focused on that in the US as you saw our expectations for 2023 and beyond, because those large-scale relationships that we put in place with our -- the critical carriers in the United States are long-term in nature. And so we now have a very predictable growth path in the US. And the US is the foundation really of our entire business. And what I've always said is that we enjoy the benefits of diversification, because there are going to be some markets that are going to grow significantly, others that are going to grow less so simply because the methodology that all of our customers use for build are different. And they all form those different sign waves as we've talked about in the past. And we can -- if you can layer on all those sign paths, you're able to get some predictable rates of growth. And so we're excited about coming out of 2022 strongly. We expect higher rates of growth in 2023 and in particular, within the United States. From a total portfolio perspective, we're constantly looking at where we can maximize value. And we are in 26 countries today, and there could be certain markets there where it may just make sense for us from a number of different perspectives for us to peel back some of those assets. Don't have anything in mind as we speak. We're constantly evaluating it. That's kind of what we do. And with regards to India, India is a market where they're going to have a higher population than China, if not now, very soon. They have huge penetration, huge data usage. And it's a market that we would like to be able to continue to keep our toe in because we continue to believe that there is significant growth there. To the extent that we can bring in a third-party player to monetize the particular part of the asset and reallocate some of that capital in some other parts of the market, we'll look at that. It's purely opportunistic, and we look at every kind of available opportunity as we speak. With regards to our data center business, of course, I had a terrific 2022 record sales in 2022. And they're replenishing capacity where they needed. We've added land in Denver and New Jersey, where we needed some additional runway. But we've got a good amount of capacity in the hopper. We're building out another 30 megawatts of capacity under construction. We actually got one-third of that already pre-leased, and we have 224 megawatts for future development. So there's an incredible demand, as you well know, as we've heard from other competitors in the market for interconnection hubs. And that's what I really refer to as core side. It's not a co-location facility. It's an interconnection hub creating opportunities for new logos. We added over hundred logos last year. And we're really excited about the opportunity and the demand that we see in the market for activity relative to our data center business in the United States. Did I miss anything, Simon? Simon Flannery : Well, I guess, just in terms of the scale M&A, you've obviously done a lot of deals over the years. If you get back down into that three times to five times leverage, is that when we think about you're potentially looking at larger deals again? Tom Bartlett : Interesting, Simon. We have a lot of different ways of being able to secure M&A. We demonstrated that really with what we've done in Europe, with our capital, even in the United States with Stonepeak in terms of private capital. So I think the capital is there. For us, yeah, it is a function that our objective is to delever. I really do want to get down to that five times kind of leverage. And so that remains a top priority for the business. But on top of that, we want to continue to feed our build program. We had record build last year. We have a strong build program this year. With regards to the M&A, there's just still a significant difference between the valuations, the bid and the ask. And there's nothing out there that's compelling as we see it today. And so our focus continues to be on, as I said, what we do every day, driving organic growth, driving efficiency. You see we expect margin improvement in 2023 versus 2022 and supporting our build program. Our customers are very active around the world from a build perspective. And I think in the last several years, we brought in like \u2013 we built like 25,000 sites. And so there's a significant opportunity there, and the returns are incredibly compelling on that new build program. So as I said, there's just nothing at this point in time that we see out there that's interesting really from an M&A perspective. And we continue to just keep our head down in terms of funding our build program and delevering our business. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks a lot. Tom Bartlett : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Rick Prentiss : Thanks, Good morning, everyone. Tom Bartlett : Hey Rick. Rick Prentiss : A couple of questions. I'll give it to you part-by-part. First, as we think about the guidance, and thanks for all the color there, how should we think about in US, Canada the pacing throughout the year? Is it going to ramp through the year? Does it start high and come down? Is it balanced? But opening question everybody is trying to figure out what is happening with the pacing in 2023 in US, Canada? Tom Bartlett : Actually, Rick, it's going to be very consistent, very linear throughout the year. And so largely, it's a function of the relationships and the agreements that we have in place. But we would expect it to be very consistent in the US throughout the year. Rick Prentiss : Okay. And the related question to extrapolate from that is last year at this time, you laid out some thoughts on longer-term leasing activity in the US, Canada 2023 through 2027 being above 5% and then extraordinarily above -- equal or above 6%. How are you feeling about that exiting 2023, looking at 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 as you gave us a year ago? Tom Bartlett : Yeah, exactly the same. I mean, it's \u2013 as we have said, as we have predicted, as we have thought, and again, it comes down to largely the relationships that we have with our customers. We see strong demand coming out. I still think we're in the early innings really with 5G. Our customers on average are probably on about half of our sites. So there is a significant amount of opportunity there. But it also comes down to the types of relationships and the arrangements that we have with regards to our MLAs. So we are underscoring really what we had said a year ago relative to growth coming out of 2023 through 2027. Rick Prentiss : Okay. And the last one for me, taking that to the bottom line, attributable AFFO per share last year at this time mentioned that 21 to 27 maybe above \u2013 at or above 10%. We've had a couple of tough years here with Sprint churn. 2023, we've got financing costs, still some Indian reserves. How do we think throw away 2021 to 2027 and just say, hey, as we look at 2023 as a new base point, how are you feeling about that ability to grow attributable FFO per share, dividend per share from this point onwards? Tom Bartlett : Well, I mean, you've got a couple of questions in there. We're not going to \u2013 we're not focused on rolling out a long-term guide at this point, as you would expect. But there have been some significant macro environment changes that happened around the world that we use to underwrite kind of that double-digit expectation, which I think is what you're referring to. But I'm not letting the foot off the gas in the business, okay? We're not changing anything at this point in time. Our core growth, as Rod just walked through, really remains really, really strong. And we don't have any expectations for that kind of growth diminishing. We see kind of 4G, 5G being rolled out across all of our footprints, which really gives us a lot of comfort in terms of being able to suggest that, that growth is going to continue. Now, also having the types of relationships that we do with our customers in the United States helps underpin a lot of that growth. The interest rates, Rod walked through the impact of rates. It's kind of a reset in 2023. I believe it to be kind of more of a one-off, if you will, in 2023. So we remain really bullish on going forward. As I said, I'm not going to talk about long-term guide, but I'm not letting the gas \u2013 letting the foot off the gas at all within the business. With regards to \u2013 of our dividend program, as you all know, you're a REIT expert. Our policy is just followed our REIT TI. And it's been very consistent. We've been able to enjoy double-digit rates of growth on our dividend for the better part of the last 10 years actually, which has been very supportive. And we continue to be \u2013 we continue to feel that our dividend is an important part of our total shareholder return. So we're looking at 10% dividend, as Rod talked about this year. It's difficult really to predict what that might be. It depends upon what we bring into the REIT, what's not in the REIT, obviously, what kind of M&A exists out there. It could drop a little bit to high single digits. But again, we continue to expect it to grow significantly. And as I said, it's an important piece of our overall total shareholder return. Rick Prentiss : Great. Thank so much. Everybody stay well. Tom Bartlett : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups. So first, and maybe this is a slightly different question on the US leasing environment. But you outlined the percentage of revenue tied to comprehensive deals. I'm just curious if you can unpack where the flex could be in US performance, both in 2023 and maybe going forward as you think about the organic leasing growth potential of the US business. And then thinking a little bit more about the percent of revenue that you have tied to comprehensive deals. You shared a lot over the last couple of years on how the US has been shaping up on that front. Can you share with us how other regions fit in terms of the percent of revenue tied to comprehensive deals? And as you work with your customers, are there aspirations that you have in different markets to get that to certain levels over time? Thanks. Rod Smith : Hey, Michael. Good morning. This is Rod. I'll start here, and Tom can certainly join in. So -- but in the US, the leasing activity is really strong. And our revenue in the US is underpinned through what we refer to as the holistic agreements, which I think everyone is very familiar with. But we've seen contributions from colocations and amendments rise from about $150 million in 2022, up to $220 million in 2023. That drives about a 5% contribution to our organic tenant billings growth. And as Tom mentioned in his previous answer, we see about 90% of that locked in for 2023. And the long-term guidance that Rick asked about, we are continuing to target equal to or greater than 5% between 2023 out to 2027. And a fair amount of that activity, both the underlying revenue and the revenue growth, is locked in as part of the holistic deals. Now of course, as we move beyond 2023, that 90% will come down maybe to about two-thirds or so by the time you get in the outer years. And that's just a function of getting closer to the end of some of the agreements, and chances are some agreements will be rewritten sort of along the way. So we feel really good about the visibility we have into the US leasing market and the strength that we're seeing in the US market, particularly because of our assets and the way that we drive these agreements. Now your question kind of refers to flex. And I think what you mean there is where is the potential upside? And of course, there is a potential upside to the extent that there's faster uptake on 5G utilization in the US. And if that requires carriers to densify the networks a little bit quicker, and we see a faster conversion for colocations and fewer amendments going forward, that could certainly provide some upside. And then depending on just the build of some of the carriers. And certainly, DISH comes to mind as they build a greenfield network to the extent that they go beyond their minimum commitments with us, that could certainly be some upside as well. So I would really kind of watch -- certainly watch DISH. I would watch the other carriers and see the 5G utilization. And some of these new applications come out for 5G, we'll see what kind of bandwidth constraints that puts on networks and when network densification may end up happening. But it's a pretty exciting time in the US market, particularly when you look at the 5G networks and potential applications coming down the pike. So I think that kind of covers off the points around the US leasing. When you think about our international business, we don't have holistic deals in the same way in a material fashion outside the US. They are much more traditional green, more of an a la carte, kind of pay as you go around the globe. So, that's what I would say about that point, Michael. Michael Rollins : Thanks very much. Rod Smith : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys. Thanks very much for taking the questions. So, I guess the first one would be, Tom, thank you for your commentary around kind of the commitment to deleveraging. And I think you said 'there's nothing compelling out there,' significant differences between bid and ask on the buy side of that equation. So, to the extent that, that is true, is that what's informing your openness now to looking at an equity sale of the India market? Meaning that if things are too expensive to buy, maybe now is the right time to sell. And is that exclusive to the India market, or as you look across the portfolio, could you make the same argument that maybe it's an interesting time to monetize Latin America or other pieces of that? Part two of that would be is now the right time to think about this given the situation with VIL, or should we wait until that situation maybe resolve itself and then we think about an equity sale? And then, Rod, if I could -- so you went out of your way to mention that the financing impact on the AFFO -- attributable AFFO per your calculation is going to be about 8% for the year. Absent that and absent the provisions for VIL, we might be seeing an underlying 8% to 9% AFFO growth per share. Is that our takeaway for how we think about 2024, that obviously, other things aside and the fundamentals across the world that our starting point for thinking about 2024 is an 8% to 9% FFO growth business. Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Okay. Dave, you got a bunch of stuff packed in there. Let me start to -- no. Relative to the M&A in India, there's not a direct connect between the two. They are somewhat mutually exclusive types of decisions. And it really becomes, again, part of a broader portfolio kind of conversation relative to what we think may make sense for the portfolio in terms of driving further value over time. India is really just kind of an opportunistic at this point in time. And really, it's -- we're in kind of the exploration mode at this point. A number of things going on there. And to the extent that there is, again, a value creation opportunity for us, we can continue to enjoy the growth of the market and utilize that capital in other parts of the world, including using it to further de-lever, perhaps more -- even more quickly than we would have otherwise thought is not a bad thing. So, there -- I understand the kind of the connection that you're drawing there, but I'm not really looking them in that way. And I really do believe the paths are separate. Rod Smith : Good morning David I'll take the next one here on the AFFO per share growth. So, you can see in the chart that we laid out, we have FFO per share going from $9.76 to really down to $9.60 on an attributable basis. As we mentioned, the financing costs, you can see on the chart there, the $315 million represents about $0.68 of that or about an 8% headwind. The 405 is what's coming from our regional businesses, including our corporate cost centers. And that 405 represents about a 9% growth. So that's kind of a core growth rate that we're generating from our operating. The FX headwind is about 1%. And then VIL represents about 2% headwind. And when you put it all together, you get to a negative 2% growth. But to the extent that the financing impacts here really are one-time, which we expect, we expect interest to kind of peak this year and then -- in the middle of this year and maybe trend down towards next year, assuming they stay flat or even decline and become a tailwind next year. That certainly would be a good fact. But that could remove that 8% headwind on us. FX and the VIL situation in India, both are somewhat unpredictable. But if you put those aside, we feel really good about our global operating business in that upper single-digit growth rate in this environment. And of course, with these uncertainties around FX and maybe recessions in the US and other places, we'll watch and see how that unfolds. But absent the volatility in India, absent the FX and the financing headwinds, we feel very good about an upper single-digit sort of a growth rate from our operating units. And that's all driven and underpinned by growth in mobile data consumption around the globe and the need for tower space. And our portfolio is just really well positioned to benefit from that. David Barden : Okay. Great. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Rod Smith : Yes. Thanks. David. Tom Bartlett : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Choe : Hi. This is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow-up on the builds. So what do you see as the most attractive markets right now internationally? Rod Smith : When it comes to our build program, Richard, I mean, we're going to build about 4,000 sites this year. That's the expectation. The biggest chunks here really come from Africa and India in the range of 1,600, 1,700 sites each in those areas. In Europe, we're going to drive just over 400. In Latin America, maybe just under 300 sites. So there's an opportunity to build in all of these markets. And we get really good NOI yields in these markets kind of across the board. So it's not just about the volume of sites. Certainly, we like the idea of increasing our footprint Europe, in particular, driving more builds there with very highly credit quality customers in really attractive economies. So the 400 plus, 400 to 500 sites we'll build there are very attractive to us. But as Tom talked about with scaling the core, anywhere where we have management teams and assets and customers, to the extent we can add assets through an internal CapEx program with high NOI yields, it creates a lot of value for our shareholders long-term. It's good for our customers as well. So we think all of these markets are attractive in terms of our ability to build new assets. Tom Bartlett : Just adding on to that, one of the really interesting, I think, parts of the build is what we're doing in Africa, because we're really focused on building green sites in Africa with Airtel and really leveraging a lot of the power and fuel competencies that we've created in that market. We brought in solar to over 15,000 sites. We brought over lithium-ion in over 19,000 sites. We've reduced 5 million liters of diesel over the last several years. And so there is an incredible competency that we're building with regards to Power as a Service in that marketplace. And we're able to bring that then on to those green sites that we're building in conjunction with our -- with the agreement with Airtel. So that's a particular interest that we're really excited about over the next couple of years. Richard Choe : And coming back to the US, you said about the carriers are about 50% of your sites are 5G. When can we see, I guess, more densification activity? Do you think that's coming at the end of this year or into next year? Tom Bartlett : I'm certain that there are certain pockets of the United States where we're already seeing some densification going on in the marketplace. And so I would expect that to continue as penetration continues with 5G sets. Keep in mind, it's in the carrier's best interest to deploy out 5G, because it's going to lower their overall cost of providing service. And so as activity continues to drive and as applications continue to develop and get deployed, you'll start to see that densification. But -- so I think it is already going on. And I would expect that over the next two to three years, we'll see an increase even in the densification within the market. Also keep in mind that carriers are using slightly higher spectrum bands. And so given the propagation characteristics, they're going to be requiring higher levels of densification as a result of that as well. Richard Choe : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I just wanted to check in on the LATAM business. Obviously, as you mentioned, some churn impacts this year. Maybe you could break out the impact from Telefonica and Oi in your guide? And what type of visibility you have on churn beyond 2023 when some of these events may resolve and we could see organic growth go back to historical upper single-digit ranges? And then secondly, just a balance sheet question for Rod, obviously, a big increase in interest expense. Maybe you can talk about how you're thinking about managing the balance sheet this year in terms of fixed floating mix, whether there's the possibility of terming out some additional floating rate debt given the inverted yield curve or accessing the secured market or anything else you're looking at to help drive that down? Thank you. Rod Smith : Yeah. Sounds good, Eric. So when it comes to Latin America, I guess what I would point to is our guide on organic tenant billings growth is a little bit higher than 2%. That comes in a few pieces. The gross new business is going to be in the mid-single digits, let's call it, around 3% or so. We're also seeing higher escalators at around 8%. And we do have a headwind of churn of about 8% as well. That's the bits and pieces in terms of getting into that growth rate. So you can see the churn number is fairly high. We do think it's temporary, and we do think it will work through it over the next couple of years and get back to a more compelling overall growth in the market. And when it comes to the churn pieces in our guide specifically, when you look out here in 2023, Telefonica is really the biggest piece. And I don't want to get too detailed in terms of customers. But I think everyone knows what's happening in Mexico with Telefonica and then joining AT&T as an MVNO there. So that's driving a fair amount of the churn. We're also seeing some churn remaining from American Movil really through the Nextel assets that were purchased down in Brazil. Those are the two things other than smaller churn, smaller customers throughout the region. But it's really the Nextel and the Telefonica in the bigger piece. And then the Oi piece really is going to be out over time. So there's a couple of things that I would say about Oi. Oi in total is about $100 million of revenue for us. It represents about 1% of our overall business. About one-third of that is tied in with their landline business, which we fully expect that the landline business of Oi will keep those sites over time. The other two-thirds, we have, on average, five to six years remaining on the length there. So that will be -- kind of over time, we'll see Oi is not a significant impact today that we're seeing, but that may start unfolding this year and into next as we negotiate with the three players who kind of carved up the Oi. It will probably extend into a multiyear period in terms of getting through Oi. So that's kind of what's happening in Latin America relative to the churn issues. Yes. On the balance sheet, a couple of things that I would say. I mean, we have longstanding percentage policies when it comes to fixed and floating. We run 80-20. We're pretty much there at the end of 2022. We expect to stay in and around that range. I mean, we can be opportunistic. I think you saw it at the very end of 2021 just before interest rates began to rise. We were fairly aggressive in terms of terming out floating rate balances. We got our floating rate percentage down to closer to 10%. With about 90% or just over 90% on fixed, we did that very purposefully to take advantage of the low rates, both in the US bond market and the euro market. And that was just ahead of purchasing the data center business on December 28, 2021. So we can be flexible there. In terms of managing the balance sheet going forward, we have about $3 billion in bonds that we'll refinance this year. We'll look at a variety of opportunities to do that. That could come in the form of getting into the US capital markets that we can do that or parts of that in the European markets. And of course, we'll be balancing short-term and long-term rates. We could stay on the shorter end of the curve and with the expectation that rates may come down in the next couple of years, and then we go out longer when the rates are more attractive. We can also secure some of the debt that's on the balance sheet to the extent we refinance it and maybe carve off some savings from that perspective as well. So there are a lot of opportunities in terms of looking at the market. There's a lot to consider in terms of where we expect rates to head. But as I said earlier in one of my last comments, we do expect that rates will probably peak here in the US this year, maybe even drift down later in the year. And we'll continue to watch the markets and interest rates and economy to see what we expect to be happening next year. But we'll be looking at the full curve and all the different capital opportunities that we have in front of us to make the very best decisions going forward. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks, Rod. Rod Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great. Thank you. Just following up on India and specifically for Vodafone. Can you size the partial payments that they're making right now, if there's been a change in the pacing? And if there are any adjustments to the pricing of their contract with you? And just going back to evaluating strategic options for India. It's been a challenging market, but potentially there is some improvement. How do you sort of underwrite what valuation you would take versus the -- your long-term growth assumptions in that region? Thank you. Rod Smith : Hey, Batya, I'll take the India reserve question. So you can see in our outlook for 2023, we are calling out a specific reserve for VIL of about $75 million. That's up against on a revenue reserve basis from 2022, we reserved close to $100 million for really the last two quarters in 2022. What I can tell you is, the percentage -- I don't want to get into percentages of revenue that they're paying and those sorts of things. But I will highlight that in January, they're paying us a little bit more than they were paying us in the end of 2022. So we are seeing some improvement in terms of the collections through VIL. And we do expect that, that improvement will kind of continue, and we'll collect even a little bit more from a variety of their commitments to us as we look out over the balance of 2023. We do expect them to be getting back closer to and increasing their payments to us towards the end of the year. So we do expect to see some improvements going in that direction. That's kind of what I would say. In terms of the contracts, we haven't really written any MLAs or leasing contracts with them. We have entered into the $200 million convertible debenture, which also have some terms and conditions embedded in it that call out specific time periods in terms of when payments are due. It also has some additional terms and conditions around staying current with leasing fees within the MLAs and those sorts of things. So there's that additional agreement, which gives us a few additional kind of safety nets or safety belts here. But the situation there is volatile. We're focused on trying to support VIL through this period. We were very encouraged by the government conversion. We think that could be the beginning of better things for VIL in terms of raising additional capital going forward. And we're focused on long-term value creation and having VIL as a partner in India over the long term. And maybe on your second question, can you remind me what it was? Batya Levi : Yes. With improvement in India, why is this the right time to look for strategic options in the region? Rod Smith : Yes, I would say, it's really just being opportunistic, kind of, looking at the market. Certainly, India has been volatile over the last few years and maybe even a little bit longer than that. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we look at all of our portfolio assets around the globe kind of on a constant basis and evaluate growth opportunities, valuations and other things. So we are in the process of looking at strategic options in India. We haven't made any decisions at this point, but we are kind of going through a process in evaluating things. And it's really around being opportunistic. We do believe that the Indian market is an interesting market and does hold some upside, but there's also a fair amount of volatility that we have experienced. So we'll be looking at a number of things. And when and if we conclude and make any decisions, we'll certainly let everybody know. Batya Levi : Okay. Thank you. Rod Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from SVB MoffettNathanson. Please, go ahead. Nick Del Deo : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just a follow-up on the India question. Tom, you've emphasized how important new site builds are to your growth outlook and the returns you get with them. Obviously, there's a step down in your build plan in 2023 versus 2022, and it looks like the driver is primarily India. So, I guess, does that explicitly tie into your view that India is more volatile, potentially less appealing market than you once believed, or is something else driving that downshift? Tom Bartlett : No, it's really not. As a matter of fact, if you saw the numbers coming in from the field in terms of what they expected to build, it's significantly higher, candidly. And what I -- what we do is, we ratchet that back and look at the opportunity and look at where we can drive the most value there. So there's nothing going on there with regards to the pullback on sites. By the way, we will see different levels of site build in each one of the countries, just like we see different levels of colos, amendments depending upon what densification looks like and what the carriers are looking like. But now I wouldn't read in anything in terms of the pullback on India new builds for 2023. Nick Del Deo : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe turning to CoreSite, since you've had it for a little more than a year. It seems like things are going consistent with your underwriting, maybe even a bit better. I guess bigger picture, any key learnings you'd highlight now that you've had a chance to have deep discussions with CoreSite's customers and your tower customers about the vision for how you could integrate those assets or have them work together? And I guess, more generally, any adaptations or refinements of your plan versus a year ago that you'd want to highlight? Tom Bartlett : Yes. No, nothing specific. I mean, I -- we have a fair amount of history in the kind of in that particular part of the infrastructure business. We knew what the model was that CoreSite was delivering on with their customers and how significant interconnection was in terms of driving value for their customers as well as for the cloud and service operators, and that demand continues. And it's a significant barrier to entry for others to be able to compete against them. I'm continually incredibly impressed with the team and how they think about returns and how they think about the relationships with the customers. So -- but that wasn't surprise, because I thought that candidly through the entire due diligence process. So I knew the quality of the group. We did enjoy significant growth in 2022, which I think just goes to the strength of the team and strength of the value proposition that they're offering their customers. And we believe that 2023 is going to be another strong year. We still have, as you would expect, a significant amount of energy around what the edge will ultimately look like. We have created an advisory board. We have a lab set up. We have plans to start to look at building out some of that capacity. We've identified about 1,000 sites within the United States that can handle up to over a meg of capacity. And through the relationships that we've been able to develop really through CoreSite with the cloud, we remain really optimistic about what that opportunity is going to look like and how we're going to be able to drive incremental business to our tower site, which is in and of itself has a strong competitive barrier given the ownership that we have of the land and of the site. And so we're very excited about it. There's nothing in our guide relative to performance coming from that activity. And as we've said, it's going to be a multi-year rollout. But we think that as a result of the CoreSite assets as well as our tower assets, we're really uniquely positioned to be a meaningful part of the puzzle as the edge continues to develop. So as I said, I think we would just continue to underscore what we originally had thought, and we're continually working very methodically in terms of trying to become that linchpin for rolling out that kind of capability. Nick Del Deo : Okay. Thank you, Tom. Rod Smith : And Nick, maybe I'll just add -- complement on to what Tom said here. As we wait for the edge or work for the edge to develop, the CoreSite business is performing exceptionally well and right in line with our expectations. You heard us talk earlier about the record new business that we achieved in 2022. We see strong demand from enterprise customers on those core data center assets that we have around the country. A few of the key metrics here. We are seeing escalations right around 3% on our rental space, which is right in our target range. We see cash mark-to-market adjustments for 2023 go up beyond where they were in 2022. So, they've gone from about 2% up to maybe 3% to 3.5%. So, that's certainly a good factor. Churn continues to be in and around 6.5%, which is on the low end of our range. Interconnection growth we expect in 2023 to be in the 6% to 8% range, kind of right in line with where we would expect it to be. And our development CapEx is coming in at around $360 million for 2023. And much of that is to replace capacity that we sold in 2022 through those record new business numbers that we will be deploying in 2023 and 2024. Replacing that capacity is really where the CapEx is being deployed. So, we're seeing very good results and really demand from that CoreSite business, again, as we look to work to develop the edge. Nick Del Deo : That\u2019s great color. thank you both. Operator : And that's all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the conference back to your speakers for any closing remarks. Adam Smith : I appreciate everybody joining the call. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to myself or the Investor Relations team. Thanks everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Adam Smith : Good morning. And thank you for joining American Tower\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning\u2019s call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our U.S. tower and data center businesses. And then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q1 2023 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I\u2019ll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2023 outlook; capital allocation and future operating performance; our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning\u2019s earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. As is customary for our first quarter call, my comments today will focus on our U.S. business, which is principally comprised of our tower and data center platforms, which made up 55% of our consolidated property revenue and 64% of our property operating profit in the first quarter of 2023. With regard to our tower platform, the secular tailwinds that have supported outstanding growth over the last two decades remain consistent. Every year, U.S. wireless subscribers consume more mobile data through a growing number of devices and applications, requiring faster speeds and lower latency performance. As a result of the increasing levels of data being consumed, our customers are deploying more equipment on our towers to meet that demand. In addition, and more than ever before, our customers are utilizing multiple bands of spectrum to deliver those high-quality, ubiquitous levels of service. In 2022, U.S. carriers deployed around $40 billion in network capital to provide nationwide 5G services on mid-band spectrum. This record level of activity is reflective of the first major wave of the typical investment cycles we\u2019ve seen over the last 20 years, during which carriers amend existing sites to provide initial coverage and capacity with the new technology and harvest benefits from core network enhancements and spectral efficiencies. In previous cycles, these initial peaks have typically been followed by periods of moderation in overall spending, driven in part by reductions in spend on core upgrades, fiber and other infrastructure assets. However, we\u2019ve historically seen tower spend remain in focus as our customers look to support continuous growth in mobile data consumption and provide market-leading network quality and reliability. And we would expect more of the same over the 5G cycle. In 2023, while we\u2019re still in the relatively early stages of the overall 5G rollout, we continue to see customers making significant investments into their networks as part of their broader coverage initiatives, having yet to invest in densification at scale. These investments into adding and modifying equipment on our sites, which we\u2019ve monetized to our MLAs, is driving 5.6% organic growth in Q1 or nearly 7%, absent the impacts of the Sprint churn, our strongest quarter since Q1 of 2020. And for the full year, we expect $220 million in year-over-year growth contributions from colocations and amendments, a record for our U.S. business. Looking out over the next several years, we see an environment that is supportive of continued strong performance in the U.S. as the 5G investment cycle progresses and densification occurs. In American Tower, we\u2019ve underwritten this expectation into the comprehensive MLAs that underpin our expectation to deliver average annual organic growth of at least 5% or 6% excluding the Sprint churn over the next 5 years, which closely mirrors the 6.2% average organic growth we experienced between 2016 and 2020. Further, industry estimates suggest total monthly mobile data consumption that will require increased speed and lower latency is set to grow at a compounded annual rate of above 20% over the next five years, which we expect to be driven by continuous increases in mobile network utility, irrespective of potential impacts from any one category of new applications. As a result, we believe our customers\u2019 networks will need to provide at least 2 times the network capacity they have today in 3 to 4 years or roughly 3 times today\u2019s capacity as we approach the end of the decade. Over time, we expect our customers to meet this demand through continued network upgrade and densification initiatives, spectrum refarming and the deployment of 5G on new spectrum. In this context, we believe our portfolio of over 43,000 sites is optimally positioned to serve our customers across the balance of the 5G cycle with significant capacity to accommodate additional equipment and new tenancies even beyond what\u2019s been contractually locked in today. As we\u2019ve done historically, we anticipate leveraging our best-in-class internal processes to generate incremental efficiency in the business and higher levels of service for our customers with both resulting in increasing conversion of our top line growth to AFFO. Through a combination of organic growth and M&A, we\u2019ve added nearly $2.4 billion in annual property revenues to our U.S. and Canada segment since 2014, paired with less than $60 million in incremental SG&A expense or roughly 2% of the corresponding revenue growth. This prudent approach to cost management and operational efficiency has helped to drive operating profit margin expansion in the segment by roughly 400 basis points over the period. Going forward, given the benefits of our established scale, demonstrated ability to maximize the operating leverage potential inherent to our model and concerted efforts to further drive cost efficiencies at every level of the organization, we see a tremendous opportunity for capacity utilization in our existing assets to drive high-margin growth and expanding returns on invested capital as the 5G landscape continues to mature. Now, with respect to our CoreSite U.S. data center platform, we are equally excited about the prospects for value creation. Increasingly complex digital business demands require enhanced infrastructure performance and flexibility. CoreSite serves as an optimal nexus for the cloud service providers, service integrators, networks and enterprise customers inter-operate to propel their business initiatives forward. We continue to see customers landing and expanding with CoreSite because it provides native access to key cloud service platforms and a diverse ecosystem, which allows them to serve their customers in a way that is flexible, scalable and it drives growth and efficiency in their businesses. This is reflected in the continued strength of CoreSite\u2019s leasing results interconnection growth driven by both existing customers and new logos, as well as the ability to drive pricing, solid renewal rates and generate industry-leading returns. We also recognize that we\u2019re still in the early stages of a broader digital transformation movement. Each year, data center workloads and compute instances continue to grow at a rate of approximately 12% in the vast majority of all new IT architectures deployed into cloud and hybrid environments that CoreSite is uniquely positioned to support. Additionally, we continue to expect to generate long-term growth from enterprise digital transformations and IT hybridization as organizations face workload management challenges that require the operational -- optionality, agility and critical interconnection capabilities that our CoreSite data center platform offers. Importantly, the absorption of this type of demand drives incremental value to our interconnection ecosystem and further builds on the momentum behind the CoreSite flywheel and the value we can provide our customers. So, we see a long tail of opportunity to continue growing and scaling our campuses, and we have the added benefit of being able to prudently select opportunities that are accretive to our ecosystem. As a result, we\u2019ll continue to invest cash flows generated in the data center segment back into the business, provide our customers incremental confidence in a long runway for growth with CoreSite and generate highly attractive returns. Meanwhile, our teams continue working to develop solutions that leverage our combined communications real estate platforms to position American Tower as a leading infrastructure provider for the networks of the future and create incremental value for our customers and shareholders alike. In summary, our foundational U.S. tower and data center platforms are set to deliver continued growth and strong returns. We believe that the long-term secular tailwinds, the differentiated high-quality nature of both our U.S. tower portfolio and our data center interconnection platform, the value proposition they represent for our customers and the seasoned high talented teams managing them uniquely positions American Tower to create significant incremental value for the industry and our shareholders for many years to come. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Rod to discuss our Q1 results and expectations for the balance of the year. Rod? Rod Smith : Thanks, Tom. Good morning. And thank you for joining today\u2019s call. As you saw in our press release, we are off to a solid start to the year with performance exceeding our initial expectations across many of our key metrics. Before diving into the results and the revised outlook for 2023, I\u2019ll start with a few highlights from the quarter. First, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, strong demand trends continue to drive favorable leasing and growth across our global footprint, which is a testament to the resiliency and stability of our business. In Q1, we posted consolidated organic tenant billings growth of over 6%, our highest rate since 2017 and an over 300 basis-point acceleration as compared to Q1 of 2022. This includes growth through colocations and amendments of over 5%, our highest in three years, as carriers continue to leverage our leading macro tower portfolio to aggressively roll out their networks to meet customer demand. Organic leasing growth was further complemented by another quarter of strong new build volumes as we continue to leverage our scale and capabilities to attract accretive development opportunities from our leading customers across our international business. Finally, we had another record quarter of leasing from CoreSite, continuing the momentum from what was a record-breaking 2022 and exceeding our initial underwriting plan. Complementing our solid top line trends, our focus on cost management combined with the inherent operating leverage in the tower model, drove margin expansion of approximately 270 basis points as compared to Q1 of last year to 63.7%, with the benefits being more noticeable given the absence of material M&A. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to manage our business with cost discipline, maximizing the profitability of our strong reoccurring organic growth profile. Next, we access the debt capital markets, successfully issuing $1.5 billion in unsecured notes and $1.3 billion in secured notes at attractive terms. Proceeds from these offerings more than cover our Q1 maturities and the remainder together with the proceeds from various strategic initiatives, including the sale of the Mexico Fiber business, were used to pay down floating rate debt. As a result, we\u2019ve reduced our floating balance by nearly $800 million year-to-date, now representing slightly over 20% of our debt structure. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities to further manage this balance over the course of the year. Finally, we continue to have constructive discussions with potential investors as we assess strategic options for our India business. We remain focused on executing an outcome that maximizes value and optimizes our global portfolio mix and the risk-adjusted return profile for American Tower and its stakeholders. As we move forward, we will keep our investors informed of any new developments. With that, please turn to slide 6, and I\u2019ll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you could see, Q1 consolidated property revenue growth was over 4% and approximately 7% on an FX neutral basis over the prior year period. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of over 4%, international growth of over 3% or nearly 9%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and approximately 10% growth in our U.S. data center business. In the quarter, we benefited from accelerated decommissioning-related settlements in Latin America, totaling approximately $39 million, partially offset by Vodafone Idea or VIL, revenue reserves of approximately $33 million, representing a modest improvement to payment trends as compared to the second half of 2022. Moving to the right side of the slide, organic tenant billings growth was a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth, standing at 6.4% on a consolidated basis, which as I mentioned, was our highest quarter since Q3 of 2017. In our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.6% and nearly 7% absent Sprint-related churn, including a record quarter of colocation and amendment growth contributions of nearly $60 million, a nearly 65% increase as compared to the growth reported in Q1 of 2022. Growth modestly exceeded our expectations, driven by some delays in churn, which we still anticipate to occur in the year and, to a lesser extent, new business upside. Similarly, our international operations experienced improvements across nearly all reported segments, generating organic tenant billings growth of 7.5% and over 180 basis-point acceleration from Q4 of 2022, which includes the benefits of CPI-linked escalator commencements across various contracts. Africa generated its highest quarter on record with organic tenant billings growth of 12.1%, including escalator contributions of over 10% and a continuation of solid new business of nearly 7%. Growth in the quarter benefited from some delays in previously communicated carrier consolidation-driven churn, which we still expect to occur in the year. Turning to Europe, we saw a growth of 8.2% and including over 6% from escalations, demonstrating our ability to monetize on CPI-linked escalators across the vast majority of our portfolio in the region. In Latin America, we saw a growth of 6.1%, which includes relatively consistent escalator and new business growth, partially offset by the continued elevated churn, as we\u2019ve highlighted on past calls. Churn in the quarter was favorable relative to our initial expectations as the decommissioning events have been slightly delayed to later in the year. Lastly, in Asia Pacific, we saw a growth of 3.4%, demonstrating steady improvement over the past three quarters. This growth acceleration was mainly driven by colocation and amendment contributions as carriers ramp up 5G deployments. Organic tenant billings growth was further complemented by the construction of over 1,300 sites in the quarter, representing our 11th consecutive quarter of exceeding 1,000 sites, primarily in Africa and Asia Pacific, as carriers continue to invest in their network coverage and densification needs across the regions. Initial returns remained solidly in the double digits with Q1 constructed sites yielding nearly 14% on day one. Turning to slide 7. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 9% to approximately $1.8 billion or nearly 10% on an FX-neutral basis for the quarter. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, adjusted EBITDA margin demonstrated an approximately 270 basis-point improvement year-over-year to 63.7% and still an over 190 basis-point improvement when normalizing both periods of VIL-related revenue and bad debt reserves in India. This margin expansion was achieved through our continued focus on cost controls, allowing for approximately 100% conversion of revenue to adjusted EBITDA growth. Again, on a normalized VIL basis and driving cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue down by approximately 50 basis points year-over-year to approximately 7.1% for the quarter. Moving to the right side of the slide. Attributable AFFO growth was 1.5%, while roughly flat on a per share basis, which includes financing cost headwinds of around 7.5% and 9.5% against attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share growth, respectively, primarily driven by the rise in rates over the past year. Let\u2019s now turn to our revised full year outlook. As mentioned earlier, we had a strong first quarter, outperforming our initial expectations across the majority of our key metrics. While we are excited about the results to date and the sustainable demand trends that underpinned our performance, we have largely kept core and full year assumptions consistent to our prior guide, given our early position in the year and some of the timing benefits I alluded to earlier. This approach for our Q1 guidance is relatively consistent to past years. This also includes our assumptions around VIL-related revenue reserves, which we\u2019ve held at $75 million for the year. As noted earlier, we did record approximately $33 million in VIL reserves in Q1 with the guide applying an improvement for the duration of the year, notably in the back half. This assumption is supported by certain factors that we\u2019ve considered in our risk assessment, including the customers\u2019 contractual obligations for 2023, our latest conversations with VIL management, where they\u2019ve committed to meet these contractual obligations, and a demonstrated improvement in payments by the customer in Q1 relative to the second half of 2022. Key updates to our revised outlook include the impacts from the recent sale of the fiber business in Mexico, together with the upsides from FX derived using our standard methodology and several small adjustments below EBITDA at the attributable AFFO level. With that, let\u2019s dive into the numbers. Turning to slide 8. We are reducing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $20 million versus our prior outlook, driven by $45 million related to the sale of the fiber business in Mexico, partially offset by $25 million associated with the positive impacts of FX. Moving to slide 9. We are reiterating our prior outlook expectations for organic tenant billings growth across our regions, and we\u2019ll continue to assess the positive momentum coming from our strong first quarter as we work further into the year. Moving on to slide 10. We are reiterating our adjusted EBITDA outlook with a decline of approximately $25 million related to the Mexico Fiber sale, offset by $25 million from positive impacts of FX. Turning to slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $20 million at the midpoint and approximately $0.05 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.65 per share. Updates to our expectations, aside from FX, include the cash adjusted EBITDA reduction driven by the Mexico Fiber sale, offset by favorable net interest in part due to the use of the sale proceeds to pay down debt and some cash tax savings. On an isolated basis, the Mexico Fiber sale resulted in a $15 million decline to attributable AFFO as compared to our prior outlook midpoint. Moving on to slide 12. I\u2019ll review our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities for 2023. Beginning on the left side of the slide, our capital allocation priorities for 2023 remain consistent with our prior outlook, which includes approximately $3 billion towards our common dividend, subject to Board approval, representing 10% growth year-over-year on a per share basis. In addition, our CapEx outlook midpoints remain unchanged across all categories and support our initial plans to construct approximately 4,000 new sites across our international footprint. Moving to the right side of the slide. And as I highlighted earlier, we further strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet in the first three months of the year, extending our average maturity profile to nearly six years, while reducing our floating rate debt balance to slightly over 20%. Additionally, we closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5.2 times, well on track towards our deleveraging target of 3 to 5 times. Consistent with our past remarks, we remain focused on driving shareholder value through our growing dividend and accretive CapEx program while strengthening our balance sheet through deleveraging, maximizing liquidity, managing a diverse pool of capital sources and an ongoing assessment of market conditions to potentially further term out floating rate debt and extend our maturity profile. Turning to slide 13 and in summary. Q1 was another strong quarter across our business with incremental steps taken towards strengthening our balance sheet. Underpinned by sustained demand trends across our global footprint, our leading portfolio of communications infrastructure assets generated accelerating leasing growth, while our capabilities as an operator and partner continue to afford us opportunities to deploy accretive capital to its high-yielding development projects. We believe we are well positioned to drive compelling growth, supported by attractive secular trends across our global footprint and deliver solid returns to our shareholders over the long term. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to the line of Brett Feldman. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman : I was hoping I can ask about some background on the sale of the Mexican fiber asset. What led to that? Was that something you were actively shopping, or was there an inbound that came there? And then if we maybe just take a higher-level approach to this. You gave us an update you\u2019re considering and evaluating a potential equity sale in the India business. You just sold a piece of your Mexican business. Are you undertaking a broader portfolio rationalization strategy? And if that is the case or even if it was just India, where you would pull some additional proceeds in, how do we think about applying those proceeds especially now that you\u2019re getting close to the high end of your target leverage range? Thank you. Tom Bartlett : Yes. Hey Brett, I\u2019ll start, and Rod can also obviously add on here. We look at every one of our assets in our markets repeatedly. And continually, you\u2019re looking at where are the best rates of return that we can drive, are there better places for us to reallocate capital. And so, this is -- it\u2019s an ongoing process that we do internally. We also do it with our Board every year as well. And the business that we\u2019ve had in -- the fiber business that we\u2019ve had in Mexico, we\u2019ve had for several years, was really part of our kind of initial innovation and platform extension approach. And the piece of that particular business was just a business that we couldn\u2019t generate the kinds of returns on that we had expected. And we felt that it would be a better -- could be in better hands with somebody who had broader scale in the marketplace. And so, as a result of our kind of ongoing review, it was a business that we\u2019ve actively marketed over the last several months. And this is consistent with how we\u2019re thinking about even a market like India, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. It goes through that same kind of disciplined approach that we have. And we look at, okay, in each given market, again, like India, is there a better place to be able to reallocate some of that capital or invest in other products and services. And so, that\u2019s the process that we\u2019re going through right now. And Rod and I talked about it on the last call with you all. And we\u2019ll look to, as we did with the fiber, I mean, our goal from a balance sheet perspective is to delever, as we\u2019ve talked about right now, and we use those proceeds from the fiber sale to do just that. And we will continue to look at kind of delevering the balance sheet really over the next 12 to 18 months until we get it to a spot that we\u2019re really comfortable with. Rod Smith : Brad, if I could just add a couple of points there. Thanks for the question. You see in our quarterly numbers here, we got our leverage down to 5.2% (sic) [5.2x]. And of course, as constant, we did use the proceeds from the fiber business to pay down debt, not just to delever, but to actually reduce our exposure to floating rate debt, which we did, and we\u2019re down around that 20% number. And that really shows our commitment to our investment-grade balance sheet in this environment, looking to delever. That\u2019s definitely top of the list when it comes to capital allocation once you get beyond paying the dividend and the dividend growth that we have. And we\u2019ll continue to focus on delevering the business until we get down within our target range of 3 to 5 times. And we\u2019re also continuing to focus on reducing our exposure to floating rate debt. So, we\u2019re within our policy now right at about 20%. But we\u2019re going to be looking at that and working to try to reduce that exposure on the floating rate side even more than that in the coming quarter. So, you\u2019ll see us pretty active in that space. Brett Feldman : Great. If you don\u2019t mind as a quick follow-up question. I mean, just being at 5.2 turns, which is so close to the high end of your range. It doesn\u2019t seem like it would take 12 to 18 months to get into that target range. And so, is the right interpretation of that statement to say that in this environment, all things being equal, you would likely just continue to delever and particularly to pay down floating rate debt absent something that\u2019s highly compelling, meaning you may drift below 5 times and closer to 3 times, if that\u2019s just the case? Tom Bartlett : Yes, absolutely, Brett. You\u2019re exactly right. And now whether we go back down to 3 times, it could be a bit of a stretch. But clearly, we want to get sub-5. And as Rod said, we really do want to lessen the exposure to the floating rate debt that we have on the balance sheet. Rod Smith : One thing, Brett, that I\u2019ll just alert you to is don\u2019t be surprised if you see the 5 float back up a little bit, even maybe a 5.3 in the coming quarters before you see it trending back down. That will just be a function of kind of where our EBITDA -- our quarterly annualized EBITDA might end up landing. But that should not make you think that our commitment to delevering isn\u2019t as strong as we\u2019re suggesting it is, because it is, but you may see it flow back up just a touch before you see it come back down. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Landon Park : Good morning. This is Landon Park on for Simon. Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019m wondering if we can start on the data center side. You mentioned another record bookings quarter for CoreSite. Can you maybe provide any more color there in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in the market and where that demand is coming from? And on the data center side, can you give us an update on your edge data center project that you were trying to get built out this year to start scaling on that front? Tom Bartlett : Yes, sure. Let me start, and then Rod, you can continue -- or can add to it. To continue -- continuation of what we saw in 2022. I mean, the demand from -- for the kind of the digital infrastructure that we have just continues to be strong throughout the country. And it\u2019s a really nice balance between enterprise accounts, between operators as well as the cloud. So, the pipeline remains really healthy, and we\u2019ve been able and have taken advantage of the opportunity to capture some strong pricing actions throughout the year, particularly as we really continue to drive all the interconnection growth. So, we\u2019re really pleased with what the team has done, with the types of business that they\u2019ve generated, and it really resulted again in a really strong Q1, and we continue to have really strong expectations for the business going forward. With regards to kind of all of the edge work, we continue to work internally on identifying particular locations where we can actually drive 1 meg or 2 meg of power. We have a number of sites that are shovel-ready at this point, and we\u2019re looking to move on them. We continue to have conversations with all the service operators as well as the hyperscalers and all the cloud players to continue to move forward and figure out that value proposition that we think can be a profitable one for all of us. And so, as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s still early stages of it, but we continue to remain really excited about the ultimate opportunity. Landon Park : And just one follow-up on that. Where are you at in terms of the design phase for that sort of edge data center that you guys were hoping, I think, to design this year and something that could be scaled relatively easily going forward? Tom Bartlett : From a design and engineering perspective, we really have the specs really well laid out such that, as I said before, we\u2019re shovel-ready on a couple of locations to start to deploy it. And so, the teams know exactly what it\u2019s going to look like, have identified who the vendors are that are going to be providing a lot of the resources and pieces of it. And so, we\u2019re really far along on the overall design. Landon Park : What does the cost per megawatt look like for that design? Tom Bartlett : I don\u2019t know that I want to get into -- at this point in time. When we\u2019re ready to roll it and deploy it, we can give more -- we\u2019ll give more specifics as to the overall economics. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Rick Prentiss : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I want to follow up on Brett\u2019s question a little bit on the Mexico Fiber sale. Let\u2019s go deeper into what lessons that you learned there. I think you were hoping to see some small cell. But is it just that the fiber business is dramatically different than the power business and small cells weren\u2019t playing. But what specifically did you learn? And I got a U.S. question. Tom Bartlett : Rick, it\u2019s consistent with some of the experiences candidly that we\u2019ve had in the past in the business, and we thought we might be able to do things differently and unique. That particular asset came with at tens of thousands of sites in Mexico City, which was also very interesting to it and remains very interesting to us, and we still have the right to those particular assets as our customers deploy and densify in Region IX or in Mexico City itself. But what we continue to learn on the retail side, just how difficult it is to be able to provision circuits and make money, providing lit services to enterprise accounts and then just how competitive it is. And the SLAs that go along with them, how difficult it is to be able to maintain them in a very profitable manner. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of competition in the marketplace. And so, as a result, it just makes sense for us to put those particular capabilities in the hands of somebody that just does that 24/7. And hopefully, they will find more success there. But it\u2019s consistent with what we see in the fiber business in all of our markets, including the U.S., where we think that there\u2019s really an opportunity for fiber is when you\u2019re bringing it to the tower. That\u2019s kind of a slam dunk for us because that\u2019s obviously improving the capability and the capacity of a particular site. So, when we start to get into the retail aspects of it, it\u2019s just such a competitive, capital intensive, low margin opportunity that it just made sense for us to move out of it. Rick Prentiss : In this debt environment, good to reduce your floating rate and save some interest. On the U.S. side, can you update us as far as in aggregate what kind of percent of your towers do you think have been touched with mid-band spectrum by the carriers. And we\u2019ve heard a lot of talk that private networks are going slowly, but starting to ramp, but that some of the carriers are wanting to see private networks before we get to the edge. So just trying to gauge in the U.S. where we\u2019re at as far as mid-band touches and what you\u2019re seeing on private networks. Tom Bartlett : Yes. I mean, Rick, it still is in that kind of that 50% range. Some are a bit higher, some are a bit lower. But in the aggregate, it\u2019s at that 50% range I think that have been touched. Again, it\u2019s largely been coverage. There are some pockets of densification going on, still largely amendment-driven, if you will, in terms of getting that ubiquitous coverage on a nationwide basis. So the carriers all remain active. And as Rod mentioned, the overall capital spend, we expect it to be lower in \u201823 versus \u201822. But as you well know, our comprehensive MLAs really protect us from that type of volatility, if you will. And so, while the carriers may spend at different levels on a consolidated basis, slowed down a bit as would be expected in \u201823, we really are protected from that. On the private side, yes, there is a lot more dialogue going on candidly relative to private networks. I mean I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a surge of deployments. But I do see our sales teams entering into different types of conversations with carriers, enterprises, looking at deploying kind of private 5G types of networks. We have some that we\u2019re experimenting with and deploying. I think there\u2019s more to come on that. But clearly, 5G, I think, plays -- will play a significant role in developing that aspect of the market. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Just following up on the domestic leasing environment. Curious how much of the leasing strength is coming from outside of the big three national wireless carriers? And what\u2019s the sensitivity to performance, both for \u201823 and as you look out to your multiyear guidance, if that activity from these others, which could include DISH, were to significantly increase or significantly decrease? And then if I could just throw in a second question, the common theme from some of the market-by-market commentary with delay of churn. And so just curious if there\u2019s more to unpack in what\u2019s causing those delays in certain markets. And if those delays should help the \u201823 outlook and just be something we should be considerate of in terms of a possible headwind for part of 2024? Thanks. Rod Smith : Hey, Michael. Good morning. Thanks for joining, and thanks for the question. We\u2019ve talked about in the past we are seeing an acceleration in the leasing environment in the U.S. in terms of our numbers and specifically the incremental revenue that we\u2019re seeing from new business coming from colocations and amendment. So, we had a really strong quarter in Q1 in the U.S. We booked about $60 million of incremental colocation amendment revenue. That\u2019s well on track to achieve our $220 million target for the year, which is a nice step-up over last year, which was about $150 million. So, that\u2019s the acceleration that we\u2019re seeing. That is primarily coming from the primary carriers, the big three certainly. And DISH is also a contributor in that. And I think you know and most everyone on the call knows that we have holistic deals with the carriers in the U. S. environment. So not that we\u2019ll go through any specifics with how they work carrier by carrier, but what it does is it has our revenue contracted in there. So, we have about 90% of our revenue and revenue growth for this year fully contracted, and there\u2019s no variability in that. So, we feel really good about that. And then when you look at the long-term going out through 2027, you\u2019ve heard us talk about that 5% on average OTBG in the U.S. We have about 75% visibility out over that long period of time of the underlying revenue as colored for revenue growth. So we feel really good about that. But the vast majority of that activity is the big three plus DISH. Certainly, we have kind of this other category with some broadcasters, some local independent radio companies and other people that use our towers like government agencies. And they always contribute a piece there, and they\u2019re kind of in the range that they\u2019ve always been at. But the vast majority really is the big guys in the U.S. When you think about churn, we did have delays in churn, which helps support our growth rates for the quarter. So, we\u2019re up to about 6.4%. Our churn came in at about 3.4% for the quarter. And the places where it\u2019s noticeable, it\u2019s a slight improvement in the U.S. because of churn, but that\u2019s not the biggest piece. It\u2019s probably more dropping down into Latin America. Within our overall guide for Latin America, we had 8 percentage points in for churn. And that is primarily coming from two big carriers : Telefonica, which everyone knows what\u2019s happening with Telefonica in Mexico as well as Oi down in Brazil. Oi represents about 2% within that 8%. And what\u2019s happening is just the delay. So we fully expect the churn for the Telefonica churn as well as the Oi churn to kind of catch up here during the year. That\u2019s why you\u2019re not seeing a change to our organic tenant billings outlook for the full year. So, we do expect to kind of catch up with that. So, we\u2019ll take the positive benefits for Q1, and we\u2019re still kind of being realistic and maybe a little conservative in terms of keeping our organic tenant billings growth consistent. But that\u2019s really where it is. We also have elevated churn in Africa with Cell C down in South Africa and even AirtelTigo over in Ghana. And again, we\u2019re not changing our full year outlook with just the timing is moving around just a bit. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Matt Niknam : Just two, if I could. First, on India, if there\u2019s any more color you can give or update in terms of where that process is and when you may expect to have that resolved. And then, maybe to dovetail on the prior question, obviously, this year has been impacted by interest, FX, some VIL reserves. As we kind of move past that, is high-single-digit type AFFO per share growth maybe a more viable aspirational target to consider in 2024 onwards, or are there other maybe headwinds we should be contemplating as we start to roll the calendar? Thanks. Rod Smith : Let me hit the India process first, and then I\u2019ll jump into the next question. So, we are running a process, as Tom and I have talked about here on this call and in the prior call. It\u2019s very similar to the process we walked through when we sold an equity stake in our data center business in the U.S. as well as the European joint venture that we did. So, we\u2019ve gone out to the top couple dozen highly professional, large investors that are in the infrastructure space. Our goals remain the same that in the other transactions we did, really, which is to partner to or sell the equity to a very strong investor that understands the space that can help run the business, has government connection, has carrier connections, all those sorts of things. So bringing more than just capital, but also a willingness and some experience to be a strategic partner in the business. So that process continues. I would say at this point, it\u2019s progressing. And we\u2019ve got the list worked down from the full couple of dozen to a smaller list here, still very active. And I think we\u2019ll figure out where we head and what that transaction might look like in the coming quarter. So, there\u2019ll be more to update you on probably in the next call. But we\u2019ll be patient. We\u2019ll be opportunistic as we kind of work through it, and we\u2019ll see what the opportunities there look like. And when we decide what we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019ll have the best interest of the shareholders in mind, of course, and as well as the employees and the customers there in India. But it\u2019s a very similar process that we\u2019ve kind of gone through before. I guess when you think about the -- jumping into the next question here in terms of AFFO. You know we have AFFO per share growth in our guide here that\u2019s a little less than zero, so a negative growth rate. And I\u2019ll just remind you that the headwinds there, as you highlighted, is really the financing interest cost, but also the issuance of the shares that we did middle of last year to help finance the CoreSite business as well as FX. So, we are seeing roughly an 8% headwind for the year around the financing pieces, including the spike in interest rates. We\u2019re seeing about a 1% headwind roughly on FX. And the VIL reserve that we\u2019re taking, that $75 million that we talked about, that represents about a 2% headwind as well. So, when you put all that together, the core underlying business is in fact growing in that 8% to 9% range this year. And we think that feels like a pretty good place for us. So to the extent that we drive 5% organic tenant billings growth in the U.S., we drive a little bit higher organic tenant billings growth in our international markets, we complement that with another 100 basis points or so with new builds. We expand margins as we drop down through the P&L. And then, we deployed capital in a prudent way. We certainly think that upper single-digit growth rate is achievable. Now with that said, there are a few things that could still be items that we need to watch. The VIL situation is a situation that\u2019s ongoing that we continue to -- the need to watch. We don\u2019t know exactly where interest rates will go. So, we\u2019re certainly being prudent in trying to reduce our exposure to floating rate debt, get ahead of refinancings and reduce refinancing risk. And this year, we\u2019ve already issued just under $3 billion of new bonds, new notes. And that removes the refinancing risk from \u201823 entirely. Now, we\u2019re beginning to look at \u201824 to remove that. But you put all that together, as long as interest rates cooperate if that bag kind of hangs in there, which we\u2019re seeing favorability in the spot rates, so that\u2019s kind of trending in a good direction. If we sort out the VIL kind of India volatility, then upper single digits certainly is achievable in this business. We\u2019ve got a great portfolio of assets in a lot of really good places, and we\u2019ve got customers that are actively leasing the site. So, we feel really good about the core performance of this portfolio. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to the line of David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : So two, if I could. So first one for Rod. I just want to make sure I understand this Vodafone Idea situation. So, when we came out of the second half and you gave guidance for 2023, you said that you assumed that the collections rate would be roughly equivalent to the second half run rate for 2023. And that number was -- and then you changed to a cash accounting method maybe 70% to 80% of what you expected would be realized. And yet then you said today that you\u2019re actually in the first quarter had better-than-expected collections. But then you also made a provision, which was almost half the reserves that you expected for the whole year. So, I don\u2019t know if I understand how all that\u2019s working. So, if you can kind of help us through that and how it will work, that would be super helpful. And then the second piece would be, Tom, DISH, stock is hitting a 24-year low. The bonds are yielding 20% to 30% for the next three years. It\u2019s in a distressed position. And there\u2019s a lot of questions I field from people about kind of how comfortable you feel with your contractual relationship? How does that contribute to growth? And then for those of us who maybe aren\u2019t as grizzled as some of us veterans, how do you think if a bankruptcy emerged in the wireless space, how would that work in this day and age? Thanks. Rod Smith : Hey David, good morning. I\u2019ll take the first one on Voda. So the collections rate that we\u2019re seeing in Q1, it\u2019s not better than our expectation. It\u2019s right in line with our expectation. We expect the level of collection that we had in Q1 to continue into Q2 as kind of the way we\u2019re thinking about it. I\u2019m not sure if I heard all the detail in your question, but I\u2019ll try to clarify for you. That collections rate that we experienced in Q1 is slightly better than what we experienced in Q4 of last year and what we experienced in Q3 of last year. So that\u2019s where we talk about the improvement in terms of the collections from Vodafone. It\u2019s really the first half of this year, let\u2019s say, compared to the last half of last year. The other part of your question, I think it kind of leads into what\u2019s happening later in the year. And we do expect an improvement in collections from Vodafone as we enter into the second half of this year. And so, that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re looking. And we talk to Voda quite frequently. We have -- you have seen -- we\u2019ve seen that the government converted their equity. That does kind of clear the way a little bit for Voda to work on their balance sheet and to potentially raise equity and debt. And we gather that they\u2019re working aggressively on that. You may have seen a new Board appointment over in India. We think that\u2019s a really good fact as well. And we do believe that Voda management is committed to and capable of increasing their payments to us in the second half of the year, and that\u2019s reflected in our outlook. So that\u2019s kind of how those bits and pieces worth most of the $75 million serve that we have in there will be booked and realized in the first half of this year. Tom Bartlett : Dave, with regards to DISH, they remain very active in the market. They are investing throughout the country to meet all of their FCC requirements. They\u2019re -- have always been a good partner. I have a lot of faith in their leadership team there in terms of being able to develop the network and drive strategies that make sense for them. So from our perspective, there has been a very strong player and a very strong partner. I\u2019m not going to speculate on bankruptcies and all the other types of things candidly. But just to let you know that I believe that they are really strong leadership team, really smart and being, I think, very intelligent in terms of how they\u2019re building out their network. David Barden : Tom, if I could just follow up. I think that there is a spectrum of relationships that tower companies have with DISH. Some are activity-related, some are kind of minimum take rates with contractual escalators and such. And I think that you\u2019re in the latter camp. Is that fair to say? Tom Bartlett : I mean we\u2019ve been working with DISH for a number of years in terms of helping them look at the engineering of their network and building out their network. And I would say that our U.S. leadership team has had, I think, a really strong relationship with them right out of the gate. I can\u2019t speculate on other types of relationships with some of the other tower cos. But we\u2019ve been really comfortable with the relationship and how it\u2019s been built over the years. And I think that there\u2019s a mutual respect for -- between both entities. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Batya Levi : Can you talk a little bit about how you will approach M&A? There seems to be a number of portfolios available in some of the Asian markets that you don\u2019t currently have a presence in and maybe some in Europe. If you could just talk about your interest and how you would prioritize portfolio growth in the next couple of years, that would be great. And a second question maybe just specifically in Europe. What do you see in terms of the carrier activity? And if there\u2019s any update on how one-on-one is contributing to your growth? And if they decide to grow the MVNO route, should we expect any impacts on your growth outlook? Thank you. Rod Smith : Hey Batya, good morning. Thanks for the question. So regarding M&A, our view today is consistent with where it\u2019s been in the last couple of -- the last few months, certainly the last couple of quarters, which is in this environment, given what\u2019s available and kind of the differences that we see in pricing between private tower sales and, let\u2019s say, public tower equities, along with some terms and conditions that, of course, are important, when you look at portfolio by portfolio and region by region, we continue to look at the pipeline. And in our evaluation, there\u2019s nothing in there that we see that\u2019s compelling at the moment. Nothing in there that we see that would require us or prompt us to make any kind of a move. So then we settle back in. And we\u2019re firmly kind of committed to our capital allocation approach here going forward. And one of the things that helps guide us is the uncertainty around rates and ensuring that we\u2019re reducing our leverage getting back below our 5 times in a prudent amount of time, also reducing that floating rate exposure, making sure we\u2019re aggressively managing interest rates along with providing a dividend and a growing dividend to our shareholders. So, when you look at the totality of opportunities available, we\u2019re fully committed to the dividend and dividend growth. Next, we allocate capital to our capital programs, our internal programs where we build towers. We\u2019ll build around 4,000 this year around the globe. Those come in at very high day one NOI yields, roughly mid-teens. 14% is the number for the -- for Q1. So, we feel that that\u2019s really good. We\u2019re also allocating some capital within our capital number for this year towards CoreSite in the mid-$300 million, let\u2019s call it, $360 million or so. And as we\u2019ve discussed, that\u2019s kind of within their cash flow generation. They produce EBITDA or gross margin, let\u2019s say, in the mid-400s. So we\u2019re comfortably kind of reinvesting -- their cash flow back into their business to make sure that we have capacity to continue to satisfy the customers and keep up with the record demand that we experienced last year in the first quarter of this year. And I\u2019ll highlight again for the folks on the call here that our capital program this year is slightly below last year, not materially below, but they\u2019re slightly below. And that\u2019s kind of a function of allocating capital towards balance sheet and reducing leverage and reducing our floating rate exposure. When you think about Europe and Asia, like we would want to be larger in there. We think that market is very constructive for us. We do think there are some interesting portfolios there, but nothing that we\u2019ve seen yet in terms of terms and conditions and pricing and all the different pieces lining up where it would need to be. And we don\u2019t expect that to happen any time soon. But over the next several years, let\u2019s call it, 2 to 5 years, Europe is a place where we could be active in looking at different portfolios. We think there\u2019s really good backdrop in Europe. With that said, if we don\u2019t buy anything in Europe, we\u2019ve got a really good portfolio and feel good about our position day one. And when you think of Asia where we spent a lot of time in the last couple of years looking at different transactions in Asia, and again, nothing kind of lined up and met our criteria. We\u2019re very-disciplined when it comes to pricing terms and conditions, counterparty and also country evaluations and things like that. We\u2019ll continue to be disciplined. And I do think you\u2019ll see us be very committed to balance sheet, reducing leverage, reducing floating rate debt and not active in any major way in M&A in the near term. And then, maybe in Europe, the other thing just to hit your other question, we\u2019re seeing good activity across Europe. It\u2019s a -- when you think about Germany, kind of the center point that Drillisch 1&1 is just beginning to ramp up their network build in a full greenfield 5G build. So, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of revenue activity from that. But we\u2019re excited to support them in their endeavor to build out a network there. And we do think that we\u2019ll see more activity with them in the second half of this year and certainly in years to come. But then when you think about France and Germany and Spain across the board, we think there\u2019s a really good backdrop, a good set of counter-parties and carriers there for us to support. And we feel really good about the growth rates and our position within those markets. We guided when we did the Telxius transaction that we would be achieving mid-single-digit organic tenant billings growth. We\u2019ve been above that since we acquired the portfolio in this year, we\u2019re again looking at upper single digits in that 7% to 8% range, which is a really nice place. We\u2019re benefited from the activity that we\u2019re seeing from the carriers in terms of the leasing. We\u2019re also benefited from the contract terms where we have untapped escalators in Germany and in Spain, which is very helpful. And then we\u2019re seeing very low churn rates again, because of the demand that we see from the carriers to build out networks and also the way the contracts work that we\u2019ve been able to negotiate. So, we feel really good about our position in Europe. We feel really good about our ability to support the carriers\u2019 endeavors to build out networks in Europe, and we think there are some good things to come in Europe. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Brandon Nispel : I guess when we look at the U. S. leasing colo line, $60 million I think was a record for the Company ever. Are we at the point where that colo number is peaking? And just because if we look at the midpoint of the guide $220 million, it would imply some deceleration. And then, can you just help us just refresh us in terms of how your master lease agreements work in terms of the use fee provided to your customers. I guess my understanding is in year one of those contracts, it\u2019s typically the highest use fee contribution and that those generally fall off as the term of the contract extends. But I was hoping you can help explain it for us. Thanks. Rod Smith : So, you are correct in terms of the organic new bid, the incremental new bids we get from colocations and amendments. That $60 million number, we do see that at the peak for the year. But with that said, it will be -- we expect that number on a quarterly basis to be between $50 million and $60 million for the next three quarters for the full year. So, it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re going to see a big drop off. It is pretty linear there the way things work. So -- but you will see it drift down a little bit, and that is kind of a function of the timing of the MLAs and the use right fees. I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail about the contracts and the way the contracts work. But you can have timing differences here where you have use right fees that step up in a certain quarter. They\u2019re mostly front-end loaded. And then you also have the ability to get additional revenue over and above that, which can be more variable kind of throughout the quarter. I would say that that -- the $220 million that we\u2019re seeing this year, there is kind of a function there with the MLAs and kind of some of the transition period that we had kind of moving in and out of different MLAs, that does help support that number a bit. So, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that number is a little bit lower next year. But with that said, we\u2019re still seeing kind of the acceleration of that revenue kind of as we enter the beginning of this year. And again, it will taper off on a quarterly basis. But we\u2019ll hit the $220 million for the full year. That again is up almost 50% from the $150 million that we that we hit last year. And we continue to feel really good about everything that we see and work on in terms of the U.S. business being in a strong position to achieve 5% organic tenant billings growth on average out over the time period through 2027. Operator : And we have time for one more question. That will come from the line of Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : Maybe just quickly touching on the data center business, obviously, continuing to perform well. Maybe you could talk about the accelerated growth you\u2019re seeing there and kind of disaggregate it between just new leasing and then also pricing. We\u2019ve heard that supply is really historically tightened data centers and a lot of operators are continuing to push rents. And then you made a comment, I think, that you\u2019re seeing some pockets of densification in certain markets. Maybe you can talk about how you think the cadence of that evolves over the next few years, especially as some of the mid-band spectrum upgrades, amendment revenue starts to taper off in the next couple of years? Rod Smith : So, we\u2019re very excited about the data center business that we have. I think you\u2019ve heard us say in the past that it\u2019s a differentiated set of assets to the extent that it\u2019s a cloud-rich standard facilities, multiple cloud on-ramps and lots of the facilities that we have, their network and lots of enterprise customers in there. And that really means there\u2019s a lot of interconnection. People come into these facilities for those multiple cloud on-ramps and to interconnect with everyone else, the cloud, the networking companies and the other enterprise companies. That is helping drive this record growth that we\u2019ve seen. So, as we\u2019ve talked about, we saw record new bids for CoreSite through the full year 2022. And we also saw a continuation of that where we had a record new business performance for Q1 kind of quarter-over-quarter from prior year, I should say, from Q1 of last year. So that strong performance certainly is continuing. That resulted in a 10% revenue growth year-on-year for that business. That\u2019s higher than what we underwrote that business for. We\u2019ve talked about kind of upper single-digit 6% to 8% economic growth in that set of assets. That\u2019s the way we underwrote it. And we outperformed last year. We\u2019ve got a really good start this year. Maybe that 10% thinks back a little bit. But we should be solidly in the upper single-digit growth rate and within our underwriting targets for that business. We\u2019re also seeing really strong growth in interconnection revenue, up about 9.5%. And that\u2019s really key because that really represents what these customers are doing within our facilities and why they\u2019re there. And it makes the revenue that we have a lot more durable, dependable and sticky because they\u2019ve got these relationships with other enterprise customers and into all these networking companies. So, that is a really good fact. We\u2019re also increasing prices within that market being sensitive to customers as well, but also trying to drive growth in that business and making sure we\u2019re getting the value that these assets are contributing to our customers. So, we continue to see cash mark-to-market increases in the 3% to 5% range, 3% to 4% range, which is -- which is going well. We have escalators in lots of our contracts, so we generally see a 3% escalator kind of in our underlying contracts. The churn rate continues to be in the mid-single digits in that business, in the 6.5% range, well within our 6% to 8% target. And our maintenance CapEx is right within our target range of about 2% of revenue, runs in between $20 million and $30 million a year. So, we\u2019re really pleased with the way that the team is running that business and the way those assets are performing for us. And quite frankly, what those assets do for our customers, which they\u2019re really important assets for the customers. And we\u2019re continuing at a gross margin that\u2019s almost 60%. So, we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with the performance of the data center business and the future outlook, quite frankly, and the optionality that those assets provide us when you think about the edge and potentially connecting those assets into our towers and into edge compute facilities closer to our customers\u2019 base radios on the wireless side, but also closer to network companies as well as enterprise customers that are scattered throughout the U.S. So, that business and the future outlook there is really strong.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Adam Smith : Good morning. And thank you for joining American Tower\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. On this morning\u2019s call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our international business, and then Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our Q2 2023 results and revised full year outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I\u2019ll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2023 outlook; capital allocation, and future operating performance; our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning\u2019s earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as updated in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thanks Adam and thanks to everyone for joining this morning\u2019s call. Consistent with our past practice my comments today will focus on our international segment which consists of a well-diversified, high growth portfolio of assets across key developed and emerging geographies outside of the United States. Before diving into our international operations though and in light of the recent excitement surrounding the potential arising from AI workloads, I'd like to spend a moment highlighting the demand we're seeing in our CoreSite data center business, where we've seen 9% year-over-year growth, in both revenue and operating profit for the first six months of the year. Following record levels of signing new business in 2022 and Q1 of 2023, we continue to see demand for data centers outstripping supply in our initial underwriting expectations, elevated pre-leasing in a pipeline that points to an extended opportunity for increasingly profitable growth.  Each of these factors is contributing to strong pricing trends, and the ability to be selective in terms of signing new logos and expansions from existing customers, ensuring accretion to the value of the interconnection ecosystem and overall AFFO growth, particularly once we begin commencing the remainder of the record new business we've signed over the last year and a half. This is all before factoring in expectations for elevated demand from AI used cases. While much of the immediate demand in the market today is coming from hyper scale requirements, the longer term opportunity for interconnection hub like CoreSite, is just as significant and is arising from several key demand drivers. First, we've already seen an acceleration in outsourcing to CoreSite as hybrid IT and multi cloud access are becoming more relevant for continued digital transformation across all workloads. As enterprises increasingly leverage new generative AI models for business and customer applications, they'll need to deploy servers that require more power and cooling than on premises data centers can typically handle. At the same time, we expect existing enterprise customers who are building AI into their products and operating models will expand their power and space requirements in CoreSite with its flexible and scalable model and speed to market benefits, is already well positioned to support these expected used cases today.  Second, we're seeing today's cloud enabled large language models requiring connections to proprietary distributed datasets use for training, which CoreSite as an interconnection ecosystem with a nationwide distribution of cloud on-ramps is well situated to serve. And finally we see a significant incremental opportunity arising from the use of hybrid and custom large language models for training and inferencing where low latency, high power density and distributed high performance compute is expected to result in elevated activity across our existing CoreSite campus footprint. Over time, we see a potential for these dynamic requirements to push demand for a more distributed compute infrastructure for which our CoreSite portfolio and ultimately our distributed footprint of land parcels on the Tower sites may be ideal locations over the long-term.  Simply put, the ongoing demand trends in the data center space and the emergence of generative AI used cases are providing American Tower from CoreSite an opportunity to play a central role as an infrastructure provider against a backdrop of technology evolution that's expected to drive a step up function increasing computing power demand. As a result, we see a compelling opportunity to continue delivering the industry leading yields on invested capital that CoreSite has historically achieved which Rod will touch on more later.  With that, let's turn to our international Tower business, where our objectives have remained clear, since we began expansion over two decades ago, leverage our proven capabilities and expertise to selectively invest in the world's largest free market democracies with regulatory structures that are supportive of the neutral host tower model, healthy competitive wireless industries, and high quality assets and counterparties. At the same time we focused on investing in markets that are in various stages of network technology development, and where we see a path to establishing nationwide scale. By bringing these factors together, we believe we could both augment and extend our growth trajectory, leverage our platform and expertise to create incremental value in selected markets, and add to an already compelling total return profile for American Tower shareholders.  As a critical component of this portfolio management and capital allocation program, we measure and analyze our assets on an ongoing basis to ensure the marriage identified and our initial investment underwriting remained consistent today. As you've seen recently, such evaluation has led to select divestitures including our Mexico fiber business and operations in Poland and a strategic review of our India business. The takeaways from these analyses together with our on the ground experiences across our global business continue to shape and evolve our approach to capital allocation. And the criteria we use to support ongoing capital investment and the setting of appropriate risk adjusted rates of return. Today, we have a leading international portfolio of nearly 183,000 sites that are contributing approximately 45% and 36% towards consolidated property revenues and operating profit respectively, and are expected to deliver more than 8.5% in total tenant billings growth, including greater than a 6.5% organic growth in 2023. The secular demand trends driving our international growth remained consistent. Similar to the U.S., industry estimates forecasts roughly $35 billion in carrier CAPEX across our non-U.S. markets in 2023 and forecast suggest mobile data consumption is set to grow in the 20% to 30% range on average in these markets over the next several years, which would mark a continuation of the trends we've seen over the better part of the last two decades.  Globally, we've anchored our portfolio in key markets, which are in varying stages of network development relative to that of the U.S., where some level of 5G coverage deployed over a combination of low and mid band spectrum has reached approximately 95% of the population. In Europe, that number is closer to 60%, while Africa and Latin America are closer to 7% to 8%, suggesting a long tail of 5G and other next generation technology investments requiring significant incremental network density and sell side points of presence. Critical to our expansion strategy has been our discipline in establishing appropriate contract structures with the leading M&A [ph] in each geography. Although we've experienced certain consolidation driven churn events across our international portfolios over the past several years, we believe that through our proactive steps to increase exposure to leading multinational counterparties, we strategically reset our international customer base, enhancing the quality of our earnings and predictability of growth.  In fact, in Africa, approximately 90% of our Q2 property revenues are derived by market leaders Airtel, MTN, Vodafone, and Orange, as compared to roughly 80%, five years ago. In Europe, we similarly see over 80% of property revenue supported by Telefonica, Orange, Vodafone, and Deutsche Telekom versus less than 60% at the same time in 2018. In Latin America, which has a more fragmented customer base, given our operations across eight markets, we're still generating approximately 75% of our property revenues from Telefonica, At&T, American mobile, and Tim, up from a little over 60% over the same time period.  In addition to focusing on partnerships with market leaders, we've underwritten attractive leasing terms, including real estate REITs, and CPI linked escalators in the vast majority of our contracts outside of India. This disciplined approach to securing growth and critical contract terms is evident in our results in Q2, with a combination of gross organic new business and our escalator generated just under 13.5% growth in aggregate for Latin America, Europe, and Africa, roughly 300 basis points over our trailing five-year average. This reflects our ability to complement new site leasing with attractive amendment growth across our international operations, as we've done in the U.S. historically. In fact, looking again at Latin America, Europe, and Africa, of the roughly $100 million we've generated through colocation and amendment growth over the past 12 months, around half, both in each region and in the aggregate has come in the form of amendments, illustrating our ability to monetize various stages of network investment cycles, and our success in franchising our proven U.S. tower model throughout our global operations.  There's perhaps no better example of the benefits of remaining disciplined in terms of contract structure in Europe, where over the last several quarters, CPI linked escalators in Germany and Spain have provided a boost to our organic growth profile. And where again, roughly half of our new business growth has been driven by 5G related amendment activity on existing sites. In 2023, these factors as well as a healthy leasing environment are coming together to derive an expectation of approximately 8% organic kind of Billings growth in Europe, including an expectation for an acceleration in growth from colocations as we exit the year. As the 5G investment cycle continues our contract structures along with our work to develop leading operating capabilities in the region, and an ongoing expectation for low churn should allow us to deliver solid organic growth in the region for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the importance of the scale we built as a distinct competitive advantage has never been clear.  To our global diversified presence, and decades long track record of operational excellence, we've established American Tower as a trusted, strategic partner for our customers. This is exemplified by our new build program, where we partnered with leading carriers to rapidly deploy new sites, which has driven some of our highest returns on invested capital. In fact, since we began expanding internationally, we have built over 45,000 international sites, which are achieving a NOI yield of approximately 25%. And approximately 65% of these sites have been built since the start of 2017 alone shortly after we crossed the 100,000 international site mark. Nearly 8000 of these sites have been built in Africa, where our scale presence and strategic relationships with key wireless operators have afforded us the opportunity to build several 1000 new sites in recent years, that typically deliver mid teen yields on day one.  As we continue to augment our scale in key markets across the region, 4G investments, which are very much in the middle innings today are driving compelling organic tenant billings growth and our existing assets, including an expectation for greater than 11% growth in 2023, of which approximately 7% is coming from colocation and amendments, the highest of any region. And as the 4G cycle rounds out over the next few years, and we move toward 5G and the densification requirements that come with it, we expect capacity utilization across the assets we've built over the last several years to result in ongoing compelling growth.  Meanwhile, our regional scale and leading capabilities have resulted in the opportunity to invest in accretive platform extensions, such as our power as a service program in Africa. As you'll see in our recently published sustainability report, through 2022 we've invested approximately $345 million in this program, primarily in solar arrays and lithium ion battery solutions. As a result, we decreased annual diesel consumption at our sites in the region by an estimated 43.5 million liters when compared to business as usual operations and we've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions intensity per tower by 21%, against our 2019 baseline. Based on the demand to extend this program, it seems clear that this solution provides compelling differentiated value to our customers.  At the same time, the program advances our progress toward meeting our science based targets and supports our customers network sustainability goals. Meanwhile, similar to our new build program, these investments have been among the highest return opportunities we've seen. And as more power intensive 5G begins to be deployed at scale more broadly, we believe we'll be well positioned to continue extending the reach of this high return program to new geographies over time. Finally, we're more focused than ever, on leveraging the benefits of our scale to maximize the margin profile of the business. For example, through our Global Business Services Organization, we've invested in standardization across lease management and other transactional processes that's driving both significant increase in productivity and run rate savings on an annual basis. Through our procurement organization we will begin to truly leverage our scale as a buyer to reduce input costs in our build to suit programs. Drive cost optimization when it comes to power and energy components and work with other critical vendors in our supply chain to realize incremental efficiencies. And while we're beginning to see the benefits of these and many other initiatives in our operations today, we believe we have a significant opportunity to transform our organization into one that is truly global, and capable of maximizing the operating leverage inherent to the business to expand on an already attractive margin profile.  In summary, we believe our global platform of assets is exceptionally positioned to benefit from what we expect to be a massive wave of incremental infrastructure demand required to support the technological advancements and network capabilities we're beginning to see in the market today. By complementing our U.S. platform, with a continued disciplined approach to international growth, and a focus on leveraging our scale, capabilities and learnings from over two decades of international U.S. operations we can provide compelling growth and margin expansion, and augmented return opportunity for investors, and a differentiated value proposition for our customers for many years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to go through the quarterly results and updated outlook. Rod Smith : Thanks, Tom. Good morning. And thank you for joining today's call. As you saw in our press release, we had a strong second quarter reflecting a continuation of resilient demand for our diversified global portfolio, and solid operational execution across our organization. Before I walk through the details of our Q2 results, and revised full year outlook, I'll start with highlighting a few items from the quarter. First, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, raising approximately $2.7 billion in fixed rate debt through a combination of Euro and U.S. dollar denominated senior notes at a weighted average cost of 4.9%. As a result, we decreased our exposure to floating rate debt to approximately $6 billion or less than 15% of our total outstanding debt as of the end of the second quarter.  Next, the momentum experienced across our global business in Q1 continued into the second quarter with outperformance across new business, escalations and churn, resulting in another quarter of over 6% organic tenant billings growth, allowing us to raise our full year expectations across our Latin America, Europe, and Africa segments. We also had another strong quarter at CoreSite where elevated leasing volumes since our acquisition continued into Q2, and were further supported by solid pricing trends, high renewal rates, and interconnection growth of approximately 10%, which together with our tower business drove property revenue growth of over 4% in the quarter. Complementing top line growth, and as I highlighted last quarter, we are maintaining a strong focus on cost management. Once again in Q2, despite an elevated inflationary environment, we kept cash SG&A roughly flat year-over-year, helping to support an adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 60 basis points to 63.1% or over 100 basis points when normalizing for VIL reserves. Finally, we continue to engage in active discussions with a focused group of investors around the potential sale of a majority equity interest in our India business as we assess strategic options in the market, and exercise we anticipate completing in the second half of the year. As always, we will remain disciplined and patient with the goal of achieving the best outcome for American Tower and its shareholders. With that, please turn to Slide 6 and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, Q2 consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth was over 4% or over 6% on an FX neutral basis. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of over 5%, international growth of nearly 3%, or over 7%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and over 7% growth in our U.S. data center business. In the quarter we recognized approximately $35 million in revenue reserves associated with VIL short payments, as collection patterns in Q2 were relatively consistent with that of Q1. Moving to the right side of the slide, we achieved another strong quarter of organic tenant billings growth, which stood at 6.2% on a consolidated basis. In our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.1% and approximately 6.5% absent sprint related churn, including another quarter of elevated colocation and amendment growth contributions of nearly $60 million. Our international segment saw outperformance across nearly all reported segments, primarily due to a combination of higher than anticipated colocation and amendment growth and continued churn delays, resulting in organic tenant billings growth of 7.9% up from 7.5% in Q1. At a segment level, Africa, Europe, and APAC produce growth of 12.9%, 8.3%, and 5.6% respectively, each in acceleration off of Q1, with Africa representing a record for the region, APAC delivering its highest quarter since Q3 of 2017, and Europe demonstrating growth of over 575 basis points above its pre-Telsius [ph] average. In Latin America, we did see a modest deceleration of 5.4% as expected. Consistent with the last quarter, we continued to realize benefits associated with CPI linked escalators across the vast majority of our international markets while a continued delay in anticipated consolidation driven churn in Latin America has kept reported churn favorable to our initial expectations through the first half of the year.  Finally, strong leasing trends across our international business has driven an acceleration in colocation and amendment growth contributions across nearly all of our segments, resulting in an approximately 40 basis point improvement sequentially at a consolidated international level. Organic tenant billings growth was further complemented by the construction of more than 565 sites with virtually all of the step down relative to Q1 associated with India volumes, as we continue to prioritize capital deployments across our footprint to projects that demonstrate the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return. Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 5% to over $1.7 billion or approximately 6% on an FX-neutral basis for the quarter. As I mentioned, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 63.1% driven by elevated organic growth, combined with prudent cost controls throughout the business, which allowed for a conversion of over 85% of revenue to adjusted EBITDA growth, again, on a normalized VIL basis. Cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was around 6.8%, and over 20 basis point improvement compared to prior year. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share decreased by less than 1% and approximately 2%, respectively. This decline includes financing cost headwinds of approximately 7% and 9% against attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share growth, respectively, driven by the rise in interest rates over the past year. Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, as mentioned earlier, we had a solid second quarter, and the core performance of the business continues to remain strong supporting an increase to our expectations for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, attributable AFFO, and attributable AFFO per share. Next, consistent with our prior outlook, we have maintained our VIL revenue reserve assumption of $75 million for the year. As I noted, we saw similar collection trends in the second quarter as compared to Q1 bringing our year-to-date reserves associated with VIL to approximately $70 million. Subsequent to the quarter end, VIL made a full payment for July's billings and has committed to paying at least 100% of billings moving forward. In this case, we could potentially see some upside to our outlook assumption. However, we believe it is prudent to leave the full year assumption unchanged at this time.  Additionally, we have assumed lower U.S. services volumes through the balance of the year, resulting in an approximately $40 million reduction in gross margin as compared to our prior outlook. While the recent pullback was more abrupt than our initial expectations, moderation in carrier spend following the recent historic levels of activity we've seen in the industry isn't unexpected and is consistent with past network generation investment cycles. Despite this reduction, we're still seeing healthy levels of activity on our sites, which we expect to continue, and our guide still assumes over $40 million in services gross margin contribution in the back half of the year which on an annualized basis, is still in excess of any year throughout the 4G cycle. It is also important to note that although our services business is non-run rate, more susceptible to in-period carrier activity and cyclical in nature, our comprehensive MLAs continue to provide us with a high degree of visibility and contractual protection against activity variability in our 2023 property revenue and organic tenant billings guide, as well as the growth we've assumed in our long-term U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth target. Finally, on the macro side, we have revised our FX and interest assumptions. Starting with FX our revised outlook includes the negative impact associated with the recent devaluation in the Nigerian Naira with impacts partially mitigated through the USD denomination of roughly half of our tenant revenues in the market. This is further offset by the strengthening of other currencies in our portfolio, resulting in minimal FX impacts versus our prior outlook. On the interest side, our guidance reflects a modest increase to interest expense based on the updated forward curve estimates of SOFR, partially offset by interest income.  With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 8, we are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $125 million as compared to our prior outlook. Outperformance was driven by approximately $65 million in core property revenue supported by increases to the U.S. and Canada segment, which includes the benefits of several non-recurring onetime items along with our U.S. data center and international segments. Complementing our core upside, we're also increasing our outlook by another $60 million, primarily associated with straight line and pass-through revenue. Moving to Slide 9, we are increasing our expectations for organic tenant billings growth at a consolidated and international level. In the U.S. and Canada, we are maintaining our guidance of approximately 5% or over 6% excluding sprint churn, with an expectation for at least $220 million in colocation and amendment growth contributions. In Latin America, we have increased our outlook from greater than 2% to approximately 4%, largely driven by continued delays in anticipated consolidation-related churn. In Europe, we are raising our guidance to approximately 8%, up from 7% to 8% previously, supported by modest improvements in our escalator contributions, together with an expectation for colocation and amendment growth to be closer to the upper end of our initial 2% to 3% assumption as we continue to make operational progress in Germany on leasing up our rooftop assets. Next, we're increasing our Africa outlook from approximately 9% to greater than 11%, primarily due to a continuation of solid new business demand. Although we are pleased with the acceleration in organic tenant billings growth in APAC in Q2, we are maintaining our prior outlook of approximately 4% at this time. Moving on to Slide 10, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $75 million. This reflects the strong conversion of the incremental property revenue I just mentioned, facilitated through prudent cost controls resulting in an incremental $75 million in cash property gross margin, along with an additional $40 million, primarily due to straight line. This growth was partially offset by a reduction of $40 million associated with our U.S. services business.  Turning to Slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $25 million at the midpoint, representing approximately $0.05 on a per share basis moving the midpoint to $9.70 per share. Updates to our expectations include the cash adjusted EBITDA increase of $35 million, partially offset by approximately $10 million in other items, including the impacts of interest expense and also a slightly higher minority interest, which is the product of outperformance in our U.S. data center business.  Moving on to Slide 12, while our capital allocation plans remain consistent relative to our prior outlook, primarily consisting of $3 billion in common stock dividends, subject to Board approval and $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, I'd like to spend a moment to review our approach to ensure adequate capacity for our CoreSite business as we support an elevated backlog and expectations for continued future demand. On the left side of the slide, you see our plans continue to assume approximately $360 million in discretionary spend allocated to our U.S. data center business in 2023. This level of spend supports a high watermark of cash backlog, driven by the record levels of leasing since closing our acquisition at the end of 2021.  Similarly, our retail and scale backlog, excluding hyperscale, is also at record levels, demonstrating the strength of the core business and diversification of new leasing which we expect to drive incremental ecosystem value and a continuation of the industry-leading returns CoreSite has produced historically. The differentiated nature of the CoreSite assets, representing a network, cloud and digital platform rich interconnection hub, which in conjunction with large-scale, purpose-built adjacent capacity uniquely positions CoreSite to support the high-performance workloads of today and in the future including expected incremental AI capacity needs.  Combined with the favorable supply and demand dynamics we're seeing across the data center industry, we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to drive double-digit stabilized yields on our development investments, largely supported by the reinvestment of CoreSite's own cash flows with further support from American Tower and our partner, Stonepeak. In fact, our pre-leasing at the end of the quarter was approximately 36%, which further derisks our capital investments and illustrates the robust demand we're seeing across the space. While such demand drives the need for incremental investment, we are eager to support the business and realize the attractive rates of return CoreSite has historically proven, while remaining selective and disciplined in current and future development priorities and decisions. Moving to the right side of the slide, and as I mentioned earlier, we continue to execute on our financing initiatives in the quarter raising $2.7 billion in fixed rate debt, extending our average maturity to over six years while reducing our floating rate debt balance to below 15%. We also closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5.3 times ahead of our own deleveraging path towards our targeted range of 3 to 5 times. Moving forward, we'll remain opportunistic in potentially further accessing the debt capital markets to appropriately manage our investment-grade balance sheet. Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, our business continues to demonstrate resiliency and benefit from ongoing demand across our operations while effectively mitigating certain risks and variability through the strength of our customer agreements. Supported by a continuation and positive growth trends in Q2, we were able to increase the full year outlook midpoints across the majority of our key metrics, largely supported by core property outperformance across our tower and data center segments. We believe our global portfolio, strong balance sheet, best-in-class operating capabilities, disciplined approach to capital allocation, and keen focus to drive long-term efficiencies across our organization has American Tower well positioned to deliver strong, sustained growth in shareholder returns as we close 2023 and over the long term. With that, operator, we can open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to touch on the U.S. domestic leasing environment. We heard from one of your peers that carrier activity had slowed substantially during Q2. It looks like you're seeing a little bit of that in your service revenues, but I wanted to talk more about your organic tenant billings growth. Obviously, you reiterated the guide this year, but as we look beyond 2023, I know you have I think, 75% locked in into your long-term guide, but could it sustain slowdown in carrier activity, put that 5% number potentially at risk beyond 2023, maybe you could just walk through some of the puts and takes there? Rod Smith : Hey, Eric, good morning. And thanks for the question and thanks for joining the call. So as the other tower companies are experiencing the slowdown with the carrier spend, we're seeing that as well. You rightly point out, you see it mostly in the services revenue. So for us, you noticed we took our guide down from over $200 million down to about $175 million. In that process, we also were able to increase our margins and kind of mitigate some of that softness. The thing that I would point out there as it relates to services is the level of activity we see continuing into the back half of the year, even through the slowdown, it's still equal to or better than the high watermark of level of activity we experienced throughout the 4G cycle. So we still view the services business and activity levels as pretty healthy. And this is not inconsistent with what we've seen in other technology upgrades with the carriers to have an initial burst of spending they get their network upgraded on the new technology. Then you see a pullback in CAPEX and that sustained level of new CAPEX under the cycle is typically higher than the last cycle. And that's what we're seeing, that's what we expect. In terms of the longer-term guidance is you think the way that our comprehensive agreements are set up, we really are in very good shape we think, from now out to 2027. So I'll just remind you in terms of what our long-term guide was. We are seeing an average of about 5% organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. from now until 2027. And the slowdown does not change our view there because the vast majority of that is fully contracted. That includes the incremental impact of sprint churn. Without that, we'd be at about 6%. And again, we don't see that changing because this pullback or slowdown as described from carriers because of the way that our holistic or comprehensive agreements were. So that's kind of -- that's the strong nature of those comprehensive agreements that we have. It really does protect us from these fluctuations in spend from quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year. And within that guide, we do have 4% to 5% of activity base, new business kind of coming through. So I think from that perspective, we're in pretty good shape. Eric Luebchow : Great, thanks Rod. And just one follow-up. I wanted to touch on the data center business. Maybe you could give a little more color on the strength you've seen there. Is it coming from more of your traditional retail colocation requirements or are you starting to see increased demand for larger footprint deals perhaps tied to some of the AI demand we've heard about in the market with the cloud service providers, and I guess, given the demand backdrop, do you think that maybe CAPEX needs in that business might need to go up in future years or do you feel kind of comfortable with where you're at in terms of capital intensity with CoreSite? Tom Bartlett : Eric, maybe I'll start this one, and then Rod can finish on. I think the mix of customers has actually been pretty consistent across the cloud and enterprise and the network. I think as Rod mentioned in his prepared remarks, we see a kind of record levels of cash backlog that's contracted revenue that's going to hit a balance of this year and into 2024 and a little bit into 2025. We see a pipeline that's up roughly 70%. We see pricing and it's up 15% on a year-over-year basis. Even the renewal rate, the MLR [ph] renewal rates is up at the 7% level. So there is a significant demand for these assets. We have a significant amount under development and a significant amount in the pipeline. So we're really outpacing the way we even underwrote the transaction to begin with. So really pleased with what we're seeing across the data center platform. Rod Smith : Yes, Eric, maybe I would add just a couple of other comments to Tom's answer there. The overall growth that we're seeing in CoreSite is really healthy. We saw 10% overall revenue growth in Q1. We're seeing high single-digit growth in Q2. So you put that together for the first half and the revenue was up high single digits, which is really robust. We continue to see healthy escalators in that business. The cash mark-to-market is still up in our range, at the high end of our range, even beyond the 3% high end of the range. The churn is well controlled and within our range of 6% to 8%. Interconnection growth, we've always targeted 6% to 8%. We're seeing a higher level of growth than that today. So that's that ecosystem that we have kind of at work producing what we hope to produce. And then hitting the CAPEX part of your question, we've got $360 million this year in CAPEX, we had about $300 million last year. And we do think that's a good run rate. It will fluctuate from time to time, but the purpose for our CAPEX program, of course, is really to make sure that we have the adequate capacity available to satisfy the new business and the demand in the backlog. So you can see from the chart, we have an average backlog of about $53 million, which will be deployed over the next 18 to 24 months or so. So we are ensuring that we have that capacity available. So that $360 million really is going into the 28 locations we have, the campuses either adding buildings into those campuses or adding conditioned space within existing buildings to make sure that we're keeping pace with the demand that we see. And the demand is robust. So certainly, there's opportunities to deploy even a little bit more capital. We'll continue to evaluate the returns and the growth rates and those sorts of things. But all in, we're exceptionally pleased with the way the data center business is performing. And we do think staying in that between 300 to 360 in and around that area is the right place in terms of ensuring we have the capacity available to meet the demand in our current facilities. Eric Luebchow : Great, thank you for the questions. Operator : Next, we move to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Thank you very much. Good morning. Rod, I wanted to come back to the balance sheet if we could. Good updates on the floating rate debt and the leverage. You said in there, you want to continue to delever and I guess this also brings in Tom. You haven't done a lot of deals since the CoreSite deal. And I know you've been in this kind of focus on the balance sheet kind of period. So perhaps you just talk about what does -- where you want to get to on the leverage side of things and are you starting to think about being more opportunistic on the M&A side and maybe any commentary on the bid offer spreads, I know you talked about the India deal a little bit, but where do you see the opportunity to find things at a reasonable value, given the move in rates, etcetera? Thank you. Rod Smith : Yes. Good morning Simon, thanks for joining the call. Thanks for the question. So delevering is a priority for us. We've talked about that for quite a while. It comes in a couple of forms, outright in reducing overall debt, we're focused on that as well. Our target range is between 3 and 5 times. You saw that we ended Q2 at just over that at about 5.3 times. So a little outside that window. We want to get down below 5 times, and that's what we're really focused on going forward.  With that said, when we look at our capital program, our overall priorities haven't changed. We still prioritize the dividend and dividend growth so that's key. We see very good day one NOI yields and returns in the new build program. So this year, we're deploying about 1.7 billion in capital. We think that's a very good use of capital and resources for our shareholders. And then beyond that, when you look at M&A, as Tom has talked about in the past, in our pipeline today, we just don't see anything compelling. That's a combination of terms and conditions and markets where they're available in different criteria. So we look globally, we look at the pipeline, we continue to have a pipeline that we review. But again, nothing is compelling. So with that said, and in the specific environment where the rate -- the go-forward interest rate is still uncertain, we think it's very prudent to prioritize delevering and debt reduction. We think it's very prudent to reduce the amount of floating rate debt so we lock in our interest rates on a larger portion of our debt. So going forward, our target range is about 20% for floating rate debt. We've got that down to around 15%. And I think in Q3, you'll see us continue to be opportunistic depending on where the rates are in the U.S. and where the 10-year is in the U.S. and the benchmark over in Europe. You could see us back in the capital markets to reduce our exposure to floating rate debt even below the 15%. And you'll see us going forward this year and well into next prioritizing delevering and trying to get down below 5 times. Tom Bartlett : Yes, Simon, I think I'll just underscore. I think it comes back to what Rod's saying is that there's nothing strategic out there. There's nothing compelling. We find it much more advantageous to invest in our own business that is through deleveraging, that is through investing through our capital. That's through buying back shares, I mean, given where we're trading. So we find it much more valuable to allocate our capital that way at this point in time than anything we see out in the market. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you very much. Operator : And our next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just two on international. I guess, first on the churn expectations. I think, Rod, you had alluded to maybe some reduced expectations for churn at least this year in LatAm, just wondering if you can give us any updates in terms of the outlook, both for LatAm and Africa and whether the ultimate sort of churn expectations have been reduced or is this more of a deferral than anything else? And then secondarily, just on India, if you could maybe give us any additional color in terms of updates on discussions. You mentioned, I think, second half in terms of when you'd like to have the process completed, so any additional color would be great there? Thanks. Rod Smith : Hey Matt, good morning. Thanks for the question. So regarding the debt, the simple answer here is the -- some of the increases in our organic tenant billings for the balance of the year is really a delay in churn, not an expectation that churn is going to be materially lower over the long term. So, it's primarily in Latin America driven by the oi churn, which is delayed. So we do anticipate that to pick up later in the year in Q3 and Q4. And that oi churn is about 2% of our overall -- within our organic tenant billings growth, it's 200 basis points in that revised kind of view of that approximately 4%. So it really is a timing issue there. And then in Africa, it's pretty consistent. We're seeing some delays, but nothing too material, and it's not a change in terms of our overall long-term view in Africa. We're still looking at some churn in AirtelTigo in Ghana and Cell C is churning off some sites down in South Africa. So churn ends up being approximately 6% in the African market. And Latin America, it's about 6.5% kind of in total for the year. The other thing I would highlight is in Africa, we are seeing elevated levels of new business and activity. So we've been really pleased with that. So that's the churn piece. I guess jumping over to India, I'll just make a couple of comments on our process there. So as you know and as we've talked about in the past, we're fully engaged in a process in India. It started with a full evaluation of the market, particularly the future impacts of that market under different scenarios. And we're also evaluating potential uses of capital that we may take out of that market as a result of this process. We are -- we continue to focus and we're very engaged with a few remaining select investors. We're highly focused on selling a majority stake in that business anywhere, and I'll be kind of broad the process is continuing here, but anywhere from 50% to 100% stake sale. I don't want to talk about any more details than that. Of course, valuation is always important. Terms and conditions are always important. They are primary key considerations for us as we work through it. And I would say at the moment, we're happy with the progress that we've made to date. We've been working on it for quite some time. We are in the late stages of the process. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we do expect to complete a transaction sometime during the second half of this year. That's kind of what we're looking for. And our goal is to drive the best outcome for our shareholders through this process. We're going to remain very thoughtful, very disciplined, and very patient as we get through the final stages here. And we hope to update you all at some point soon in terms of the process and next steps here. But again, we're in late stages of the process. Matthew Niknam : Excellent, thank you. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. I was hoping to revisit some of the comments that you're providing around the carrier activity in the U.S. and specifically, is there a way to frame what changed relative to the carrier activity expectations that American Tower may have had earlier in the year for the full year 2023 and then given that customers under these comprehensive MLAs can execute a certain amount of capacity and if activity is less, does that mean they're not taking full advantage of the capacity they're paying for and then create some form of greater backlog of deployments that need to come through the system in the future? Tom Bartlett : Hey Michael, maybe I'll start and then Rod can kind of kick in. And the types of questions you're asking for, I think, are probably more appropriate for them. We've seen T-Mobile come out and say they're rolling out more carriers. We've seen Verizon talk about their deployment and looking for more mid-band and how that's going to drive kind of the second wave. But I think if you kind of step back, the pullback that we're seeing in spending today is absolutely reflective of the cadence of network investment cycles that we've seen historically. I mean you and I have both been around long enough to see most of them and meet all of them and how that cadence has progressed. And the 5G cycle is no different, at least from my perspective, than what we saw with prior cycles.  I mean it -- when we looked at our long-term growth expectations for U.S. and Canada in 2021, we had and had anticipated having those comprehensive MLAs in place. And so it's obviously kind of straight line what we are looking at in terms of our overall growth and protects from -- as we've talked about this kind of signed wave, if you will, of development. But the cycles typically progress as there's a coverage cycle. It's what we've seen in past cycles, including 3G and 4G. It's an initial multiyear period of elevated coverage CAPEX, and it's tied to new G spectrum aimed at upgrading the existing infrastructure. It's largely cost based. I mean the carriers are dropping in new technology to bring down their overall cost per bit as well as then positioning themselves to be able to offer their customers, their consumers and enterprise customers more technology and more capability. It's then followed by some grooming that will go on. And perhaps that's kind of the stage that we're starting to see ourselves in at this point in time.  And then later in the cycle, it will fill back into a capacity stage where we'll start to see more densification going on. And so when we think of kind of the services and the cadence, if you will, every time it is difficult to predict because the cycles from each of the customers are so different. As Rod said, the $175 million or so that we're looking to service, it is kind of the third -- largest on record. Last two years, we're up, I think, north of the $200 million range. But there still is a sizable year for our services business. So -- and our customers themselves are spending still record level versus where they were spending in 4G. So I know there's a lot of this anticipation of what's going on in 5G, why is this pull back and spend in 5G. I think we need to take a look at kind of a broader period of time here and saying, okay, our customers have deployed 5G to a large extent, they're continuing to deploy. We still do see obviously, services activity from all of them and we would expect to move through over the decade further levels of investment as they continue to drive more value for enterprises as well as then more value for consumers. So I'm hopeful that our investor base doesn't get spooked by the fact that this is a pullback. It's very consistent. The cadence is really spot on with what we've seen with other technologies. And we're going to -- we continue, as well as any of our customers do, heavily investments in the 5G networks over time. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : Next, we go to Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Richard Prentiss : Thanks, good morning everybody. A couple of questions to follow up on some of the ones we had. Thanks for the updates on India, but a few extra ones. Can you remind us again how much you spent in India, where is that on your books right now as we look to maybe a transaction getting wrapped up here, hopefully? Rod Smith : Yes, Rick, we've invested around $5 billion into the market. What we have on our books today is in the range of about $2.5 billion. Richard Prentiss : Okay. And earlier, I appreciate the color that India's Vodafone Idea looks like they're getting current and 100% going forward. At what point you thought you might take a stake on that receivable, is that kind of on pause as you go through wrapping up the strategic review, and did I hear you say you maybe have slowed down some of the builds in India, is that also related to kind of the process? Rod Smith : I guess on the first piece, when you say a stake in the receivables, you might be talking about the idea of converting some of the receivables with VIL into a different type of financial instrument. We have done that, Rick. So we've got about $200 million of prior receivables that we've converted into more of a financial note or a note receivable. So that is in place, and I think it will certainly work to our advantage over time. We are seeing a slowdown in terms of the new builds in India. And it is partly driven by our view, a higher cost of capital kind of reviewing pricing and our overall appetite to invest in the market. It doesn't mean that those new builds might not accelerate again if the opportunities come through with some higher pricing and higher returns. But the -- we're focused on driving the highest returns on the opportunities that we have to build. But we are seeing kind of a reduction there in India. And it's not because the overall demand is down. It's really we're being very disciplined and patient. And we're also continuing to build towers in Europe and Africa and a handful in Latin America. So in this environment, we're just being very selective and putting our capital towards the sites that give us the highest growth, the highest risk-adjusted rates of return going forward, and we balance that with our desire to delever and prioritize some capital towards delevering this year and into next. Richard Prentiss : Okay. And then you also mentioned delevering is a priority, makes sense. But that stock buyback might make sense in the future, particularly compared to M&A out there. What would be the timing to think about putting a plan in place and how low does leverage have to get maybe? Rod Smith : Yes. I would say, I mean, we want to be opportunistic there. But we're also -- we want to get down below 5 times. There's a combination of a couple of things, Rick. I think you want to watch where our leverage is getting down below 5 times. I've said in the past and we continue to be ahead of the delevering schedule with the rating agency. So from that perspective, where we sit today, we're very comfortable. We want to accelerate that delevering and get down below 5 times well ahead of the rating agency agreed plan because of the uncertainty around interest rates and the high cost of carrying debt these days as you've all experienced. So you want to watch kind of where our leverage goes and the closer we get to 5 times, the lower that overall leverage gets. And certainly, when it gets down below 5 times, we might hit a little bit more flexibility kind of in our capital allocation. The other thing that we are watching is the rate environment and where that goes, and when there will be a little less uncertainty around rates. And when they peak and begin to come down, we're not making any bets on when that will happen, but that will be something we continue to watch. And depending on how that unfolds, we may be able to prioritize buybacks sooner rather than later or maybe not if rates continue to stay high and this continued uncertainty. So we'll be watching both the rate environment here in the U.S. And as you know, we do a lot of borrowing in Euro denominated debt as well, and we'll be looking at our overall leverage. Hopefully, that helps. And of course, the share price is part of that as well. Richard Prentiss : Yup, it all makes sense, all the calculus that you look at. Great, thanks. Everyone stay well. Operator : Next, we go to Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks very much. On the CoreSite strength, Tom, you talked about positive renewal spreads and pricing. I wondered, is that happening as a result of like higher price list for cabinets and for cross connects, is that kind of a deliberate action you're taking on both new business and applying it to the base or if you can kind of tell us a little bit about the source of that strength? And then I wanted to ask about -- I think just real quick on DISH with their -- Dave Mayo retiring and then some of the uncertainty around that, how should we think broadly about U.S. leasing trends beyond this year just in a qualitative sense? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : I think relative to DISH, Dave has been a great partner of ours going forward as well as the entire business. So I'm sure while he will be missed I've got a great team in place there, Jonathan. So I don't think they're going to miss a beat. As I said, Dave is a great guy, really a great engineer, very, very technical and has been instrumental to driving the business. But they're a big business and like with ours. I mean, if we lost one person and that changed the direction of the business, that would be a sad thing. So they're a large institution, and I think they're well positioned and a good partner of ours. So I don't see any change there at all. With regard -- your first question, Jonathan, was? Jonathan Atkin : Yes, of course, a little bit more color around the CoreSite, the strength you are seeing? Tom Bartlett : Right, right. A lot of it is a function of our own pricing increase that we put in place. I mean looking at the market, looking at the demand, they were initiated by ourselves. The volumes are robust, as I said, the pricing is up 15% above first half of 2022. The funnel was healthy. As a matter of fact, on the funnel on the $54 million, I think 80% of it is actually retail and scale. So largely enterprise driven as opposed to even having a major piece driven by the scale. And on the 7%, historically, we've been in that 2% to 4% rate. So very pleased with the fact of those renewal rates being up significantly above where we've been historically. Jonathan Atkin : I think anything around innovation initiatives around EDGE data centers, things of that nature? Tom Bartlett : Yes. We have a number of projects going on within the business, candidly, Jonathan. No news to report. Working on several different pilots with potential customers. As I mentioned in the past, we have a number of sites that are -- have a significant ability to add capacity of power at each one of them. So still very early days, early innings of that. Hopeful that AI inferencing in particular, will drive even more of that need out at the customer prem. So we continue to explore, continue to work through a number of different pilots and projects, but nothing new to report at this point. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. Operator : Next, we go to Greg Williams with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Gregory Williams : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Just the first one would be on the cadence of your U.S. new leasing going forward. So you hit about 119 in new leasing in the first half of the year, and you're guiding 220 for the full year, that implies a notable step down to like $50 million mark per quarter in the next two quarters. But you did give yourself leg room by saying at least $220 million here in full guidance. So I'm just trying to understand how much of this is conservatism versus taking our estimates down to the low 50s? And just second question, in that new leasing are you seeing a lot of DoD spectrum or dual-band radio spectrum being deployed and if not, could we then see another leg of growth as these dual-band radios and DoD get scaled and ready to deploy? Rod Smith : Hey Greg, thanks for the question. Regarding the cadence here, I think you do want to plan for that lower 50 certainly by the time you get out to Q4. We'll see a slight deceleration from Q3 to Q4. So maybe you're up in the mid-50s and the low 50s by the time you get to Q4, but that's what we do expect and see in terms of the new business in the U.S. going forward. And it's very in line with kind of that 220, 220 plus sort of range. So we're certainly very happy with that, and it drives about a 5% new business growth contribution to that overall organic tenant balance growth.  And then in terms of the DoD and the spectrum, we're not seeing a lot of that. I'm not sure, Greg, if I would go out and say that, that upside is certainly not in the short term, if it would, it would probably be clearly small here this year. We wouldn't expect to see much of an impact. And to the extent that it is deployed later some of that may be within our holistic agreements as well with certain carriers. Gregory Williams : Got it, thank you. Rod Smith : You are welcome. Operator : And our next question is from Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great, thank you. A couple of follow-ups. First, how do you think about your current scale in the data center business against the growing demand that you're experiencing? And on the services side, you did mention that there was an abrupt slowdown in carrier activity. Was that across the board or specific to one or two clients and do you provide the split for installation versus maybe managed services and one of your peers is getting out of the installation business, how do you think about that? Thank you. Rod Smith : Hey Batya, good morning. Thanks for joining the call. I think when you think about data centers, we're happy with the scale that we have. We've got great facilities, 28 facilities across really eight key markets. Their eco -- the ecosystem there is very rich with cloud on-ramps and network companies and enterprise customers. And it really gives us kind of the backdrop and the footprint that we need. And we're not seeing any headwinds because of a lack of scale. So all the great financial results that we're seeing, we're able to do it, because of the quality of the ecosystem and the way that these facilities are distributed throughout the U.S. So from that perspective, we feel really good with our data center investment to date. Now certainly, adding a location here or there, you've seen us do that a little bit even before we bought CoreSite. That certainly could be in the cards going forward. But we really do like the assets we have. We're not overly focused on trying to ramp up the scale as we've talked about in the past. When it comes to services, I would say we are seeing a slowdown -- it's -- I don't know if abrupt is the right word to use there, but we did see kind of a slowdown. I wouldn't say that it's across the board. I don't want to get into specific carrier by carrier, of course. But some carriers continue to plug right along and others have slowed down a little bit. Again, it's not unexpected from our view. When it comes to the final part of your question, in terms of the construction services, that's always been a pretty small part of our business. We've been maybe a little different than some of our competitors from that perspective. It is a small piece and it continues to be a small piece of our business. Most of what we do is in the permitting zoning engineering kind of those preconstruction activities. We do some construction services and deployment but not a lot. Batya Levi : Got it. Thank you. Rod Smith : You are welcome. Operator : And our last question will come from Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow-up on the grooming comment that you made earlier. Does that typically last for just a few quarters or is that something longer? And then I have one more. Tom Bartlett : Yes. I mean, it depends -- it will be depending on the carrier, on the customer themselves. Typically, as we've said in the past, I mean, things happen in the form of sign ways. We see heavy build, then we'll see a lighter build as it gets filled. I mean the carriers aren't going to be spending the money ahead of time until they see the network demand. And so there will be certain locations, certain geographies, urban parts of the market, mortgage and is more of the suburban, where you can see shorter cycles on the grooming side. So it really depends on the customer. And it's -- you can't really come up with a kind of an average, if you will, overall. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then on the expense side, are you seeing any pressure in the domestic business on ground lease renegotiations on renewals, given where CPI or inflation is? Rod Smith : No, Richard, I would say we're really not. I mean we have long-term leases on the vast majority of these sites. We either own or have 20-year leases on more than 70% of our sites approaching 75%. So we're in good shape from that perspective. And we do a lot of work well ahead of expirations of the ground leases to renew these things and kind of move the exploration data out or buy the land through our capital program. So we don't see and we're really not exposed to any short-term significant spikes in land rent because of an inflationary environment. On average, our land goes up in line with our revenue in that 3%, 3% to 4% range. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Rod Smith : You are welcome. Operator : I'll now turn the conference back to the leadership team for closing comments. Adam Smith : Thanks, everyone for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to myself or the Investor Relations team with any further questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2023 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. And my focus for today's call will be on the technology trends and network investments that drive demand for our leading tower and data center platforms as well as the developments we're seeing at the edge. While my comments will largely be focused on the 5G evolution and the progress we're seeing in the United States, we believe similar trends will prevail across our international footprint as they have historically. Beginning with our macro tower business, the fundamental factor that drives demand for our global power portfolio, growth in mobile data consumption continues unabated. This is true both in the United States and across the globe, where mobile network data traffic has almost doubled over the last two years alone to a staggering 126 exabytes per month. Looking out over the next five years, forecasted growth in data traffic per device remains compelling as more spectrum for 5G networks will be deployed at scale. Average monthly data usage per smartphone across our key developed markets like the U.S., Germany and Spain is expected to grow at a healthy compounded annual rate of 18% between 2023 and 2028. And I would note that these estimates have been somewhat conservative historically. So let's spend a moment on where we are in the 5G investment cycle in the U.S. and where we believe we're going over the next several years. Just as we saw with the 3G and 4G rollouts, we expect the 5G investment cycle to play out in three phases that represent discrete business cases for the carriers and these three phases will drive two peak periods of spend that are bridged by a temporary phase of more moderate activity. The first phase is coverage-driven and aimed at upgrading existing infrastructure with new spectrum bands and radio technology, its competition to provide broad nationwide coverage with the new G ramps up. At the same time, carriers are looking to realize the efficiency benefits of their investments in new software, hardware and upgraded user devices. Initial equipment upgrades and new spectrum deployment quickly deliver reduced cost per gigabyte resulting in the ability to maintain margin profiles. Absent this migration, any incremental investments in the prior generation would be expected to result in significantly diminished returns as the additional densification required to sustain increasing network traffic on existing spectrum bands would be cost prohibitive. As the cadence of initial coverage investments begin to moderate from record spend of over $40 billion in 2022, the first peak of the 5G cycle, we retain a high degree of conviction that there's a long tail of network investment to come. This belief is predicated on several factors, including our experience with past investment cycles, industry forecast for growth in mobile data consumption that apply a necessity for significant incremental coverage and capacity and the visibility into network needs, we get through our contract structures. Today, Phase 1 of the 5G rollout is winding down and we're heading into a second phase. We expect Phase 2 to be characterized by carriers beginning to harvest the network efficiency benefits of their initial investments, while moderating spend from the record levels of 2022 to roughly $35 billion in 2023, which is $5 billion in excess of 4G averages, representing the second highest level of annual spend on record. In this next phase, we will begin to see a seeping in of 5G technology across the wireless and enterprise landscape. For example, 5G smartphone penetration has now surpassed the 50% mark in North America, which will ultimately allow for the majority of network traffic to shift over to 5G networks which we would expect to occur in the 2025 time frame. We're also looking forward to the emergence of more ubiquitous accessibility of stand-alone 5G core networks, which will unlock improved 5G network quality, higher speeds and lower latency and provide a platform for the development of innovative services and consumer applications. Finally, we anticipate that the arrival of end-to-end 5G capabilities will facilitate additional monetization opportunities at the enterprise level through use cases like private networks, network slicing and other IoT services that are beginning to emerge today. Ultimately, these dynamics will culminate in a third capacity focused phase aimed at significant densification of 5G networks. We continue to believe that 5G will advance and enable the next generation of mass market consumer use cases, particularly once 3GPP-released 17 and 18 are in the market, coupled with 5G cores that provide the true benefits of the end-to-end technology upgrade at scale. That said, meeting industry forecasts for growth in mobile data consumption that will drive the need for substantial network capacity investments seems highly achievable when taking into account the technology we have at our fingertips today. In fact, industry estimates already show that 5G subscribers are consuming 2 times to 3 times more mobile data than the average 4G subscriber. So let's take the case of mobile video consumption, which has consistently shown to be a dominant use case across subscriber usage types. As you can see on Slide 6, today the average smartphone subscriber in North America utilizes roughly 21 gigabytes of mobile data per month, and this is expected to grow to about 48 gigabytes by 2028. Of the 21 gigabytes consumed today, the majority or approximately 19 gigabytes are attributed to video streaming, which corresponds to a little over an hour of daily video usage and 360 and 480 pixel videos currently make up around half of that time. So by simply assuming a modest level of incremental usage towards higher resolution streaming such as 8 minutes of 4K Ultra HD, we would see video consumption alone drive usage to the forecasted 48 gigabytes per month or approximately 2.3 times the current rate. Furthermore, the data already shows that 5G is driving increased usage of higher resolution video formats. A recent report from Ericsson found that since 2021, 5G users report a nearly 50% increase in time spent on enhanced video formats. For example, among that user base, usage of new video formats like 360 degree videos and multi-view streaming have increased by an average of 10 minutes and 15 minutes per day, respectively, while time spent streaming videos and standard resolution has decreased by 23 minutes over the same period. In short, we've already seen 5G adoption linked with a shift in behavior towards using more data intensive applications, a trend we firmly believe will continue going forward. And while we remain confident that new low latency, high bandwidth consumer applications will be born as 5G standalone networks are deployed at scale, we see a highly tangible case for densification requirements from where we stand today. With that, I'll briefly provide an update on CoreSite in our data center segment before shifting to the progress we're making at the edge. The case remains that demand in CoreSite's interconnection centric business is exceeding our initial expectations. Our teams delivered record signed new business in 2022, a record we are targeting to exceed in 2023. We've also seen consistent elevated growth in interconnection revenue, mark-to-market pricing increases that exceed our historical averages, low churn and ongoing performance that we believe positions us to deliver compelling results in the segment for many years to come. And much like we see in our tower business, the secular trends that underpin the business model like the migration of workloads from on-prem to hybrid multi-cloud environments and the emergence of AI use cases that will drive more demand in our ecosystem continue on a path toward long-term acceleration. For example, findings from our recent 2023 state of the data center report showed that 94% of IT leaders noted that native direct connection between co-location data centers, major cloud providers, which CoreSite provides is essential for improved performance, enhanced security, cost savings and hybrid cloud connectivity. Further, 92% of IT leaders are considering moving critical workloads from public cloud to colocation to accelerate revenue growth and support the increasing need for AI and machine learning applications. In this context, we continue to upgrade our offerings and capabilities within the business to support emerging use cases. For example, earlier this month, we launched new capabilities on our OCX, our pioneering software defined networking platform, enabling clients to rapidly create higher bandwidth virtual connections to Google Cloud and AWS Direct Connect and between CoreSite data centers, including 50 gigabit services. These upgrades reduce the time required for organizations to augment network capacity to support high bandwidth, low latency hybrid applications like AI, machine learning and digital media production. When it comes to current and future AI and machine learning applications, CoreSite's flexible, purpose-built design data centers position us to host power-intensive GPU services being used for AI and ML use cases. For example, we're already providing GPU capacity for applications like 3D visualization and rendering and for software development with a niche cloud environment. And for the densest AI applications, our purpose built facilities are designed to accommodate liquid cooling with modest development efforts when required. As we've stated previously, in the near term, we continue to believe the majority of today's generative AI workloads will provide hyperscale opportunities that don't meet our investment criteria or fit within the CoreSite ecosystem. However, as GEN AI evolves, we would expect the balance of workloads to shift from large language model development, intensive training and public prompts to specialized inference-based use cases as productivity gains from the deployment of custom models accelerates. At this stage, when low latency interconnection high power density and distributed high performance compute become the priorities, we believe CoreSite and ultimately, our distributed portfolio of franchise real estate assets across the U.S. are going to be optimally positioned to benefit. On that note, we've continued to see progress toward the realization of demand cases that support our initial edge thesis, and we believe we have an opportunity to enable a more efficient exchange of network traffic and support cloud services and peering in a more distributed manner. As a result, we've been working both internally and with external stakeholders to develop an edge model we can execute on as compelling opportunities present themselves. In our initial assumption that through CoreSite, our seat at the table and visibility into the customer demand environment would be materially enhanced is holding true. We're increasingly seeing interest from potential customers looking to extend technologies such as private cloud computing AI and 5G applications closer to the end device through a more distributed architecture. This is resulting from several key demand cases including availability of future power requirements, business efficiency, revenue generation opportunities and customer experience. When it comes to power, CoreSite has secured significant future power availability and is insulated from expected shortages in markets like Northern Virginia. However, power constraints in general are increasingly in focus in legacy data center markets. In this case, we believe our distributed land footprint in Tier 2 and 3 markets with significant power availability and capability to connect back to CoreSite campuses can serve more distributed power capacity needs, while enabling customers to enjoy the interconnection benefits of the CoreSite ecosystem. And as potential customers increasingly focus on new revenue opportunities and customer experience including through the proliferation of applications like next-generation gaming, AR and devices and wearables that leverage interactive AI, we believe we have a compelling combination of distributed points of presence and interconnection capabilities that can be extended to a broader edge. In addition, by prioritizing our existing owned real estate, which in many cases is already designated for use as digital infrastructure, we see an opportunity to drive a significant time to market advantage and reduce overall development costs, which could be compelling to customers and enhance returns on investment. As a result of these factors, we continue to work towards establishing a repeatable, rapidly deployable design with initial capacity in the 1 megawatt range, which could then be scalable to incremental megawatts with interconnection to multisite campuses as demand dictates. As always, we'll assess potential growth at the edge through the prism of our disciplined capital allocation framework committing capital only if the opportunity meets our investment criteria and aligns with our long-term strategic vision of growing our interconnection ecosystem in a way that maximizes shareholder value. In closing, the bottom line is that we remain at the relatively early stages of a 5G and network technology evolution that we believe will necessitate continuous incremental investment in existing infrastructure like towers, data centers and distributed edge infrastructure. We also believe that ongoing technology developments will unlock new capabilities that will drive the next wave of innovative and data intensive consumer and enterprise devices and applications. And American Tower, with its leading tower portfolio and real estate footprint combined with a highly interconnected data center ecosystem is in a truly differentiated position to serve the network infrastructure needs of the future. Before I hand the call over to Rod, I'd like to close my remarks by congratulating Steve Vondran, who effective November 1 will hold the role of Global Chief Operating Officer until February 1 of next year, at which point he'll transition to the position of Chief Executive Officer; and Bud Noel, who will become our new Executive Vice President and President of our U.S. Tower Division. The Board and I have worked diligently on succession planning weighing the merits of an external search against the talent we have within our organization. Steve joined American Tower in 2000 and currently serves as the Executive Vice President of our U.S. and Canada business, including both towers and data centers. For the past 23 years, Steve has been instrumental to the growth and sustainability of earnings from American Tower and has built tremendous credibility with our global organization his peers, the Board of Directors, the American Tower investor base and our customers. All this to say, Steve is a clear candidate to lead American Tower in its next growth phase. And over the next several months, I'll work closely with Steve, the executive leadership team and the Board to ensure a seamless transition. Lastly, I want to thank all of the incredible American Tower employees around the world both past and present, our customers and investors for their support and confidence you've demonstrated since I joined in 2009. Although, this is a difficult decision on my part, I look forward to the time ahead with family and friends and new challenges, while watching the company under Steve's leadership continue to succeed. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rod to review our latest results and updated outlook. Rod? Rod Smith : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. In Q3, we continued our trend of strong performance, driven by solid demand for our diverse global portfolio of assets. Against the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we remain focused on delivering results and creating value by driving organic growth across our existing portfolio and demonstrating global operational efficiency and cost management in support of attractive margin expansion. At the same time, we are committed to strengthening our balance sheet by enhancing our liquidity extending our maturities, reducing floating rate debt volatility and making progress towards our leverage target. These efforts coupled with the evolving technological trends highlighted by Tom, remain key drivers of our current performance and give us confidence in our ability to drive sustained growth over the long term. Before delving into the specifics of our Q3 results and raised outlook, let me touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, we saw a continuation of solid trends across our global operations, driving consolidated property revenue growth of 7%, consolidated organic tenant billings growth in our tower business exceeded 6% for the third consecutive quarter and was complemented by over 9% revenue growth in our data center business. As a result of this strong performance and visibility extending through the end of 2023, we raised our full year expectations across nearly all segments, which I'll discuss in more detail later. Next, our keen focus on cost management resulted in conversion rates exceeding 100% and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of roughly 290 basis points year-over-year and still over 215 basis points when normalized for the prior year VIL revenue reserves, complementing our operational efforts. On the balance sheet side, we raised $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of approximately 5.9% by utilizing the proceeds to pay down revolver balances, we reduced our floating rate debt exposure to approximately $4 billion or less than 11% of our total outstanding debt as of the end of the third quarter down from over 22% at the start of the year. Finally, we're making significant progress on the strategic review of our India business. As we are in the final stages of this process, we remain committed to communicating the outcome to our shareholders before the end of the year, consistent with our past messaging. In Q3, we recorded $322 million in goodwill impairment charges associated with our India business. This was prompted by indications of value obtained through the process conducted over the past several months, supported by our own interim goodwill impairment test. We believe this impairment accurately reflects the current market conditions, evolving risk premiums associated with operating in the India market and more generally increases in the cost of capital. With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, consolidated property revenue growth was 7% or 8% on an FX neutral basis. U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was over 5%, which includes a nearly 2% headwind associated with a reduction in straight-line revenue, offset by timing benefits associated with certain non-recurring one-time items in the quarter. International growth was nearly 9% or approximately 11% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, which included a 4% benefit associated with the full collection of VIL billings in India in the quarter, as compared to the approximately $48 million revenue reserve in the prior year. Finally, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, our data center business revenue increased by over 9% and continues to demonstrate solid outperformance as compared to our initial underwriting plan. As Tom mentioned earlier, we anticipate 2023 to again break the signed new business record just set in 2022, setting up CoreSite to drive sustained attractive levels of growth as the backlog of new business commences over the next several years. Moving to the right side of the slide. Strong performance across each of our segments drove consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 6.3%. Within our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.3% and greater than 6.5% absent sprint related churn, including another quarter of colocation and amendment contributions of nearly $60 million. Our International segment saw outperformance across nearly all reported segments, primarily driven by higher new business in Africa and churn delays in Latin America and APAC resulting in organic tenant billings growth of 7.9%. Turning to Slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 10% to $1.8 billion for the quarter or approximately 11% on an FX neutral basis. As I highlighted in my opening remarks, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 64.4%, a 290 basis point improvement compared to the previous year, primarily driven by solid organic growth, effective cost management throughout the business and the one-time revenue items I mentioned. In fact, despite the current inflationary environment, we have managed to maintain a relatively flat year-over-year cash SG&A profile remaining consistent with the themes from the first half of the year, with cash SG&A as a percent of property revenue standing at approximately 6.5% for the quarter, a nearly 70 basis point improvement versus Q3 of 2022. Moving to the right side of the slide. Attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share each increased by over 9%, driven by solid cash adjusted EBITDA growth partially offset by an approximately 5% headwind from financing costs. Now shifting focus to our revised full year outlook. I'll start by highlighting a few key items. First, as a result of our strong performance in the third quarter and the momentum taking us through the end of the year, we've raised our guidance for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share. Next, our revised outlook includes a reduction in U.S. services, resulting in a $20 million decrease in gross margin compared to our previous expectations for the year. As we've highlighted in the past, although, quarter-to-quarter variations in tower leasing activity have impacted our services revenue in 2023, our leasing revenue remains unaffected, underpinned by the comprehensive master lease agreements currently in place. Finally, the updated midpoints include revised FX assumptions that have resulted in outlook to outlook headwinds of approximately $28 million for property revenue, $14 million for adjusted EBITDA and $5 million for attributable AFFO. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 10. We are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $60 million as compared to our prior outlook. Our revised expectations are driven by $31 million in core property revenue outperformance, along with approximately $45 million and $12 million in additional pass-through and straight-line revenues, respectively. Our revised guidance includes $10 million in outperformance associated with VIL collections with roughly half included in our core property revenue and the balance in the pass-through outperformance illustrated. Growth was partially offset by $28 million of negative FX impacts. Turning to Slide 11. We are increasing our expectations for organic tenant billings growth across nearly all segments. In the U.S. and Canada, we are increasing our guidance to greater than 5% or approximately 6.5% excluding Sprint churn, now with an expectation for approximately $230 million in colocation and amendment growth contributions. Growth is further benefiting from non-Sprint related churn delays, which we now anticipate occurring in 2024. In Latin America, we have increased our outlook from approximately 4% up now to approximately 5%, largely driven by continued delays in anticipated consolidation-related churn. Next, we're increasing our Africa outlook from greater than 11% to approximately 12%, primarily due to a continued uptick in colocation and amendment demand. In APAC, we are increasing our guidance from approximately 4% to about 5% supported by a combination of strong new business in delayed churn. Moving on to Slide 12. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $60 million. This reflects the strong conversion of the incremental property revenue highlighted earlier, coupled with prudent cost controls, resulting in an incremental $67 million in cash property gross margin outperformance along with an additional $14 million in cash, SG&A savings and $30 million of straight line. This growth was partially offset by a reduction of $20 million associated with our U.S. services business and a negative FX impact of $14 million. Turning to Slide 13. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $40 million at the midpoint or approximately $0.09 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.79 per share. Our performance was driven by the cash adjusted EBITDA increase of $61 million partially offset by $16 million of other items, including an acceleration of certain maintenance projects in cash taxes, along with incremental minority interest due to outperformance in our JV businesses, partially offset by improvements to net interest. As I noted earlier, FX caused a headwind of approximately $5 million. Moving on to Slide 14. Let's review our capital allocation plans for the full year. Consistent with the expectations set at the beginning of the year, we are planning to distribute approximately $3 billion in common stock dividends which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 10% on a per share basis, subject to board approval. Our full year CapEx spend also remains consistent at $1.7 billion with the acceleration of certain non-discretionary projects that I mentioned earlier, offset by lower discretionary spend, which includes a reduction in development CapEx associated with lower anticipated new build volumes. As always, our goal is to execute a capital deployment strategy that maximizes total shareholder returns. In line with my earlier remarks, we're focused on creating incremental value through solid organic growth and quality of earnings optimizing global operational efficiency and expanding cash margins, all while strengthening our financial position by further reducing balance sheet risk and enhancing financial flexibility. As it relates to capital allocation and against the current economic backdrop, we believe it's optimal to prioritize balance sheet strength and keep discretionary spend focused on select capital expenditure projects that yield the best risk-adjusted returns and quality of earnings. Additionally, decoupled from our current line of sight to its attributable AFFO growth for next year, we anticipate maintaining a dividend per share profile in 2024 that closely aligns with our 2023 expectation of $6.45 per share resuming growth in a manner supportive of our REIT taxable income thereafter, all subject to Board approval. By focusing on the above priorities, we believe American Tower is positioned for sustained and compelling total shareholder returns supported through balance sheet strength over the long term. Consistent with our historical practice, we'll discuss our 2024 plans in more detail on our next earnings call. Moving to the right side of the slide and as highlighted earlier, as a result of the successful execution of our financing initiatives in the third quarter, we reduced our floating rate debt balance to below 11%, increased our liquidity to $9.7 billion, and our average maturity remains over six years. We closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5 times, which benefits from certain non-recurring items in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect to close the year slightly above 5 times. Moving forward, we'll remain opportunistic and potentially further accessing the debt capital markets, ensuring continued strength in our balance sheet, reducing risk and enhancing our financial flexibility. Turning to Slide 15, and in summary, our diverse portfolio of global communications assets continue to demonstrate resiliency in the face of a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, producing attractive growth through organic leasing, further amplified by exceptional cost management at the margin. Complementing our operational performance, we continue to make progress in strengthening and de-risking our balance sheet. Furthermore, we remain committed to managing our capital structure, sources and uses and capital allocation priorities in a manner that positions American Tower to drive sustained attractive returns for our shareholders over the long term. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Tom, all the best for the future. It's been great working with you over the years, even back to the Verizon use of cell days. And Steve, congratulations and best of luck in the new role. If we could come back to the capital allocation please. The comments around the dividend and perhaps, Rod, you could just talk about target leverage? Are you thinking about bringing leverage down more aggressively given the rate environment and the uncertain macro environment? Just any color around that would be great or any other drivers of the dividend decision? And perhaps how are you thinking about M&A more broadly outside of the India process that you referenced earlier. There's a big gap here between public and private markets. Any opportunities there that you see? And what about buybacks? Is that something that could come into your toolbox in the coming quarters here? Thank you. Rod Smith : Yeah. Simon, good morning. Thanks for joining. I'll hit the leverage piece first, and then Tom will address the dividend more broadly. When you think about the leverage, we've been a little bit higher than our stated range. We've been up in the 5, 3 range. We did end this quarter at around 5.0 that was benefited from some non-recurring one-time revenue items. So we do expect that to tick back up towards the end of this year. And we expect to end this year, again, higher than our stated range of 3 to 5 times up in the 5.2%, 5.3% range. It is a priority of ours to bring that leverage down, along with driving organic growth operational efficiency, expanding margins, controlling the SG&A in the -- and ultimately, the AFFO and AFFO growth that we can drive. So the target is to get to 5.0 as soon as we can. We'll be working through that diligently next year. And a lot of these operational objectives around organic growth and driving AFFO as well as capital allocation, our capital plan, specifically you'll see a reduction -- you've seen a reduction in our capital plans this year versus last year. And that, again, is all in line with trying to drive down leverage and strengthen our balance sheet. We do think those are important steps to take to drive total shareholder return in the short term and the long term. So that's what it's really all about the dividend holding it flat next year is in line with that. I mean, I'll say, we believe that's the best use of capital in terms of strengthening the balance sheet in this time of uncertain rates. When it comes to M&A, we continue to not see compelling M&A opportunities in our pipeline. So it's not something that's hitting our radar screen in terms of capital allocation this year and we turn the corner into next year. Then I'll turn it over to Tom to hit and a little bit more directly. Tom Bartlett : First of all, Simon, thanks for your kind words. But maybe with regards to the dividend, it's important just to just take a step back and understand how we really manage this dividend growth. Since we became a REIT over a decade ago back in 2012, we've always looked to complement AFFO growth with a compelling yield, which we've grown, as you all know, around 20% annually as compared to our AFFO per share growth, which has been closer to 10% over that same time period. We've aligned our distribution with REIT taxable income, as you would expect. And within REIT AI you do have a recurring run rate and more of one-time buckets, consistent of things like earnings and profits, settlements, throwbacks NOLs, which we used last decade, much of which is discretionary in the planning that are absolutely separate from AFFO. And these tools allow us for to manage a more predictable glide path on our dividend. So here we are in 2023, we're committed to a 10% dividend growth rate which, like other years, consisted of certain one-time items to manage the dividend path and ensure alignment between our distribution and REIT AI. And so although our recurring REIT AI bucket was negatively impacted by interest rates, we utilize certain one-time items to manage towards the distribution. And absent those items, like most years, we'd be overdistributed. So as we look ahead to '24, we see an opportunity to accelerate our glide path and reset REIT AI closer to the run rate, which means temporarily relatively flat dividends per share in '24 decoupled from our expectations for AFFO growth based on our line of sight today. So our priorities that Rod just laid out really remain on maximizing our total shareholder returns. And we see the optimal path to do so, really centered around strengthening and de-risking our balance sheet, which means, in part, reducing our debt balance and advancing our pathway to sub 5 times net leverage and with that, more financial flexibility. And we view the levers to accelerate this path through maximizing organic growth, reducing our cost base as we've done in '23 and will continue to do in '24 with disciplined capital allocation that Rod just referred to, together with managing the dividend in a relatively flat basis before resuming growth in line with our recurring REIT AI thereafter. So this isn't a decision we take lightly, as you would expect. But given the current macro volatility, we believe that the balance sheet strength and accelerating financial flexibility for future opportunities, which could include buybacks is the optimal approach from where we sit today. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a sense, at least in terms of how we're thinking about it and how it fits into our overall plans for creating value long term. Simon Flannery : Right. Yeah. That's very helpful. So just to be clear, the hope would be to resume dividend growth in '25 or into 25? Tom Bartlett : Yes. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank a lot. Operator : And next, we go to Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thank and good morning. And Tom, I also want to express my thanks and best wishes for your upcoming retirement. Congratulations to Steve on your upcoming transition to the CEO role. Just a couple of questions for me. -- You're welcome. And again, thank you, it's both at Verizon and at AMP. We've been working... Tom Bartlett : We got a long answer. My hairline has received more than years Michael Rollins : So a couple of things. So first, on activity levels in the domestic business. Curious, if you could just go deeper into what you're seeing as you're looking at the balance of this year and what it means for next year in terms of how that domestic business can grow relative to the long-term annual targets that you set for that business? And if you can -- within that context, also unpack the delays that you're seeing in Sprint related churn and what that means for that decommissioning pace as we look forward? Thanks. Rod Smith : Sure. I'll take that one. So we're not going to give specific guidance for 2024 at this time, obviously. And I don't want to get into specific care activity levels because I want to leave it to them to talk about the rollout plans. But in general, we have seen activity levels moderate over the last several months from the recent highs. However, the visibility that we have into a baseline level of contractually guaranteed growth through these comprehensive MLAs allow us to reiterate our expectation that we're going to achieve an average annual OTBG growth rate of at least 5% in the U.S. and Canada segment between 2023 and 2027. And despite some of the concerns that people have in the market over the recent moderation we have visibility into a level of organic growth in 2024 that's supportive of that average. Now having said that, I want to break down the components a little bit, we do not have visibility into another year of $230 million growth from colocation and amendment activity. That's far away a record from American Tower. But we balance that with an expectation for some moderation in churn following 2023, excluding Sprint. Our MLAs do provide us visibility into a level of colocation and movement contributions that exceeds the average we've seen over the past several years. And again, it's supportive of that at least 5% average OTBG that we've guided to between 2023 and 2027. And to reiterate on our Sprint churn, the annual impacts of our Sprint churn have been $195 million in 2021, $60 million in 2022, and $50 million in 2023 and $70 million in 2024 for a total of $375 million. So we're past the peak of that churn, and there's no change to that cadence versus our prior guidance in that respect. Tom Bartlett : And Mike, I would just add just to make it clear, the delays in churn that we're seeing in the U.S. is not Sprint related. It's other items that we were planning that could be moved out a bit, as Steve is saying the Sprint cadence has not changed. And when you think about next year 2024 in our long-term guide, it's unlikely that there's going to be material upside based on where we sit today. We do think there's potential for upside in the longer-term growth rates, but that would probably come in '26 and '27 and down the line, not necessarily in '24. Michael Rollins : Thanks. And just one quick one, what's the percent that you're seeing in terms of the mid-band upgrades, the percent of sites that have been upgraded for mid-band already versus the amount that might be remaining? Rod Smith : It\u2019s a little over half at this point. Michael Rollins : Thank you. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Michael. Operator : And next, we can go to David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions and let me echo Tom, the years we've spent together. It's been great and congrats to Budd and Steve on the new roles. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Dave. David Barden : So I guess, if I could start, just maybe more on the finance side, Rod. Slide 11, you talked about some of the increases we're seeing in some of the non-U.S. regions. Could you break that down into kind of core organic leasing and then some of the inflation driven escalators? And so is this real growth that we're seeing that could be sustained or is it more of an inflation driven bubble that we need to kind of be conscious of that might reverse? And then second, just on the India situation with the write-down, I think the tactic acknowledgment that maybe some of the loftier valuation ambitions were not there. I guess we're all sitting here trying to figure out what kind of dilution we should be baking into 2024? The latest press reports that India suggested kind of a $2 billion valuation, something like a 5 times EBITDA multiple. Obviously, it depends on kind of how big a stake you sell and when you sell it. But is there any kind of more color you can shed on the shape of what kind of dilution expectation we should be thinking about for '24? Thank you. Rod Smith : Yeah, David. So let me hit the first part of your question. I think I missed a little bit of the second, so I may ask you to repeat that. But when you think about the upside in terms of the growth rates, let me hit it by addressing the organic tenant billings piece first-off. So we are seeing increases in organic tenant billings really across the board. So you can see in the charts, they were increasing our overall organic tenant billings for the company to about 6%, that's up about 50 basis points from prior. And that kind of -- that theme is consistent across many of the regions. So as Steve just highlighted in the U.S., we're bringing that guide to beyond 5% from what was previously around 5%. International is coming up to greater than 7%. Prior, we were at greater than 6.5%. And then you look at the different parts of the company region by region, LatAm is going up to about 5% versus what was previously a 4%. APAC is coming up to about 5%. Previously, it was 4%. Europe was staying around where it was at 8%. And then Africa is also coming up to around 12% from what was prior higher than 11%. A couple of things that I would say, in terms of the stay ability or the durability of some of that growth, certainly, in the U.S., it's nice strong performance. There is a little bit of delayed churn, so we can expect to see that hit next year. Other than that, the U.S. is very steady in terms of the demand. Part of that is because of the way the contracts we have work out. When you think of Latin America, we do have higher levels of churn this year than we have had in prior years. Some of the outperformance is churn driven. So when you think about the LatAm over performance, it's really a delay in churn and probably not all that durable from that perspective. When you get into APAC, it's a similar situation. The increase there is delayed churn, maybe some delayed discounts. Europe is staying in line. In Africa, we're seeing higher levels of new business activity. So much of that is, in fact, durable and lasting, that's the way I would kind of articulate that. And then maybe on the second question, if you could maybe just repeat the question about the dilution, just so I get it right. David Barden : Hey. Yeah, Rod. Thank you. So I think we were just trying to \u2013 and thank you for those comments, that's helpful on the pieces part. The -- just the India write-down would seem to suggest that the bid-ask spread between what maybe AMT hopes to accomplish from a valuation standpoint and what's been offered has kind of collapsed down to the offer the side of the spread? And is that the right interpretation or reading through that write-down. And then obviously, we're all attempting to evaluate what the dilution effect for the sale might be on 2024. Any more color on whether it's a full divestiture or 50% divestiture and kind of timetable would help us kind of do that math? Thank you. Rod Smith : Yeah. That's good, David. Thank you. So we're making good progress with the strategic review that we've set out. In terms of the write-down, we are writing the India business down about $322 million and sets the book value in around $2.2 billion or so. And as I stated in my prepared remarks, it really is based on our internal impairment review analysis, discounted cash flow driven and certainly, cost of capital plays a significant role in that. But also, as I highlighted in my comments, it does also consider indications of value that we've determined throughout the process. So I think you can understand what that means, and it will help you kind of think about where things might fit. We've also provided a little bit more breakout on the India financials and some of -- in the back of the presentation, which you'll see. But in terms of revenue, we're a little over $1 billion EBITDA. It's about $355 million. Unlevered AFFO is about $290 million. So that gives you a little bit more information to kind of piece through and kind of assume where we may -- the way we may have. I don't want to get into too much direct guidance. We'll certainly lay that out when we complete our strategic review, which -- the good news is we're happy with the way the process is evolving. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ll be concluding it this year just as we\u2019ve previously mentioned, once we do, we\u2019ll let the investors know exactly what we\u2019ve concluded and what we plan to do there. We\u2019ve said that our goal, and we\u2019re on track to achieve our goals, which is to sell a majority equity stake to a financial investor. We\u2019ve said between 51% and 100%, the reality is it\u2019s probably going to be a majority stake. We probably will retain a stake, so it will be somewhere between that 61% and 100%. That\u2019s where we\u2019re kind of directing the process at this point. But again, we are confident that the process will conclude in the next couple of months. And when it does, we\u2019ll let the investors know exactly what we\u2019ve done. David Barden : Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it. Good luck everybody. Rod Smith : Thanks. Operator : And next, we'll move to Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Richard Prentiss : Guys, I'll echo the bell head, thanks for the memory, Tom. it's been great working with you. I think we went to your first NAREIT like, 14 years ago. Tom Bartlett : Absolutely. You set up the table for us at the NAREIT conference, Rick, I remember that. Richard Prentiss : Yeah. And Steve, been great working with you in the past, and we look forward to the new role. Rod Smith : Thanks, Rick. Richard Prentiss : Yeah. I want to go back to the dividend question from a couple of different angles as well. Rod, I think you mentioned $6.45 a share approximately current dividend announcing getting paid shortly would imply a little bit higher than that $6.48. Are we thinking it's in that range or is the $6.45 million more we should be thinking about? Rod Smith : Yeah. I think at this point, think about it being flat year-on-year. So, of course, every quarter, we get the dividend approved by the Board. But our intention is to hold the dividend flat annually year-over-year to help support deleveraging balance sheet strength and ultimately, AFFO growth as well as total shareholder returns. Richard Prentiss : Okay. I appreciate the comments that you're trying to kind of decouple from AFFO, more related to the REIT taxable income, it sounds like as well, but sort of implicit in that isn\u2019t also that thought that the India sale is anticipated and that also can kind of affect what the dividend might have been prior thoughts. Rod Smith : Yeah. I guess, Rick, I would say that's not correct. The India business isn't in our REIT at this point. So it really doesn't drive into the retaxable income issue. I think Tom articulated all the drivers with that, which it's really -- this is a management decision and certainly supported by our Board to prioritize capital to prioritize deleveraging and balance sheet strength, it's not impacted by the India process at all. And Tom highlighted, there are certain REIT rules that allow one-time items in some pretax earnings to be moved from one period to another. So there have been times in the past where we've been over under distributed, and we can move some of that over or under distribution back and forth from year-to-year, which is helpful. So in this case, it really is a decision to drive balance sheet strength and using our capital in the best way we can again, to drive total shareholder return in the short term and in the long term. And in this market with uncertain interest rates going forward, we think that's prudent and that's really the driving factor. Richard Prentiss : Okay. And then, you said there was a small acquisition from AT&T/SBCs talking about history lesson. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the marketplace as far as multiples in the U.S., Europe and other places. Rod Smith : Yeah, Rick. I would -- let me highlight first that we don't see compelling M&A on our pipeline. I think everyone kind of knows that, I'll just reiterate that. We are seeing some things out there. Certainly, there is -- not as robust, but there is a market in the U.S. with some smaller portfolios. And I don't want to get into a lot of detail in terms of what we see. I think we still see very high prices, even though they may have pulled back slightly from where they were, let's say, a year ago. And for that, we still look at the small deals if we can find compelling ways to expand total shareholder return. We have a little flexibility there. We don't see anything major. But we also just see the majority of the deals are probably still priced a little higher than what today's cost of capital would suggest that they should be. The small acquisition you see in our numbers is really just a buyout of a prior SBC sublease, which you'll be familiar with. It was a small tranche. Richard Prentiss : Okay. Was that some of the final purchase option stuff as well? Rod Smith : Yeah. That's exactly what it is. It's not the final one. It's just another tranche, and that will continue for a few more years. Richard Prentiss : Makes sense. And last one for me then. I think you've mentioned that all assets are coming on the tail we reviewed with India getting closer to this process. Any update as far as what you're looking at on the balance sheet that might be possible to say it's not where they are, where we thought it would be or maybe someone else wants to pay more, given private versus pilot multiples? Rod Smith : Yeah. I would say, Rick, we routinely review the portfolio performance across our business globally. We do that from a couple of perspectives. One is, there could be capital recycling opportunities, which we think could be very good for our shareholders over the long term, that certainly the decisions we saw driving our exit from the Mexico fiber business. It also is what is driving our consideration around what we're doing in India. So I'll highlight that, I don't want to get into specific other places where we might be looking. But we are looking at our portfolio, and it's something we do constantly. The other thing we do is, we constantly look at our capital deployments. And from that perspective, we can throttle those back or up depending on where the opportunities are. We can also reallocate or redistribute that capital to where we feel that investments will most -- will be most aligned with our priorities of driving organic growth in the short term and the long term, quality of earnings and consistent durable industry-leading AFFO growth and ultimately, total shareholder return. So I wouldn\u2019t just look at whether or not we sell a business here or there, those would be kind of operational decisions as well as recycling capital, but also kind of our CapEx programs, how much are we investing? Where are we investing? What kind of assets. And again, those decisions are made each and every year, really each and every quarter, and they are meant to and do align with our priorities. Richard Prentiss : Okay. Thanks, guys. And again, best wishes everybody. Tom Bartlett : Thanks, Rick. Operator : And next -- pardon me, next we go to Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just two related to the U.S. Maybe first on services. So it was a pretty sizable drop off maybe less surprising in terms of what's going on in the industry, but services revenue looks like they dropped off in third quarter. Just wondering if you can share any color in terms of whether this is broad-based or related to one or two customers in particular and how to think about sort of forward trajectory into 4Q? And then, maybe on a somewhat related note, in terms of colo and amendment activity in the U.S., so, 3Q held in relatively stable to what you saw in the first half. I think the implied number for 4Q is around $53 million. Just wondering whether that's sort of an appropriate run rate to consider into next year or whether we should anticipate sort of incremental moderations by virtue of just a broader low in the industry? Thanks. Tom Bartlett : Sure. I'll start out and then, if you want to jump in, Rod. In terms of our service business, it's inherently a non-run rate business, and that makes it difficult to predict. And you saw that in 2021 when we raised our guide materially over a couple of quarters, we're seeing that this year as we've seen a moderation of activity. What I would say is because of our cooperative MLAs, that's not a direct read across to our property revenue, because we are somewhat insulated from the peaks and valleys of activity with the customers on that. And it's too early to be giving guidance for 2024 and where we see the activity levels going there. What I would just reiterate is this is consistent with what we've seen in other Gs of activity. And the carriers have an initial build phase that starts out with kind of a [indiscernible] of activity, and you'll see that moderate a little bit. We are seeing the capital spend moderate a bit, but it's still settling at levels higher than it was in 4G. And even with our reduced expectations this year for our services business, it's still higher than it was at the same point in 4G. So we're very optimistic that customers will continue to build throughout the cadence of this 5G build. There will be a restart of that activity. We don't know exactly when that's going to happen and we'll give better guidance on that in February as we get more visibility into 2024, what those activity levels are going to be. Rod Smith : Yeah. And Matt, I'll just add a couple of data points. When you think about the co-location amendment additions. This year, we're anticipating a number of around $230 million for the U.S. You recall last year, we were around $150 million, we're at about $58 million this quarter and our guide anticipates a further reduction, but still a number that's greater than $50 million in Q4. I wouldn't just take that Q4 number and annualize. And I think you're better off and we won't give guidance, as Steve suggest until next year. But for modeling purposes, if you look at this year and last year and you split the difference, that's probably a safer place to put in your models today. And then, of course, we'll guide in February, and we'll be able to update that number. The only other thing I would say on services is the $140 million number is still higher than the historical average for services, and we're continuing to maintain a very nice gross margin in that business at all levels. So when we saw that go up to about $270 million, we were still in the 50s, low 50s, 53%, 54% margins as it tapered off a little bit to $140 million, we are able to drive up the margins based on the mix of the revenue and the way we service that revenue. So with a lower revenue, we\u2019re still able to mitigate some of that with higher margins in the upper 50s at this point. Matthew Niknam : Appreciate it. Thank you both. Tom Bartlett : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. And next, we'll go to Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple on capital allocation. So given the recent increases in interest rates and cost of capital, I mean, to influence at all as you look into next year, kind of your build-to-suit ambitions internationally or is there any kind of valuation of maybe slowing that to reinvest in other areas and that could potentially be data centers where it seems like you've had really strong performance year-to-date. It seems like growth continues to ramp and maybe you need to allocate more capital to your data center business and how you kind of balance that versus other forms of shareholder return? That would be very helpful. Thank you. Rod Smith : Yeah. Good morning, Eric. Thanks for joining in. And absolutely, all those issues are on the table. We look at our capital allocation every year, certainly, and I would say, even more frequently than that in the idea and the approach is to make the best decisions we can to support long-term total shareholder return. With the increase in cost of capital, the increase in interest rates as well as other factors affecting our markets around the globe, those all play into how much capital we will be deploying, how many build-to-suits will be executing on and where those will be. So that certainly comes into play. I won't get into a lot of detail in terms of decision-making there. I would just maybe highlight again that capital this year is lower than it was last year. And the environment in interest rates, in particular, there's still a fair amount of uncertainty. So we will be continuing to kind of look at that capital plan to decide if putting the capital into build-to-suits around the globe is better than some of the other options we have and a continuation of capital reductions is probably what you'll end up seeing in this environment. That's kind of where we're looking at it. The other part of your question is absolutely, we look at putting capital into places that primarily or specifically drive and align with our priorities. So when you think about us focused on organic growth over the long term, we're focused on quality of earnings. We're focused on operational efficiencies and driving balance sheet strength, all of the different ways that we can execute on achieving those goals are in play. If that means allocating more capital to higher quality markets versus emerging markets or vice versa. If it means putting less into CapEx and more into debt reduction, if it means reducing the growth of the dividend and putting more towards balance sheet and debt reduction. We think about those things all the time and it plays into our capital allocation and it will next year as well, and we'll lay out what that will mean in February. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks. And just one follow-up question. Latin America, you've talked about some delayed churn in that business. So maybe you could just kind of walk us through the cadence of when that you expect that churn to kind of layer through and when you may be on the other side of it. And then, obviously, it seems like given a pretty big reduction in inflation in some of those markets like Brazil, would seem to seem like the CPI-linked escalators will be a bit of a headwind at least into next year. So maybe just talk about some of the moving pieces and the growth outlook there? Thank you. Rod Smith : Yeah. A couple of things that I\u2019d \u2013 that I highlight relative to the LatAm market. I mean in 2022, we had roughly 5% churn that was part of embedded in our organic tenant billings growth. In Q3 here, it was 5.2%, so pretty consistent. For the full year of '23, we're projecting that to be around 6%. So that's what's driving. When we say elevated churn, that's exactly kind of what we're seeing there. We are seeing delays in churn. Much of that is tied to the oi churn (ph) that we're experiencing and will continue to experience down in Brazil. We also see churn from Telefonica up in Mexico. Those are kind of the two primary places where we see churn. We've laid out a lot of the different pieces of the oi churn. I won't do that again here. But I would say, we do expect elevated churn to continue into next year. I think you're absolutely right in terms of when inflation moderates in some of these markets, that will potentially lower the organic tenant billings growth from that perspective as well. So we'll be watching all of those issues. I think when it comes to LatAm, we'll be watching the churn as we go into next year. I can't tell you yet that we're beyond the peak here because of this churn that was delayed and potentially pushed into next year. But over the next couple of years, LatAm because of the reduction in inflation that could happen and the elevated churn, we could be in the low single digits in terms of organic tenant billings growth as we head into next year. Eric Luebchow : Okay. Great. Thank you, Rob. Appreciate it. Rod Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And next, we can go to Nick Del Deo with Moffett Nathanson. Please go ahead. Nick Del Deo : Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. And first of all, I want to echo others' comments and congratulate both Tom and Steve on the upcoming changes. Tom Bartlett : All right. Thank you. Nick Del Deo : Tom, just following up on the technology outlook you shared, is there any reason to believe that -- call it, the combination of the volume of spectrum that the carriers have been able to deploy and the capacity improvements enabled by 5G and massive MIMO, are going to allow them to stretch out their 5G upgrades over a longer period of time than may have been the case in the past, I think what you call the harvest phase of the 5G deployment or do you think those -- the impact of those improvements are just confident to what we've seen in the past with other technology upgrades? Tom Bartlett : My sense is that they're more comparable with what we've seen in prior upgrades. Yeah. There are bigger swaps of spectrum in the market today that all of our customers are deploying, particularly in the mid-band. But the demand is disproportionate to what we've seen in the past. So my sense is that given the demand and the additional kind of usage that we would expect over the next several years, it will be very -- rarely, very, very consistent. The data intensity that I even talked about with regards to adding certain levels of video usage is really going to eat into a lot of that spectrum capacity that is out there. So as I said, there is definitely more spectrum out there, definitely more in the mid-band, but I would expect that the usage that we will see and experience over the next several years, we'll put it on the same path as what we've seen in 3G and 4G. Nick Del Deo : Okay. And then maybe for Rod kind of a follow-up question on the dividend outlook. You noted that coming 2025, we should start to see the dividend grow at kind of in line with taxable income. I think historically, you had outlined sort of a 10% expectation. Should we think of your likely taxable income growth as being in that zone or is it going to be sort of a different level or is it just too early to say? Rod Smith : I think, Nick, it -- we'll have to watch kind of the trajectory of the REIT taxable income. But in general, I think it's probably safe for you to assume that, that will be in line with all material respects with our AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth, that's probably a safe way to kind of think about it. It may not be exact all the time. But given the fact that we can't predict the future certain -- and certainly, we're not going to be guiding long term on that. If you think about where our AFFO and AFFO per share growth is going to be and you think about that being probably consistent with where re-taxable income might be and where the dividend growth could be. That's probably the safest bet. I'd just highlight again, we do have a requirement to dividend out 90% of our REIT taxable income. We typically dividend out closer to 100% because we think that's most beneficial to our shareholders from a tax perspective. So that's important to notice. But then, Tom, mentioned, there are other ways that we manage the dividend payout relative to REIT taxable income, and that's where there is a little bit more discretion on our end to try to match it up to AFFO growth. So that's probably the way to think about it. Think about what our AFFO growth is going to be over the long term, what our AFFO per share growth is going to be and a dividend growth very well may align with that. But with that said, we will be considering capital allocation and the best uses of capital for our shareholders each and every year and each and every quarter. And the dividend specifically, is approved by our Board each year in each quarter. Nick Del Deo : Okay. That's great. Thank you, Rod. And can I just -- one quick clarification on the one-time revenue benefits you called out. It looks like other was elevated in the U.S. in the quarter. I think that's really the Sprint payments. And any other one-timers that you would call out or be able to describe to us? Rod Smith : The only thing it's really in the settlement area. I mean we had about -- I think it was about $50 million in settlements this quarter. Last year, same quarter was much lower, more in the $15 million range. There's a customer equipment removal settlement in the U.S. that was pulled forward from the fourth quarter into the third quarter, that was probably in the range of $25 million or so. But those are really the items. It's the one-time items, it's settlement fees. We get some small settlement fees throughout our other international markets and the timing of those can be somewhat bumpy. One thing you'll see from our guide is those settlement fees, those one-time items do drop off pretty substantially in Q4. So that's one of the things you can think about when you look at the bridge from Q3 to Q4 in terms of our AFFO, there will be a non-recurrence of close to $40 million, $45 million of those one-time items. Nick Del Deo : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great. Thank you. Tom ad Steve, I wish you all the best as well. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Rod, you mentioned that we'll end leverage at about 5.2, 5.3 at year-end. Where do you want that to be over the next year or two? And we will get specific guidance next year, but just directionally, do you expect AFFO to grow in '24, assuming India is sold at year-end? Thank you. Rod Smith : Yeah. Hey, Batya. Nice to hear from you. Hope you are well. Yes, so we ended the quarter with 5.0 leverage. It's going to be a little higher than that at the end of the year, primarily driven because of those one-time items on the EBITDA side. But our clear focus is to delever to reduce debt as well as reduce our exposure to floating rate debt by driving the percentage of our debt that is exposed to floating rates, and we got that down to about 11% or so. Our goal is to get to 5 times really as soon as we can. And that's what we're focused on, and that's what's driving a lot of our capital allocation decisions is driving balance sheet strength and reducing leverage getting to that 5.0 as soon as we can. So that is clearly the goal. The goal will also -- the goal -- and it's specifically for 2024, that's where we hope to get to. And we're looking for all the opportunities we can find to drive that. And that could include reducing the capital program a little bit next year, that certainly is in line with the dividend decision that you heard us articulate today, you'll see that our SG&A is being held flat year-over-year. You'll see that our margins are expanding that's the result of a lot of global initiatives around operational efficiency to drive additional EBITDA and AFFO. Not only is that good for everyone. It also helps us get our leverage numbers down a little bit. It provides a little bit more cash flow to reduce the debt. So those are all the pieces that we're focused on. The short answer is 5 times as soon as possible. 5 times in 2024 would be great. That's possible, and we're driving towards that and we'll see if we can achieve it. And then with AFFO, I would absolutely say, our portfolio, consistent with the way we've explained this for years is really well positioned for durable AFFO per share growth. This year, that was interrupted primarily because of financing cost headwinds, driven by interest rates, additional shares that we issued for some of our prior acquisitions and some minority interest that we have because of some of the private capital that we raised in certain parts of our business. With our new AFFO per share outlook of around $9.79, we\u2019re pretty much flat with where we were prior year. So we\u2019ve been able to convert a 1% to 2% reduction in AFFO, AFFO per share up to closer to flat, which is good. But when you think about that number being flat and an 8% headwind from financing being embedded in it as well as a 2% headwind from VIL short payments or, let\u2019s say, the VIL reserve of $75 million we made, you adjust for those things, the underlying core operating performance of the assets that we own around the globe are driving double-digit growth without those headwinds. So we absolutely believe this business can drive growth over the long term and in 2024. The thing that we\u2019ll be watching that a potential interrupters would be any material volatility in FX. We don\u2019t know where rates will go. Rate uncertainty is something that we watch. But absent those sorts of items, we think the portfolio is well positioned to grow next year and over the long term. Batya Levi : Got it. Thank you. Rod Smith : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'll hand the call back over to our team. Adam Smith : Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call.

Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2024 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance. Our expectations for the closing of the sale of our India business and the expected impacts of such sale on our business, our collections expectations in India and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those that will be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steven Vondran : Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I'd like to start by saying it's an honor and a privilege to step into the role of CEO at American Tower. I want to thank Tom Bartlett for his leadership over the last 15 years of the company and congratulate him on an exceptional career. I certainly recognize I have big shoes to fill and to all of our stakeholders, I look forward to continuing to build on the tremendous success we've achieved together to date. In recent weeks, I've been telling many of our employees, customers and investors that I'm more excited today by the opportunity ahead that I've been in my 20 plus years with the company. There are two key reasons for that. First, we're still in the early stages of a mobility and computing-driven technology wave that suggests distributed digital infrastructure is going to be a higher demand for the foreseeable future. Second, we spent the last two decades developing a leading global portfolio with real estate, power and interconnection platforms that will serve as the core backbone of this wave. I believe we're now positioned to harvest the benefits of the scaled, differentiated tower and data center platforms we've built to provide unique value for our customers and best-in-class growth, profitability and returns for our investors. To deliver on that opportunity, we're going to be zeroing in on a few key areas in 2024 and beyond. To begin, we're committed to operating the highest quality portfolio. This means owning and investing in assets in the most attractive geographies where secular demand trends signal the potential for long-term sustained growth. Equally, it is important, it means securing business with market leaders, maintaining contract structures that maximize organic growth and minimize downside risks, as well as attracting and securing accretive development opportunities afforded by our in-market scale and leading operational capabilities. We saw the clear benefits of these factors play out in 2023. In our [indiscernible] U.S. and Canada Tower business, the 5G investment cycle and contributions from our comprehensive MLAs drove a record of roughly $230 million in colocation and amendment growth. International performance was also driven by record organic new business growth contribution and further supported by critical CPI-linked escalator terms and growth from our build-to-suit and power as a service programs. Furthermore, our differentiated CoreSite interconnection business saw second consecutive year of record signed new business. Going forward, we're going to continue our focus on maximizing organic growth across our existing assets and complement that incremental revenue generation through select development opportunities. At the same time, we'll continue to actively assess and challenge our prior capital allocation decisions to ensure the opportunity we see ahead across our global footprint is still supportive of our original underwriting thesis and apply what we've learned over the last two decades to our deployment plans going forward. Ultimately, we're focused on operating a portfolio that provides the proper mix of risk exposure and can deliver high quality, sustained top line growth supported by an operating structure that drives outsized rates of conversion to profitability and commands a premium in the market. That's a good segue into the next area of focus, which is delivering the most efficient global operating model centered around cost discipline, margin expansion and increasing returns on invested capital. Our global regional scale and long operating track record present an opportunity to further improve on the operating leverage inherent in the neutral host infrastructure model. We're accelerating initiatives in our regional operations to bring down direct cost per site, we're also investing in experimentation and implementation of AI applications and other technologies that create a more cost and time-efficient equipment deployment cycle bring greater precision and lower cost to our maintenance operations and improved yields on renewable energy generation, just to name a few examples. What it cost our overhead costs, as you'll see in our 2024 guidance, we're targeting a reduction in SG&A, which combined with healthy top line growth is supporting an 80 basis point reduction in cash SG&A as a percentage of property revenue and approximately 200 basis point expansion in cash adjusted EBITDA margin since 2022. Continued improvement to our cost structure and driving profitability is going to be a cornerstone in our both algorithm going forward. Next, and as we've highlighted on past calls, we're working today to further reinforce our balance sheet as a strategic asset. Our investment grade credit rating is at the core of our strategy, and that's not going to change. In fact, I believe market access and cost of capital advantages may be of even more strategic importance in this cycle than they were over the last decade. As Rob will elaborate on further, we made substantial progress towards strengthening the balance sheet in 2023. And as we look to 2024 and beyond, our capital allocation program is going to prioritize resiliency and flexibility in this evolving economic environment. Together with other strategic initiatives like reducing our overall capital intensity of executing on cost savings across the business, we'll hold the dividend relatively flat in 2024, subject to board approval. In turn, we'll prioritize a reduction to our gross debt balance and accelerate the pathway to achieving our net leverage target and enhance financial flexibility. As we've highlighted in the past, while M&A is not a priority today, as a company, we want to be in a position of strength when and if strategically relevant portfolios that meet our investment criteria do come to the market. In our internal CapEx program, we'll continue investing to expand our existing tower and data center platforms by selecting the opportunities with the highest risk-adjusted rates of return. At American Tower, we've developed a unique ability to allocate capital between our U.S. and international tower businesses as well as our U.S. based CoreSite platform. We see this as a distinct competitive advantage. While we continue to view the tower business as the best model out there, the flexibility we're building into our CapEx program and the robust cash flow assets generate allow us to be nimble and responsive to market conditions as we make capital allocation decisions over time, which in the near term means growing our exposure to developed markets. In our outlook for 2024, a larger share of our development capital is going toward the U.S. and Europe including expanding within our CoreSite footprint, where the same demand trends that have resulted in two consecutive years of record new leasing are expected to drive stabilized returns in the mid-teens for ongoing development projects. We're balancing out the expectation to build around 3,000 new tower sites, primarily in our international markets. This does represent a decline in volumes compared to 2022 and 2023, particularly as we assess certain risks in our emerging market footprint, including the FX volatility we've seen recently in Africa. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see partnering with market leaders to grow our tower portfolio globally as a key component of our long-term growth algorithm. Simply put, the changes in the global macroeconomic environment we've seen over the last 24 months and our balance sheet priorities, have raised the bar when it comes to required returns. And you're seeing discipline and flexibility reflected in the capital allocation expectations that we're rolling out for 2024. Finally, and foundational to our strategy are the people throughout the global business. Everything I've talked about today hinge is of the dedication and performance of our teams across the globe and the impact we can make for our customers, investors and the communities we serve. I've been so impressed by the teams I've met with and heard from over recent weeks, and we're going to continue strengthening our organization around the world and focus on developing, attracting and rewarding the best talent in the industry. In closing, I want to reiterate my comments from the outset. I believe there's tremendous opportunity ahead for American Tower. Evolving technology trends continue to drive demand for more ubiquitous, dense, low latency distributed networks. Against those trends, we're going to leverage our leading tower and data center platforms, balance sheet strength, capital allocation discipline and the dedicated teams that are supporting our global business to present a truly differentiated value proposition and compelling growth and return opportunities for shareholders. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rod to discuss our 2023 results and 2024 outlook. Rod Smith : Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. Before I dive into our 2023 financial results and our expectations for 2024, I will highlight a few key achievements from the past year. First, we closed a successful 2023 with a strong fourth quarter, exceeding our prior outlook midpoints across property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO per share with full year 2023 results comfortably beating our initial guidance from a year ago. For the year, performance was anchored by continued demand for our diverse global asset portfolio resulting in over 6% consolidated organic tenant billings growth, an acceleration of over 300 basis points as compared to 2022. With our U.S. & Canada and International segments each delivering record colocation and amendment growth of roughly $230 million in nearly $150 million, respectively. Additionally, we marked another record year of signed new business for CoreSite, supporting digital transformation across diverse workloads in emerging technologies, including more recently, AI use cases. Furthermore, our focus on cost management, combined with the inherent operating leverage in the tower model and certain one-time benefits resulted in attractive year-over-year cash adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, which I'll touch on in a moment. Second, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet through organic deleveraging and the successful issuance of approximately $7 billion in fixed rate debt. As a result of our 2023 actions, we've extended our average maturity and reduced our exposure to floating rate debt to less than 11% of the total debt stack, down from over 22% at the start of the year. Closing the fourth quarter with net leverage of 5.2 times, we are on track to meet the upper end of our 3 times to 5 times net leverage goal by the end of 2024. Finally, we concluded the strategic review of our India business earlier this year, reaching a definitive agreement to sell 100% of ATC India to Brookfield, which we will refer to as the India sale. We believe this transaction together with the Mexico fiber and Poland divestitures in 2023 enhances our global portfolio mix and risk profile and positions American Tower for sustained high quality earnings growth over the long term. Now let's discuss the details of our full year 2023 results. Turning to Slide 6. Full year consolidated property revenue growth was over 5% and nearly 7% on an FX neutral basis, tenant billings growth was 7.2% with organic tenant billings growth of 6.3%, complemented by the construction of nearly 3,200 new builds, primarily in our international markets. In the United States & Canada, property revenue growth was over 4%, with organic tenant billings growth of 5.3% or 6.6% excluding Sprint churn. Our international property revenue grew by over 5%, including organic tenant billings growth of 7.7%, with each segment meeting or exceeding our prior outlook. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we were able to reverse approximately $38 million of prior revenue reserves associated with customer collections in India, contributing to outperformance versus our prior outlook, closing the year with a net revenue reserve associated with customer collections in India of approximately $28 million. Finally, our data center segment contributed approximately $835 million to our total property revenue in 2023, representing year-over-year growth of nearly 9%, and as I mentioned earlier, delivering another record year of signed new business. Moving on. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 7% or around 7.5% on an FX neutral basis to over $7 billion. On a consolidated basis, cash adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 170 basis points year-over-year to 62.3%, primarily driven by strong organic growth and certain one-time benefits combined with a keen focus on cost management throughout the business, with cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue down over 30 basis points year-over-year to approximately 7%. Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by over 2% and 1%, respectively. Growth on a per share basis absorbed negative impacts of approximately 7% in financing costs and another 1% from FX. Now before I discuss the details of our outlook for 2024, I will start by summarizing a few key highlights and assumptions. First, and as Steve mentioned, we are committed to owning and operating the highest quality portfolio supported by a strong balance sheet. With that commitment in mind, we are focused on continuing to drive compelling organic growth across our diverse portfolio of assets, while maximizing the conversion of top line growth to profitability by taking costs out of the business. Together with reducing our aggregate capital intensity for the second year in a row and maintaining a relatively flat dividend payout in 2024 as compared to 2023, subject to Board approval, we believe these collective actions will maximize recurring cash flow growth, further strengthen our balance sheet, and as a result, accelerate our pathway to financial flexibility and optionality. We'll get into more detail shortly. Next, we are assuming a full year contribution of the India business in our outlook, representing over $1.16 billion in property revenue, $360 million of adjusted EBITDA and $285 million for unlevered AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders. Upon closing of the India sale, which we anticipate occurring during the second half of 2024, subject to customary conditions and regulatory approval. We will then revise our outlook assumptions to incorporate the transaction. For added transparency, we have included Slide 20 in this earnings presentation, which shows the India contributions to our outlook by quarter, assuming a potential closing on October 1, 2024, for your reference, we would anticipate a reduction of $295 million and $95 million to our presented outlook midpoints for property revenue and adjusted EBITDA, respectively. Furthermore, we would estimate an approximately $0.09 reduction to attributable AFFO per share, which assumes anticipated proceeds at closing are used to pay down existing indebtedness. Also within the India segment, we have included approximately $65 million in incremental revenue reserves for the full year, translating to a reduction of $0.14 to attributable AFFO per share. Although, we are encouraged by the positive collection results realized in the second half of 2023, we believe it's prudent to take a conservative view at this point in time. Additionally, we've assumed the forward rate curve to support our 2024 interest rate assumptions, including the cost of our floating rate debt and assumptions for refinancing our 2024 senior note maturities. Lastly, on the FX side, our outlook reflects estimated negative translational impacts of $191 million on property revenue, $132 million for adjusted EBITDA and $82 million for attributable AFFO as compared to 2023. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Moving to the details on Slide 7. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect total property revenue of over $11.1 billion, representing an increase year-over-year of greater than 1% and 3% on an FX neutral basis. Our guide includes cash revenue growth of around $200 million in the U.S. and Canada segment and $225 million of FX neutral growth in our international regions, excluding pass-through. We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $80 million of growth in cash revenue in 2024, demonstrating nearly 10% growth year-over-year, excluding the impacts of straight line. Property revenue also includes an approximately $203 million stepdown in non-cash straight line revenue or approximately 2% headwind to growth partially offset by approximately $28 million increase in pass-through. Lastly, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we anticipate an FX headwind of nearly 2% or $191 million to consolidated property revenue growth. Turning to Slide 8. We expect another solid year of organic growth contributions from our U.S. & Canada and International segments. In the U.S. & Canada, we anticipate organic tenant billings growth of approximately 4.7% or 6%, excluding Sprint churn. This expectation includes another healthy year of colocation and amendment growth contributions of $180 million to $190 million, reflecting the expected step down from our record level achievement in 2023 though still approximately 20% higher than our 2016 to 2022 average. Internationally, starting with Africa, we expect a strong momentum from 2023 to continue with expected organic tenant billings growth of 11% to 12%. This includes colocation and amendment contributions of approximately 7%, along with escalator growth of 8% to 9%, partially offset by churn of around 4%, which would represent a notable year-over-year improvement after incurring the largest impacts from carrier consolidation in 2023. Turning to Europe. 2024 organic tenant billings growth is expected to be 5% to 6%. On the colocation and amendment front, we anticipate growth of 3% to 4%, an acceleration as compared to 2023, while growth from escalators stand at roughly 3%, consistent with 2023, churn is expected to remain low at around 1%. In Latin America, consistent with our previous messaging, we expect organic tenant billings growth to stepdown as compared to 2023 to approximately 2% for the year, as churn will remain elevated at around 5%, primarily due to Oi (ph) in Brazil. Churn is offset by relatively consistent colocation and amendment activity of approximately 3% and contributions from escalators of approximately 4%. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we are guiding to approximately 2% organic tenant billings growth in 2024, including colocation and amendment growth of approximately 3.5%, roughly 2.5% from escalators and churn of around 4%. Moving on to Slide 9. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of less than 1% and approximately 2.5% on an FX neutral basis, while absorbing a negative impact of over 3% associated with net straight line. Complementing the strong revenue growth trends I mentioned earlier, we're planning to reduce cash SG&A by approximately $30 million as compared to 2023, contributing to cash adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of around 30 basis points. Additionally, our outlook includes an expectation for approximately $17 million in year-over-year gross margin growth from our U.S. services business with the quarterly cadence, suggesting a ramp-up in carrier activity in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 10. We expect attributable AFFO per share to grow approximately 5% year-over-year to $10.33 and approximately 6.5% on an FX neutral basis. Growth in cash adjusted EBITDA and a reduction in maintenance CapEx is partially offset by an increase in financing costs and cash taxes, together with higher minority interest adjustments due to growth in our European and data center JVs. Moving on to Slide 11. I'll review our capital plans for 2024 and our balance sheet priorities for the upcoming year. In 2024, we will continue to focus on organic growth, quality of earnings and operational efficiency, while prioritizing balance sheet strength, reducing risk and channel and discretionary spending into capital projects that support sustainable earnings growth and yield the most attractive risk adjusted returns. Consistent with the messaging, on our third quarter 2023 earnings call, the 2024 plan assumes maintaining an annual common dividend distribution of approximately $3 billion, representing a modest increase on an annual per share basis to $6.48 per share. We also expect to evenly distribute the dividend across each quarter of the year, which would suggest a one-time sequential stepdown from our fourth quarter 2023 declared dividend of $1.70 to $1.62 in the first quarter of 2024, all subject to Board approval. In addition, we expect to deploy around $1.6 billion in CapEx, of which 90% will be discretionary. As Steve highlighted in his remarks, we view the flexibility of our CapEx deployments with options across a range of geographies and assets to be a distinct competitive advantage for American Tower and our ability to drive sustained attractive returns for our shareholders. In 2024, this means increasing our CapEx allocation and exposure towards our developed markets. This includes increasing development spend for existing CoreSite data center campuses to $450 million as we seek to replenish the record capacity sold in 2022 and 2023, and maintain appropriate levels of sellable capacity, while continuing to drive attractive targeted stabilized yields in the mid-teens. The balance of the development CapEx spend will support another year of solid new build volumes internationally, which assumes the construction of 3,000 sites at the midpoint. Moving to the right side of the slide, and as I mentioned earlier, we made significant progress towards strengthening our balance sheet in 2023 through recurring business growth, augmented with cost discipline and combined with the strategic management of our capital allocation plans, we anticipate meeting the upper end of our 3 times to 5 times net leverage range by year-end. Our steadfast commitment to maintaining investment grade credit rating and enhancing our balance sheet strength and financial flexibility remains unchanged. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary, our global business continued to demonstrate solid core growth and resiliency in 2023, augmented by strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing our quality of earnings, driving operational efficiency and strengthening our already strong balance sheet. We believe successful execution of these initiatives provides a strong foundation for 2024 and enhances our position as a leader in the global communications infrastructure industry. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities, adapt to challenges and deliver compelling risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders for years to come. With that, operator, we can open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning, and Steve, congrats on the new role and the very best for that. I appreciate the initial comments on your priorities. I wanted to come back to this highest quality portfolio point that you were making. Is there some sort of review process where you're sort of formally going through each of the markets and just looking at what fits and what doesn't and what you want to do about that or is it more kind of investing more in these developed markets? Any color around that? And I'm thinking about markets like Nigeria, where we've obviously had a challenging FX environment here. How do you think about some of those more challenged markets in the near and medium-term? And then you mentioned data center several times in your comments, I know that Rod noted the CapEx was going up here. How are you thinking beyond the existing campuses either domestically or internationally, certainly, a huge opportunity in that business and again, a business where scale really matters? Thanks. Steven Vondran : Sure. Well, thanks, Simon. Thanks for the good wishes there. I'll take that in a couple of pieces here. So I'll start out with what do we mean by the highest quality portfolio. And what we mean by that is, we're constantly reassessing all of our portfolios, both domestically and abroad and rechallenging all the decisions we made about capital allocation in the past and say, do they still meet our investment criteria. And if there's a challenge in the business, our first choice is to say what can we do to fix that? How can we get it to meet those criteria? And then the second thing, we would look at is ongoing capital allocation and is it a market or a business we want to continue to put capital into. So when we talk about the best quality portfolio, what we're saying is that we continue to look at that we found our assumptions there, and I did mention in my comments that if you look at a market like Nigeria, the macroeconomic conditions, including some of the FX translation issues have caused us to raise the bar in terms of acquired returns. So when we talk about that portfolio, we're looking at the market, the asset class, the demand for the assets, the contract structures we have in place, what types of contractual protections we can get for something like an FX devaluation, and we're shaping the portfolio for that. Now having said that, there's nothing to report beyond what we've already talked about in terms of the strategic review we did in India. We've been very clear that we're going to exit that market. We did exit Poland because it wasn't to scale for us and we did choose to exit Mexico fiber. And we'll continue to look at those other businesses that we have and make assessments on those. But there's nothing I would point to today to say that we're going to make any portfolio changes in the near term. The second question, I think you asked was how do we think about a market like Nigeria, and we believe that the emerging market portfolio is still an important part of our growth algorithm going forward. And we think that having the appropriate level of risk there to complement our developed market strategy will continue to allow us to elongate our growth curve over time there. We are mindful that there are some near-term challenges that we're seeing there. And you're seeing that play out some of our capital allocation decisions as we're rotating some of our discretionary CapEx for developed markets versus the emerging markets. You've also seen that play out in recent years with some of the inorganic acquisitions we've done. We did inside in the U.S., CoreSite in the U.S., Telsius in Europe. And those all had the effect of reducing our emerging market exposure, divesting India will reduce our emerging market exposure if we continue to allocate more of our development CapEx to developed markets versus emerging markets, that will also decrease our margin market exposure. So what you're essentially seeing play out there is us rebalancing our portfolio a little bit in response to the macroeconomic conditions that we're seeing, which we think is the appropriate thing to do in any environment is to look at the portfolio and rebalance it. And so that leads back into that highest quality portfolio. The second question I think you had was around CoreSite and what are we focused on there? Right now, most of our development CapEx is focused on expanding our existing campuses. And if you look at how that business has performed, we've had two years of record leasing, and we need to replenish the capacity that we have sold in those campuses. And it's a very good use of our capital. Again, we're looking at stabilized returns in the mid-teens. And if you think about the projects we have in our development, they're more than 40% pre-leased as of the end of the year. And so when you think about that business, pre-leasing is something that wasn't as prevalent in CoreSite pre-acquisition and that pre-leasing really reduces the risk of all that development, and it shortens the time period that it takes to get to those stabilized mid-teens returns. And so that's why you're seeing us pick up the investment there a bit. We do evaluate some Tier 2 markets in the U.S. You saw us buy a small data center in Miami, and we'll continue to look at whether there are sort of tuck-ins that we might want to do in the U.S. if we have an anchor tenant that's going to give us a good return going into it. And if we think it can turn into a more material campus for us later on. But it's not a huge priority for us. You're not going to see us put a lot of capital into that. And with respect to international expansion in data centers, that's not something we're leaning into at this point. We do have customers that would love for us to have a larger footprint than we do today. And we'll consider those opportunities. But there's nothing that I would point to today to say that we're going to do anything outside the U.S. in the near term? Simon Flannery : Right. Rod Smith : Hey, Simon. Maybe I would complement Steve's comments on Nigeria just briefly here. But just as a reminder, I know you know this, but for others in Nigeria, we also look to protect ourselves in the contract structures that Steve mentioned. So just as a reminder, we've got about $400 million in revenue, property revenue in Nigeria. 40% of that is actually passed through. Much of that is power, which is pegged to U.S. pricing. So we avoid the FX risk on those pass-through numbers. 60% of that $400 million roughly is the is the leasing revenue and 50% of that adjusts annually pegged to the U.S. dollar. So again, that's protected or sheltered from the FX volatility. That leaves about 30% of the revenue in Nigeria that's actually directly exposed to the FX fluctuations. And then with that said, of course, we build the Fisher effect into our models. We look for risk adjusted rates of returns, although in the short term, FX can be volatile, we do think our underwriting process catches the FX volatility that would be in a market like Nigeria and others over the long term. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Good morning and congrats again, Steve, on the official transition. Two topics for you this morning. First, can you share an update on the domestic leasing environment as to whether or not you're seeing any changes in the activity levels early this year? And can you share some of the data points and development that are contributing to the decision to include improving carrier activity during the second half within your services guidance? And then just a second topic, what is the road map for the LatAm portfolio to normalize its level of organic growth? How long does it take to get there and what is that level of organic growth that AMT can return to? Thanks. Steven Vondran : Thanks, Michael. Thanks for the well wishes there. So I'll start with your first question about the U.S. So we are predicting our guidance for OTBG in the U.S. is approximately 4.7%. And as you know, that's underwritten largely by our comprehensive MLAs that we have with our carriers. So we have a degree of insulation from the variability that you see in the deployment cadence there. We do have one of our big three carrier MLAs that has rolled off of its comprehensive portion of that MLA. And so that's gone to a little bit more of an a [indiscernible]. So you'll see that activity spread more through unloaded like it would have been in a comprehensive agreement. What we're seeing from the carriers in the U.S. is we are seeing an uptick in the conversations around activity. We've seen a modest increase in application levels already this year that's off to a pretty low base at the end of last year, but we are seeing some increase in activity. But before we get the applications, there's a degree of conversation, an inquiry that happens with our carriers. And especially with respect to our services business, we have a lot of conversation around that. And we're engaged on the front end of the process when they're doing their RF design sheets and trying to figure out what they're going to do for the year. And that's what's led us to believe that there's an uptick in activity, probably back-end loaded, and that's led to our increasing our guidance and our services business for next year. Now I would point out that if you look at our services guide, it's a little bit lower margin than previously. That's a result of having a little bit more construction services in that guide. And I do want to point out our construction business. That's something that we've not grown aggressively over the past. And when you think about that services business, we don't do that nationwide. We do it in pockets where we have the right resources and can you lean on third-party contractors to do the work. So if there are variabilities in the demand that we see there that we can cut our costs pretty quickly there. So that's one of the things we're seeing reflected in that services margin is a higher mix of construction services. But again, that's targeted by region, by carrier and it's not a huge business for us, but it's 1 that we think adds value to our customers, and it earns us a little bit more business. Michael Rollins : Yeah. Rod Smith : Michael, I'll hit the LatAm question on the organic tenant billings. So let me just kind of recap a little bit where we're at. Our guide for 2024 is about 2% organic tenant billings growth. That comes with a pretty steady colocation and amendment level of activity of around 3%. We also are benefiting from the escalators that are tied to local inflation across the region, that's at about 4%. So you have that gross growth coming in, in the upper single digits, 7%. We do also have 5% churn in for 2024. We've had a couple of churn events that we've worked through in Latin America over the last couple of years. Noticeably in 2023, we worked through the Telefonica churn down in Mexico. I think you're well aware of that. One of the primary drivers of the churn in 2024 is the Oi churn in Brazil. So of that 5% churn, almost half of it is the Oi churn that we're assuming is going to come through in 2024, that's about $26 million of tenant billings for Oi that ends up coming off in 2024. So we look at the market there. And yes, we've gone through some consolidation churn. And that churn is really what's been reducing our overall organic tenant billings growth rate. We do expect to get through that churn and return to more normalized growth in the mid to upper mid-single digits but it's probably going to be a few years away before we get through that in the event, not that I want to talk too much about '25 and beyond, but the Oi churn will persist for a couple of more years. That's the one sort of to watch and to see how it rolls through. But once we get through that, we do see a good steady level of colocation amendment activity and the way our contracts are written. We do benefit from the escalations tied to inflation. We protect ourselves from some FX volatility as well. Michael Rollins : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess, two, if I could. First, maybe just Steve, I think the biggest question I'm getting is that what we're hearing from American Tower about maybe a better second half of visibility into higher activity levels into the second half of the year is different than maybe what we heard yesterday from one of your peers, which is that the year is going to be more front-end loaded that the back part of the year could be slower than the jumping off point for 2024 and the 2025 might be slower. So could you kind of maybe talk a little bit about your conviction level that the second half activity levels can be higher, maybe some of the differences between some of the MLAs you might have that others don't DISH relationships, etc., that would be very helpful, I think, for people to kind of reconcile what we're hearing in the last couple of days. And then the second question, Rod. Thank you for all the details around India. I think some people, I think, were surprised to see India in the full year guide, and people are trying to back out that one quarter in the back part of the year. Slide 20, you have an unlevered number that gets you to around $0.15, $0.16 per share. But in the text, you've got a number that you're pulling out for about $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter. Could you help us understand the difference between the unlevered and the levered numbers that in order to kind of get a level set for what we are really thinking will be the guide for 2024 AFFO per share. Thank you. Steven Vondran : Okay. I'll start with the first question, and talk about the U.S. growth. So I would just point out that as a result of our comprehensive MLAs that our revenue is decoupled from the levels of activity to some extent. So I think comparing us to someone else's estimations of leasing new business is a little bit tough, just given the fact that we have a level of locked-in activity. And a large part of our rental growth is, it's locked in, it's either signed because it was signed last year, it's commencing this year. It's part of our comprehensive MLAs or there's a degree of carryover revenue and the OTBG number carries forward because the trailing 12-month metric there. The better analog for activity is our services business. And as we've said in the past, it's notoriously hard to predict exactly where you're going to land. A couple of years ago, we had to take guidance up quite a bit. Last year, we brought it down. So what we're providing here is, our best estimate given the levels of activity we're seeing, but also some of it can be more market-driven. So it may be activity in a particular market versus more ubiquitous activity, given that that's how we're performing some of that service has worked. We do see a general uptick in conversation from our customers that make us believe that there will be an uptick in the second half of the year. But as you think about that activity and the service levels of the -- service business with that activity, you have to do quite a bit of services work before you actually sign a new lease, if you're driving an a la carte environment. So it could just be timing that we're referencing there. But at the end of the day, our belief is, our property revenue growth or rental growth is largely locked in, and we feel confident in the portion that's not locked in, but that will come through in the cadence, we believe. And on the services side, we believe that we'll see a continuing ramp in that activity and that's what led to the guide on that. Rod Smith : Hey, David. Rod here. Regarding India, just a couple of points there. So you see in Page 20, we give you the breakdown for India, not just for the full year, but also on a quarterly basis so that to really help you figure out kind of what the impact may be up against a variety of closing dates, right? We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2024. And the process that we're going through is it's being reviewed by the Competition Commission in India. So that's kind of the gating action there. And of course, we reviewed kind of that process with local -- with our local team, with local advisers, lawyers in India based, lawyers in the U.S. and as well as doing the proper diligence around interested parties within India, and we feel pretty good about that approval process. With all that said, we do expect it to be approved and closed in the second half of the year, but we're not exactly sure what the date would be. So we wanted to give you the quarterly breakdown so that as we progress through the year, you'd have the ability to kind of look at it quarter-by-quarter. On a full year, we've got property revenue from India at about 1.2 -- just under $1.2 billion adjusted EBITDA at about $360 million. And unlevered AFFO at $285 million and again, you can see the way that breaks down per quarter. Essentially, the difference between that unlevered AFFO and what we look at is the potential dilution of $0.30 to $0.40 for the year, maybe $0.09 dilution on a quarterly basis is the assumption that we would take the proceeds from the sale, roughly the $2 billion to $2.5 billion in pay down revolving debt that is in the -- not that I want to give you the guide in terms of our interest rate, but you can kind of know where revolving debt is these days for us up in the 6% range or so, approximately. You put that -- those proceeds towards paying down that debt, and that's the differential that brings that dilution down into the $0.09 per quarter or between $0.30 and $0.40 for the year. The math is really that simple, David. David Barden : Perfect. That\u2019s really helpful, guys. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Richard Prentiss : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Steve, I appreciate you giving us your view and the refinement raising the capital allocation by all good details. First question I've got is, Rod, piggybacking on David's question about India. There is obviously some concentration there at Brookfield as far as how many towers they have in the marketplace. Have you heard anything from the competitive commission there about their comfort level or would there be any required divestitures? Rod Smith : Yeah, Rick. Thanks for the question. So we're working through the process. I don't want to get into detailed discussions. We certainly haven't talked directly to the Competition Commission, but we've certainly done a fair amount of diligence. We're not sure where that will end up. We're pretty confident, very confident it gets approved. There could be some level of divestitures that was contemplated within the agreement that we work through. So nothing there that would concern us overly. And the other part is where Brookfield does have some towers the way they plan to run these also is competition friendly, I would say is the way that we kind of we view it there. So I don't want to go into more detail than that, but we do expect that the transaction would be approved and would have the ability to close it in the second half of 2024. Richard Prentiss : Okay. And then Steve, I appreciate the comments that you decouple service revenue really from leasing revenue because of the analyses versus others. Is it still kind of three, six months from the time you're getting applications having these talks before it shows up in the financials? And then can you give us a little color kind of then on the pacing you expect of that. I think, Rod, you said $180 million to $190 million of new leasing activity in U.S., Canada. Steven Vondran : Sure. It's hard to give an exact time line, Rick, because it's different by different customers. So I would say from application to revenue showing up on an a la carte basis, there's a variability there from call it, 60 days to six months kind of what you referred to there. It really depends on the customer and how urgent they are to get on the site, to be honest with you. In terms of the cadence for the contribution from the new leases and colocation, it's relatively flat across the period. Again, I just would point out that we had the comprehensive portion of 1 of our major MLAs expired at the end of last year. And so that got rid of some of the front-end loading that you saw in previous years. So it will be more evenly distributed this year. Richard Prentiss : Okay. And the last one, Rod, you cited out that there's a probability that the dividend could go down from the $1.70 paid in the fourth quarter to what would be paid evenly spread over 24 or maybe $1.62, while keeping it fairly flat '24 versus '23 annually. Help people understand, what was the thought process on why raise the dividend because we get this question a lot, why raise the dividend so much in 4Q '23 if you have to pull it optically down in 1Q '24, while keeping that flat for the year. Steven Vondran : Yeah. Rick, I'll take that one. Look, we didn't take the decision to hold the dividend flat lightly on that, and we were aware of the optics problem with a step down from Q4 to Q1. But we had committed to our shareholders to a certain dividend in 2023 and when we decided to hold it flat in 2024. If we didn't have the step up in Q4, then we would have -- then we wouldn't have hit the number that we had committed to. And so we like to do what we say we're going to do, and that's the reason we kept it there. And we think this has been very well telegraphed. We're trying to be very clear on our Q3 call about what was happening, and we've talked about it since then. And this is a one-time event. And so agree that it wasn't -- it's not the ideal situation, but we wanted to do what we say we're going to do and handle the dividend flat. Richard Prentiss : We always like executives doing what they say they're going to do. And I do think going spread evenly through the year is probably good as well. So thanks, guys and Steve, appreciate all the color is very insightful about how you're sitting in the seat on running the company. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : I appreciate the question. Steve, so you made it pretty clear deleveraging and investing in kind of more developed markets this year is a top priority. So maybe you could talk about the M&A environment right now as a potential use of capital? I know there are some consolidation opportunities out there in Europe. Just wondering if that's an area of expansion for you over time? And then one for Rod, I think you've talked aspirationally about getting to kind of a double-digit AFFO growth rate. Maybe you could just kind of update us longer term with the impact of refinancings in the coming years, the India transaction, where do you think you can get to when stripping out some of the noise from India and some of the changes in interest rates that we've seen recently? Thank you. Steven Vondran : So I'll start talking about the M&A environment. Look, we continue to monitor what's going on in the M&A activity across the portfolio. We're still seeing a dislocation between public and private multiples. And so there's no portfolio out there today that's trading that we think is strategically important that would meet our investment criteria. And that's one of the reasons that we're a little bit out of that market right now. One of the reasons that we're very focused on bringing our leverage down to the high end of our target range is to make sure that we're in a position to take advantage of inorganic opportunities when and if they come to market that we think are strategically important, but also to meet our investment criteria. So we're optimistic that there will be portfolios in the future that are something that we would be interested in. But right now, there's just nothing that I would point to you that we think is, is trading in a range that we would find compelling. Rod Smith : Hey, Eric. Rod here. Thanks for the question. So regarding AFFO growth, let me just hit a couple of points. First, I'll just hit kind of generically what we look at as kind of a growth algorithm for the portfolio. And as Steve said, we're really pleased with the portfolio that we have the diversity that we have throughout developed markets as well as exposure to emerging markets. I would remind you and everyone that in those emerging markets, those are some of the largest populated industries in the world that need more and more infrastructure over time. And we do think having exposure to that is going to be really good for us and our investors in this growth algorithm. But the algorithm is really pretty straightforward. We look at it roughly 5% organic growth from the U.S. That includes some Sprint churn over the next few years there. We do expect that the non-U.S. properties will have incremental growth from there, maybe a couple of hundred basis points. And we think that's possible, certainly from Africa and Latin America over time, maybe not every year, but on average over a long period of time, which we expect to be there. We're looking at upper single-digit, double-digit growth rates from CoreSite with very nice returns. So that looks very good. And of course, as you move down the P&L, you end up with higher growth rates at gross margin and EBITDA margin, particularly with our focus on cost discipline reducing cost, managing costs, both direct costs as well as SG&A and driving expanded margins. So by the time you get down to AFFO, does that 5% U.S. growth, 7% international, double-digit CoreSite, all that can translate into upper single-digit AFFO growth pretty nicely. That's kind of what we look at. And then if you just look at 2023 and in 2024, in '23, we came in AFFO per share growth at around 1% or so. I'll just remind you that included 7% headwind from financing in the year. It included an additional 100 basis point headwind for the VIL reserve and maybe a full percentage point for FX. If you kind of do the math backwards, that core underlying business is solidly upper single-digit growth rate. In 2024, the guide is around 5%, getting us to that $10.33 per share. Financing headwinds in that is about 100 basis points. We have the reserve, broadly speaking, for India, and that's about a 100 basis point headwind as well. And with the FX volatility that we're seeing, and that's about a 200 basis point headwind again, you back up into that and you're getting into that upper single-digit kind of core growth. And I'll remind you that, that -- even that upper single-digit core growth has embedded in it higher-than-normal churn in some of the emerging markets as well as the Sprint churn in the U.S. As we go through that, being able to handle some modest FX and even financing items with churn being at a more normal level, certainly in the upper single-digit growth rates on AFFO and AFFO per share is in our line of sight. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit more about your expectations for Europe in terms of new leasing revenue growth beyond this year and how you think about your scale in the region? And I think there was a bit of a write-down in Spain, can you talk about what drove that? Thank you. Steven Vondran : I'll start with some leasing trends, Rod you can pick it up. So what we're seeing in Europe is we continue to see build-outs by the carriers. And we do see substantial 5G population coverage from the leading MNOs in Germany and Spain. So the pipeline of growth that we see remains solid, but it's more weighted toward colocations. In Germany, we are continuing to work through some of the market complexities that everyone's dealing with there, including some permitting delays and time for power connections. But we do feel good about the progress we've made there. We've brought in resources from other parts of our company to help with that and kind of utilizing best practices. So we do expect some improvement in our time lines there. So that's what we would expect to continue to see in Europe. There's a little bit more colocation driven activity and they're through the bulk of their 5G upgrades in most of our markets. Rod Smith : Hey, Batya. Rod here. So regarding Spain, you obviously saw that we had a write-down in our Spain market of about $80 million, that is exclusively rate driven based on the cost of capital as a function of our annual impairment testing. And I would also add to that, that the Spain market is performing very well in terms of hitting its metrics and milestones up against our original business case. I'd also remind you that the Spain business was really the only business in Europe that is 100% from the Telsius acquisition. There was no legacy business there prior to that transaction. But simply put, the impairment of about $80 million was exclusively a function of rising cost of capital running through a discounted cash flow impairment model. Batya Levi : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Just one on data centers and one housekeeping. First, on data centers, how are the nature of conversations with your customers changing or evolving if at all, as AI use cases become a little bit more pervasive across enterprises. And I'm really getting at, do you sense that, that sort of edge data center builds that maybe was part of the CoreSite acquisition maybe rationale at least initially, the micro data centers at the basis of your towers, is that becoming something that's a little bit more near term or is that more still of a long-term opportunity? And then maybe for Rod, on D&A, what's driving the review and the decision to potentially extend the useful lives of the tower assets? I saw a pretty big step down implied in D&A and your guide for this year? Thanks. Steven Vondran : So I'll start with the data center question. In general, with CoreSite, what we're seeing is demand is still largely driven by enterprises moving to hybrid cloud environment. And that's people who either or either cloud native or primarily cloud or they were still in their on-prem facility, that's still a major driver. We are seeing AI inferencing pick up in our facilities. We've always had some AI applications that we're targeting our facilities. So we are seeing demand there. More broadly speaking, AI is reducing overall capacity in the market or overall supply of the markets, which is leading to some favorable pricing trends for us. When it comes to the Edge deployment, we do think that AI inferencing in particular, in the interface people have with AI will lead to opportunities there. Right now, the near-term opportunities that we're exploring are more niche markets. You may have seen one of our partners put out a blog that we're working with them on an Edge facility kind of in the automotive market to update software on their products. We have a number of POCs that we're working on with various partners that are more niche applications in particular. I think the micro data centers at the base of the towers, facilitating AI is still a little bit further out. And we'll continue to update you guys if there's something to talk about there. But in the meantime, we just continue to work with our customers or potential customers on iterating on what that's going to look like. Rod Smith : Hey, Matt. Regarding the tower life adjustment that you saw running through our numbers here, we essentially increased the tower life from 20 years to 30 years for book purposes for our GAAP books. And that was simply put, it\u2019s just a function of matching up the book life here more closely with what the actual realized life is for the assets. So nothing really more complicated than that other than a realization that these assets last a lot longer than 20 years. So our books will not reflect that going forward. Matthew Niknam : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Brandon Nispel from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Brandon Nispel : Hey. Thank you for taking the question. So when we look at the capital spending to the data center segment and your development pipeline, does that imply your development pipeline -- with your development pipeline, does that imply capital spending expansion beyond 2024, really, how does that inform your decision on spending around your remaining businesses in your tower segments? Thanks. Steven Vondran : Sure. Well, the record amount of sales that we've had is what's led to increasing the development pipeline there. And it really depends on what our sales are this year and how we continue to see the opportunities in that portfolio evolve as to what the future spending are. So it would be premature for me to kind of guide future years' capital there. What I would reinforce is that we have a degree of optionality in our capital spending and that we do have a structure with CoreSite where we also have partners in that business. And so there is some optionality in terms of how much capital we put in, and you could see us using our capital or somebody else's capital to expand if we thought that was a better option for us. But at this point, the development pipeline we have today, we're choosing to sell fine because we're achieving mid-teens stabilized returns, very low risk in our existing campuses, and we continue to see demand rise. So we'll make that assessment into what's appropriate for 2025 and later a little bit later, and we'll share that with you guys at the appropriate time. Rod Smith : Hey, Brandon. Rod here. The only thing I would add to Steve's comments there is that we have full optionality kind of going forward. I think Steve alluded to this, but going beyond 2024 the fact that we're investing $450 million in the data center business in 2024 does not commit us to that level or a higher level of capital spending in that business going forward. So we have a fair amount of flexibility to deploy capital towards towers, towards data centers, towards towers in developed markets, emerging markets, certain countries, not other countries as we go year-to-year. So we will be looking to secure that optionality, protect that optionality so we can always make decisions with our capital that follow the best risk-adjusted rates of return around the globe for any given year. Brandon Nispel : Great. Thank you. Adam Smith : Thank you, everybody for joining today's call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thank you all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Please go ahead, sir. Adam Smith : Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.  I'm joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our President and CEO; and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions.  Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2024 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations for the closing of the sale of our India business and the expected impacts of such sale on our business; our collections expectations in India and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other risks described in documents we subsequently file from time to time with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steven Vondran : Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining today. As you can see in the results we reported this morning, mobile network upgrades and digital transformation trends are driving compelling demand across our tower and data center platforms. 5G rollouts are contributing to an acceleration in our U.S. application pipeline and another sequential step up in co-location and amendment growth in Europe.  Solid demand in Africa continue to drive elevating business growth, and retail demand resulted in another quarter of strong sales performance at CoreSite, which you'll hear more about later on. Before handing the call over to Rod, I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the key factors that have driven performance in our U.S. and Canada tower business and underpin the evaluation and execution of our global expansion strategy.  In particular, we believe that our focus on asset quality, operational excellence and contract structures, all through the prism of long-term value creation, have been the most critical factors in determining our ability to monetize growth in mobile data consumption and our ability to drive leading performance on our assets over multiple network investment cycles.  Over the last 25 years, we've developed a scaled nationwide portfolio of approximately 43,000 sites across the U.S. and Canada. This portfolio has been methodically constructed, primarily through the acquisition of high-quality carrier design and constructive tower portfolios, of which nationwide networks have been built and expanded upon through each successive G and have further benefited from the transition to neutral-host operation.  We've complemented the acquisition of these target assets with select high-quality independent tower provider portfolios, smaller tuck-in portfolios and build-to-suit sites, which taken together represent meaningful scale. Our ability to be highly selective in the assets that we've aggressively pursued for acquisition and development, the assets we've chosen not to pursue and the standards we've used to underwrite our growth are the result of robust internal analysis and due diligence capabilities that rely on data insights that we've accumulated through our history as a tower operator.  These insights have reinforced our understanding of the asset location, competition considerations and structural dynamics come together to create the potential for differentiated value creation. For example, our focus on high-quality assets in premier locations has resulted in a portfolio that's geographically skewed towards suburban and rural environments and transport corridors where the vast majority of Americans live and travel as well as towers that are structurally designed for co-tenancy, which we believe has enabled us to generate leading new business growth on our assets. Similarly, by focusing our assets on significant structural capacity, we believe we can reduce overall operating and redevelopment costs allowing for profit and return maximization at the asset level at industry best speed to market for carrier deployments on our towers.  We are seeing these factors come together to result in significant value creation on our assets. Notably, cash operating profit margins for our U.S. and Canada Property segment have expanded by over 420 basis points since 2016, the year following our Verizon transaction in the U.S. As we continue to focus on driving more new business and efficiency at the asset level, we see a path to further increasing the profitability of our U.S. and Canada business going forward.  Turning to our operating model. Through our focus on efficiency and delivering exceptional value for customers, we've invested in technology and then build up of capabilities that we believe enhance the service we provide our customers as a value of our product offering. For example, through our application services automation programs, we've continuously reduced cycle times, further supporting critical speed-to-market advantages for our customers, which translates into accelerated revenue realization for our business. Elsewhere in our Services segment, we've combined investments in data quality and governance with the development of internal data platforms to improve our overall service offerings and asset integrity. Over time, customer feedback shows that these investments have resulted in a consistent upward trajectory in customer satisfaction, achieved by providing a differentiated customer experience of high asset integrity.  In our land management operations, we're also taking approach that's focused on our customers' needs and expanding the profitability of our sites. Through our Tower Asset Protection Program, we performed thousands of transactions a year that improved the ground rights and eased site access conditions, a critical factor for our customers. And over the last decade, we've deployed significant capital at attractive rates of return and admitted thousands of contracts to protect our assets and mitigate growth in land rent, supporting margin performance.  Finally, as we've said publicly many times, contract terms and structure are critical to realizing the full value of the assets we only manage. And our approach has been centered around creating long-term value for American Tower and our carrier customers, even when it can potentially come at the expense of short-term wins.  Perhaps the most important capability we've built internally over the last 2 decades is knowing our assets and understanding their value. As a result, we've been able to achieve outstanding growth and create significant shareholder value at our traditional MLA agreement, while also developing innovative structures such as the comprehensive MLA. Under these agreements, we're able to secure guaranteed growth over a multiyear period in a way that maximizes the value of our assets while providing a degree of insulation from quarter-to-quarter ebbs and flows in wireless network spending. Critically, we've seen that these contracts represented a compelling value proposition for our carrier customers. By lowering their total cost of ownership when compared to self-performance, by providing a framework to leverage our skill for their networks that translates to budgetary operational visibility and by creating administrative efficiencies that yield lower transaction costs on sell-side deployments.  Taking all this together, we've seen this focus on the right assets, high-quality contracts with operational excellence facilitate increasing monetization and growth in mobile data consumption and corresponding carrier's CapEx increases over time.  Over the course of the 4G investment cycle between 2010 and 2018, average mobile data consumption for smartphone increased from less than 100 megawatts per month to 7 gigabytes per month. And over that period, carriers were deploying approximately $29 billion annually on average, up from approximately $23 billion during 3G.  As we have moved into the 5G investment cycle, for early 2019 till today, we've once again seen mobile data consumption for smartphone grow to almost 30 gigabytes per month in 2024. We've seen early 5G subscribers consuming roughly 2x the mobile data compared to the average 4G subscriber. And we see average annual carrier CapEx step up to approximately $36 billion a year.  This CapEx investment translated to the approximately $230 million in year-over-year co-location and amendment growths we delivered last year, much of which was attributed to 5G activity as well as an expectation for growth on a per-site basis in 2024 that significantly exceeds the average seen during the 4G deployment cycle. That brings us to today, where we continue to see all of our key customers actively working on network upgrades and rollouts and the 5G cycle playing out in line with the broader expectations underwritten our long-term guidance. On our last call, we indicated that we expected a year-over-year increase in contributions for our Services segment due in part to early indications of uptick in our application pipeline as well as conversations that our teams were having with our customers on the ground. The activity we saw in Q1 reinforces that expectation. Specifically, contributions in our Services segment for the quarter came in ahead of our internal expectations. And on the application side, Q1 volume was over 70% higher than what we saw in Q4 of last year. In fact, March represented the highest volume level over the trailing 12 months. It was supported by broad-based step-ups across our major U.S. customers. Now while there's only some level of risk associated with our expectations in the Services segment, I'm pleased to say that what we've seen thus far supports the 2024 guidance we provided in February, including approximately $195 million, the expected services revenue contributions; approximately 4.7% organic tenant billings growth at $180 million to $190 million in year-over-year co-location and amendment growth, one of our strongest years to date.  So as we move forward, we believe our U.S. tower portfolio is uniquely positioned to continue driving compelling growth as 5G expected increases in mobile data consumption and associated carrier investments driving increasing demand for our assets over time.  Importantly, by leveraging that same expertise to develop our leading global portfolio, we're well positioned to monetize similar trends across our global footprint, while delivering a differentiated experience and value proposition to our customers. Further, we believe the factors that we're taking in through today as well as the global focus on increasing efficiency in our cost structure provide a path to continue converting topline growth at a rate that expands already attractive cash operating profit margins and creates incremental shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Rod to discuss Q1 performance and our updated outlook. Rod? Rodney Smith : Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We are off to a solid start to 2024 with Q1 performance exceeding our initial expectations across many of our key metrics. These results, together with the positive trends highlighted by Steve, the various initiatives we have in place to drive profitability and margin expansion and our optionality and discipline and selectively deploying capital towards projects yielding the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return, give us confidence in our ability to drive strong, sustained growth, quality of earnings and shareholder returns for 2024 and beyond.  Before I dive into the results and our revised 2024 outlook, I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, the strong reoccurring fundamentals that underpin our business are again highlighted in our Q1 performance with consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 5.4% and another exceptional leasing quarter at CoreSite, including its highest quarter of retail new business signed since Q4 of 2020. Furthermore, we continue to demonstrate cost discipline resulting in strong year-over-year cash adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, which I will touch on in a moment.  Next, in India, the collection trends we saw in Q4 of 2023 continued into Q1, allowing us to reverse approximately $29 million of previously reserved revenue. Separately, while we continue to anticipate a second half 2024 closing on our sale of ATC India to Brookfield, we have already made progress in accelerating certain payments included in the potential $2.5 billion total proceeds associated with the transaction, including the repatriation of approximately $100 million net of withholding's tax back to the U.S. earlier this month.  Additionally, we are making progress towards monetizing our optionally convertible debentures issued by VIL ahead of the anticipated closing of our India transaction. Executing the intended purpose of the debentures in serving as a liquid asset to backstop outstanding receivable balances, we expect to use the anticipated proceeds from the India sale to pay down existing indebtedness. We will continue to keep our shareholders informed as incremental progress is made towards the closing of our transaction. Finally, we successfully accessed the debt capital markets last month, issuing $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of 5.3%, with proceeds used to pay down floating rate debt. Turning to first quarter property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on Slide 6, consolidated property revenue growth was 3.3% or over 4.5% excluding noncash straight line revenue while absorbing roughly 100 basis points of FX headwinds. U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was approximately 1.8% or over 4% excluding straight line, which includes over 1% impact from Sprint churn. International revenue growth was approximately 3.7% or roughly 6% excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, which includes a benefit associated with the improved collections in India, partially offset by the timing of the sale of our Mexico fiber business at the end of Q1 in 2023 and a reduction in Latin America termination fees as compared to the prior year. Finally, revenue in our Data Centers business increased by 10.6%, continuing the outperformance versus our initial underwriting plan as strong demand for hybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture continues and the backlog of record new business signed over the last 2 years begins to commence in a meaningful way. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was 5.4%, supported by strong demand across our global footprint. In our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 4.6% and over 5.5% absent Sprint-related churn. As expected, growth in the quarter was slightly below our full-year guidance of 4.7%. As we lap modestly elevated churn that commenced in Q2 of 2023, we would expect Q2 and Q3 growth rates to each accelerate to roughly 5% before a step down in Q4 as we commence the final tranche of contracted Sprint churn, all supportive of our 2024 outlook expectation.  Our International segment drove 6.5% in organic tenant billings growth, reflecting an expected step down from the Q4 2023 rate of 7.7%, as we see moderation in CPI-linked escalators. Meanwhile, contributions from co-location and amendments remain strong with another sequential acceleration in Europe and a continuation of elevated contribution rates of around 8% in Africa.  Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EBITDA grew 5.2% or nearly 8% excluding the impacts of noncash straight line while absorbing 90 basis points in FX headwinds. Cash-adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 240 basis points year-over-year to 64.9% taking certain expense timing in India reserve benefits and further supported by our ongoing cost management focus. In fact, cash SG&A, excluding bad debt, declined approximately 5% year-over-year in Q1 and was down roughly 7% of our Q1 2022 levels.  Additionally, gross margin from our U.S. services business came in just over $16 million, a decline of roughly 50% year-over-year, though representing an acceleration of nearly 70% of our Q4 2023 levels. This performance, together with the broad-based application pipeline buildup discussed by Steve in his prepared remarks, gives us confidence in our expectation for accelerating activity continuing through the duration of the year and is supportive of our full-year U.S. services outlook.  Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 10% and 9.8%, respectively, supported by high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth to attributable AFFO. Now shifting to our revised full-year outlook. As I mentioned, we are pleased with the results to date and the sustainable demand trends underpinning our performance. However, given the close proximity to our previously released guidance, we have kept core full-year assumptions largely unchanged. With that in mind, our revised outlook includes several notable updates. First, we have taken the strong collections activity in India through the first quarter, which, as I mentioned earlier, resulted in approximately $29 million in revenue reserve reversals compared to approximately $16 million in revenue reserves assumed for Q1 in our prior outlook, resulting in a net benefit to plan of $45 million for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO.  Reserve assumptions for April through December remained unchanged, resulting in a net reserve for the year of $20 million compared to the prior year outlook assumption of $65 million. Next, we have revised our FX assumptions for the year, resulting in a modest headwind compared to our prior outlook. Finally, while our net interest assumptions remain relatively unchanged, we have increased our interest expense due to elevated rates, which was partially offset by modest interest expense reductions through a reduced debt balance attributed to the accelerated India proceeds I mentioned earlier and further offset by higher interest income. With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 8. We are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $30 million compared to prior outlook, driven by $45 million of upside related to the positive collections in India during the first quarter, partially offset by $15 million associated with negative FX impacts. We are reiterating our prior outlook expectations for organic tenant billings growth across all regions, including approximately 4.7% in the U.S. and Canada, 11% to 12% in Africa, 5% to 6% in Europe and 2% in both LatAm and APAC, collectively driving approximately 5% for international and 5% on a consolidated basis. We will continue to assess our first quarter momentum as we work through the year.  Turning to Slide 9. We are increasing our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $40 million as compared to prior outlook, driven by the flow-through of the revised revenue reserve assumptions in India, partially offset by $5 million of FX headwinds.  Moving to Slide 10. We are similarly raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $40 million at the midpoint and approximately $0.09 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $10.42, supported by the revised Indian reserve assumption benefits, partially offset by FX. As I mentioned, although we are raising expectations for interest expense, it is offset on a net basis by a similar increase in interest income.  Turning to Slide 11. We are reiterating our capital allocation plans for 2024, which is focused on selectively funding projects we expect to drive the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return, sustained growth and quality of earnings, executing on an accelerated pathway to balance sheet strength and financial flexibility and delivering an attractive total shareholder return profile as discussed on our Q4 2023 earnings call. This includes maintaining a relatively flat annual common dividend declaration of $6.48 per share or approximately $3 billion in 2024, with an expectation to resume growth again in 2025, all subject to Board approval. Moving to the right side of the slide, our disciplined approach to capital allocation, together with recurring topline growth and its high conversion to profitability through cost management, all support the progress we've made to achieving our goal of 5x net leverage by the end of the year. While our Q1 net leverage already stands at 5x, it is important to note that the metric for this quarter benefits from the Indian reserve reversals previously mentioned, and we'd expect to be above 5x in Q2. These efforts, combined with our successful capital markets execution year-to-date, have further reinforced our investment-grade balance sheet as a strategic asset, which will remain a key focus moving forward.  Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we are off to a great start to 2024. Our visibility into a solid foundation of recurring contracted growth across our global business combined with an accelerating pipeline supporting our expectations for future activity, a keen focus on cost discipline and margin expansion and a continued demonstration of strategically deploying capital while enhancing balance sheet strength, gives us a high degree of confidence in our ability to drive strong, sustained growth over the long term for our shareholders while being a best-in-class operator for our stakeholders globally. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam : Congrats on the quarter. Just 2, if I could. First, on the U.S., maybe if you can get a little bit more color on the acceleration in activity you saw in the quarter and maybe what that implies for services and new leasing expectations going forward. I'm more curious whether this was broad-based across the big 3 and maybe even DISH or more limited in nature. And then secondly, on Data Centers, I think you talked about your highest quarter of signed retail leasing since 4Q '20, any color you can share in terms of what's driving the uptick in new business? And it seems to imply there isn't much in the way of macro headwinds or caution that some of your peers have talked about. But again, just curious if there are any signs of macro caution there. Steven Vondran : Sure. Thanks for the question. In the U.S., again, we're seeing an acceleration in Q1 relative to Q4. And our application pipeline coming in, in Q1 was about 70% higher than Q4. And our services gross margin came in at about $16 million in the quarter, which was higher than we had expected. So what we're seeing is an acceleration in activity that really underpins the guidance that we gave last quarter. And just to kind of reiterate what that is, on our services, we're expecting our services about $195 million in revenue, about $100 million in gross margin. And look, while that services is inherently hard to predict sometimes, the activity we're seeing in Q1 along with the conversations we're having with kind of the boots on the ground teams from our customers, that gives us confidence that we're going to hit that services guide for the year. And so we'll continue to watch it and see how that cadence goes throughout the rest of the year. But everything we're seeing in Q1 gives us some optimism there.  When it comes to our property revenue growth from that, again, I'll remind you that a lot of our revenue assumptions are underpinned by our comprehensive MLAs. So at this point, the acceleration that we're seeing in growth, that doesn't change our guidance in terms of what we're expecting to see in the U.S. Again, I'll reiterate that. We're expecting to see organic tenant billings growth of approximately 4.7% in the U.S. And that will be a little bit different quarter-by-quarter.  In Q1, it was 4.6%. And I will expect that to go up a little bit in the middle of the year and then the final tranche of Sprint churn that hits in October, we'll weigh that down a bit in Q4. But overall, we're encouraged by that. In terms of what we're seeing, it is fairly broad-based. I don't want to get into individual customer activity levels, but we are seeing some broad-based activity pick up in the U.S. with all of our major customers. And again, we're encouraged that, that's going to continue for the rest of the year. When it comes to CoreSite, yes, we have 2 years of kind of record sales and we have a healthy pipeline this year. And we've got a tough comp compared to last year. So I don't know that we'll achieve another record year of sales, but we're hoping. And we did have a very strong quarter on retail this year, and that was really exciting to see.  In terms of the headwinds for that business, we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. Again, what's underpinning the growth in CoreSite right now, the bulk of that growth is being driven by enterprises that are going to hybrid cloud IT infrastructure. And there's a long tail event that we see out there. There's still a lot of companies that have their own data centers, and there are a lot of companies that went cloud native or that had moved everything to the cloud, and they're looking for a different cost structure, and they're going to this hybrid environment. And that's still the biggest driver we have, and we see a very, very long tail of that activity out there.  We are seeing an uptick in activity from AI. In particular, the inferencing portion of AI models is kind of perfectly suited for CoreSite. You're going to have these large learning models that are done in the big hyperscale data centers, but when you start interfacing with the users to provide that data to them and also get the inputs from them, you need a distribution channel. And CoreSite is perfectly suited to provide that type of distribution. So we are seeing some activity there.  In terms of kind of industry headwinds, we're not seeing a falloff in our funnel today. We're watching it just like everyone else is. Some of the things that people have highlighted, some of the demand and the supply issues are things that actually drive pricing up, so where we have markets that are constrained supplied, that's actually driving pricing up. We've got more megawatts under construction today than we ever had before at CoreSite, so we're planning for that demand cycle to continue. But I'll just reiterate that a large portion of that is pre-leased, more than we ever have before.  In fact, our pre-leasing percentage right now of the stuff that we have under construction is about 35%. And that's down a tick from last quarter because we've placed some things in service, but we're still seeing healthy demand for pre-leasing, and we'll continue to explore that as well. We're still seeing growth in interconnect, and I know that there's been some discussion out there about grooming of cross connects. And that's something that we constantly see with customers as they're trying to optimize our cost structure. But even with a little bit of grooming going on, we're still seeing healthy growth there. So again, I think we're very optimistic about the demand for CoreSite, the pipeline that we're seeing, hoping for another record year of sales, but that's a tough comp. So I'm sure my sales team is cringing hearing me say that, but we feel good about it. And we're not seeing headwinds weigh on it today. But again, we're watching the market just like everybody else is, and we'll be appropriately cautious if we see that demand slowing down. But that's not what we're seeing from our sales teams today. Rodney Smith : Matt, this is Rod. If I could just add briefly here 1 or 2 comments. So of course, as Steve said, we've had record levels of new business in the past. And what that is leading to is higher revenue growth now as we're delivering that new business that we signed up over the last couple of years. So you saw in the quarter, we had a north of 10% revenue growth rate. As I said in my prepared remarks, that is the result of delivering on that new business, those record levels of new business we signed up over the last couple of years. The last couple of years of new business has also led to a high level of backlog. So we're up in the close to $60 million in terms of backlog, which is signed deals that we haven't commenced into revenue yet. That's up from a run rate of being closer to $40 million or $45 million in the last couple of years. So that the new business we sign up, it translates into backlog and then it translates into revenue and revenue growth. So with the activity level we've seen in the last couple of years, the high backlog we have today, that positions CoreSite very well to have high levels of growth over the next couple of years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Michael Rollins : Just following up on your comments regarding the pickup in domestic activity in the first quarter. Do you see this as a rising tide for the tower category? Or do you see American Tower taking share from your competitors? And then secondly, you referenced, I think, in one of the slides and some of your comments that the activity is supporting your long-term guide for the domestic business. If you can recap for us where you see the longer-term average annual organic tenant billings growth and how these changes in activity levels may influence those outcomes? Steven Vondran : Sure. Thanks for the question. So what we're seeing in the U.S., it's clearly -- it's 1 quarter results. And again, the conversations that we're having give us the optimism that our guide for the year is kind of spot on in terms of the customer is starting to ramp up. I don't have a lot of visibility into what my competitors are seeing. So I don't think I can give an opinion on whether what we're seeing is materially different than what they're seeing.  But when I reflect on what the customers need to do to complete their mid-band 5G rollouts and when I think about what their long-term goals are on their network, there's a lot of work yet to be done. So what I think that we're seeing play out is the same cycle we saw in 4G, the same cycle we saw in 3G, where there's an initial push, then there's a little bit of a slowdown while they're optimizing their network and then there's another push. And I think that we're starting to see that.  Now where I do think we've really differentiated ourselves is that our MLAs do provide a little bit of an easy button for our customers, and we're able to give them great speed to market, great cost predictability. And I think that, that does give us greater market share over time. Back to kind of our longer-term guide for the U.S., just to remind everyone, we said that we expect at least 5% organic tenant billings growth on average for the period between 2023 and 2027, and that would be 6% excluding the Sprint churn that we have. And in 2023, that OTBG number was 5.3%, and we're projecting 4.7% this year. And that's all while we're absorbing greater than 100 basis points of Sprint churn a year in each of those years. So we see the activity levels very supportive of that long-term guide.  And again, we feel good about the cycle of 5G. We feel good about the carrier activity that we're seeing and about the way 5G is performing in terms of giving them megabytes of data or gigabytes of data a lot cheaper than they could produce it any other way. Michael Rollins : And just 1 other quick one. Any shift in the mix between amendments and densification within the domestic activity? Steven Vondran : A little bit. Again, I think when you think about these cycles that the carriers build in, the first push that you see is always a coverage network and that implies overlays on existing sites. And then, when they slow down and start optimizing, part of that optimization is infill to get better quality of service where they might have some coverage gaps or might not be getting the optimal service. And that always implies more co-locations. So we are seeing some demand for that as well.  Again, we're -- we see some kind of broad-based activity, so it's -- we're seeing both, and we're seeing that across the carriers. And again, I would just remind folks that we do have comprehensive MLAs in place with some of our customers that smooth out some of those cycles of the ups and downs of the activity levels. We did disclose in Q1 that one of our major customers rolled off of their comprehensive MLAs. And so for that customer, when you come off the comprehensive portion and get to more of the kind of pay by the drink, there is more seasonality in terms of the commencement of those leases as they sign them. And so from that perspective, activity levels will drive the -- that portion of our business, more than they do for the ones that are in the comprehensive MLAs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. Steve, thanks for the comments on the portfolio review. Maybe you could just review the M&A market more broadly. Are there things that you might be looking at doing either buying or selling beyond the India situation? And how you think about that? And then any other things that come out of that, any sort of portfolio assessment? And then any updates on the deal timing in India? I think we talked last quarter perhaps about sort of October 1 as being kind of a placeholder, but any updates on regulatory processes in India at this point? Steven Vondran : Yes. Sure. I'll start with India. No updates at this point. It's very hard to predict when that approval will come through. So we're still expecting second half of the year. But we'll let you know as soon as we know what's happening on that.  In terms of broader M&A, our team is looking at everything that's kind of out there for sale. And that's just part of our standard practice. There's nothing that we're seeing that's compelling that would take us off of our capital allocation priorities that we laid out at the beginning of the year, and that is our first priority of any of our capital allocations paying our dividend, but then we're really focused on delevering after that, making sure we get down to our 5x net leverage. And so when we're looking at the M&A that's out there, there's nothing that we're seeing today that is strategically important or at the right price that would make us change our mind on that at this point.  When it comes to our own portfolio, and I just want to be clear about this, we're not doing a strategic review specifically, if anything, meaning there's nothing that we're intending to sell out there today. Having said that, we do have some businesses that may not be as strategic for us or they may not be at scale. And if the right buyer with the right price came along, we would consider something there. But as we look at our portfolio kind of across the globe, our goal is to figure out if there are businesses that are not meeting our original underwriting criteria. The first thing is what can we do to fix those, how do we drive greater sales, how do we get more efficiency in the market to drive margins up? And we'll try that first. If we decided to exit other market, they'd have to be because we're getting the right price and that we think it's more accretive to our shareholders than holding it. So at this point, there's nothing to point to in our portfolio that we're actively looking to dispose of. But again, there are some nonstrategic businesses for us out there that we would consider if the right buyer and the right price came along. Rodney Smith : Simon, this is Rod. Simon, I'm going to add a couple of comments on India just to give everyone listening a couple of the numbers and a reminder. So as Steve said, the timing is still second half of this year. Everything is going well, certainly within our expectation. I just want to remind everyone that we announced when we signed a deal with Brookfield to sell 100% of India that it would have total proceeds that could be up to $2.5 billion. That comes in a couple of different forms. It will be $2 billion in terms of the -- let's call it, the purchase price, which includes the intercompany debt that we have in there as well as the term loan that we have in India. The intercompany debt is little less than $0.5 billion, and then, the term loan is about $120 million. It also includes some working capital, some receivables and the OCD that I'm sure you're familiar with that we put in place with VIL. So the OCD was about $200 million. The other India receivables was a little less than about $200 million. And then there's also a ticking fee component that we get that is based on the mechanics between signing and closing.  You put all those things together, it comes up to about $2.5 billion. We are in the process of realizing and taking some of these proceeds out of India. So you did see -- and you'll see in the details, we removed about $100 million from India and took it back to the U.S. That's based on some of the positive collection trends that we've seen in India. Those receivables belong to us and is part of the $2.5 billion.  We also converted 90% of the $200 million OCD, and then, we subsequently liquidated that right kind of during and after the successful FPO that VIL had done, which we were happy to see. So the 90% of the $200 million that we converted, we sold it into the market, and we realized a little over $200 million on that. So that's worked out really well.  And again, I'll just highlight that it's achieving our original purpose, which is giving us multiple avenues to liquidate that receivable balance, increasing the probability of actually realizing cash, and it worked well. So we have over $200 million. We will -- you will see us remove that from India and bring it back to the U.S. as well. And on closing, you'll see the $2 billion plus any kind of ticking fee probably be paired up around closing just to give everyone the mechanics of those and what to expect in terms of the proceeds on closing. Simon Flannery : That's great. And any update on dividend policy beyond this year? Steven Vondran : Yes, what we've said is we plan to resume growth in 2025, subject to Board approval, and we'll give specifics on our Q4 call in February '25, as we always do, in terms of what that's going to look like. Over the long term, what you can think about is that our dividend per share and AFFO per share growth to be similar over the longer term. And so there may be some short-term changes in that.  So for example, with our India divestiture, there will be some dilution in AFFO per share. So there might be a dislocation there from the AFFO per share growth and what we will see in taxable income. So over the long term, you can think about those being similar, but for 2025, in particular, we'll get more specific about that in February of next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Prentiss from Raymond James. Ric Prentiss : I want to follow up on Simon's question there on the dividend. I appreciate you can't give a lot of color there yet. But what kind of payout ratio are you trying to achieve that? Is it in like 100% of attributable AFFO per share? Was it more like 90% and the growth rate is going to be more on that long term, again Board decision? But is it more a payout ratio? Or is it an absolute level? Or is it growth that you're kind of pairing up dividend per share with attributable AFFO per share? Steven Vondran : Well, if we continue to grow it kind of in line with our AFFO per share growth, you can think of that payout ratio staying kind of in that 60% to 65% range. Rodney Smith : I would just add to that quickly, Rick, to that 65% range. It does leave us between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of additional, let's say, AFFO to put towards other uses, either CapEx or anything else we want to do. So that ratio of that 60% to 65% kind of fits in well with giving us a lot of financial flexibility to invest capital. Ric Prentiss : And It's a good thing not to pay it all out, leave yourselves some room to grow the business. Appreciate that. One question we get a lot. And Steve, you've talked to a lot on the call already, prepared remarks and questions of Michael and others, about U.S. green shoots, possibility of improvement. A lot of investors we talk to always look to like carrier CapEx. And you've pointed to it as well, \"I view carrier CapEx as an indicator, but not a perfect linear indicator of leasing. Can you help us understand how you look at carrier CapEx and why it may or may not be a perfect indicator to what can happen in any given quarter or a year on the leasing activity you see? Steven Vondran : Sure. I'm happy to. Thanks for the question, Rick. So when you look at carrier CapEx, first, I would point out that we're seeing -- the estimates for carrier CapEx and 5G are around that $35 billion, $36 billion per year mark on average. And that's up about $5 billion or $6 billion from what we saw in 4G, and that was up $5 billion or $6 billion from 3G. So we do see overall CapEx increasing.  The reason it's not a perfect algorithm for growth on the tower side is that CapEx goes to a lot of different uses. It's not all going into the radio access network that goes on towers. Some of that CapEx goes into the core of the network and some of it goes to the fiber to connect the network. And so there's a lot of CapEx that's not related to just the rent on the sites. So it's not a perfect algorithm for that.  And in fact, I think I'd point you to one of my customers' comments earlier this year where they said that their C-band deployments will continue at pace and that the savings that they're getting in their CapEx this year is coming from core and fiber. So when we think about carrier CapEx, what we're really trying to focus on is what we think the CapEx is going to be on the tower sites themselves.  And while the carriers don't break that out specifically, that's where we take our market intelligence and what we're hearing from the teams on the ground to get a better idea from our perspective on what the activity is going to be based on what they're preparing to do on their sites. And so the CapEx does matter. If they're spending more CapEx, that does imply, generally speaking, more activity, less means less, but it's not a perfect algorithm. Ric Prentiss : Sure. And back to another thing Michael pointed out, it seems to us also that, if you do see the shift from coverage and amendment activity to new lease activity and new co-locations, typically, your average rent is going to be higher, obviously, for a new lease than an amendment even though CapEx might not be very different than the carrier. Is that another possibility? Steven Vondran : Yes, that's a possibility, Rick. A new lease rate is typically higher than an amendment rate, but you get more amendments than you do new leases, so there's a little bit of a trade-off there. But look, it's all positive, and it's all the things that underpin our long-term guidance, and that's what our expectation for growth is. It's a combination of new leases and amendments as we go through a 5G cycle. It's a long cycle, and it's going to replicate very closely what we saw in 4G and 3G, and that's what we're seeing playing out today. Ric Prentiss : Let me circle back, last one for me, Rod, you mentioned, obviously, you have excess cash that you can use for capital allocation, construction projects at new returns. But you would also think stock buyback comes into the equation at some point. I know you're trying to get to the 5.0. Help us understand the process getting through India and then what would trigger and allow you to think that stock buybacks are an available option given where the stock price is at. Rodney Smith : Yes. It's a great question, Rick. And as we've -- as Steve and I have been saying really for the last couple of quarters, we are very focused on driving organic growth, very focused on driving operational efficiency, reducing our overall direct and SG&A cost to drive AFFO and AFFO per share growth where when it comes to capital allocation, we're very focused on delevering and strengthening our balance sheet and continuing momentum of adding CapEx and with the best projects that we see driving quality of earnings, the right risk profile, the right growth profile over the long term. So all that is clear and remains our focus.  You did see we are at 5x this quarter in terms of net leverage. So we've achieved our goal for Q1. I'll point out, Rick, for you that, that was benefited by the payments that we saw in India and the absence of, let's say, the need for the reserve that we had in our outlook. So there is some timing benefits there that could be as much as $40 million, $45 million in Q1. What that means is we expect that leverage during the year will be back up above 5 slightly between now and the end of the year. And we're going to continue to work on getting that down to 5 in a sustainable way, and the goal is by the end of the year.  Now we may not get there, but we'll be very close, I think, and we'll be in good shape. So with all that said, at some point, when we have leverage at our target range or below in a sustained fashion, then I think all options are on the table. At that point, we have regained full financial flexibility. In order to really engage in buybacks, I think we'd want to see more certainty around the economics, more certainty around issues of inflation and interest rates and those sorts of things.  Today I think we all appreciate the fact that there is still a fair amount of uncertainty there, and we're going to be prudent in making sure our balance sheet is strong and that we are managing the business effectively to drive AFFO growth. That means reducing our floating rate debt, reducing our vulnerability, let's say, to changes in short-term rates. That's kind of the focus for this year.  So I would say when you think about buybacks, Rick, it's probably more towards the end of this year, we'll be reassessing things. At that point, I think we'll be in a little bit different position when it comes to sustained leverage. Hopefully, by then, there's more certainty in the economic outlook and where interest rates are going. And at that point, we can do a full consideration of different allocation options. Ric Prentiss : Well, I sure hope so more certainty and visibility. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. David Barden : I guess my first question would just be related to foreign currency movements. We've been seeing some pretty extraordinary moves in the last 6 months, the Argentinian peso, the Nigerian naira, the -- even more recently the yen. Could you kind of share with us any evolution in your thinking around hedging and how that might be impacting your outlooks as you give them for the year? And then the second question would be, similarly, we seem to be at an inflection point maybe in fixed wireless access, some carriers getting more aggressive, some carriers getting less aggressive. Could you kind of share how you are looking at fixed wireless access, as an increasing contributor or a decreasing contributor to your growth outlook for the macro side? Rodney Smith : David, thanks for the question. I'll hit the FX one, and then, I think Steve will take the one on fixed wireless. So when it comes to FX, you're absolutely right to point out, we do have some FX headwinds in the business. That's clear. This year, the FX headwinds that we're really seeing are coming through Africa, and primarily in Nigeria, which I think you're aware of. So when you look at outlook to outlook, we're down about $15 million in this guide on property revenue, just about $5 million on EBITDA and AFFO, which is about $0.01 dilution or headwind when it comes to the outlook adjustment there.  And the puts and takes there, we've seen although for the year, year-on-year, we have an FX tailwind across Latin America. Outlook to outlook, there's a bit of a headwind that brewed up here in the first quarter. And then we have the opposite in Africa where we have a pretty significant headwind in FX across the region year-on-year, but outlook to outlook is actually a positive kind of tailwind in Africa. So not all currencies kind of move together. We certainly benefit at times more than others in terms of the portfolio effect where if one currency is under pressure, another one may be up a little bit.  If you look at the spot rates, we actually could improve revs by about $17 million. It's too early to build that into our outlook, but that's what the spots would tell us. So from a hedging standpoint, I mean, one of the things that we've done is we've diversified our debt structure quite a bit in the last several years. And we're up now to about $7.5 billion of euro-denominated debt to kind of match up with our euro-based business that we have in Europe.  The other thing I would say is the international businesses that we have, let's say, across Latin America and in Africa and in APAC, the cash flow that we generate there, we continue to kind of reinvest back in the business if we don't take it out through our intercompany lending. And of course, when you have devaluation, we're still operating in local currency in those markets. Our P&L is denominated in local currency. So all of the revenues and expenses are all in local currency. So a lot of it is translational. There isn't a lot of hedging that we can do or we think is prudent to do in Africa and Latin America. But reinvesting those cash flows back into assets in those regions, I think, is a pretty good long-term play in terms of creating value for our shareholders. But with that said, to the extent that we see any markets that have outsized FX headwinds, that certainly comes into our capital allocation thinking. And one of the benefits of our portfolio is it is very broad. And we don't have to invest capital in every country, every year. We can allocate it where it makes most sense for our shareholders and where it will create the most value, and we do that actively and dynamically.  The other thing you've heard us say this before, David, we certainly build FX headwinds or FX impacts into our underwriting model. It's in all of our deals, so we do weighted average cost of capitals country by country. We also have the Fisher effect and expectation of inflation differentials between the foreign country as well as the U.S. currency that we invest in, and we build that in out over the long term within the model.  So it's hard to get FX right on in the short term. But I think when you pull that out over a 20-, 30-year period, you have a much better chance of getting that right in the long-term model. So in terms of our underwriting over the long term, we still feel good about the portfolio that we have and our ability to handle the FX. But it is important to note that in the short term, we have the ability to lean in and out of different places depending on what's happening in FX, is one of those things that we would certainly be looking at. Steven Vondran : Yes. I would just add that we also use contractual mechanisms to also control it to some extent. It's very important for us to have CPI-linked escalators in all those international markets to make sure that you do recover some of the differential that you have from inflation from the U.S. in those markets. And in some markets, we also will have some of the revenues pegged to U.S. dollar. For example, in Nigeria, the -- about 40% of the revenue in Nigeria is passed through power.  And so that's kind of passing through at the same rate that we're paying it, so that's a little bit of a natural hedge. The remaining 60%, about half of that is pegged to the U.S. dollar. That we get paid in naira, but it's pegged to whatever the exchange rate is when we go in there. So we do use contractual mechanisms to hedge as well. As well as what Rod said that most of our expenses are local currency expenses, so there's some natural hedge there as well. Fixed wireless, so on the fixed wireless side, look, we're seeing our carrier customers aggressively going into fixed wireless. And it's -- we've always said that it might be one of the first use cases in the 5G, and we're seeing that play out. I think the numbers are about 10 million subs that were at total for fixed wireless in the U.S. At this point, we're not seeing them deploy stand-alone fixed wireless networks by the major carriers. We do have stand-alone fixed wireless for some of the small guys, the WISPs and people like that. But at this point, the carriers continue to utilize the excess capacity they have in their current builds. What that means for the long term, I think it's too early to say. I'm encouraged by the ARPUs they're getting, the growth that they're seeing, the competitiveness that they're showing with the fixed-line broadband.  And if those trends continue and if they're able to kind of underwrite some additional incremental network builds to support that, that would be upside to our base case. When we've set our long-term guide in the U.S., we were not anticipating any type of a stand-alone fixed wireless build or incremental network activity driven by fixed wireless. So that would be upside for us if it happens. But I think it's too early to tell right now if that's going to drive a lot of additional business or not. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Nicholas Del Deo : First on CoreSite, your MMR per cabinet growth has been really strong. Steve, you talked about that a little bit earlier. I guess can you help to decompose the drivers a bit more, how -- like-for-like pricing gains versus mix changes versus higher consumption per cabinet might be driving that.  And you also noted that you had a record quarter for retail signings in the quarter. I guess more generally, can you comment on the mix of retail versus scale deals that you've had in recent periods and what's in your funnel today? Steven Vondran : Sure. Let me attack the first part of that. So when you look at pricing across our markets, what's really driving it is supply-demand dynamics. And so we're seeing similar increases and retail scale, hyperscale pricing in those markets. There's probably a little bit more increase in hyperscale at this point because contiguous capacity is becoming more rare and because they have the lowest pricing to begin with kind of in the markets. And so what we've seen across all of our markets is the supply is less than the demand.  And part of that is just -- I think AI and other use cases have taken off faster than people expected. And the entire ecosystem has not provided as much capacity as what people are seeking. And that's really the underlying driver for what that pricing is happening in our facilities. Our funnel has a healthy mix of retail and scale. I don't have the exact breakdown at my fingertips. But a lot of that's driven by what capacity we have to sell and what use capacity is out there for some of the scale installations.  And so, yes, depending on which facility and which market, we could be flexible in terms of what we offer people, and we can be selective on the customers. Because CoreSite is really the interconnection hub, it's not just a retail or co-location facility, we don't underwrite -- we don't write all the business that comes to us. We're not a low-cost provider per se in those markets. People come to us because of the interconnection we provide. And so we curate a mix, and we try to balance networks, cloud players and enterprises with a healthy mix of retail in a way that gives us the kind of industry-leading returns on our capital that CoreSite was delivering before we bought them and that we continue to use to underwrite our model there. Nicholas Del Deo : Steve, have higher power densities influenced the MMR up for grab at all? Or is it more just the like-for-like pricing dynamic you described? Steven Vondran : I mean, certainly, look, we price the higher density cabinets more because they're taking up more power. So that does influence it. We did have a press release a couple of weeks ago about being NVIDIA certified in some of our facilities. And so certainly, when you're putting GPUs in versus CPUs, there's a pricing differential on that cabinet. But really what's driving the pricing increases across the board or the supply-demand dynamics? Nicholas Del Deo : Okay. Okay. And then can I ask one on expenses? You've always run a pretty tight ship from that perspective. It seems like you're running even tighter than normal this year. I guess can you drill down into any of the specific actions you're taking to really help keep costs down. Steven Vondran : Sure. Let me give you kind of the backdrop to it, then I can give you a few examples. So over the last decade, we've been in a rapid growth mode in a lot of our markets. And when you're growing very quickly and you're buying and integrating assets, you're really focused on that piece of it and making sure that no balls drop and you're providing new customer service, et cetera. Now that we're not buying a lot of assets and integrating them, it's a good time for us to really focus on operational excellence.  So across the board, what we're doing is we're looking at our operations and saying, \"How can we be better without negatively impacting customer service or the future of our business.\" So we're being very careful that we're not damaging the long-term trajectory of the business with it, but we are finding opportunities to do things more efficiently. And I would say what we're doing today is kind of Phase 1, and that each market is looking at what they can do on their own. And then there is an opportunity that we're focused on to more globalize the business, and that's taking best practices from each market in terms of what their expertise is and taking that to other markets to see if we can drive additional efficiencies there. For example, in the U.S., we've automated a lot of our processes. And the question that we're asking ourselves is, can we take those automations and use them internationally to drive even more efficiency there? In Africa, we are extremely efficient with how we use fuel in our Power as a Service business. So we're looking at that and saying, can we export those practices to other markets like the U.S. And so right now, we're being very deliberate and kind of chasing the low-hanging fruit that's just inherent in the business after coming off a decade of growth. And then we're going to be very thoughtful about continuing to look at those costs as we try to become as efficient as we can everywhere we can over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Batya Levi : Can you talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing in LatAm? I think the quarter came in a bit ahead of your outlook. An update on activity and maybe expected churn from or any exposure to its wireline business would be helpful.  And just a second question on your build-to-suit program across regions. Any changes given the macro pressures or some regional risks that you're seeing? Rodney Smith : Batya, this is Rod. I'll start with LatAm and give you a little insight on the trends there. So we're seeing for the outlook for 2024, LatAm is going to be coming in around 2% organic tenant billings growth. That's coming with about 3% being contributed via the co-location and amendment revenue. And if you put that up against prior year, it's pretty flat. So we're seeing a steady level of demand and activity across Latin America in that 3-ish percent for new business. The escalators are also in that 4%, so a touch above that. That's actually down kind of moderating because inflation across the region has come down.  So last year, that was north of 7%. This year, it's about 4%. So that's a big driver of any headline change that you'll see. It's just a moderation of that inflation. The good news is we also are seeing a lower level of churn. So churn is about 5% in this year's guide. Last year, it was up closer to 6%. Within that 5% churn, almost half of it is coming from Oi, which I know you're familiar with that. It will take a couple of more years to kind of work through, and we will sort of get to the other side there. And then we would expect a more normalized overall growth will come back in the region. But it will take a couple of years before we get there.  When you think about maybe just hitting the wireline side of Oi, you heard -- you probably saw a couple of comments come out publicly around the wireline of Oi and what they're doing. But I'll give you a couple of numbers here. They represent about $35 million to $40 million of revenue for us in our LatAm business. We did agree to about a 20% discount that is assumed in our outlook, so there's no negative impact to the outlook that we have out on the street based on that. That means that, that comes into about $7 million on a per-year basis over the next couple of years in terms of the discount.  And as part of the transaction, we will also be taking ownership of certain sites down there from Oi. I'm not going to give you a count or any more detail there. We've got a little bit of work to do to look at that. But we have kind of worked through that. So we'll be working through the remaining churn down in LatAm. We do think it's temporary, but we also do think that you'll see kind of relatively low growth for the region for the next couple of years, let's say, lower single digits in that 3% -- 2% to 4% range, let's say. Batya Levi : That's helpful. And maybe just to build-to-suit update. Rodney Smith : Yes. In terms of the build-to-suits, I mean, we're keeping that consistent up in the range of 2,000 to 2,500 to 3,500. Q1, the volumes were a little bit lower, but we do expect that to increase. We continue to see strong demand for us building towers for our customers across Africa and also in Europe. So we certainly have been happy with that.  We're being fairly disciplined with the higher cost of capital, looking to make sure that pricing around build-to-suits reflects the new reality. But we still see several thousand sites that we can build every year. And I would say the volumes have come down a little bit. But one of the results of that is the quality, let's say, has increased because we're really being very selective on where we build, who we build for and what assets we build. As we look at the macro environment with the uncertainty around rates and cost of capital, we're being extremely disciplined. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Jon Atkin from RBC. Jonathan Atkin : Question about MLAs, maybe a 2-parter. To what extent do you use them internationally? I know a lot of it is paid by the drink, but maybe just update us on holistic MLAs and to what extent they're used internationally. And then as we look into maybe year-end '25, anything changing around the holistic portions of your domestic MLAs that roll off or even take effect? Steven Vondran : Sure. So when it comes to our international markets, we have a variety of contract structures, and sometimes, they depend on whether it's with an acquisition that we did or build-to-suits or a bigger part of the business there. So I would say there's a lot more variation in terms of how we construct our contracts internationally. We do have a couple of holistic type deals internationally. Again, a little bit different flavor than we would have in the U.S., but we do try to utilize those contract structures. Yes, I think that's something that may be an opportunity for us over time. But it takes time to get the customers to understand those. They're not typically used in a lot of those markets. And so kind of educating them on the benefits of those type structures and seeing the experience that our U.S. customers have had in terms of being able to continue to utilize those agreements and see value from them is something that may take some time. In terms of the U.S. agreements at the end of the year this year, there's nothing that we would point to you specifically on that, that we're talking about publicly at this point. So I would expect a ton of change there. Jonathan Atkin : And any change into '25 given that these are often 5 years in duration? Steven Vondran : Well, look, it's a little early for us to be giving any type of guidance for 2025. But look, we think that our fundamental growth algorithm kind of holds true. And so when we look at 2025, we continue to see strong fundamentals in our business. That includes a continuation of solid U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth, even while we're still absorbing some headwinds associated with that final tranche of spread churn that happens in Q4 of this year.  We see leasing volumes in Africa and Europe remaining positive with churn remaining low in Europe and an expectation for further moderation in China and Africa. Continued strong growth from CoreSite, especially as we're commencing those kind of record levels of new business that we've signed since the transaction was consummated. And we'll complement that topline growth with, again, continuing to focus on margin expansion and cost discipline and continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation.  Now that growth can be a little bit offset by the headwinds we have in Latin America because we do see an elevated consolidation churn environment there for the next few years, and that's going to keep Latin America kind of in that low single-digit growth. And then again, when you think about 2025 and beyond, there's a lot of variables that we're keeping our eyes on, like FX rates, interest rates, services, is inherently harder to predict. So we won't be trying to guide anything on that until early next year.  And then the timing of the India closing will also have an impact on what that AFFO per share growth rate is, although we think we've been very clear about what that means to us. I think most of our investors understand the variability on that with the timing. But all those kind of variables, we think, point to our long-term growth algorithm remaining strong in 2025 and beyond. Adam Smith : Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Please feel free to reach out to myself or the IR team with any questions. And operator, we can close the call. Operator : Thank you.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Please go ahead, sir. Adam Smith : Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's second quarter earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. I'm joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our President and CEO, and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2024 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance, our expectations for the closing of the sale of our India business and the expected impacts of such sale on our business, our collections expectations in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other risks described in documents we subsequently file from time to time with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors, and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve Vondran : Good morning. And thanks to everyone for joining the call today. As you can see in our Q2 results and our revised full year outlook, we continue to build on the strength we saw in the underlying business at the outset of the year, with further validation of our initial expectations for strong activity across our platforms in 2024. I want to start today's remarks by thanking our teams across the world for their commitment to operational excellence and dedication to maximizing sales, bringing down costs and expanding margins across the portfolio. My comments today will focus on our latest views on our international portfolio and aim to address some of the recurring questions related to our international strategy in both developed and emerging markets that we received from investors in recent months. As we've communicated in the past, our international investment thesis is two-pronged. First, we see that the fundamentals that have driven performance in the US, such as ongoing exponential growth in mobile data consumption and a business model that benefits from tremendous operating leverage generally hold true across international markets. Second, by exporting our successful US model to investment in a diversified portfolio of assets that balance various risk and return profiles, we expect to expand and augment our long-term growth potential. Executing on this thesis has resulted in a footprint that includes diverse and sometimes complicated geographies. In our US markets, as a US business involves creating value, while solving for two types of risk : operational and financial. On the operational front, I can confidently tell you that we have the best operating teams in each geography across our portfolio, and we've overcome operational risks on a consistent basis through our shared global expertise and experience. In many cases, we leverage operating challenges to create new business opportunities and enhance existing or introduce new competitive advantages. This capability has been demonstrated through our reliable speed-to-market delivery on new tower builds, a global reputation of sophisticated regulatory approach that has afforded opportunities to effectively assess new markets and assets and the development of innovative power as a service model that provides best-in-class network uptime and supports initiatives about American Tower, our M&M customers and the communities we serve to deliver clear telecommunications networks. This is one of the key synergies American Tower brings an unmatched global knowledge and support platform to create value through operational excellence. Our investors benefit from our ability to utilize that platform to realize expanded market share of new business, drive best-in-class margins and leverage cost of capital advantages derived from our global balance sheet. When you take all these together, these benefits translate to enhanced value of the assets under the American Tower umbrella commanding a premium relative to the market implied some of the parts on a comparable basis. And where this does not hold true, we've taken corrective actions, which I'll touch on a little bit later. As I mentioned in previous remarks, our exposure to financial risk has been more acute in our emerging market portfolio particularly over the past several years as global macroeconomic factors have had an outsized impact on emerging markets. In these cases, those financial risks have, quite frankly, outpaced what we originally underwrote and together with care consolidation that contributed to financial results in certain emerging markets that fall short of our standards. We're taking action to improve those results. We've talked previously about our focus on cost controls, and I'm happy to say that those are paying off. At the midpoint of our guidance this year, we anticipate savings of over $40 million of SG&A, including bad debt relative to 2023. Our emerging market footprint has been a meaningful contributor to our cost efficiency progress to date, where we're shifting our focus from aggressively growing those portfolios to maximizing the return on our investments. We've also previously commented on raising the hurdle rates for the deployment of additional capital in those markets. These proactive actions and our refined strategic focus have corresponded to an expected 2024 reduction of over 40% in discretionary capital across Latin America, Africa and APAC compared to 2021. Conversely, in parts of our developed market footprint such as Europe and Corsair we're underwriting compelling mid-teens US dollar yields, we're increasing our investments alongside our capital partners. With an expanded developed market platform inclusive of the US and Canada, we've been able to more than double our discretionary capital in those markets over the same period. As a result, as you can see on slide 6, the allocation towards emerging markets has reduced from around two-thirds of our total in 2021 to less than a-third in our 2024 guidance. You'll likely see that number continue to trend down as we satisfy some of our previously contracted obligations in certain markets. Complementing our approach to discretionary capital allocation and supporting our proactive steps to enhance our global portfolio. In 2023, we divested non-core subscale underperforming assets like Mexico fiber and our Poland operations. And earlier this year, we announced our pending exit from India. Additionally, over the past several years, we further expanded our developed market exposure through our M&A focus across the US and Europe, all just name a few examples of the key strategic actions we've taken to date. Pro forma for the anticipated sale of our India business, attributable AFFO exposure to emerging markets will be approximately 25%. As a result of these actions, and those I'll touch on later, we believe our emerging market operations and our business as a whole are in a better position to deliver the higher quality, sustainable earnings growth that makes investing in communications infrastructure is so compelling. However, given the impacts of the financial risk and the stability and the quality of earnings our investor is whitefly demand from tower and communications infrastructure models, we expect to further reduce our relative exposure to emerging markets over time as we continue focus on incremental investments in developed economies. Now, that doesn't mean that you should assume we plan on divesting in particular markets. For our full management team and our Board regularly assess all options, including divestitures and we're going to remain opportunistic as we continue to actively manage our portfolio. We believe today that more long-term value is created by continuing to operate these portfolios, expand our gross margins, and reduce capital intensity, while repatriating cash flows to fund other global priorities such as deleveraging, paying our dividend, developed market investments with the highest quality return profiles, and looking ahead the potential for share buybacks. Meanwhile, continued operation of these portfolios means that we retain the optionality to reinvest into those markets if economic conditions and growth outlooks evolve. With that in mind, here's what we're focused on in our international segment going forward. First, just in the U.S., owning and operating highest quality assets and partner with leading carriers in each market helps provide more stable growth reduce long-term earning volatility resulting from consolidation. This is a critical lesson learned from our experience in India where consolidation post significant headwinds to growth over a multiyear period. Today, the vast majority of our revenues in Europe, Africa, and Latin America come from leading [ph] customers with competitive end market scale. Meaningful enhancements to our counterparty profile over the past several years have come in part due to carrier consolidation, but also as a result of proactively aligning growth initiatives and capital allocation both through development or M&A to our doing business with market leaders, and we remain committed to growing in Tier 1 global MNOs across our footprint. In some cases, particularly where growth capital is not required, we may also support network rollouts of new entrants or smaller operators. However, any time we assess expansion CapEx from carriers that fit this profile, the underwriting standards will be adjusted to account for potential incremental risk on a case-by-case basis. Next, scale is perhaps the most critical component of the international value creation flywheel. At a high level, our scale allows us to operate more profitably by leveraging shared overhead and a global balance sheet that creates cost of capital advantages. Importantly, scale also enables us to develop nationwide agreements that present a differentiated go-to-market solution for leading MNOs that that contract terms we view as critical. In particular, securing full lease-up rights on the assets we acquire, including the ability to monetize by colocation limit activity is crucial to our ability to drive long-term organic growth. Over the past decade, we had counter sale-leaseback opportunities with restrictive contract terms that limit the lease-up monetization. These are non-starters for us. Similarly, while recent currency devaluation in certain markets has exceeded our initial underwriting expectations, CPI-linked escalators have proven to be a critical tool to help mitigate long-term currency risk over the last decade. As we look forward to the balance of 2024 in the next several years, we believe we're uniquely positioned to create differentiated value for our customers. To maximize the benefits of scale portfolio we have in place, we're reinforcing a customer service-driven approach to everything we do. And our internal departments in each region are focused on supporting our sales team's ability to find new business with market leaders and deliver strong organic growth. Further, our global model allows our best-in-class operating team to remain flexible in addressing the ebbs and flows in demand through cross-border share resources, allowing for sustained speed-to-market delivery for our customers, while also supporting focus on cost management. To that end, we remain committed to extending the global efficiency and cost management achievements we made to-date. For 2018 and at the midpoint of our 2024 outlook, we expect to reduce cash SG&A, excluding bad debt as a percentage of revenue by roughly 210 basis points in Europe, Africa and LatAm in aggregate. We're now in the process of further globalizing our business functions to identify additional areas where we can leverage scale and technology to continued growth in customer service in the most cost efficient manner. In closing, we believe we have an opportunity to leverage our learnings for the last two-plus decades of global operations to continue managing and developing a best-in-class business that's capable of delivering high-quality, long-term earnings growth. We're going to continue actively managing our portfolio to ensure compelling mix of geographies and assets that are well positioned to support and monetize growing data demand and our operating capabilities to continue to serve a sustained competitive advantage. As our actions have demonstrated over the past year, we're prepared to make appropriate strategic decisions to ensure that we have a portfolio of the highest quality. Going forward, we believe that through our focus on maximizing organic growth disciplined and flexible reinvestment of cash flows and their growth opportunities and further leveraging our global scale and maximize profitability and returns, we can provide a value proposition that can't be replicated elsewhere, translating into expanded returns on capital over time. With that, I'll hand it over to Rod to discuss Q2 results and our revised outlook. Rod Smith : Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. As highlighted in this morning's press release, we had a strong second quarter driven by the resilient demand for our assets and resulting in robust performance across several key areas. Given the critical nature of our global portfolio and the growth trends in mobile data consumption, we head into the back half of the year confident in our ability to drive strong growth, execute on our cost management initiatives enhance our quality of earnings and deliver compelling total shareholder returns. Before I discuss the specifics of our Q2 results and revised full year outlook, I'll summarize a few of the highlights. First, activity levels on our tower assets remain strong. Our consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 5.3% continues to demonstrate the strength of the fundamentals that fuel our business. In our U.S. Services segment performed in line with our expectations for accelerating tower activity in 2024 with revenues and gross profit each increasing over 50% versus Q1 and more than double that of Q4 of 2023. Next, CoreSite executed another exceptionally strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth their second highest quarter of signed new leasing in the company's history and record cash backlog. Additionally, our data center projects currently under development are roughly 60% pre-leased, four times the historical average, providing confidence and visibility to an accelerated pathway to realizing CoreSite's best-in-class returns on invested capital. Furthermore, in India, the positive collection trends we saw over the last several quarters continued in Q2, allowing us to reverse approximately $67 million of previously reserved revenue and clearing the majority of the outstanding AR we have with a key customer. Separately, we made further progress in accelerating certain payments included in the approximately $2.5 billion of potential total proceeds associated with our pending sale of ATC India. In the quarter, we repatriated more than $210 million back to the U.S., and we are in the process of repatriating an additional approximately $20 million, largely associated with the monetization of the VIL OCDs net of fees. To date, total accelerated proceeds stands at approximately $345 million, inclusive of funds received in Q1, and we expect the remaining proceeds potentially of approximately $2.1 billion to be received at closing as we make progress towards closing, which we continue to target the second half of 2024, we anticipate incurring incremental costs within the business between SG&A and maintenance CapEx, a modest offset to the upside realized through strong collections. I will touch on these items and how they impact our outlook later. Finally, we continue to effectively execute on our balance sheet initiatives highlighted in the quarter by the issuance of \u20ac1 billion denominated senior unsecured notes at a weighted average cost of 4%. The proceeds we used to pay down floating rate debt, lowering our ratio back to 89% fixed to 11% floating. Turning to second quarter property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on slide 8, consolidated property revenue growth was 4.6% or over 6.5%, excluding non-cash straight line revenue, while absorbing roughly 230 basis points of FX headwinds. US and Canada, property revenue growth was approximately 1%, or over 4% excluding straight line and includes an approximately 1% negative impact from Sprint churn. International revenue growth was approximately 7% or over 12%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, which includes an over 8% benefit associated with improved collections in India. Finally, data center revenues increased over 12% as demand for hybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture continues unabated, AI-driven demand picks up in the backlog of record new business signed over the last two years continues to commence. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was 5.3%, supported by strong demand for our assets across our global portfolio. In our US and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.1% and over 6% absent Sprint related churn, we expect a relatively similar growth rate in Q3 before a step down in Q4 as we commence the final tranche of contracted Sprint churn, all supportive of our 2024 outlook expectation of approximately 4.7%. Our International segment drove 5.5% in organic tenant billings growth, reflecting additional moderation in CPI-linked escalators as expected, and a sequential step down in colocation and amendment contributions, most notably in APAC. However, in Europe, we saw another quarter of accelerating new business moving organic tenant billings growth in the region to 5.7% and giving us confidence to modestly raise our full year outlook for the segment, which I'll touch on shortly. Turning to slide 9. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.1% or nearly 12%, excluding the impacts of non-cash straight line, while absorbing approximately 210 basis points in FX headwinds, cash, adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 300 basis points year-over-year to 64.7%, which includes a roughly 80 basis point benefit in the quarter associated with India reserve reversals as compared to a drag of nearly 50 basis points in the year ago period. Absent these onetime items, we're continuing to demonstrate meaningful cash margin improvements supported by the inherent operating leverage in the tower model and continued cost management throughout the business. In fact, cash, SG&A, excluding bad debt, declined approximately 2.5% year-over-year in the quarter. Moving to the right side of the slide. Attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share grew by 13.5% and 13.4%, respectively, supported by a high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth to attributable AFFO. Now shifting to our revised full year outlook, I'll start with a few key updates. First, as I mentioned earlier, we've had a strong start to the year. Core performance remains solid, and our continued focus on driving cost discipline and margin expansion across the business is paying off through exceptional conversion rates of top-line results through adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. As you'll see in the next several slides, our core results to-date and expectations for the remainder of year are contributing to outperformance across key metrics for 2024 as compared to our prior expectations. Next, having now come off so consecutive quarters of solid collections in India, we've reassessed expectations for the year. In our prior outlook, we have assumed nearly $50 million in revenue reserves from Q2 to Q4 or just over $16 million per quarter. As I mentioned earlier, through positive collections in Q2, we reversed $67 million of previously reserved revenue translating to an upside $84 million as compared to our prior outlook assumptions for the quarter. We now have confidence to fully remove our previous reserve assumption for the second half of the year, representing an incremental $32 million in upside, which, together with Q2 results is driving an outlook to outlook increase of around $116 million across property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO. Finally, we have revised our FX assumptions, providing an incremental headwind of $51 million, $33 million and $28 million to property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and attributable AFFO, respectively. Turning to slide 10. We are increasing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $20 million compared to prior outlook. Outperformance includes $116 million associated with positive collection trends in India partially offset by a decrease of $45 million, which consists of a decrease of $58 million in pass-through primarily due to fuel costs, net of an increase of $13 million in straight-line revenue. Consolidated core property revenue remains unchanged with certain offsetting movements between segments. Growth was partially also offset by $51 million associated with negative FX impacts. Moving to slide 11. Expectations for consolidated US and Canada, total international and APAC organic tenant billings growth remain unchanged. However, we have raised expectations for Africa to greater than 12% and Europe to approximately 6%, up from 11% to 12% and 5% to 6%, respectively. In addition, we have lowered our expectations for Latin America to greater than 1.5%, down from approximately 2%. Turning to slide 12. We are increasing our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $130 million as compared to the prior outlook. Outperformance is driven by the flow-through of FX-neutral property revenue upside and direct expense savings partially offset by additional SG&A costs in India and $33 million of FX headwinds. Moving to slide 13. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $85 million at the midpoint and $0.18 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $10.60. Cash, adjusted EBITDA outperformance was partially offset by incremental maintenance CapEx split between the US and Canada, where we're prioritizing certain incremental projects and India. Growth is partially offset by $28 million in FX headwinds. Excluding India, outperformance on an FX-neutral basis was $27 million as compared to prior outlook. Turning to Slide 14. You'll see our capital allocation plans remain relatively consistent, including unchanged expectations for our 2024 dividend distribution, which is subject to Board approval. On the capital program side, we are increasing our plan for 2024 by $55 million, which includes $30 million associated with maintenance CapEx, as I previously mentioned, and additional success-based development investments in our US data center business to maximize sellable capacity on the back of ongoing record demand. Additionally, we have reallocated certain discretionary capital buckets, including an increase towards our strategically important US land acquisition program, partially offset by savings in redevelopment. Moving to the right side of the slide, we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet and accelerating our pathway to additional financial flexibility. This commitment is demonstrated through our successful execution in the capital markets including the issuance of over $2 billion in fixed rate debt since the start of the year, a strategic and disciplined approach towards our capital deployment priorities, highlighted for reductions in discretionary capital spend in each of the last several years, together with a rebalancing of strategic priorities between geographies and risk profiles and a continued cost focus across the business. These strategic actions have translated into meaningful progress towards achieving our net leverage target and an improved fixed to floating rate debt profile over the past 24 months. Turning to Slide 15. And in summary, we are pleased with our execution through the first half of the year, demonstrating the strength of the fundamentals that underpin our business through solid organic growth and a diligent focus on cost management throughout our company, combined with our prudent approach to capital allocation, while reinforcing and enhancing our balance sheet strength financial flexibility we believe we are well positioned to drive strong sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value while being a best-in-class operation for our stakeholders across the globe. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Steve, thanks for the comments on the international strategy approach. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a update on how you're seeing the opportunities to do additional M&A in the US, Europe, other developed markets? What are you seeing in terms of interesting properties when SBA last night was talking about potential for material deals. Are you seeing the same sort of thing here, how are valuations looking? And then kind of related to that on data centers, you're continuing to invest heavily in that business. You see opportunities for inorganic expansion beyond some of the small tuck-ins you've done either in the US and/or Europe? Thank you. Steve Vondran : Yes. Thanks, Simon. So with respect to the material M&A in the US and Europe, there are some rumors of portfolios coming available. And so I won't comment on any specific portfolios out there. But what I would reiterate is, we're very focused on our current capital allocation priorities, and in particular, delevering down below 5. Now we did give below 5 this quarter as a result of some of the onetime items, but that will likely go up above 5% next quarter. So we're focused on getting durably below 5. And we're also focused on our internal CapEx programs and the other capital priorities we've laid out there. And at this point, we haven't seen anything that we've evaluated that would take us off those priorities. So there's nothing that we're evaluating today that would be compelling for us today. And just as a reminder, anything that we would buy would need to be better than buying back our own stock. So when we look at those acquisition opportunities, we have to see an opportunity for that 1 plus 1 to equal 3 versus just kind of a growth for growth's sake. So what we're very interested in trying to grow our portfolios in the US and Europe and putting a developed markets that we're in. We aren't seeing opportunities today that look to be the right price, the right asset group for us to see that kind of synergy that would give us that opportunity today. Having said that, our teams are always evaluating everything out there and anything that comes to market, we'll evaluate if that evaluation changes, we'll let you guys know. When it comes to CoreSite, we have a lot of opportunity to invest in our existing campuses, and that's going to give us the best return on the [indiscernible] risk of any CapEx that we can deploy. And just to kind of put a fine point on it, we've got 44 megawatts under construction today and 61% of that is pre-leased. And so there's quite a bit of CapEx going into those campuses today that we feel very confident that we're going to get our mid-teens stabilized yields or better in those campuses that we're investing in. There are some tuck-ins. Miami is one example. And whenever you see us do that, the reason for us to do a tuck-in market like that is to try to build a new campus. We're very committed to our business model. We think it gives us the most resilient asset, the 1 that has the most durability over time and the best returns. And if we can create more campuses and have high interconnection cloud on-ramps in that ecosystem that commands a premium in market, we'll try to develop those. Those take time to develop, and so we do start small. And that's what you're more likely to see with us. Again, we're very committed to our business model being an interconnection hub. And there aren't many inorganic opportunities that would contribute to that model. If something did come available at that profile, we'd look at it. But today, we think we have ample opportunity to invest in that core business that's performing so well for us. Rod Smith : Simon, good morning, this is Rod. Maybe I'll just add and complement what Steve is saying with a couple of numbers on CapEx for the data center business. So, notwithstanding the fact that our overall CapEx program year-over-year has come down because our capital priorities and the focus on balance sheet strength, delevering all the things Steve talked about. Notwithstanding that decline, we have increased our investments, our CapEx investments in CoreSite for '24 over '23 by roughly 100 million. We did the same '23 over '22. So we are seeing very compelling opportunities. We are following those and leaning in. The numbers in the grand scheme of things are meaningful, albeit modest, but we do have the ability to dynamically allocate that capital. And just because you see our CapEx program go down somewhat. It doesn't mean we're not leaning into the very best opportunities to deploy CapEx. Simon Flannery : Great. Very clear. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good morning. A couple of questions. First, I'm just curious if you can unpack a bit more of what you're seeing in the US leasing environment with respect to geography types of activity between densification and amendments? And where A&T may be differiating itself and its results relative to the commentary that we hear from some of your competitors? And then secondly, just curious, your current view on dividend policy exiting 2024 and how that should relate to the level and growth of AFFO per share over time? Thanks. Steve Vondran : Sure. Thanks for the question. So in the US, we're seeing 2024 play out much as we expected. We've seen a modest increase in application volume in Q2 over Q1. It is fairly broad-based. The main driver continues to be our carrier customers continuing to build out their 5G network. So it is largely still amendment driven, although we do see an uptick somewhat in new colocations over prior years, I wouldn't point to that as quite a densification phase yet. There's still a lot of room for the carriers to continue to expand their 5G presence. And while we're not getting specific about individual carriers, we would say that over half of our sites are now upgraded with mid-band 5G, but one carrier is ahead of the other two. And we have one that's over 80%, one that's a little over 60% now and one that's a little bit further behind. So there's a lot of runway there for them to continue to roll out mid-band 5G across the portfolio, and we expect them to continue to do that. With respect to our services guide, we are holding our guide for the year. Now there's always a degree of risk in that services guide because it's near term, but what we're seeing in our application flow and our services by is supportive that full year guide. So we do still feel good about the US activity levels kind of hitting those levels that saw at the beginning of the year. I believe the carrier capital spend projections are right in line with that kind of $34 billion to $36 billion is what they've said publicly. And that's again supportive of a level of development that we think is typical in this phase of a build. So we feel good about the US, and we think we're going to continue to see that up-tick. And we're also seeing usage patterns by the consumer continue to drive demand on those networks, and we're seeing the continued drive of that 20% to 30% up-tick in consumer demand that's going to continue to put pressure on the networks. And we're seeing that 5G is working for the carriers. It's letting them produce more gigabytes at lower cost. So we think that, that's going to continue to be a compelling business proposition for them to build 5G and with the addition of fixed wireless and some of the positive trends we're seeing in ARPUs and things like that, we're very confident that the US market will continue to grow and build and that densification phase will come. Sorry, the dividend question. Rod Smith : Hey, Michael, this is Rod. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So regarding the dividend, as everyone on the call knows, we held our dividend flat in 2024. That was really one of many things that we. [Technical Difficulty] Operator : I retrieve him -- I'm getting him back-up. Please go ahead. Rod Smith : Great. Thank you. So, I\u2019ll start over Michael. Thank you. This is Rod. So, regarding the dividend, as everyone on the call knows that in 2024, we chose to hold the dividend flat. The reasons behind that really was giving -- given the macroeconomic backdrop, the uncertainty around rates, we decided to favor balance sheet strength, operational growth, organic growth. And it was one of many things that we decided to do as leaned into delevering. We're really focused on driving organic growth. We're focused on expanding margins, controlling direct expenses, focused on actually reducing SG&A, becoming more efficient, reducing costs, and our overall CapEx program and our CapEx investments, holding the dividend flat, and putting the extra funds that we had into delevering and into reducing exposure to floating rate debt in the environment. So, that was one of many things that we did. When you think about going forward into beyond 2024, of course, it's too early to talk about specific guidance for 2025 or beyond. I would remind you and everyone that we're a REIT, we target our dividend distribution to equal about 100% of our pretax income. That's an important point. From a long-term perspective, I would say that we see pre-tax income growing in line with AFFO and AFFO per share growth on average and over time. So, you can think about the trajectory in terms of the growth rate of the dividend being similar to the trajectory the growth rate of AFFO and AFFO per share. That doesn't mean it will match every single year. But over a multiyear period and on average, we believe that will match up pretty well. Certainly, the dividend is a meaningful piece of the overall total shareholder return that we look to deliver. And as always, anything with respect to our dividend and dividend policy needs to be approved by the Board, certainly. So, that's kind of the way we think about it. We would expect that the dividend growth would resume in 2025 based on what we're seeing in the numbers going beyond 2024. Michael Rollins : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Rod Smith : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Morning guys. Rod Smith : Hey Ric. Ric Prentiss : A couple of questions on my side. Thanks for the update on the India collections process nicely to get that money on hand and what's left at closing, how should we think about the status of that approval process? And then how long would you get through the competitive committee in India would it take to close the transaction? Steve Vondran : At this point, Ric, there's no update on that. We're still waiting for the approval. And what we've said consistently is we believe it is second half of the year closing. So, I'm not sure when that's going to come out. It's hard to predict. But we do still anticipate getting that in that relevant timeframe. And in terms of closing afterwards, I think you could expect that to occur in kind of four to six weeks afterwards, somewhere in that timeframe. Ric Prentiss : Makes sense, probably tie it to a month or a quarter and two just for the accounting purposes, probably. Rod Smith : Yes. If we have that choice, Ric, we probably would, we'll see exactly how it unfolds. Ric Prentiss : Okay. Second question, thanks for the update on the mid-band spectrum deployment in the U.S., that's helpful to see kind of at least some over half of the sites and how it kind of varies by carrier. Internationally, any update there with your competitors, peers suggested that obviously, international is way behind those kind of numbers? Any broad stroke as whereas 5G deployment internationally is out? Steve Vondran : Sure. I'll give a little bit of color on that. I think it depends on the geography that you're in. If you look at Europe, they've been able to deploy 5G of a large proportion of the population there. I think high 80s, low 90s and Spain and Germany for most part. That's a combination of low and mid-band spectrum to. So there's still a runway of continued opportunity there to get the mid-band deployed there. I don't have specific stats on the percentage of mid-band because it's a little bit more nuanced in that market. And in France, we have OneCare it's a little bit it's a little bit further ahead in terms of 5G than the other. So of a mixed bag there. When you look at Africa, you are seeing some 5G deployments in some of the major cities, but it's still pretty nascent there. They're still focused on their 4G networks, augmenting those and improving the network quality over time. But we do think that you'll see 5G being deployed there, especially where the population centers are over time. So there's still some runway there for those 5G upgrades to occur in Africa. In Latin America, you have a little bit of 5G that's been deployed in Brazil and a couple of the other markets, but most of those markets are a little bit further behind. And even in Brazil, I'd say it's probably nascent in terms of the 5G deployments today. In many of those markets, there's been a delay in getting 5G spectrum in the hands of the carriers. Some of that is auctions that have been delayed, and some of it is the carriers pushing for a lower entry price there. And so I think as we see that play out over time, we'll continue to see opportunity there. The other thing that's happening in Brazil is the incumbents there are still integrating the oil assets they bought and that's depressing the activities there a little bit as they deal with those integrations and combining those networks together. So I'd say it's very consistent with the way we kind of view the international markets that they're a little bit behind the developed markets, the deployment of 5G. We are starting to see some green shoots in some of those markets where they need those cheaper gigabytes that 5G delivers, and we're seeing some deployments there, but there's a lot of runway ahead to deploy it there. Ric Prentiss : Great. And last one for me. I think on the cost management side, is site decommissioning kind of one of the things that's helping to drive that. It looked like some significant decommissionings in the U.S., Canada, maybe it's related to Sprint towers that are naked once they get off of them, but just maybe a little update on what you're doing with decommissioning towers and how that's benefiting cost and how we should think about running that forward? Steve Vondran : Yes. Thanks, Ric. We're looking at everything in terms of cost management. And our goal is to enhance our margin profile by direct cost savings in addition to SG&A. So what you're seeing there is exactly what you would expect. We're looking at that portfolio and where we have underperforming assets that we don't think are going to see near-term activity, we are decommissioning those to save the OpEx on those and doing what's right. So we are doing some accelerated work there. Rob, do you want to touch on some of the other elements. Rod Smith : Yes. I'll just add in there. In terms of the decommissioning, I think you'll see in the numbers LatAm, we took down about 250 sites in the U.S. We took down about 300. That's just normal portfolio pruning and managing the portfolio from time-to-time. We certainly have sites without tenants on them here and there, and we'll try to lease those up again. And if it doesn't work, we end up taking them down to save the cost. So that is a driver, but it's not the only -- it's not the only driver. We're also seeing lower land rent escalations that was certainly good. We're doing some things with property tax, which resulted in a one-time reduction, which was certainly good. In our CapEx, we're leaning into investing in our brown leases and reducing ground expense. So, that's another area where we're allocating capital to the most accretive and value-creating opportunities. So we're seeing lower land rents based on capital allocation. So there's a number of different things that are playing into that direct cost reduction. Rick Prentiss : Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. Rod Smith : Thanks, Ric. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Thanks so much for taking the question. So, you guys made this bold prediction about activity levels and services accelerating through the course of the year. Not everyone, I think, is seeing the same thing, assuming that the service revenue guide is still $195 million, it implies yet another big step-up into the second half on a quarterly basis. But the temptation would then be to extrapolate that as a leading indicator for leasing activity. But as I understand it, the M&A has kind of already contemplated all that. So by the drink model, this activity might foreshadow some increased leasing, but because of the MLAs, you might not see that same kind of sensitivity. So if you could kind of validate that perspective? And then I guess a related question is the holistic MLA that you guys signed with AT&T in September 2019. Theoretically, if it's a 5-year term, it's going to be coming up for renewal or not in the third quarter. You've highlighted that these holistic MLAs typically have far shorter durations than your underlying kind of core MLAs. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, what this means for the business outlook in the second half and into 2025? Thanks. Steve Vondran : Sure. Let me start with the services piece of that. So our Q1 services gross margin was about twice what our Q4 2023 was and our Q2 is about 50% up from Q1. So we are seeing acceleration in that services business. And again, we believe from the pipeline that we're looking at today that we're on track to hit our full year services guide on that. And again, there's a risk in that services pipeline, and we've seen it play out a couple of times in the past, but our teams are confident at this point that we're on track to be able to do that. With respect to our MLAs, what we were -- what we've disclosed is that we had one customer that rolled off the MLA earlier this year. And so we haven't really talked specifically about anything beyond that. But because we've telegraphed that pretty clearly, I think you can get an idea that that's where we kind of where we are. Those comprehensive portions are typically 3 to 5 years, so it's not just 5 years. There's a different range on those. And since we do have 1 customer that's off of that kind of use-right fee that underpins that smoothing out of growth over time, that customer is a little bit more dependent on the volumes that they're doing. And so there will be a little bit more peaks and valleys in terms of activity with them. The works on instant we're fine either way on that. We take a long-term view of these agreements. And if getting into another holistic type of agreement makes sense, we will. And if we don't think it does, we'll stay and pay up the drink, and we're very confident in our ability to monetize that way. With respect the activity and how that translates into our organic growth over time, it's too early to be giving kind of a 2025 guide at this point. We'll do that in February, like we always do. But we are encouraged by the growth that we see in terms of the activity by the carriers. We do have one major customer who is off the holistic portion of their agreement. They still have underling MLA, but the holistic portion is expired. And so if those volumes continue, that's a positive. We also have what we call our vertical market segment, which are smaller customers, and that's also very much dependent on volume and timing on that. And we're seeing good activity there as well. So we're encouraged by that. When we look out into the future, we do have a level of contractually locked in growth for 2025 via our comprehensive MLA and that's similar to what we see in 2024 as well as consistent growth from the escalator of about 3%. On the churn side, in 2025, we're going to continue to see a level of elevated spread churn. The final tranche of that spread churn commenced in Q4 of this year, that's about $70 million of annualized monthly run rate. That will impact our growth rates through Q3 of next year. In terms of kind of the swing factors that you would see in terms of 2025, there's a portion the growth that's not locked in via the conference of MLAs. Again, I mentioned one of the big three carriers and the vertical markets. So that's a swing factor. We also have our eye on the timing and scale of any potential churn from US cellular. Over the next couple of years in the event that deal is approved and closes. We'd expect the overlap to be modest, but the timing and the scale of that churn could put some pressure on rates temporarily. And who knows, we could end up signing another conference of MLA or agreement that would also potentially impact what that number looks like. So there's a number of swing factors for 2025, and that's why we can't really give guidance until we get to February. But at the end of day, we're still confident that we're going to have continued growth supportive of our longer-term guide. David Barden : Thanks, Steve. Very helpful. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. One question, one follow-up. First, Steve, you spoke a little bit about emerging markets making up roughly 25% of AFFO per share today. Where do you see that going over time? And how does that inform forward uses of discretionary capital in your M&A strategy? And then just a follow-up maybe for Rod. If you can quantify the benefit to property taxes that you saw in the quarter and just clarify if it's onetime in nature or not? Thank you. Steve Vondran : Thanks for the question. Let me just clarify, the 25% is pro forma for the India transaction. So a little bit higher today. Once we close the new transaction, we'll be at roughly 25%. And as we look at some of the macroeconomic conditions, particularly the FX headwinds that we've been seeing, that's kind of given us the choice to start pivoting a little bit more away from the exposure into those emerging market economies, given what we're seeing in the macroeconomic conditions today. So what we're doing is pivoting more of our discretionary CapEx to the developed markets. This isn't a new thing. We've been doing that for the last several years, and we haven't done an emerging market transaction in quite a few years now. And the bulk of our CapEx has been going toward developed markets. What that will do if that trend continues, and we expect it to, is it will reduce that emerging market exposure over time. We're not setting a kind of line in the sand a day for where we think it should be, but we do think it appropriate to work that percentage down over time by focusing on our developed markets. Having said that, we will continue to support our Tier 1 MNOs in those markets. We'll make some discretionary CapEx investments where it makes sense or where they meet the return criteria that we set out for markets. But in terms of expanding in those markets are looking to double down or anything. That's not something you're likely to see us do given our desire to reduce the exposure we have to that -- those emerging market economies. Rod Smith : Hey, Matt, Rod here. So on one of the charts, you can see on the adjusted EBITDA, we're showing roughly a $50 million benefit to outlook on cash gross margins. The way to think about that is much of that is driven, almost all of that is driven by benefits or improvements in that direct expense line. From a high level, think about it as 50/50 mix in terms of what may be run rate and what may be one-time in nature. And then when you think about that, roughly one-quarter of the entire piece was a property tax accrual. But there's a lot of other kind of nits and nats and things going through that section there. Things like the accelerated e-com as we just talked about with the record of the land purchases as well as just some operational improvements around the way we do R&M and contractor management and other things. So roughly the $49 million of improvement in cash gross margin, think of it 50/50 as onetime versus durable and reoccurring going forward. And property tax onetime benefit was roughly one-quarter of the whole thing. Matt Niknam : Awesome. Thank you. Rod Smith : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, you delivered a relatively concise message on the strategy for international markets and emerging markets, in particular, and the higher hurdle rates for organic investment. Can you maybe just comment on, broadly speaking, whether you'll be more likely to dispose of some of those non-core emerging market assets if they were able to fetch higher multiples in the market? And then secondly, you also delivered a pretty clear theme around the higher returns and portfolio optimization. Can you maybe quantify for us, what are your consolidated returns inhibitions are where they are where they relative to where they stand today? Steve Vondran : Sure. I'll hit the first part of that, Rod can hit the second. We always are looking to actively manage our portfolio. So the management team and the Board regularly review our portfolio and look at the assets under our management. And we're always looking to say, what's going to create the best long-term shareholder value. And so when you think about some of the benefits that American Tower brings to these portfolios, I touched on this a little bit in my prepared remarks, but I'll reiterate it. We have operational excellence across the globe, and that operational excellence lets us drive best-in-class margins. It lets us optimize the amount of new business we get, so organic growth is better under American Tower. And so we believe that we create a lot more value for those assets that are under our umbrella than anybody else can. Now where that doesn't hold true if we think that somebody else can create more value, we would look at divesting it, and that's what we do with India. So absolutely, price is one of the considerations that would factor in when we think about whether a disposition create more value than we continue to operate it. But at this point, we think the best thing that we can do is keep those assets under our umbrella, continue to operate them in the way that we do and continue to focus on the gross margin and the growth of the organic revenue there. And if we ever do decide that a disposition is more desirable at that point, it's going to be more valuable because we've created more cash flow on the assets. So right now, that's where our decision point is. But we'll always be nimble and we'll always look to maximize the long-term value. Now there are some subscale portfolios and some ancillary businesses that we would think about. If you look at what we've done over the past couple of years, we did divest Mexico fiber. We did divest Poland, one because it was subscale, the other because we thought somebody else could maximize that business better. And so when you look at some of those portfolios in our overall portfolio, that's the type of thing that we think about. But there's no process we've announced today and nothing I would point to of any scale that we think would make sense in the short-term. Rod Smith : Hey Jim, Rod here. I'll just hit on your return on invested capital question. So, one thing I would point out right at the start here is we do give in the disclosures, A, the NOI yield in U.S. dollar terms for vintage. So, I think you've probably seen that, but dig into that, there's a lot of interesting information in there. One thing I would point out is that the NOI yields in U.S. dollar terms typically are higher than the U.S. when you're looking at these emerging markets. So, for build-to-suits and other investments, that's been that's been the case. And they need to be because we, as Steve talked about, have risk-adjusted return requirements, of course, not just per region, but by country and even deal-specific. So, we do require an additional spread a risk-adjusted spread. Sometimes even over and above the detailed country level cost of capital that we calculate will require a spread over that, that that could be meaningful to compensate for other things that we see either in the market or in the portfolio. So, that certainly is key. But when you look at analysis, you'll see that the vintage analysis shows that the NOI yields over time go up. Certainly, when you think about the emerging markets, we're looking at low teens here and heading upwards, we would expect them all to be in the upper teens certainly in places like Africa, above 20% over time, would certainly be where we would target that. So, broadly speaking, you've heard us say it before, but when you think about Africa, we're looking for high teens, north of 20% returns. And then depending on the country, it can even be higher at the high end of that and even higher. Today, we're below that. But if you look at our return on invested capital across the region as reported, we're in the mid-teens for return on invested capital. But these are long-term assets. So, our focus on driving organic growth, margin expansion really driving SG&A costs being super-efficient when it comes to the way we operate the markets, including Africa, but LatAm even India while we have it. And combining that, coupling that with very disciplined CapEx programs, maybe even lower CapEx programs are all meant to drive return on invested capital up for us so that we can reach our hurdle rate and get beyond it. And again, these are long-term assets. And LatAm is maybe a little better of a position, but similar. They're at the low teens from a return on invested capital. The requirements there are going to be more in the mid-teens, not necessarily north of 20%. So, you may recall, we've done a fair amount of building and acquiring there over the last several years. So, again, the focus on operational execution and excellence in these markets, we really talk about that. We plan that, and we drive that in the business to help accelerate these returns on invested capital over the long-term. But these are long-term assets, and we're very bullish on the underlying fundamentals of the business, not just in the U.S., Europe, and CoreSite in course, but the fundamentals underpinning the operating results across LatAm and Africa are very good. In Europe, we're actually seeing an acceleration in new business contributions in organic tenant billings 2024 or 2023. So, that is certainly a very positive sign. Hopefully, that addresses the question, Jim. Jim Schneider : Yes, thank you. Rod Smith : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on the data center segment with CoreSite. You mentioned you had your second highest bookings quarter this quarter. So could you talk about what the demand backdrop looks like there? Is it -- do you see more larger footprint opportunities tied to either cloud or AI or is your performance more related to kind of traditional enterprise workloads? Steve Vondran : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll address demand and then I'll address who we're leasing to a separate issues. We're seeing broad-based demand from a lot of different sectors. Part of that, there's a scarcity of supply in some of the markets that we're in. But our key customer base that's driving long-term demand in CoreSite continues to be enterprises that are deploying hybrid cloud deployment, hybrid cloud technology. And we see a very long tail of that business. And it's probably helpful for me to talk a little bit about how we curate our customer mix. CoreSite doesn't just lease to just anybody who wants to lease space in their facilities, particularly when we're looking at our scale and hyperscale space that's available, we want to lease to customers that help build the ecosystem. And that's why we are pretty selective in terms of who we lease to. And so that hybrid cloud deployment is the perfect type of customer to help build that ecosystem. We are seeing demand from AI, and the inferencing layer of AI is perfectly suited for our highly interconnected ecosystem like CoreSite because it helps distribute the content that the AI is generating. And so we do see some demand there. We're being selective in terms of who we're willing to lease to in that. We do recognize that not all customers are kind of built the same in that space. So we want to make sure that we're partnering with people who have good long-term business plans there. But what's driving the overall demand is just a general scarcity of supply there, but we're continuing to lease to that core customer base, expanding our enterprise reach for hyper cloud deployments, a little bit of AI and then continuing to serve a lot of the customers that we already have there as they expand their needs. And those are the primary drivers from who we're leasing to you. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks, Steven. Just one follow-up for Rod. You touched on the deleveraging path and the potential for buybacks. As we look into 2025, any kind of early reason how -- what key variables you may look at when the in that decision, whether it's AFFO yields versus implied cost of capital or any other variables to keep in mind and when the buyback conversation may become a little more tangible. Rod Smith : Yeah, it's a good question, Eric. I would say, first off, we -- you saw in the numbers, we're at about 4.8 times levered. Our stated range is 3 times to 5 times. So we're below that. We're also at about 5 times at the end of Q1. Leverage for Q1 and Q2 were materially supported or helped by some onetime nonrecurring benefits. With that said, and Steve alluded to this earlier, we do expect leverage to tick back up to 5.0 or 5.1 during Q3 and Q4. We'll see where that goes. But we're very, very confident that we are on the right path, driving towards getting to that 5.0 and we will get there. Most likely the second half of this year, if not the beginning of next year. So with that, we do feel as though we'll be in a position to have financial flexibility and kind of manage the business without a hyperfocus on the delevering. And with that said, we'll be very disciplined. We'll be looking at all of our capital allocation options, including our CapEx programs, not in general, but specifically country by country, deal by deal, asset by asset. And there's some compelling things that we can invest our capital in as Steve outlined in his kind of strategic prepared remarks and in some of the Q&A. So the CapEx programs are still very much supportive of long-term total shareholder returns. So that's an opportunity. When it comes to buybacks, the buybacks, it has to create more shareholder value over the long term than deploying it towards CapEx or an M&A program or delevering. There are simple ways to look at it in terms of just you buyback a share stock as the yield above or below the cost of debt, we'll certainly be looking at that. But longer-term growth rates are really important, too, on our own business as well as where we invest, we'll be looking at the returns beyond day one as well. But rest assured, we will be doing a lot of work being very opportunistic and disciplined when it comes to capital allocation across the board and buying back shares will be one of options that that we have in our toolkit we'll be continuing to evaluate. Eric Luebchow : Thanks guys. Rod Smith : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo from Moffitt Matheson. Please go ahead. Nick Del Deo : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, going back to CoreSite. Yeah, I think you're planning your first aggregation edge data center in Raleigh. And I also saw a footnote that you're launching a JV with Stonepeak in Denver. So I guess, can you talk about what you're hoping to achieve with those projects, the rationale for the deal structure in Denver and whether we should expect more projects like these in the coming years? Steve Vondran : Sure. Those are two very different projects. So I'll start with the Raleigh. So the Raleigh data center is really being done by our US tower division, working with CoreSite. And that is our continued evolution as we work with various partners on the edge, we needed a little bit more of a sandbox for them to play in. And Raleigh was a good market. It has low power costs. There's a lot of enterprise there that are working on edge applications. And so we think it's a good place for us to kind of start there, and we are seeing demand in that market that we think we can serve there. That one is expandable. It's on a tower site, so we were able to get easy access to land, there's power, there's fiber. It was just a great location for us. And so we'll see how that plays out over time. Again, that's part of our experimentation on the edge, and we do have some clear visibility into monetizing that as well. So that's a benefit of having sandbox that makes money. The second one, DE3. So this is a little bit different. This is our first purpose-built data center in Denver. And while we do have a small presence in Denver, it's not really a campus effect yet. And what we've said over time is we're open to structures where we're a minority partner where it gives us the ability to build a campus over time. So for that particular facility, we're taking advantage of the opportunity that we have to meet the demand for a strategic customer to support the ecosystem in Denver, and we're utilizing our partnership and the capital flexibility that that we have with that partnership to not redirect any of our current cash flow -- our current CapEx program to that and our partner is happy to fund that development. And the reason we're doing that is to really start building that campus in in Denver and to do it a capital-efficient way for us. And so we think that's the right structure for that facility. That parcel is large enough to build other buildings. We have retained ownership of those other buildings in CoreSite. And so if we build future pieces of the campus, that would likely be done in CoreSite. And we do have the ability to buy back the one that's being built there, if we decide that that's the right thing to do as we build an ecosystem over time. And that structure today is -- it's very similar to what you're seeing other data centers do with private capital partners. CoreSite's going to own 15%, Stone People own 85% as we developed that first facility there in Denver. Nick Del Deo : Okay. That's great. Thanks for the detail, Steve. Second, kind of turning back to emerging markets towers. In your prepared remarks, you said that scale is the most critical driver of value creation overseas. I guess, how do you define and measure scale? Is it just a given number of towers? Is it share of towers? Is it exposure to top carriers when you look at scale by region versus country? Just interested in any each on that front so you can better understand kind of what you're looking for? Steve Vondran : Sure. Look, at a high level, you want to be the number one or number two independent tower company in a market, if you can. That's your ideal situation to be in. At a broad level, scale means being strategically relevant to your customers. So you could have some localized scale without having national scale as long you're relevant enough to have some leverage in the negotiations with the customers there. And so that's really how we think about scale. We have some markets where we're subscale, but we're able to leverage regional scale in those by using operating leverage. And what I mean by that is we can serve some of those under scale markets with the human capital we have in other parts of those markets. So we might operate a small country from a larger country that's nearby. And that's how we're getting some operational scale. It helps us get even better returns in there that you really would naturally get in a subscale market. But at the end of the day, we want to be kind of the number one or two in the market in terms of independence, captives are a little bit different because they have different dynamics with it. But that's how we think about it overall. And we do have -- like if you look at Latin America, about 97% of our sites are in markets where we're the leader. In Africa, it's well over half of the sites that we're the market leader in. A little bit lower in Europe today. But overall, we felt we have adequate scale in all those markets to be strategically relevant to the customers and to get the cost synergies that you get. Nick Del Deo : Okay. That's great. Thanks Steve. Operator : And your final question today comes from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead. Batya Levi : Great. Thank you. Comprehensive MLAs have helped provide visibility for domestic growth. Can you talk about if you're also seeing opportunities to implement the same strategy internationally? And could that change the growth trajectory? I also wanted to follow up on AFFO growth with solid revenue growth and good cost control. If you just put FX and fluctuations in rates of side, do you think that we're back on a trend for high single-digit FFO growth for the next few years? Thank you. Steve Vondran : Sure, I'll take the further part about the MLAs and Rod can touch on the growth. The conference of MLAs that we have in the U.S. are pretty much uniquely in the U.S. right now. We've talked to partners internationally about those contract structures and there's some interest in learning more about them. But because the -- they haven't been using those markets before, there's some understandable concern on the counterparty side, about being the first one to take the leap into that. So we've encouraged them to talk to our U.S. customers to understand the benefits of that. So I'm hopeful that we can export those because, again, those create value for both parties. It gives us predictability on the revenue side. It gives customers predictability on their cost side. It vastly simplifies the deployment of networks by the customers. So I'm hopeful that our international customers will embrace that, and we'll continue talking with them about it until they do, but none to announce right now, Batya. Batya Levi : Got it. Rod Smith : Hey, Batya, Rod here. I'll take the AFFO piece. So I'll start off by saying we believe in the fundamentals of the portfolio that we've built around the globe. Certainly, when you think about our ability to drive AFFO per share growth, it really starts with revenue growth. So I could give you a very short answer to your question. I'll give you the medium answer here. So the way we think about the bits and pieces that support and drive AFFO per share growth. Certainly in the US, we're continuing to see demand and activity levels that are in line with our previous long-term guide on OTBG, organic tenant billings growth in and around that 5%. You've heard us say we continue to see demand for our emerging markets. And in Europe, we're seeing escalating new business growth, which is really good. That's all very supportive over the long-term for the international towers that we have to deliver higher organic tenant billings growth than the US does by maybe a couple hundred basis points. That is certainly kind of front and center. CoreSite, as you heard from Steve and you see in our numbers and you have for several quarters is outperforming our expectations, and very accretive to overall growth rates, and that's been really nice to see. And we continue to build sites very opportunistically and disciplined, maybe not as many as we used to, but we build sites that adds to growth rate in revenue. So you put all that together and you're in the upper single digits in terms of revenue growth, call it 6% or 7%, somewhere in that range. And then we're focused on margin expansion, controlling the direct cost driving margins up. That means you get into that range around the gross margin point. SG&A, this year, loan SG&A is going down $30 million year-over-year decline last year as well. So SG&A cost control is also supportive and accretive to those growth rates. So when you think about all the things that we've done and everything that we see, the fundamentals in this business for our towers globally is really strong and could potentially deliver upper single-digit AFFO growth on the towers around the globe. Now the things that you do need to watch, we certainly watch and pay a lot of attention to, some of these are not under our control, of course, interest rates could go up or down, that could be positive or negative from time-to-time. FX, same thing could go up, could go down, it could be positive, could be negative. And then in particular, very specifically, we have the ATC India sale, which we are very confident will close out during the second half of this year just like we previously guided. That will be slightly dilutive, maybe about $0.08 to $0.09 on a per quarter basis. So if we close it early in October, you might see $0.08 or $0.09 dilution from that. And then you'll see the follow-on kind of tail of that into next year. But absent interest rates or assuming interest rates are flat, FX is flat and eliminating the ATC India, we have a portfolio of assets here that are performing very well operationally with the fundamentals that could deliver upper single-digit AFFO per share growth. Batya Levi : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Rod Smith : Welcome. Adam Smith : All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any questions. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Please go ahead, sir. Adam Smith : Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. I'm joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our President and CEO; and Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO, and Treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2024 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks described in documents we subsequently file from time-to-time with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve Vondran : Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining today. As you can see in our Q3 results, demand remains strong across our global portfolio of real-estate assets. In our Tower business, our customers' efforts to deploy mid-band 5G for additional coverage continue to support a healthy pipeline of activity across the US, Europe and parts of our emerging markets. The discussions we're having with our carrier customers about their need to address upcoming capacity requirements, particularly in the US, further reinforce our bullish expectations for the densification phase of the 5G investment cycle. Additionally, our data center segment delivered another fantastic quarter of leasing, benefiting from accelerating hybrid IT deployments and early signs of AI-related demand. To complement our top line growth, we're executing our previously stated strategic initiative to enhance our portfolio composition and improve the quality of earnings by focusing our discretionary capital in developed markets and closing our India sale. I want to thank all the teams involved in the sale process for their efforts and dedication to getting the deal over the finish line and for ensuring a successful outcome for both American Tower and Brookfield. Finally, we continue to add value by managing our cost structure to maximize conversion rates, expand our margins and drive profitability across our business. We remain committed to executing on all these strategic priorities that position American Tower to deliver durable, high quality earnings growth over the long term. On our last call, I talked through the key lessons learned from our historical capital investments that have led us to refine our approach to investment underwriting and prioritize capital deployment to our developed markets. Having recently covered the US tower market where demand remains firmly intact, I'll focus today's remarks on our other developed market platforms, Europe and CoreSite. However, I'd first like to recognize the critical efforts of our US teams who have been working with our customers to rapidly restore essential communication and emergency services to those communities affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. I really appreciate all their hard work. So now I'd like to highlight trends in our European and CoreSite businesses, which are each positioned to capture high rates of organic growth and provide opportunities to further invest where returns meet our standards. I'll start with Europe. As we've highlighted on past calls, we were highly disciplined in our approach to inter-select European markets at scale, and we're seeing that patience pay off. In our assessment of Europe, we leveraged our global underwriting and operating experience to effectively evaluate the most attractive markets. Our criteria included macroeconomic stability, government support for mobile connectivity, healthy carrier and counterparty profiles and critical contract terms and conditions. Additionally, we sought market and competitive dynamics where we believe that our value proposition as a true independent operator with over two decades of global experience could successfully deliver a best-in-class customer experience that affords outsized new business and enhanced margins. This rigorous assessment led to the acquisition of select portfolios across Germany, France and Spain, where mobile data consumption is expected to grow at about a 20% CAGR over the next five years and where governments have advocated for nationwide coverage through various activities, including spectrum auctions and subsidy programs like the new deal in France, Spain's 5G UNICO to support rural 5G development and the Gigabit Infrastructure Act at the broader EU level. Importantly, these markets also present a healthy carrier environment, including increased competition in Germany and Spain through new entrants as well as strong market leaders with whom we contract for the majority of our business. Approximately 85% of our revenues in Europe are indexed to carriers with at least a 25% share in their respective markets. This provides a high degree of insulation from further consolidation risk, maintaining our very low exposure to ongoing consolidation in Spain, while providing visibility into sustained growth and quality earnings over the long term. And although land sharing is a reality in certain parts of these markets, we mitigate its impact with well-structured customer agreements that allow us to either monetize such sharing or provide certain revenue protections that support our growth objectives. American Tower is uniquely positioned to unlock opportunities in Germany, France and Spain where the neutral host independent tower model is still relatively nascent. Leveraging our considerable experience and capabilities can help solve persistent operational challenges experienced by the carriers and infrastructure operators throughout past network cycles. Since closing the Telxius acquisition, which increased our asset count in the region over five times, we further enhanced our ability to serve our customers by internalizing critical activities that align with our global competencies, reducing reliance on external vendors, strengthening our process management leadership and when possible, integrating our teams directly with our customers to expedite decision making and improved processes. Our disciplined approach to market entry and effective operational execution have yielded an attractive growth profile in Europe. On the organic side, healthy carrier demand combined with the benefit of CPI linked escalators have yielded an average of over 7% organic tenant billings growth over the past three years and we remain confident in driving organic growth, in line with our mid-single-digit expectations in the region going forward. To complement this organic growth, we also invested in increased newbuild activity, delivering 1,200 new sites since the start of 2021. Additionally, we've improved the process of getting new colocations on air to further evolve the neutral host model and reduce the carrier's total cost of ownership. This required engagement with regulators, landlords, tenants, vendors and the enhancement of our own internal skill sets that's paying off as approximately 70% of our expected organic new business growth in 2024 is coming through colocations, of which over a quarter are on rooftops. Taken altogether, we see a long runway of sustained growth with optionality to further capitalize on a multi-year pipeline of attractive development opportunities. As carriers continue to rapidly deploy mid-band spectrum and densify their networks to meet insatiable data demand, we'll continue to assess opportunities using both the principles that shaped our investments for over a decade and the recent learnings we've institutionalized. Now, I'll switch to our data center business. We also see long-term demand trends within our US data center segment, which like our European portfolio, provides a platform for incremental development opportunities underwritten at very attractive return profiles. Since closing the CoreSite transaction at the end of 2021, we've achieved record-breaking leasing each year and are on pace again to deliver a new high mark in 2024. As we've highlighted on past calls, our portfolio is optimally positioned to benefit from accelerating demand for hybrid and multi-cloud IT architecture due to its ability to facilitate seamless, secure, nationwide low-latency interoperability, including native cloud access to a diverse set of customers. Critically, we believe that CoreSite's interconnection campus model, which can be extended to distributed endpoints to support the low-latency and cost-efficiency required for future use cases, represents a potentially distinct option for new synergistic revenue opportunities when combined with our tower assets at the edge. Today, I'm more convinced than ever that the mobile edge is going to present a meaningful addressable market for us, in part due to the rapid acceleration in AI deployments and the infrastructure required to accommodate future latency-sensitive workloads like inferencing. And while the timing might be delayed relative to our initial expectations, we continue to expect synergies between our Tower and CoreSite platforms over the long -term. In the meantime, we're realizing the benefits of the step-function of AI demand and our leasing results at CoreSite. AI-driven workloads are a growing component of CoreSite's signed leasing and customer requirements are indicating that demand will only grow over the near-to-medium term. Over the past several quarters, enterprises have started to build their own GPU space architectures connecting to the cloud either through auto-ramps or our virtual OCX offering. These deployments resemble typical hybrid IT architecture, but they're larger and more power-dense. As with virtually all workloads across the AI spectrum, our facilities are well-equipped to accommodate this need. More indirectly, our data center portfolio is also benefiting from hyperscale AI absorption that's consuming a record level of capacity throughout our key markets, exacerbating the supply-and-demand imbalance and further supporting the favorable pricing environment for both new leasing and renewals into the foreseeable future. Given the healthy demand catalyst that we see persisting for many years to come, attractive rates of return that are de-risked through accelerated preleasing activity, we plan to allocate more capital to CoreSite over the next several years, likely meeting or exceeding the $480 million in development spend assumed at the midpoint of our 2024 guide. Recently, I've received questions as to whether we'd be interested in participating in the extensive hyperscale development taking place in the market today. We see a long runway ahead for CoreSite's retail-oriented approach, which has yielded industry-leading returns on a sustained basis as our facilities continue to meet and in certain cases exceed our initial expectations for mid-teen stabilized yields. Thus single-tenant hyperscale opportunities are not a priority unless there was a clear opportunity for one to serve as a seed for a new campus or if there were compelling opportunities to invest with our JV partner, Stonepeak. Today, we're prioritizing the expansion of existing campuses, new ground-up facilities adjacent to existing campuses or potentially selected expansion of our national ecosystem by establishing new campuses and new markets. We remain focused on developing multi-tenant colocation facilities, methodically curating the mix of customers deployed within our facilities to enhance the value of our interconnection ecosystem and effectively planning for long-term absorption and power needs. In closing, American Tower has built a global platform of assets that are well-positioned to capitalize on the exponential rise in data demand. Our CoreSite data center business and European tower operation are both differentiated by asset quality and best-in-class operations, creating a leading experience for our customers as they deploy the critical networks and applications of today and the future. These businesses are uniquely positioned to deliver attractive sustained organic growth and provide optionality for us to assess future opportunities for investment. This portfolio strength, combined with demand catalysts across our global portfolio and the ongoing progress we're making in executing the strategic priorities I laid out earlier in this year, position American Tower extremely well to deliver high-quality earnings growth and total shareholder returns for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Rod to discuss Q3 performance and our updated outlook. Rod? Rod Smith : Thanks, Steve. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. As you saw in this morning's press release, adjusted for certain non-cash items in the quarter, including the loss taken upon closing our ATC India sale, our solid third quarter results continue to highlight strong demand across our exceptional portfolio of global assets. These durable demand trends, combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, continued focus on cost management and strong balance sheet, position us to deliver sustained high-quality earnings, growth and shareholder returns over the long term. Before I dive into our results, I want to highlight a key reporting change as it relates to the successful closing of our ATC India sale on September 12th. You will now see historical results associated with our India business reported as discontinued operations, represented as a standalone line item on the income statement, balance sheet, and in our reconciliations to attributable AFFO. As such, certain reported measures, including revenues and expenses within the income statement and non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA and tenant billings, will now be presented to exclude discontinued operations. I encourage you to refer to the definitions and footnotes throughout our Q3 earnings presentation and press release for added clarity on how the discontinued operations treatment is reflected in our results. Additionally, we have introduced new metrics, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders or attributable AFFO as adjusted, and AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders per share or attributable AFFO per share as adjusted. These new metrics represent results from continuing operations adjusted for a full period of interest expense savings associated with the use of proceeds from the India sale. The intent of these as adjusted metrics is to provide investors with what we believe our continuing operations would produce an attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share. We believe this will be useful in determining an appropriate baseline for future periods. Now, a few highlights from the quarter. First, in the third quarter, demand for our global portfolio of assets remained strong as we saw a continued acceleration in application volumes in the US, which nearly doubled those of the prior year period and similar growth in our services gross margin. Internationally, mid-single-digit organic tenant billings growth was supported by another quarter of accelerating new business contributions in Europe and double-digit organic growth in Africa. International organic growth was complemented by selective new site construction, including the fourth consecutive quarter of over 100 sites in Europe and approximately 500 new sites overall. As Steve mentioned, demand in our US data center business remains exceptionally strong and well in excess of our initial underwriting as CoreSite is on track for its third consecutive record year of new leasing, supporting year-over-year revenue growth of over 10%. Next, complementing the demand trends driving our top line results, we continue to execute strategic priorities laid out earlier this year. On the cost management side, third quarter SG&A, excluding bad debt declined nearly 2% year-over-year, supporting cash-adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of roughly 30 basis points as compared to the prior year period. We also made progress in optimizing our portfolio, closing our India sale and signing agreements to sell our land interests in Australia and New Zealand. Additionally, we further strengthened the balance sheet by using ATC India sale proceeds to reduce gross debt and we expect further reductions from efficient repatriation in the near term. Importantly, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB flat from BBB-minus during the quarter, signaling our momentum in executing key financial and operating strategies to enhance our balance sheet strength, financial flexibility and portfolio quality. These achievements reinforce our commitment to actively assess our global portfolio to focus on platforms where we can drive high-quality earnings and earnings growth, outsized returns and compelling total shareholder value over the long-term. Finally, on the customer front, we took certain provisions in Colombia related to WOM, who filed for the equivalent of US bankruptcy earlier this year. Any outcome of the potential reorganization is uncertain and it would be premature to speculate, but we began recognizing revenue on a cash basis and reserved a portion of outstanding AR as bad debt. In the third quarter, this resulted in revenue reserves of $13 million, including $3 million in straight line and another $8 million recognized as bad debt expense. For context, WOM Columbia's gross revenue makes up approximately 1.5% and less than 0.5% of our total Latin America and consolidated property revenues respectively. Turning to third quarter property revenue and organic tenant billings growth on Slide 6. Consolidated property revenue declined approximately 1% year-over-year and increased nearly 1% excluding non-cash straight-line revenue. Growth was negatively impacted by roughly 3% due to FX as well as by the non-recurrence of certain one-time benefits in the US in the prior year period and revenue reserves taken in the current period in Colombia. As I mentioned, performance was supported by the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our US Data Center business. Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated organic tenant billings growth was over 5%. In our US and Canada segment, growth was 5% or approximately 6% absent Sprint related churn. As we have previously indicated, we expect to see a step-down towards 4% growth in Q4 due to the commencement of the final tranche of Sprint churn, consistent with prior outlook assumptions. On the international side, growth was 5.7%, representing an enhancement of over 100 basis points compared to prior expectations through the exclusion of the India business. Turning to Slide 7, adjusted EBITDA declined approximately 1% year-over-year, primarily due to the revenue drivers, I just discussed. Growth excluding non-cash straight-line was just over 2%, benefiting from disciplined cost management and a roughly 100% increase in our services gross margin associated with an increase in tower activity. Growth was negatively impacted approximately 3% by FX headwinds. Moving to the right side of the slide, AFFO attributable to American Tower common stockholders increased 2.6% year-over-year, driven by the high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA growth to AFFO through the effective management of interest costs, maintenance CapEx and cash taxes, partially offset by the timing of our India sale. On an as adjusted per share basis, growth would have stood at nearly 3%. Now shifting to our revised full year outlook. I'll start with a few key updates. First, outlook has been adjusted for the close of our India transaction. As a result, historical India results will now be treated as discontinued operations and as such, our property revenue, organic tenant billings and adjusted EBITDA will exclude India contributions for the full year. Our reported AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders will include contributions from discontinued operations up to the date of closing. Prior year periods have been adjusted accordingly. Next, our core business and the drivers that underpin our performance remain solid. As a company, we're focused on executing on a strong pipeline of new business demand, driving cost discipline and margin expansion across the global business and effectively allocating our capital in a manner that supports sustained value creation. As you'll see, we're absorbing provisions in our outlook related to WOM, consisting of $21 million in incremental revenue reserves, including $3 million in straight-line and an additional $15 million in bad debt expense, which combined represent $36 million in downside to adjusted EBITDA and $33 million to AFFO relative to our prior outlook. However, we're more than offsetting that exposure through direct expense savings and an anticipated settlement with a customer in Brazil associated with the cancellation of future lease obligations, the latter contributing $35 million of upside. Lastly, our revised FX assumptions include an incremental headwind of $25 million, $20 million and $17 million to property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders respectively. Turning to Slide 8, we are increasing our expectations for property revenue from continuing operations by approximately $15 million. This outperformance includes $15 million of core upside, primarily driven by our data center segment and the one-time customer settlement in Brazil, partially offset by WOM related reserves and an anticipated delay in certain non-run rate reimbursements in the US, which we now expect to receive in 2025. Non-core outperformance is driven by increases in pass through revenue and straight-line. Total outperformance was partially offset by FX. Moving to Slide 9. Organic tenant billings growth expectations for consolidated US and Canada, Africa, Europe and Latin America remain unchanged with trends and catalysts consistent with our prior assumptions. The removal of the lower-growth India business did increase our international expectation by roughly 100 basis points from the prior outlook to approximately 6% and provides a modest benefit to our consolidated company expectations, though not enough to move our expectation of approximately 5%. Turning to Slide 10. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations by $5 million. This outperformance is driven by the revenue drivers I just mentioned, together with incremental operating expenses upside achieved through a combination of recurring savings from various strategic initiatives as well as certain non-recurring benefits, gross margin expectations for our US services business remain intact. Although certain anticipated project delays into 2025 will likely bring our revenue modestly below initial estimates. Partially offsetting the benefits to adjusted EBITDA, we've assumed $15 million of additional bad debt expense associated with WOM and another $20 million in FX unfavorability. Moving to Slide 11. Adjusting our prior attributable AFFO per share outlook midpoint of $10.60 to the timing of the India closing resulted in approximately $0.12 of dilution, leading to a midpoint of $10.48 per share. This is directionally consistent with the dilution expectations communicated on past calls. Relative to prior outlook, adjusted for the ATC India closing, our revised outlook reflects upside of $0.05, moving the midpoint to $10.53 per share. Improvements include approximately $0.05 in outperformance from our India business through the September 12th closing date and the 100% conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA upside from our continuing operations on a currency neutral basis, which is largely offset by the impacts of FX. On an as adjusted basis, the outlook midpoint remains consistent at $9.95 per share, reflecting the core outperformance in our continuing operations, offset by FX. Moving to Slide 12. Our capital allocation plans remain relatively consistent, except for the removal of $105 million of capital expenditures allocated to India in our prior outlook. Our planned dividend distribution remains at $6.48 per share with the expectation to resume growth in 2025, all subject to Board approval. In summary, at the start of the year, we laid out a compelling set of expectations for 2024, reflective of the strong durable data demand trends that continue to highlight the criticality of our real-estate assets. Our top line financial targets assumed accelerating demand in the US and Europe, ongoing growth through 5G coverage and 4G densification across our emerging markets and a continuation of near-record setting leasing in our data center segment. To capture that demand, we established a set of strategic priorities aimed to effectively support our customers needs and drive new business opportunities manage our costs and capital structure and optimize our portfolio through selective asset sales and refined capital allocation priorities to enhance margins and the quality of our earnings profile. Our accomplishments to date and expectations for the duration of the year reflect the successful execution across each of these priorities, we believe this momentum will position us for an even stronger future, enabling us to drive attractive high quality growth and shareholder value for years to come. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Ric Prentiss : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Steve Vondran : Good morning, Rick. Ric Prentiss : Hey, I have two areas of questions. One at the top line and one at the bottom line. Last year on the third-quarter call, you gave some color on new lease activity in North America, kind of saying, hey, we're going to split the goalpost, no guidance given at the time, but kind of directionally, we'll split the goalpost, we'll be above '22 level, but below '23 levels. As we look at the green shoots and the positive stuff you just went through on your presentation, directionally, how should we think about '25 new lease activity versus '24 in North America? Steve Vondran : Yes. I'll take that, Ric. It's still too early to give guidance for next year. There's still some moving pieces in it. But if you look at the, in particular, the US business, we are hearing a lot of good conversation from our customers about the beginnings of the densification phase. And that's right in line with what we thought was going to happen. And so if you think about next year, in terms of the leasing in the US, we still have this final tranche of Sprint churn that's hitting in October this year that will weigh on the US a bit. And so when you kind of couple that with the kind of leasing environment that we're seeing, what's contractually already committed growth under our comprehensive MLAs, which does tick down just a little bit next year, that's most likely you're going to see us kind of in that mid-4s range in terms of the US growth rate for next year. And that's consistent with our long-term guide of at least 5% from '23 to '27, because if you think about '26 and '27, at that point, we're through the spread churn. And so if you look at 2025 through that lens, we still have about 100 basis points of churn coming in from that final Sprint churn tranche. So if you normalize that out, that's kind of be the mid-5s for next year. So that's kind of the way to think about sizing it and exactly where in that mid-4s range we're going to be, we're not sure yet. We do have one customer that's not uncomprehensive. So there's some volume-driven things with that. We also are hearing some interest from customers in new colocations that would be outside of our comprehensive MLAs. We don't know if that's going to fall in the early part of '25 or the later part of '25 or '26. We're still trying to figure that out. There's a few moving pieces there but directionally, you can think about it kind of being in that mid-4s range. Rod Smith : Hey, Ric. Maybe I would just add to that. In terms of 2024 levels of new business, we had provided you guys all a range of between $180 million and $190 million. And the way the year is shaping up, it's pretty consistent each quarter in terms of the amount of new biz that we loaded on. We expect that to be similar for Q4 as well, so pretty similar to the last three quarters which was all in and around a quarterly contribution of about mid-40s, $45 million or so. That would end up landing us at kind of the lower end of that range around $180 million and that's all kind of supportive of then transitioning into next year and hitting the numbers that Steve just talked about. Ric Prentiss : Okay. And then on the bottom line question, Slide 11 is helpful. Appreciate Slide 11 in the deck. Want to make sure I understand completely not a CPA discontinued ops accounting makes my head spin this morning I'd admit. The -- we have been thinking originally that India would be kind of about $0.08 a quarter, maybe $0.32 a year as far as an impact net-net-net. How should we think about going from $10.60 to $10.48 to the $9.95 is what I'll call AAA FFO adjusted attributable adjusted funds from operations. How should we think about stepping down from that $10.60 to $10.48 to the $9.95, which sounds like that should be our jump-off point to thinking how growth in '25 would look? Rod Smith : Yeah. I think that's right, Ric. So fully appreciate that the numbers can be a little bit complicated with the addition of the sale of India and accounting for that under discontinued ops. I'll try to hit a couple of the highlights here. And certainly, for anyone on the call that wants to go through it in more granular detail, our Investor Relations group is here to walk you through all the detail. First, I'll take you from maybe the $10.60 going over the $10.53, which is kind of our AFFO numbers as reported, right? So the $10.60 -- $10.60 a share was the original outlook. We sold India at the beginning of the fourth quarter here. So that's out of our numbers for the fourth quarter. So that pulled out $0.12. That's just the elimination of the India contribution to AFFO per share for Q4, which they're no longer in there. So we stepped from $10.60 per share to $10.48. Then on an apples-to-apples basis, India outperformed by about $22 million. That was largely with cash tax refunds and a few other items. There's outperformance across cash-adjusted EBITDA of the $20 million we show. And then there's a little bit of FX headwind another $17 million going the other way, primarily in the Latin America countries. That bridges us over to the $4.930 billion, which is equal to $10.53. So that $10.53 still has India in there for the first three quarters. When you drop down to the $9.95, you're basically reducing that by $0.58, which is the combination of pulling out the India contributions to AFFO and also offsetting that with interest savings that we have by using the $2 billion proceeds and the cash we got out earlier than closing in the third -- second and third quarter, which we pulled out another almost $350 million. Using all those proceeds to pay down debt will reduce our interest costs. So the net of taking India contributions to AFFO out also combining that with the interest savings from using the proceeds to pay down debt is the $0.58 that gets you down to the $9.95. And then there is some timing issues in there and some outperformance in that number as well, basically the $22 million that I just talked about from India, the discontinued ops outperformance largely in terms of cash taxes. And that $9.95 is the best representation of our continuing operations AFFO per share for 2024. And that is a really good starting point to think about how the core business, the ongoing business will grow going forward. And as we said, we look forward to mid-single-digit growth rates kind of going forward and that holds true for 2025. So that would put us into next year on an apples-to-apples basis the $9.95. We think we can grow that into the $10.50 range for 2025 and that would be AFFO from continuing operations. And again, Ric, I appreciate that there's a lot of numbers in here and it may take a little bit of time going through with our Investor Relations team. But trust me, when you kind of look through it, it becomes much easier after you've had a few minutes to think about it. I know people on the phone have only gotten the press release earlier this morning and there's a lot to digest. But once you get through it, I think you'll understand it pretty clearly. Ric Prentiss : Understood. Helpful. And bottom line for me that is attributable AFFO per share now that's kind of cleaned up. Is it really a mid-single-digit growing business? Can you get back to high single-digits? Kind of what kind of tailwinds, headwinds kind of would keep you in mid-single-digit versus high single-digits? Rod Smith : Yeah. I think, Ric, certainly getting above mid-single-digits is absolutely possible. We are very happy with the portfolio that we have across the globe. We've been working very diligently to improve the quality of the earnings and selling the India business, removing that volatility from the business is a -- certainly a positive when you think of that. So the long-term growth algorithm still holds true just as we've talked in the past, certainly. We think that US business can grow in the mid-single digits, just like Steve walked through the long-term guide for US OTBG on average that 5%. We do think next year with that final tranche of the Sprint churn will be the low watermark and then it will spring back up in '26 and '27. And you think about that longer-term guide over that whole period, averaging 5%, we're still on track. We're still on track. So that the international business can grow faster than that certainly. We all know that CoreSite is outperforming our original expectations. We're hitting double-digit growth this quarter and will -- for Q3 and we expect double-digit growth here now going forward annually. And we've had two years of record new business in CoreSite and we're pretty well set to either tie that or maybe even set a new record in 2024. So CoreSite is going exceptionally well. We've been very focused on cost controls, expanding margins, managing cash taxes, watching the balance sheet and reducing exposure to floating-rate debt. You put all that together and yes, the portfolio is strong and it's getting stronger as the quality of earnings go up and we've gotten through this interest headwind. So when you think about the longer term, we can get beyond that mid-single-digit growth rate. The areas to watch FX, we still have 25% of our earnings coming from Latin America and Africa. So that there is something that we will watch. And where interest rates go there's always uncertainty there. So we will watch that as well. Steve Vondran : Yeah. And I would just add in, Ric, if you think about kind of our long-term growth algorithm, couple of components to watch out for there. The first is Latin America. Over time, we believe that will come back to high single-digit growth. But for the next few years, we are projecting low single-digit growth in there based on care consolidation churn that's primarily OI, but it's also some potential consolidation that we see kind of on the map. We're seeing some challenges with WOM and there may be a little bit more consolidation there. And that's why we think for the next few years, that's going to be a low single-digits. Once we get past that, that won't be a headwind for us. And we are past the US Sprint churn after the end of this year. So that will be a positive for us. And so the swing factors will really be on what's going to happen with FX over time. And while we have reduced our exposure to it, 25% of our attributable AFFO is still attributable to our emerging markets. So there is still some FX risk there. And just in the last few weeks, we've seen a negative trend in that, that's resulted in a little bit of degradation for next year, just in the past few weeks. And then the other piece is interest rate headwinds and I think it's anybody's guess as to what exactly happens with interest rates over the next few years. So those are the things we'll be watching. But that long-term algorithm of mid to high single-digits holds true even while absorbing some of those costs in there. Ric Prentiss : Great. Appreciate all the color guys. Thanks. Steve Vondran : You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to the line of David Barden of Bank of America. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks for all that color, Rod. Just, Steve, on the CoreSite business, you've been flagging the record leasing, it's not a number you guys have disclosed. Could we have a conversation about what the leasing number is and what the historical context of what you're throwing up now is and what the book-to-bill situation looks like in terms of the available pipeline to make that double-digit revenue growth happen? And then the second question, if I could, Rod, just to follow up on this discussion. So this -- I think what Ric called it the AAA adjusted attributable AFFO. This is a number that you're going to report kind of on an ongoing basis and it will be the anchor for our conversation about the growth in 2025 on a quarterly basis. Is that fair? Thank you. Steve Vondran : Yeah, David, we'll certainly talk about that metric for as long as it's applicable, which will be a little while until we lap this India sale. But while the India sale and the discontinued operations is in our base number or the comparable prior year numbers, we will let you know what it is. Rod Smith : And when it comes to CoreSite, I don't think we've given a specific number in terms of what sales are, but you can think about it as a factor of what they were doing pre-acquisition. That build pipeline, just for reference, we've got about over 40 megawatts of construction ongoing today. It's about 60% pre-leased today and that's replacing the capacity we've sold. So the way to think about that is, their leasing today is significantly higher than the year before we bought them. And the majority of our $70 million backlog that we have today is commencing between now and kind of the first half of 2025 and the remainder is beyond that. So we haven't given a specific sale number. We are giving you guys the backlog and that's the way to think about that revenue growth. We feel very confident in a high single or double-digit, most likely double-digit growth rate for the next several years in terms of revenue commencing there. And that continued strength continues to feed that sales pipeline and we're expecting to have a healthy pipeline in 2025 as well. At this point, all those general dynamics we're seeing in the industry are just continue to accelerate and that is demand for hybrid. Hybrid cloud infrastructure by enterprises is our bread and butter. That's where you continue to see strength in it. And we're starting to see those enterprises now deploy GPUs, their own kind of AI based models and that again is kind of the perfect customer for CoreSite. So we're seeing our existing customers increasing the size of their installations and that's going to keep feeding that pipeline for years to come. So we feel like that growth rate is durable for the foreseeable future right now. Steve Vondran : Yeah. And, David, maybe I would just add, in terms of the relationship with the prior numbers, our backlog in that $70 million range, that's up from a number in the range of $40 million or so when we bought CoreSite in those first couple of years. So it's up 75% or so. And that's a similar level of increase that we're seeing in the new biz roughly. David Barden : Okay. Thank you for the color, both. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Thanks so much. Good morning. And, Rod, you talked about the dividend policy. Perhaps you could just give us some context around how you're thinking about that. If you're growing the bottom line, call it, mid-single-digits, is that the right way to think about dividend growth from here and how that works into payout ratios and leverage and so forth? And just coming back to the CoreSite CapEx, I think you said it could be ahead of the $480 million. I know in the past when you bought this, you were kind of to some extent ring-fencing how much you would spend on CapEx. Can you sort of update that for us? I mean, would you be prepared to go to say $600 million or $700 million or what are the parameters you're thinking about how much money you do commit to data centers? Obviously, a great opportunity and you don't want to go hyperscale at this point, but does sound like you see opportunities to deploy capital at attractive levels, but love to understand how big that might go. Thanks. Rod Smith : Yeah, sounds good, Simon. I'll take the dividend question and then Steve will talk to you about the CapEx for CoreSite. So with the dividend, as we talked about on the last call, we do look forward to resuming dividend growth as we get into 2025. I don't want to get into too much detail in terms of what that growth rate might be, but similar to the way we've discussed it in prior calls, the long-term view of the dividend growth rate is that it will closely mirror the average AFFO per share growth rate over time. So that's the way we think about it. So, if we are hitting a mid-single-digit AFFO per share growth rate on average over time, we would expect that the dividend growth rate on average over that same time period would roughly equal that same kind of a growth rate. That's the way to think about it. You can't really apply that to every individual year because there could be puts and takes. But over time, I think you kind of get the trajectory there. Now, of course, with dividend and dividend policy, every quarter we go to our Board and ask them to approve the dividend declaration and distribution, we would always do that. So everything I'm talking about here is subject to Board approval. But we do -- again, the portfolio that we have is strong. It's getting stronger with the quality of earnings increasing, the balance sheet becoming stronger. So achieving that mid-single-digit AFFO per share growth rate may be driving that up from there as we talked about with Ric's question, that all would kind of tie into our ability to grow the dividend. And if that dividend grows in line with AFFO per share, we do see the dividend payout as a percent of AFFO staying roughly where it is, which, call it, between 60 and mid-60s kind of in that range. That leaves us another $1.5 billion to $2 billion-ish to deploy into our CapEx programs around the globe or use it to buy back shares or we can allocate it to debt reductions if we wanted to, but it still leaves us with plenty of excess capital to run the business. Steve Vondran : And on the CapEx for CoreSite, we're not constraining the business. So the business has the opportunity to deploy as much capital as it wants. And so you could see that number grow kind of into that range that you're talking about. And I would also just reiterate that the beauty of how we've constructed our CoreSite entity with our private capital partners is, we have a lot of optionality in terms of how we fund that additional capital growth. So we'll be able to make the determination how much American Tower wants to put in versus how much we rely on our partners kind of real-time as we're looking at the budgets for next year. So it's too early to tell you what the budget is going to be and what percentage we're going to pay. But it's a very good use of capital. We're still able to underwrite those mid-teens or better development yields and stabilization. And because the pre-leasing is at historically high levels, it's a very low risk way to deploy capital. And we actually get a stabilization even sooner. So we think it's a great use of our capital to do that. We'll continue to fund those developments in our campuses as aggressively as we can sell and build. And so we'll let you know kind of when we lay out our expectations for 2025 where that lands, but the numbers that you're suggesting are in the ballpark of something that could be very reasonable for us to do. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks a lot, Steve. Operator : We'll go next to the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first of all strategically, Steve, you laid out some of the attractive qualities of European Tower business on an organic basis. At the same time, some of the owners of European Tower assets have been more vocal that they're open to potential sales. So I guess all else equal, is it fair to conclude this would be an area where you might consider an acquisition of scale over the coming quarters or years? And then secondly, on the CoreSite business, a couple of things I noted. One is a large land purchase in the quarter. Is that related to CoreSite and the new site development there that you're anticipating? And then I think you also made a comment on maybe inference being a little bit slower to materialize in your initial expectations. So maybe if you could unpack that -- those two things a little bit, that would be great. Thank you. Steve Vondran : Sure. So I'll start with the -- let me start with the CoreSite just because that's the most recent you asked. The land purchase that we did was in LA. And that's to expand our LA campus and that's to make sure we have a continued runway to continue to serve our customers there. So that's again, you'll see us continue to invest in land around our campuses and that just gives us more capacity to continue to build and grow over time. And that's what that one was. In terms of inferencing, I don't think it's been slower to develop than we thought. That was the edge that I was talking about that's been a little bit slower to develop than we thought. The inferencing layer, we're seeing some robust demand for that. And in fact, we're able to be very selective about the counterparty risk that we're taking there. We think that we're at ideal place for inferencing because that's really the distribution channel, how you interact with the large learning models. And we've certainly seen a lot of interest in that and we are writing some contracts with that. But there are a lot of kind of unproven businesses out there. So we're being very selective about that counterparty risk. In terms of Europe, we would love to be able to replicate what we did with Telxius and other markets. We don't feel like we have to do that. We have adequate scale in Germany and Spain. We'd like to find some more scale in France if we could because we're a little bit subscale there. But we have to be patient and disciplined. We've seen a number of portfolios trade in Europe that had terms and conditions that just aren't conducive to long-term shareholder value growth in terms of the way we see it. And so we've reiterated those kind of factors a few times, but terms and conditions are very important to us as are the counterparties that we're contracting with as well as the overall colocation dynamic. And what's working so well for us today in Europe is we have very low churn. We bought towers at a low tenancy. We have very little risk of some of the consolidation we're seeing in Spain and other markets. And we're seeing some competitive dynamics emerge in Europe that just weren't there in the past decade or so where you're seeing people competing on network quality a little bit compared to what they were in the past and that's promoting some builds. And you couple that with the real push by the governments to get ubiquitous coverage everywhere, including the rural areas, it's a great dynamic for us. So if there were portfolios that came available in Europe that had similar characteristics some more terms and conditions at the right valuation, I would certainly be interested, but we're not going to rush into anything and we're not going to buy things that don't meet our investment criteria that create that long-term value chain. Rod Smith : Hey, James. Maybe when it comes to Europe, maybe I'll just highlight a couple of revenue items for you here. So you've heard us say in the past that we're very happy with the European business that we have. It's outperforming our original expectations. I'll just hone in on the organic tenant billings growth. We hit another quarter where we were over 6% OTBG for Europe. We're looking at about 6% for the full year. And that's a very balanced 6%. So we're -- in the quarter, we were a little over 4% contributions from organic new biz. That has been accelerating for the last several quarters. It is higher than it was in any quarter in the last six quarters or so. So we're seeing an accelerated level of activity in the market, which we like a lot. The escalator is right around 3% and the churn rate continues to be below 1%. So it's a very balanced revenue generation model that we've been able to build there and we're very excited about the platform that we have and the durability of the way that that business could grow. It looks very much like the US in terms of those numbers. Operator : Anything further, Mr. Schneider? James Schneider : No, thank you. That's great. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Batya Levi : Great. Thank you. Back to the domestic operations. Can you talk about if you're seeing any change in the colocation versus amendment mix? And to the extent that DISH starts to expand its network, is it mostly included in the holistic agreement that you have right now or could there be upside? And one thing quickly on domestic gross margins. I think they were down a little bit year-on-year. Is there anything to call out there? Thank you. Steve Vondran : Sure. I'll talk about the demand trends and, Rod, you can talk about the gross margin. Overall, the mix that we're seeing is pretty consistent today, but we're seeing more interest in new colos. So we're getting -- we're having requests for information like what [rad] (ph) centers are available, what\u2019s the structural capacity. Those kind of precede the applications typically as we're doing our planning. And the conversations we're having certainly indicate that they're moving into a densification phase that will shift more to new colos. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing there. In terms of how they work in our comprehensive agreements, every one of those agreements is a little bit differently -- works a little bit differently. Some of them are just amendments only. So in those agreements, all the new colocations are incremental. And in some of those, they may include a limited amount of colocations. And once they reach that number of colocations that's in the comprehensive agreement, the incremental over that would be extra outside of the comprehensive agreements. And so as we constructed our long-term guide, we always knew that we would get to this densification phase and that the contribution from new colocation outside of the comprehensive agreements will become a larger factor and that's what we expect to see over the next several years. We expect to see this ramp-up in colocations that will add into the growth that we're expecting to see over the next several years. And that's very consistent with what we're starting to hear from customers as they're planning for the next phase of their network development. Rod Smith : Hey, Batya, thanks for joining the call. So on the margins, I'll just hit the total margins and this applies to the domestic margins as well because the things I'll describe are really in the domestic business. But we had margins for the quarter a year ago for Q3 of 2023 of about 74.7%. That's down to 74.2%. So you look at that and it's a 50 basis-point reduction. The largest call out that I would highlight for you is the straight line impact there is about a negative 90 basis point hit to that margin. So of course, we all know straight line is a non-cash item and it just kind of goes -- it -- it's a dwindling balance here as we kind of run through that straight line curve. So on a cash basis, the margins really increased 40 bps, 50 bps, not decreased. And then there's a few other small things, some one-time settlements in the prior year that's not reoccurring, things like that. But the straight line balance coming through is the biggest change -- is the biggest impact that makes it the reported margins come down, but the cash margins are actually going up. Batya Levi : Got it. Okay. Steve Vondran : Batya, one quick clarification on the MLAs. This is largely a new lease comprehensive agreement. So that when the new colocations would be included until they get to the maximum number of leases under that agreement, which we don't expect to happen for some time. Batya Levi : Got it. Thank you. Steve Vondran : Sure. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Nick Del Deo : Hey, good morning, guys. Steve, in your prepared remarks, I think you said that you're more convinced than ever that mobile edge is going to eventually be an opportunity even if it's taking a bit longer to transpire. I guess, are there specific conversations or data points or other things you can point to help us understand that increased level of conviction? Steve Vondran : Sure. So what I would say is, we've got a few proofs of concepts that we're working on with some partners on some kind of niche use cases. But the underlying theme that we're seeing from really kind of the whole ecosystem and I would point to the ecosystem at CoreSite is you're seeing more decentralization. So you're seeing the cloud providers and the AI providers start looking at more distributed architecture today. And the first phase of that is going to more regional centers. And that's what you're seeing driving a lot of the hyperscale activity that's out there, is you're seeing people diversify into more regions. Some of that is to take advantage of power costs but some of that's also to get closer to the end user and the lower latency and transport costs. And so, as we see that continuing to emerge, we think that will continue. And the conversations we're having with those types of players are that they want to continue to diversify over time. So they'll go to more regional facilities for a period of time. They're looking at Tier-2 markets, which is something that we're exploring with CoreSite is looking at expanding our presence in a couple of Tier-2 markets. You saw us do that in Miami a couple of years ago. We're still looking for opportunities to do that. And then that kind of diversification will continue until it gets out to the wireless edge, we believe over time. At the same time, we're seeing our carrier customers start talking about going to 5G standalone infrastructure versus the non-standalone 5G that's been deployed to date. And as you look at what's happening across the globe, you're seeing carriers that go to 5G standalone look at mobile edge compute more and more. So as we kind of look at both sides of that ecosystem, the wireline and the wireless, they're both going into an architecture that suggests the need for more compute at the edge. And so as we have those conversations and talk about what that eventual plan is and talk with them about what that infrastructure needs to look like at the edge, we're becoming more convinced than ever that that's going to happen. And that's really kind of what I'd point you to. Again, it's taking longer than we thought. You had to get the 5G standalone on the wireless side for that to make sense. And on the wireline side there's a little bit of evolution that has to happen to get into that more distributed architecture. But once we -- once that momentum starts, they'll keep pushing out further and further towards the consumer. Nick Del Deo : Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you, Steve. And then one other on, thinking about some of your emerging tower markets. You've been clear in your words and actions that you're tightening up CapEx there. I guess, has there been any sort of customer reaction to that decision? So for example, customer engagement with respect to discussing larger commitments, maybe if you're not willing to put as much CapEx behind new builds or anything along those lines? Steve Vondran : We've been engaging with our customers on that. They understand the issues. I mean they're good business people. Of course, they would love for us to invest more capital there, but they understand that we need to run our business in a way that creates shareholder value. And so if you look at what we were -- we've been able to talk about publicly where we renegotiated an agreement that results in lower CapEx and more co-locations, that's a result of a customer appreciating the situation we're in and working together to find a win-win solution. And we think that we have the opportunity to continue to do that with those customers. We do want to support our Tier-1 MNOs across the globe. That's an important business for us. We do think that we will continue to see growth in those emerging markets over time. And so we're not saying we're spending no capital. We're just reducing the capital spend there and focusing more in the developed markets. So certainly, customers are a huge piece of that and they've been very receptive to working with us to find the right solution for them and for us. Nick Del Deo : Okay. Thanks, Steve. Steve Vondran : So I guess I should say thank you to all of our customers who are listening for understanding and working with us on that. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Brandon Nispel : Great. Thank you for taking the question. Steve, I think I heard in your answer to Ric's question earlier that you said contracted growth under your MLAs steps down next year. Why is that? Do you guys have another customer who comes off their holistic MLA next year? And then for Rod or Steve, do the assumptions for mid-4% organic billings growth next year in the US include the assumption that churn excluding Sprint should be maintained in the sub 1% range, which it's been the last couple of quarters? Thanks. Steve Vondran : Sure. So, we don't have anyone rolling off a comprehensive agreement. When we structure those agreements, we typically try to structure the revenue toward the activity levels that we're seeing because we don't want to lose the time value of money. And so when you have a densification or when you have a phased building of a 5G network, you don't want to completely smooth it out. It smooths out the peaks and valley some, but you don't want to lose the time value of money for the earlier phases in that. So there's just a little bit of a step down there. But that also corresponds to an increase in new co-locations in the densification phase of it. And so we -- in terms of the kind of mid 4s, we do expect our churn to be at the lower end of the historical range, which was 1% to 2%. We're expecting to be at the lower end of the, but we don't want to get too specific on what that is because it's too early. We're still waiting to size that up before we can give you exact numbers. Brandon Nispel : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Richard Choe : Hi. I just wanted to get an update on the cost management initiatives. And I guess along with that, you pulled back on CapEx on some of the emerging markets, but how should we think about potential divestitures in some of these markets where you feel like you're not of enough scale or the trends can take a long time to turn around? Thank you. Steve Vondran : Sure. So we continue to work on cost management, and SG&A has been a particular focus for us, because that's kind of the low hanging fruit and we continue to make progress on that. And so if you look at kind of cash SG&A excluding bad debt, kind of year-over-year September year-to-date '24 versus '23, excluding the bad debt, it's down about $17 million or 3% over that period of time. So we're still seeing some savings there. Our cost management overall though is more comprehensive than that. We're looking at different ways to globalize parts of our business that'll take longer to realize some of the synergies that we think we can get in terms of looking at a more global approach to things like finance and operations. And we'll continue to explore those. So I do think over time you'll see some savings. It probably won't be as rapid as the savings we had in SG&A, but we think we can continue to expand margins over time with that. And sorry, what was the second part of your question there, Richard? Richard Choe : And then on the emerging markets that I guess where you don't feel like you have enough scale or the\u2026 Steve Vondran : Yeah. So there's nothing I would point to, certainly nothing on the scale of India. In the quarter, we did sign an agreement to sell some third-party land that we had in Australia, New Zealand. And we do have a few land portfolios, fiber businesses, things like that. If we were able to realize the right price line, you might see us look at that, but there's no kind of active process that I would point you to on that. But just to kind of reiterate, we've divested India, Mexico fiber, we divested, we exited Poland. So we are continuing to look at the portfolio. And for us, the real question is, can someone else realize more value on our business than we can. And if they can, then that probably creates more value for our shareholders to monetize it. And so there's nothing specific that I would point to, but the Board and the management team is always looking at all aspects of the business, trying to figure out what the right solution is for each market. Richard Choe : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'll turn it back to our speakers for any closing remarks. Adam Smith : Thank you for everyone for joining the call today. Like Rod said earlier, if there's any questions regarding the representation of discontinued operations or if you have any other questions regarding the results and outlook in general, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for replay. The replay information will be available on the American Tower website. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T event conferencing. You may now disconnect.",
