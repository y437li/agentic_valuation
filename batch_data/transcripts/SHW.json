In order to allow more time to questions, we\u2019ve provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website sherwin.com under Investor Relations First Quarter Press Release. Summarizing overall company performance for the first quarter 2014 versus first quarter 2013, consolidated net sales increased 9.2% to a record $2.37 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and acquisitions. Acquisitions increased net sales 4.5% in the quarter and unfavorable currency exchange decreased consolidated net sales 1.9%. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $103.1 million for the quarter to $1,065.9 million. Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 45% of sales from 44.4% in the first quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $105.4 million over first quarter last year to $884.1 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 37.4% in the first quarter this year from 35.9% last year. Interest expense increased $1.1 million compared to the first quarter last year to $16.4 million, consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $2.3 million to $166.1 million due primarily to the loss from acquisitions and unfavorable currency translations. Acquisitions and unfavorable currency reduced net income in the quarter by $19.2 million and $5.3 million respectively. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 30.5% compared to 31% in the first quarter of 2013. For full year 2014, we expect our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range compared to last year\u2019s rate of 30.7%. Consolidated net income decreased $728,000 to $115.5 million, net income as a percent of sales was 4.9% compared to 5.4% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased to $1.14 per share from $1.11 per share in 2013. Looking at our results by operating segments, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2014 increased 16.4% to $1.36 billion from $1.17 billion last year. Comparable store sales or sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months increased 7.9%. More than half of the Paint Stores Group\u2019s sales increase was due to higher organic paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets. Acquisitions increased net sales $7.2% for the segment. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter. Regionally in the first quarter, our Southwestern division led all divisions followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in all four divisions. Segment profit for the group increased $16.6 million or 12.8% to $146.3 million in the quarter as higher paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by the loss from acquisitions and higher SG&A spending. Acquisitions reduced segment profit to $16.7 million in the quarter. Segment operating margin including acquisitions decreased to 10.8% of sales from 11.1% in the first quarter last year. Turning to the consumer group, first quarter sales increased 5.4% to $325.3 million due primarily to acquisitions and the timing of seasonal shipments to some customers. Acquisitions increased net sales 3.9% in the quarter. Segment profit for the consumer group decreased $2.9 million to $51.1 million in the quarter from $54 million in the first quarter last year. Profit was negatively impacted by higher distribution costs to maintain service levels and by a loss from acquisitions. Acquisitions reduced segment profit $600,000 in the quarter. Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 15.7% from 17.5% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 2.2% to $497.6 million in the quarter due to primarily to selling price increases partially offset by lower paint sales volumes and unfavorable currency translations. Unfavorable currency decreased net sales for the segment 1.6% in the quarter. First quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars increased $12.6 million or 37% to $46.5 million due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and selling price increases. Unfavorable currency translation reduced segment profit $1.8 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 9.3% from 7% in the same period last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales decreased 10% to $182.4 million due to unfavorable currency translation and lower paint sales volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 16.5% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit in the quarter decreased to $10 million from $20.8 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation and lower year-over-year sales volumes. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $3.8 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 5.5% in the first quarter compared to 10.3% in the same quarter last year. Turning to our balance sheet, our total debt on March 31, 2014 was $1.71 billion including short-term borrowings of $87.4 million. Total debt on March 31st last year was $1.7 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $366.5 million compared to $613.9 million at the end of the first quarter 2013. In the first quarter 2014, we spent $29.4 million on capital expenditure, depreciation expense was $41.4 million and amortization expense was $7.6 million. For the full year 2014, we anticipate capital expenditures will be approximately $190 million to $200 million; depreciation will be about $170 million and amortization approximately $30 million. I'll conclude this review with a brief update on the status of our Lead Litigation. In the Santa Clara County case involving public nuisance claims brought by 10 California cities and counties against 5 defendant companies, judge Kleinberg entered his final judgment on January 27th. From this final judgment Sherwin-Williams, NL Industries and ConAgra filed motions with the trial court for a new trial and to vacate the judgment. Following briefing and argument on those motions, they were denied on March 25th. Our notice of appeal was filed on March 28th. The record has not yet been transmitted to the court of appeals nor has a briefing schedule been set. We continue to believe a decision by the court of appeals will take approximately two to three years. That concludes our review of first quarter results for 2014, so I will turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. Chris? Chris Connor :  Thank you, Bob. Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us today. Before I comment on the quarter, let me take a few minutes to summarize where we stand with respect to the Comex Mexico acquisition. As you know, March 31st was the date after which either parties could terminate the purchase agreement without cause. Throughout the month of March, Sherwin-Williams worked closely with Comex and the Mexican competition commission in an effort to secure approval to complete the transaction. We presented a detailed remedy proposal to the commission and as of the end of the month, they had not ruled on our remedy. On April 1st, the seller notified us that they believe we breached our obligation to use all commercially reasonable efforts to secure regulatory approval in Mexico. In response to this notification on April 3rd, we filed a complaint to the New York State Court, seeking a judgment that we are not in breach and we notified Comex that we terminated the purchase agreement. This action was entirely defensive on our part. We could not allow an allegation and breach sustain without an appropriate response. At this point, we do not know how long this legal process will take, but both parties agreeing the termination is final and we\u2019re moving on. After 18 months of effort behind this acquisition, it is an understatement to say that we\u2019re disappointed with the conclusion. On a positive note, the portion of the transaction we did complete, 306 company operated paint stores and 8 manufacturing sites in United States and Canada are on track to deliver outstanding returns to our shareholders over a relatively short timeframe. During the quarter, we made good progress in our efforts to integrate this business into our existing paint stores platform and supply chain operations. We announced the consolidation of four manufacturing and distribution facilities and the headquarters building. On March 1st, all of U.S. store locations converted to The Sherwin-Williams point of sale system, which will significantly improve store operations including color matching and inventory management. The Canadian stores will convert to this POS platform in May. As a result, product availability has improved dramatically in these stores and our field management teams are working closely together on product cross training and improving territory coverage. Our first quarter guidance included acquisition dilution in the range of $0.15 to $0.25 per share for the Comex acquisition. Actual dilution of $0.12 per share reflects the budgeted amount of one-time integration cost and better than expected operating results for these stores in the quarter. Our core business is also off to a good start. If you back out the impact of the acquisition, consolidated sales grew 4.7% in the quarter and profit before tax increased 10%. As a percent of sales, operating profit and profit before tax increased 30 basis points and 40 basis points respectively. Even with dilution from the acquisition, our consolidated gross margin increased year-over-year for the eighth consecutive quarter. The lion\u2019s share of this improvement came from our Paint Stores Group. Organic sales grew 9.2%, operating profit without acquisitions increased 25%, and core operating margins increased 160 basis points. Incremental margin on the core business was 30%. During the quarter, Paint Stores Group added 17 net new stores and our plan calls for a full year store openings in the range of 80 to 90 net new locations. Today our total score count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 3,925 stores compared to 3,529 one year ago. This year-over-year increase in store locations, both organic and acquired along with the investments we made in store and territory staffing in the back half of last year, resulted in 80 basis point increase in segment SG&A as a percent of sales. Without the acquisitions, SG&A as a percent of sales decrease 10 basis points in the quarter. Consumer Group got off to a respectable start from a revenue respective with organic sales up 1.6% in the quarter but the harsh winter weather over the first two months of the year, disruptive raw material deliveries that made it difficult to move finished goods across the northern half of the country and the cases of southern half for that matter. This drove supply chain cost up, resulting in negative flow-through for the group in the quarter. Sales momentum remained strong in the domestic paint and coatings market, particularly in the contractor segment. And Europe is showing early signs of recovery but economic conditions in Latin America have continued to deteriorate. Both our Global Finishes Group and Latin American Coatings Group felt the impact of currency devaluation and weakening market conditions throughout this region. While Global Finishes Group was able to offset the drag from Latin America with growth in other regions, our results in Latin America Coatings Group reflected the impact of soft demand in currency in the quarter and we expect these conditions to persist over the balance of the year. Our ongoing efforts to improve working capital efficiency continue to bear fruit. Working capital decreased as a percentage of sales to 11% from 11.7% in the first quarter last year. If you back out the effect of the acquisition, working capital sales would have been 10.4% at quarter end. The reduction in working capital more than offset the incremental cash used for integration activities in the quarter. As a result, net operating cash in the quarter improved by approximately $8 million compared to our first quarter cash performance last year. During the quarter, we acquired 1.3 million shares of the company stock with treasury at an average cost of a $197.22 for a total investment of $256.4 million. On March 31, we had remaining authorizations to acquire 10.85 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, up from $0.50 last year. We remain optimistic that U.S. residential demand for architectural paint strengthen as we get into the prime painting season, we\u2019re encouraged by early signs of a more robust commercial recovery. This growth will be offset to some degree by challenging conditions in Latin America. Our outlook for second quarter 2014 is for consolidated net sales to increase 8% to 14% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter in the range of $2.80 to $3 per share compared to last year\u2019s record $2.46 per share. This guidance includes our expectations; the U.S. and Canadian stores acquired from Comex will increase net sales by $125 million to $135 million and reduce diluted net income per common share by approximately $0.10 per share in the second quarter. For the full year 2014, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2013 by 8% to 13%. With annual sales at that level, we are reaffirming our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $8.12 to $8.32 per share compared to $7.26 per share earned in 2013. This annual guidance includes our expectation that the Comex stores will increase net sales by a low single-digit percentage in the year and reduce diluted net income per common share by approximately $0.45 to $0.55 per share in the full year of 2014. Again, thanks to all of you for being with us this morning on the call. And now we would be happy to take your questions. Operator :  Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Good morning. Chris Connor : Good morning Bob. Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs : Chris I don\u2019t want to steal your [thunder] from your meeting here in a month or so, but I am just wondering as you guys look at your ability to continue to get some price and lever the store base, can you give us some sense of where the goals are on the gross margin line? And then do you think it\u2019s possible to leverage your SG&A, the sales a little bit more aggressively and maybe get it closer to 32% level for [annual] basis you had during the housing boom? Chris Connor : Thanks Bob. Yes, we will be talking about all those topics when we come to see the entire investment community in New York next month. And specifically to your question on price in SG&A, as you know we did comment in the last quarter call that we did take price to the market in the first quarter. Those price increases are going in I think typically [good] for us, so nothing to report there out of the ordinary. As you know, we\u2019ve given guidance which is somewhat unusual for us that our gross margin this year will come in probably in the 45.5% to 46% range, up from 45.3%. So you can read into that that the price effect is taking place and holding and delivering the expected results. And I think the SG&A numbers are going to be a little bit cloudy this year. As we\u2019ve pointed out, the jump on that is almost 100% attributable to the acquisition rolling in. When we back that out for example and start we\u2019re seeing SG&A leverage, we would expect that the year goes on to continue to see that SG&A leverage as sales ramp up. Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs : And then if I may, you mentioned the price in the store base, can you talk about price to the consumer channel and obviously that takes a little more conservative effort with your channel partners. Does that likely to be as robust not as robust not at all, should we see that development through the year? Chris Connor : Bob it also has been our practice, we haven\u2019t commented on pricing activity so much outside of the stores organization. We\u2019d basically just kind of give you a sense of where we\u2019re managing that inside that platform; we tend to keep those discussions confidential so nothing comment on pricing outside of the stores\u2019 organization today. Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs :  All right, (inaudible) thanks Chris. Chris Connor : Good efforts, thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Great, thanks for taking my questions. So a question with regard to Comex U.S., it sounds like the revenues are coming in maybe better than you expected and certainly the dilution in the first quarter was a lot lower than what you were looking for. And you have maintained the full year expected dilution in that $0.45 to $0.55 range. So I guess I\u2019m wondering, what may be got pushed out or if there is some chunkiness too with it that maybe we need to think about or is it just kind of conservative outlook in terms of what the dilution maybe for the year? Sean Hennessy : This is Sean Hennessy, great question. When we take a look at the first quarter, yes sales were slightly above what we had thought, but the loss was dramatically lower. And we were talking on the first, three months ago when we reported the full year that we thought that 60% of the loss in 2014 would be coming from one time only and 40% would be operational. This quarter it was 80% operational and 20% one-time. So you can see the one time hit did not occur in the first quarter. And I like your word, the quarter is little bit choppy because as Chris mentioned, we have announced four, not all the hits have occurred into the real life due to those closings. So, as those come in, it\u2019s a little choppy trying to determine exactly which quarter those will come in. But we still feel that this time we\u2019re going to say with the guidance for the year on both the $0.45 to $0.55 and the $0.60, $0.40. John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Okay. No, fair enough. And then just one last question, on the non-residential construction side, can you walk us through maybe what you're seeing in the markets there, I know there are some expectations that things are starting to warm up. But have you started to see it? And what are you seeing there? Bob Wells : Yes John, this is Bob. We look at published data sources just like everyone else and it\u2019s been somewhat mixed in recent month. The one benefit of controlled distribution is that we get timely robust feedback from our contractor customers and a lot of this feedback lately has been about bidding activity and order volume. And sufficed to say commercial contractors are clearly busier and more optimistic than they were this time last year. John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Chris Connor : Thank you John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Hey guys, good morning. Chris Connor : Good morning Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Hey, you call that the weather impact in the consumer side from a manufacturing perspective, what about the Paint Stores business as a whole in terms of feedback from your customers. Does that have any impact on your same-store sales, does it still very solid. But just curious as to what your customers\u2019 feedback was? Chris Connor : Yes Ghansham, as the quarter unfold and we certainly had days and weeks of rough weather in certain geographies. I think the interesting impact was we can certainly see that in our daily sales reports. But typically that buy would rebound relatively quickly. So when we did have good weather, we\u2019d have strong days in the back side of that. And the kinds of projects that we\u2019re involved with these products typically don't get deferred if you miss the painting window in February, because store is closed or traffic system -- contractors can't get to job site, doesn't tend to get delay for quarters or years, it gets right back on it. So certainly, we had some days, so we were low on revenue but overall I think the quarter was pretty steady in terms of the demand that we saw. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird:  So Chris, just to kind of take that one step further and just kind of comment on North American housing as a whole from your perspective, do you see any material change just given the increase that people talk about in interest rates and home prices and the potential impact on housing, are you seeing any impact from that whatsoever? Bob Wells :  Johnson, this is Bob again. The March housing starts and permits were released yesterday and it was interesting although the top-line was considered a bit of a miss versus consensus. Single family starts were really solid, they were up 6%. We think that\u2019s the sign of latest strength in the market and we also believe that inventory levels of both new and existing homes are well below where they should be at this point in time if there is any pickup in rate of sales in the spring, they are going to be building. We do not believe that interest rates are significantly affecting affordability, so we would expect some pick up in the rate of sales in the spring. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. Chris Connor :  Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of P. J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Dan Jester - Citigroup: Good morning. It\u2019s Dan Jester on for P.J. Chris Connor :  Hi Dan. Dan Jester - Citigroup:  In Latin America, is the weakness that you are seeing uniform across all the end markets, or are there differences in architectural protective, marine and sort of your product finishes businesses? Chris Connor :  So geographically Dan, the weaknesses unfortunately are on two biggest economies Brazil and Mexico, architectural and both of those categories is probably leading the weakness but we are also not seeing much pick up in the protective and marine segments either. So pretty soft market conditions in both of those economies. And then of course as we commented throughout currency in both places is not helping either. Dan Jester - Citigroup: Okay. And then on your U.S. store count, it\u2019s typically I think you\u2019re back-end loaded in terms of the opening but 17 stores has been a lot more even you had in the first quarter over the last couple of years. So, are you doing anything different in terms of your store openings? Chris Connor : Yes. That\u2019s insightful comment, you\u2019re absolutely correct. In fact when we kind of look at the rolling 12 month new store count were up 95 net new stores this quarter part and parcel that SG&A kind of moving a little bit in the wrong direction as we get excited about the coming demand and getting on top of it. This is actually the preferred path for us. We would rather not be so back-end loaded on new store openings. We don\u2019t control that as much as the municipalities and the building permit cycle that developers face trying to get these retail stores open. So, I think this is nothing more than the start just aligning a little better performance, getting these stores open. And as we commented, we\u2019re pretty much on target here to get this 80 to 90 store count in this year. Dan Jester - Citigroup: Great, thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks Dan. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. And good morning everyone. You called out raw materials in Latin America and kind of didn\u2019t mention anywhere else. So was it just that you couldn\u2019t price it down there or did you actually see inflation everywhere else or what is your outlook? Chris Connor : Raw material comment in Latin America is that so much of that raw material based on there is U.S. dollar denominated. So our raw is relatively flat and benign everywhere including Latin America, it\u2019s the local currency conversion rate that\u2019s the headwind for those guys. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And just a follow-up, can I just ask you about share repurchases and with Comex Mexico not going to happen now, should we anticipate you making a lot of progress towards the remaining authorization over the balance of the year? Sean Hennessy : I think that if you take a look at the long term history of company, we believe that we like to run the company at a one-time term debt to EBITDA. I think that we\u2019ve been higher than that as well as we don\u2019t believe in holding cash. And we\u2019ve been -- have cash balances all the way up to $800 million to $900 million. So now that -- and we held that for the Comex Mexico, so that we have a proper liquidity at closing. I think over the next period of time, you are going to see us get back to those metrics. So I would tell you void of an acquisition, you are going to see us buyback stock. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley :  Okay. That sounds great. I will pass along. Chris Connor :  Thanks Vince. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Thanks, good morning. I appreciate the call. Can you spend a little time talking to us about the DIY part of the market? I know you guys have gone ahead with the [perks] program, wondering if it\u2019s kind of a strong emphasis for you. And also on the DIY, so curious what your consumers, your customers on the consumer side of the business you\u2019re doing with inventory, whether they\u2019re kind of pulling it in or send it back? Chris Connor : Yes. So the DIY business there, I mean it\u2019s always been an important part of our marketing platform here and through our stores organization continues to be something we\u2019re trying to build. To put it in perspective, our business ratio through those neighborhood network of paint stores is about 85% professional, 15% DIY. So while an important segment, it\u2019s fairly de minimis compared to the contractor focus . I wouldn\u2019t characterize that a DIY program so much as a [perk] program, we do have a preferred customer arrangement that we build up by just capturing customer\u2019s email contact information and clearly doing a much better job of connecting with them on a very digital format that are available to us. As we\u2019ve said repeatedly now for I think the last 2.5 years, our DIY sales have been terrific, they have been outpacing the market and slowly gaining a little share. And as a result of that, we\u2019re pretty pleased with that performance. We give some credit to our relationship with HGTV, which has been a terrific relationship with the company attracting a younger consumer to us. In terms of our Consumer Group customers and their exposure to the DIY market and whether or not they are adjusting inventory, I would expect the answer has to be no. I mean most of these folks are very sophisticated, retailers have great systems in place, much as we talked about working capital management and the systems we put into help us manage that. I think they are doing the same. So, long gone the days where inventories spike up and down based on some kind of a term being offered et cetera. So, I think they are in pretty good inventory shape and we would expect it to season ramps up, so (inaudible) purchase this. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Chris, can you also just clarify on price realization for the increase you took earlier in the quarter? Can you just remind us kind of how that price realization is going and you mentioned pricing mix didn\u2019t have much of an impact on Q1 but how we should think about that for the next few quarters would be great? Sean Hennessy : And again, this is Sean. But, we feel pretty good about our price realization and that\u2019s why when you see the gross margins up $0.06 for the first quarter. And I think earlier this call, Chris again reaffirmed that the gross margin forecast we have 45.5 to 46 versus last year\u2019s 45.3, we\u2019re not changing that. So, we feel the realization has been good. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Okay, thanks guys. I appreciate it. Chris Connor : Thank you, Aram. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Trey Grooms - Stephens: Hey good morning. Chris Connor : Good morning, Trey. Trey Grooms - Stephens: Back on the pricing just to follow-up on that so you are seeing good pricing realization, but the addition of Comex\u2019s 300 plus stores, is that going to impact the roll out or implementation of pricing at all as we look through this year and what\u2019s the timing? Chris Connor : The answer to that is yes, and I think that\u2019s why we really changed what we did for pricing this year versus in the past. We used to give you a percentage and a date and because this was an integration between just not only the core, but really five different businesses that needed to be integrated. There was going to be some timing different and that\u2019s why we switched from giving you a date and a percentage that we are going out, an effective rate that we saw that we are going to eventually achieve. We went to a gross margin forecast where we went from 45.5 to 46. And those were the reasons why, those are part of the reason why is because what you just referred to. Trey Grooms - Stephens: Okay. That makes sense. And then on the cost front, you mentioned not seeing any real raw material inflation. But can you speak specifically, I know at one point maybe late last year you guys thought that there was that we could see or there was possibly the potential for some modest TiO2 inflation this year. Has that outlook changed, since we are not really seeing much yet? And if not, could you kind of give us some ideas of your thoughts around that? Bob Wells : Yes Trey, this is Bob. We think for the first quarter specifically for the industry raw material inflation across the entire basket was likely flat to very low single-digits. Any year-over-year change in the quarter was most likely from plastic packaging due to as we referred to in the last call the run-up in the high density polyethylene and also monomer and polymer pricing might have been a little inflationary due to higher energy cost in the quarter. TiO2 still remains the moderate risk for the back half, it has not moved in the first half of the year. But even if it does move, it\u2019s unlikely to push the raw material basket for the full year above say 2% inflation. So our outlook of flat to low single-digit is still solid. Trey Grooms - Stephens: Okay. And then just one more still cut on cost run, I mean you guys were kind of moving I guess outside of North America, you\u2019ve been moving some of your facilities over to sulfate in some markets. Can you give us update kind of where you are in that effort? Thank you. Chris Connor : Yes Trey, I think we had commented that certainly as new products and technologies are being worked on and we\u2019re exploring all the different types of titanium packages that might help us get to the market. We have seen some switching outside the U.S. Those activities are continuing to move. I don\u2019t think those are going to be dramatic shifts for us, but it\u2019s helping a little bit around the margins. Trey Grooms - Stephens: All right, thanks a lot. Good luck guys. Chris Connor : Thank you, Trey. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with Keybanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First on the Comex North America, so it sounds like things are proceeding fairly quickly. So if you look at 2015 and with getting the point sales in all your product constraint involved, would you expect those stores to be up closer to the company average or it would be a slower ramp up than that once all the restructuring is done? Chris Connor : Right. What we have said is that next year when we will take a look at 2015 we believe that the operating margin will be in the high single-digits. So when you look at the sales next year, it\u2019s going very well, right sizing the SG&A and so forth the gross margins are moving in the right direction. So, we still feel pretty good about that forecast. Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Great. And then could you just give, you usually do the gross profit and SG&A dollar change for the segment? Chris Connor : I have the gross profit here, Paint Stores Group, $104.7 million the gross profit increase, consumer was $1.4 million increase, Global Finishes were $5.6 million increase and Latin America was actually a reduction of $6.9 million. On the SG&A, I don\u2019t have those right now. Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets : I could back it in (inaudible) appreciate it. Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks Ivan. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. Nils Wallin - CLSA: Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Chris Connor : Good morning Nils. Nils Wallin - CLSA: Now that you have Comex in the business for about two quarters or so, are you noticing anything different about the pricing strategies between the five different brands that you can optimize? And how are you, how do you feel about getting them fully integrated into the legacy Sherwin strategy? Chris Connor : Yes Nils, not so much differences between the five brands, but clearly a difference between the way that their organization approached us in a way that the Sherwin\u2019s core business. We referenced the ramp up to our POS system effective March 1 for these stores and that\u2019s really the start of the process, it starts with good data collection. So we can actually look at trends and look at specific customer segmentation, volume sets et cetera. So all that tooling will be helpful for our field teams in coaching our new members of the team here and how to appropriately price these products. And so I think one of the previous callers asked about price increases here as well too. And these are all the things that will be improving. Sean just gave guidance that we expect next year that these stores will be in the high single-digits in terms of operating margins as a percent of sales. And we\u2019re ramping them up fully to the mid-teens that stores runs at, this will be part of that mix getting that pricing levered properly and implement it. So, work to be done here still. Nils Wallin - CLSA: Understood, understood. I know that you probably don't want to think about Mexico too much anymore, but I'm curious to this whole process, if maybe you've learned something about how you might change your approach to the customer in that country now? Chris Connor : Yes. We are happy to continue to think about Mexico, we have a good business down there and we were excited for a long time to have a better stance there, obviously it didn't work out that way. I think that remains to be seen and that's probably broader for future conversations to talk a little bit about what our strategy is. Right now we're just trying to [execrate] ourselves from this particular situation we're in. Nils Wallin - CLSA: Got it. Thanks very much. Chris Connor : Thanks Nils. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America : Yes, good morning. What was the magnitude of the elevated distribution cost that you had in consumer please? Chris Connor : So just to give you, while Sean is taking the few numbers up here Kevin, think about the fact that fundamentally [butane] is made from water and when half of the United States is under the pour of vortex we were shifting a lot of pain around this country and zero degree temperatures, below zero temperatures. And so resting heated trailers, having to put some frozen loads in the heated warehouses to get them ready, checking the R&D and some of these things to make sure they are still viable so those are some of the factors that led to these costs. Sean Hennessy :  Okay. And if you look at these costs, if we backed those costs out consumer margin in the first quarter would have been flat to up slightly year-over-year so we did report 15.7 and so when you look at that you can do the math but that\u2019s where we are at, that\u2019s where the costs us. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America : Okay, that helps. And then second in the Latin American segment what was the magnitude of the volume decline and the foreign exchange pressure, any addition insights there that would be helpful. Sean Hennessy :  Again as we mentioned currency actually was effective fell by 16% so we reported a negative 10, with a positive 6 has really driven this, Chris said by the Brazilian real last year was around 2 to 1 this quarter remaining at 2.38 to 2.40 to 1, but when you look at the volume we were negative in the volume for the Latin America group and we really don\u2019t share volumes by segment specially in Latin America. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America : Okay. And then maybe for Chris apologies if I missed it, but I want to ask you about M&A broadly and what you are seeing on the landscape specifically whether or not you are seeing anything that might still at least partially the void from termination of Comex Mexico if you look at a year or so let\u2019s say? Chris Connor : Hey Kevin we\u2019ve been clear with the street about our interest and intentions to continue to build out our architectural coatings platform throughout the Western Hemisphere. There are number of terrific companies in all those geographies including Canada, United States throughout all of the Latin American region and time will tell whether any of those come to fruition on that. So this is just, this was one opportunity; we have other ideas that we\u2019ll be working out if time\u2019s with us. Likewise we continue to be focused on building out our industrial coatings platform globally and there are some interesting technologies there as well too. So nothing more to report on that. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America : Okay. Thanks very much. Chris Connor : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial : Thank you. Chris question on where do you think we are in the coatings cycle? If I look at your numbers let\u2019s say 4% growth in the overall market last year for U.S. architectural, you get another 4% this year you\u2019re knocking on the door of 700 million gallons. I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about 700, 750 million gallon market is being normalized. So I just wondered if you rethought that. Chris Connor : Those numbers are pretty accurate Don. I think we\u2019ve been showing that chart now as part of our industrial deck for a couple of years. You will recall that the peak of that market was 800 million gallon and there are some folks commenting that they think that that\u2019s the more realistic number that the market can get to in coming years. As you know we tend to be little more conservative on that. So I think you are pretty much on target. We\u2019re moving up comfortably now into the mid 600 million gallons for the industry, this will be another year of progress. So pushing in that 700 with another call it 50 to 100 million gallons of our incremental growth for the industry you have to go. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial : Okay. And then Sean, a housing keeping question, what share repurchase is baked into your guidance and what was the carry out number of shares at the end of the first quarter? Sean Hennessy :  At the end of the actual share count on May 31, 2014 was 99,651,879 that prefer not to give you, you can imagine each and every quarter we\u2019ve purchased stock, so it\u2019s very likely we\u2019re going to be buying stock over the next three quarters and I will tell you that but I will prefer not to give you the guidance on what our share count is for the year-end. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial : Okay. Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks Don. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Just first question, Chris I think you noted as you expect when weather got better you saw you gave sales improve in the regions that were affected. Any chance you could give us a sense of how they 8% same store sales trended through the quarter? Chris Connor : Dennis. March was the best quarter, or best month we had in the quarter or January, February about even. Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Okay. And then kind of on the same lines, I think you mentioned southwest being the best region east being the worst, how much variation is there between those two? Bob Wells : Dennis this is Bob. The two strongest divisions were in the double-digit, the other two were in the single. Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Okay. And then last one, Chris I think on the global Latin American business, when we look at ex-acquisitions, ex-currency, the growth rate was the best of we have seen I think in about four, five quarters. But the commentary and I think some of the commentary maybe this is the difference volume and price was more negative and just wondering if that\u2019s a trend that's accelerating would you give any concern or is there something maybe that we're missing at high level deal. Chris Connor : Yes, so are you just speaking about our Global segment Dennis? Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Yes, I was actually looking at both together kind of that concept of Global and Latin America. Chris Connor : Yes. So I think the we would agree with the Global business, what we're feeling that we're on a good trend line here, we have solidified a lot of the operations in Europe, particularly in the back of our acquisitions there several years ago. Asia is showing some nice improvement from really, really low market share. So, we've got a lot of room to go there, but we're pleased with the process improvement we've seen there, you recall this as a segment that was running at around 3% ROS and now we're pushing up close to targets we told that we can get it to which would be into the low double digit. So, that's tracking well. And we think if that can't continue to add some tailwind to the company's numbers going forward. Latin America not so much and I think we commented that we expect that we're going to be in for tough (inaudible) here for the rest of the year given the currency and the market environment. Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you guys. Chris Connor : Thanks Dennis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Good morning guys. Chris Connor :  Good morning Dmitry. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Just, I wanted to -- a lot of my questions have been answered, but wanted to follow up on a couple of things. First of all, in terms of integrating that the Comex operation you talked about closing the four plants in the one headquarters building. Are you pretty much done with the asset footprint rationalization or is there still more to go? Chris Connor : There is a few more to go. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Okay. So are you going to be retaining any of the plants that you bought or is there enough room in your plants to relocate the production there and just streamline the operations to that extent? Chris Connor : Yes, we haven\u2019t specifically commented on that. I think as time unfolds, we will be in a better position to share that with you. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Okay, alright. In terms of Latin America and the significant margin deterioration you have seen there and profits dollar decline, obviously a lot of it has to do with foreign exchange, what are your expectations for sort of the margin recovery trajectory of that business, is that going to be in 2014 or is it all related to [Finch] coming back? Chris Connor :  Yes I think that before we give you any type of guidance for the full year, we would like to see another quarter. I mean we just have gone through one quarter. At the beginning of the year, our expectations were if you remember, we had a one-time hit in our mine which was the Brazilian [fund that] situation. But without that, our margins were still -- our operating margins were still strong. At the beginning of the year we thought that we were going to have improvement or at least be flat, I would say, we would like to have seen other quarter but we are not as optimistic about having improved margins as we were three months ago that\u2019s for sure. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Okay. To follow up on that question, in the past in other businesses and other regions, we have seen companies respond very aggressively with price increases in situations where devaluations of currency was to the extent that we have seen in Latin America, are you sort of moving along that thought path or are you just concerned to sort of wait around and see if the real and the other Latin American currencies will come back? Sean Hennessy :  Dmitry, if I just go back to the total, our sales were down 10% after currency, and currency was 16%. So, we were up 6% in local currencies. And if you think about, we\u2019ve really have told you that our volume was down, so prices 6, up at least 6 plus but our volume is down. So we\u2019ve been moving prices as aggressively as we can. Some of the governments in South America have started to put pricing limits on, so we have to get approval from the governments. And we\u2019re being as aggressive as we can to get pricing in South America. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Got it. Sean, thank you. And then last question, in terms of your share buybacks, I mean I know you don\u2019t want to give a number for share count at the end of the year but just in terms of sort of releasing the cash that you\u2019ve been holding for Comex deal now and looking to redeploy toward share buybacks, are there any thought being given to sort of accelerated share buybacks or are you still going to be opportunistic and kind of [keel] throughout the quarter or throughout the year? Sean Hennessy : We really did -- we\u2019ve really done a lot of accelerated stock repurchases 10 years ago, 8 years ago. About 4 years ago the volatility of our stock as well as a lot of other company stock really improved that ASRs really didn\u2019t that were not in your best interest. I would tell you that the volatility in our stock is tremendously lower. I think that we\u2019re interested in getting the stock, the greatest effect at our share count. So yes, we\u2019re evaluating the ASRs at this time. And I think that we want to be in a situation where we can do -- if we do an ASR, we want to be opportunistic of our stock, to become more volatile again. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Got it. Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks Dmitry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Good morning everyone. Chris Connor : Good morning Jay. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : I wanted to ask first and I apologize if you already answered this. Did you give any timing for the Comex bridge of contract suite and if there is going to be any cost impact? Chris Connor :  We did comment that we have no idea, what the timing on that will likely be and we made no comment about the cost impact. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee :  Okay. Second question if you look at the promotions for the Paint Store Group, public promotions, have those increased versus what you were doing last year and did that have any impact on margins on a year-over-year basis? Chris Connor :  No, our promotional schedule for our Paint Store\u2019s team has been pretty consistent now for a number of years. They do have these big super sale events around important weekends in the paint season as they start to ramp up, but from a day-to-day comparison year-to-year as well as the discount comparison from year-to-year, Jay, those have been very consistent. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Okay. Last question on Latin America, I know a lot of people talked about it, but if we think over the next year to two years, given what especially in Brazil where it seems like things are not getting better anytime soon, does this give you an opportunity to be a buyer down there, if conditions do worsen or is the better opportunity maybe to pull back just if you could give us one to two your outlook for that market for [sure one]? Chris Connor : Yes. So our thoughts on M&A obviously are always long term and we think the long term demand for the kinds of products that we would like to be purchasing and adding to our platform are strong. So where appropriate targets to emerge in Brazil or anywhere throughout Latin American region that we thought we could acquire and improve and enhance their contribution to our earnings growth, we would be interested in doing that. So just too speculative to comment any further on that at this point. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee :  Okay. Thank you. Chris Connor :  Thanks Jay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Matt McGinley with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question. Matt McGinley - ISI Group : Good morning. My first question is a follow-on with some of the comments you made about the Global segment and the margins. And you\u2019ve had tremendous operating efficiency in that segment in this first quarter here. You had very strong margin growth, but pretty weak unit growth. My question is, was there something unique about the first quarter that enabled you to get such strong operating margin expansion, it wouldn\u2019t be relatable to the rest of 2014? Sean Hennessy : First of all, the Global Finishes Group really recorded solid sales growth in North America, Europe and Asia. And when you look at the scale we have in North America, gallons gone through our footprints, our imprints in North America, gives us a greatest flow through. So that was nice. But they also, when you look at their Latin America, it was a significant drag in the quarter and they also were affected by that currency. So, gallons going through our North America footprint are more efficient. Matt McGinley - ISI Group : Okay. Thanks for that. And then my second question is on the -- a follow-up on comments you made on Paint Stores Group. In prepared remarks, you said that you realized price, but the mixed impact was so negative. Can you help me understand like what happened with that mix that caused the price increases you have to have a muted impact on your total top-line for that Paint Stores Group? Sean Hennessy : I just don\u2019t remember us making that comment. I will not say that comment is accurate. Matt McGinley - ISI Group : Okay. So, pricing was positive in the quarter? Sean Hennessy : Yes. Matt McGinley - ISI Group : Okay. And there was not a negative mix impact? Sean Hennessy : No. Chris Connor : No, there was not. Matt McGinley - ISI Group : Alright. I guess I need to get my ears checked before you two. Chris Connor : I think we said the effective pricing was modest on sales. Matt McGinley - ISI Group : Okay. That makes sense. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : Thanks. Two things; first of all in the Comex business I\u2019m wondering if you could characterize the market share performance you\u2019re seeing of their business kind of before and after? And how that is progressing and where you expect that to go? Chris Connor :  Yes. So Eric, I think it\u2019s typical with these types of controlled store acquisitions. We commented that this was a struggling asset for the parent company. Their sales have been declining when we acquired them. They have improved slightly from that position, but they are still a little bit negative. So, with the market that\u2019s rebounding in gallon growth, you have to assume that there is some concern if they are losing share. Interestingly, now with these POSs in place, we can kind of track who those specific customers are. And so a lot of that share transfer has been going from their store locations to ours. And that will be important part of this process for us going forward. I can say with great confidence that in all the markets that we have acquired these stores, the company is not losing share, just maybe seeing a little bit of erosion in the acquired store format. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research :  As you look forward, do you think this is sustained throughout the year or can you see a path or investments that you are making that should allow their growth to be similar to the market at some point in 2014? Chris Connor :  We\u2019ve already seen in a relatively short period of time that trend line moving positively in a very quick fashion. It comes from better inventory in the stores and enhanced and improved associated product line ups that we have been rolling into their store locations as well including some of our own brands for the applicators case and point. So our expectations are that these stores are going to go positive as the year unfolds. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research :  And then secondly, I appreciate that a component of the incremental SG&A investment has been the timing of the new store investments, but away from that I\u2019m interested in how you\u2019re thinking about the incremental SG&A that you are investing in the business this year to allow you to participate in the improved market growth or gain market share. Can you just talk a little bit about where are you spending money away from new stores and where we are in the continuum of that incremental SG&A spend? Sean Hennessy : Yes. A couple of years ago I remember mentioning to you Eric, actually you asked the question, one of the other big issues that we\u2019re spending is some IT projects. And as we continue to roll out our global Oracle platform, early next year we\u2019ll have all of South America, Asia, as well as the United States. And so once we hit there, I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape with IT. But those investments are actually helping us with our working capital. And you can see the results in our working capital. Usually the first quarter is one of the highest working capital as a percent of sales quarters we have and we\u2019re at [10.4], without the Comex 11 and last year were at 11, 7. So some of these investments are not just for market share, but the majority of them are because of new stores and so forth, reps and so forth. But I would say IT is probably the other one that is really driving some of this cost. A lot of those costs are pretty flat across the year. And so our first quarter being the lowest sales quarter, those costs provided by the lowest sales quarter has the greatest impact on the SG&A as a percent of sales. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : Great. Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks Eric. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan : Thanks for squeezing me in. Because of the timing of price increases in the stores division, should prices rise sequentially in the second quarter as you more fully implement whatever you raised in the first quarter? Sean Hennessy : Yes, yes they will Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan :  Okay. And secondly, were your volumes flat to up in the consumer division? Sean Hennessy : Volume wise they were up slightly. Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan :  Were up slightly. And then lastly your sales forecast for the second quarter is 8% to 14%. Why so wide? Sean Hennessy :  I think it really comes down to Latin America Group and the currency and trying to figure out exactly what that currency is going to happen and that\u2019s probably the biggest determination of the wide range. Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan : Okay. Great thanks very much. Chris Connor : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jaideep Pandya with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question. Jaideep Pandya - Berenberg: Yes, thank you and congrats on the great results today. I have two questions; first one is on your gross margin and may be focused on the Paint Stores really. I know you don\u2019t disclose this, but if you look at the previous peak and compare it to in the next couple of years that we\u2019ve had towards the 800 million gallons mark, can you tell us what has really changed, i.e. have you actually structurally improved in gross margin considering also the fact that maybe some of the input cost should be relatively in your favor with all the capacity that is coming into U.S. and if you gained share, if you have improved your price per gallon, would be very curious to know that? And then the second question I have is on your industrial coatings franchise. What are you really structurally doing to improve this in terms of market share? Are you targeting organic growth levers or are you also looking at some acquisitions to strengthen your franchise in marine protective et cetera? Thank you. Sean Hennessy : And again, this is Sean Hennessy. And I'll take the first question about the gross margin and structurally where are we. I think that overtime, we use to talk about a range of 41 to 44, we talk about 43 to 46, we're near the peak again. And in fact, we are saying that for the year, we're going to be at 45 to 46. Overtime, we believe that range will grow for a lot of the things that you just mentioned. We think that we continue to come out with new products that are higher gross margin and then efficiencies. So, I think that our Consumer Group overtime has done a great job of lowering our conversion costs, lowering our warehouse costs, lowering our logistics costs. So, those two things when you look over a five year period, I mean you look at the amount that new products have continued to help our gross margin. We think that's going to continue and that's why we continue to try to develop new products. And structurally, we took advantage when the market did crash, when the 800 approximate million gallons a year down to about 575. We did close some plans and some warehouses that are least efficient. So as that market comes back, and we are seeing it that we're actually producing those products in lower cost plants. Chris Connor : And to the second part of your question Jaideep the industrial coatings franchise really is benefiting now from organic growth. There was a substantial M&A activity probably up to three years ago; trading the platform we needed in various geographies around the world. But as we have seen the significant profit leverage and the sales revenue, market share growth is coming now from the businesses we have. We have commented a couple of times during the call about continuing to be on the hunt for appropriate acquisitions in this space, but for the last couple of years has been mostly organic performance. Jaideep Pandya - Berenberg: Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks Jaideep. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates. Please proceed with your questions. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Thank you, gentlemen, good afternoon, at least good afternoon here. Is the acquisition contribution, is that 100% from Comex or is there something else in there? Chris Connor :  It\u2019s 100% Comex. We have annualized all of their acquisitions. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay. The reason I asked, so some of it is showing up in the Consumer Group business till then? Chris Connor :  Yes consumer did pickup a piece of that business both most notably dug back and some dealers in Canada and in the United States so they also picked up a piece of that Comex acquisition. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : The reason I ask is the 4.5% is about $97 million of sales if I did my math which I think would have been at the low-end of your forecast. So I guess I am confused. You said it was doing better than you had to what top-line and I guess I am a little confused with the numbers? Sean Hennessy :  Yes, we gave a sales range in the first quarter and if you look at the midpoint I think I answered it because I assume that he was speaking of the midpoint not the high-end of the range. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay, fine. Thanks a lot guys. Chris Connor :  Thanks Richard. Operator :  Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts - UBS:  Good afternoon. Could you comment on the sales trends and some of the leading indicator things like spray guns, ladders, less consumable oriented items? Chris Connor : Yes. We\u2019ve got a good quarter John in those categories as well (inaudible) obviously for us is always one of the leading indicators of [gaining] contractor confidence and just as we\u2019ve been talking about strong sales performance in the stores, these categories have been up double-digits as well. So, just adding to the comment that Bob added about since the thing that these anecdotal information we get from seeing these folks in our stores every day. John Roberts - UBS: Would that tend to your drag on your margin? So back to the next question you had earlier. I would have thought consumables like paint would have been more weather impacted and maybe some of the more leading indicator things people would buy anyway in anticipation when the weather would break so that would actually be a negative mixed effect to have the ladders and [stray] equipment and so forth to outperform paint. Chris Connor : No, most of those sales start to come in around this time of the year, March and April. This is when we typically see what we call pro-day or pro-show events happening from both children, as well as all the other people in this place. We commented that March was a strong month for us in terms of rebounding in the quarter, so there was not substantial mixed shift away from paint and towards these types of products. John Roberts - UBS: Okay. Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Bob Wells : Thanks, Jaycee. As a reminder to everyone that\u2019s still on the call, our annual financial community presentation is scheduled for Thursday, May 22 which is going to be held at the Intercontinental Barclays Hotel in New York City. The program will consist of our customary morning presentation and with questions and answers followed by a reception and lunch with company management. If you have not signed up and would like to attend registration is still opened. Send me an email at rjwells@sherwin.com, and I will reply with a link to our registration site. On a final note, our offices will be closed tomorrow in observings of Good Friday. So I will be returning calls over the balance of today and on Monday. Thanks for joining us today and thank you again for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

Thank you for joining The Sherwin-Williams Company\u2019s Review of the Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results and Expectations for the Third Quarter and Full Year. With us on today\u2019s call are Chris Connor, Chairman and CEO; John Morikis, President and COO, Sean Hennessy, CFO; Al Mistysyn, Vice President, Corporate Controller and Bob Wells, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Vcall via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes, and will be available until Thursday, August 7th, 2014, at 5 pm Eastern Time. Following the company's review of the second quarter financial results and outlook for the third quarter and full year, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells. Bob Wells : Thanks Jessie and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you just heard, we've made an important addition to our earnings conference call lineup. Beginning with this morning's call, John Morikis, our President and Chief Operating Officer will be participating in our earnings conference call each quarter. Many of you had opportunities to speak with John over the years at our Annual Financial Community Presentation. He has a comprehensive knowledge of our operating divisions, customers, suppliers and our industry in general and because most of his discussions surrounding our earnings releases involve these topics it's only natural to include john in the conversation. We think you'll find his perspective on the state on the industry and our company very valuable. I am going to turn the call over to John in just a moment, but before I do, let me remind you that this conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company\u2019s earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. In the interest of time, we provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website under sherwin.com Investor Relations Second Quarter Press Release. With that, let me turn the call over to John to review our financial results for second quarter. John Morikis : Thanks Bob. It's a real pleasure for me to take part on our call this morning and let me add my thanks to all of you for joining us. The press release we issued this morning summarizes a very solid second quarter for Sherwin Williams. We continue to see positive momentum in most areas of the business and we clearly had momentum in large part to our consistent focus and prudent investments made over the past five years. There are still some areas where we face challenges, but the progress we've made so far in this recovery and the bullish signals we are getting from our customers give us confidence that our momentum is sustainable. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2014 compared to the second quarter of 2013, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 12.1% to a $3.04 billion, driven primarily by strong performance in our Paint Stores Group and acquisitions. The Comex acquisition added 4.6% to net sales in the quarter, while unfavorable currency translations decreased consolidated net sales 0.9%. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $176 million year-over-year to $1.4 billion and gross margins increased 80 basis points to 46.3% of sales from 45.5% in the second quarter last year. This gross margin improvement was primarily the result of better operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume, which more than offset the anticipated gross margin drag from the Paint Stores acquired from Comex. Selling, general and administrative expense for the quarter increased 15.8% to [$969.2 million] [ph]. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased 31.8% in the second quarter this year from 30.8% last year. Higher SG&A spending in the quarter reflects our continued investment in new stores and sales territories plus incremental SG&A from acquisitions. Interest expense for the quarter was $16.4 million, an increase of $1.3 million compared to the second quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $48.3 million or 12.7% to $429.2 million. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter this year was 32.1% compared to 32.5% in the second quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30s compared to last year's 30.7%. Consolidated net income increased $34.2 million or 13.3% to $291.4 million. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 9.6% compared to 9.5% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 19.5% to $2.94 per share including a $0.06 EPS loss from the U.S. and Canada assets acquired from Comex compared to $2.46 per share in 2013. Looking at our second quarter results by operating segments, Paint Stores Group had another strong quarter. Segment sales increased 17.2% to $1.88 billion and comparable store sales, sales by stores opened more 12 calendar months grew 9.8%. Comp store sales growth accelerated 190 basis points sequentially from first quarter 2014 and 280 basis points year-over-year. The rate of sales growth increased sequentially in every customer segment. Acquisitions added $103.7 million or 6.5% of sales in the quarter. Regionally, in the second quarter, our Southwestern division led all divisions followed by our Southeastern division, Eastern division and Midwestern division. Paint Stores group segment profit for the quarter increased $42.9 million or 12.9% to $375.9 million as higher paint sales volumes were more than enough to overcome a $10.4 million loss on the acquired stores. Segment profit as a percent of sales decreased to 20% from 20.7% last year, but if you back out the effect of the acquisition, segment profit margin increased to 21.7%. During the quarter, we opened 16 new stores bringing our year-to-date total to 33 new locations. At quarter end, our total store count in U.S., Canada and the Caribbean was 3,941 compared to 3,542 locations at the end of the second quarter 2013. 98 of the 399 incremental stores were opened organically since the end of the second quarter 2013. This year our Paint Stores Group plans to add approximately 80 to 90 net new store locations. Consumer Group also turned in a solid performance for the quarter. Sales increased 10.1% to $433.4 million from $393.7 million last year. Acquisitions accounted for roughly half of the increase, while our domestic wood care and building materials business and Ronseal and Altax wood care businesses in Europe accounted for most of the organic sales improvement. Segment profit for the consumer group increased $13.4 million or 17% to $92.5 million in the quarter, driven by higher sales volumes, improved operating efficiencies and a profit contribution from acquisitions of $2.7 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 21.3% from 20.1% in the same period last year, which is gratifying to see following the softer profit performance in the first quarter. For our Global Finishes Group, second quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 6.1% to $544.6 million due to higher paint sales volumes and selling price increases. Most of Global Finishes Group's domestic business strengthened in the second quarter, but this improvement was partially offset by continued weakness outside the U.S., particularly in Latin America. Unfavorable currency translation had minimal impact on sales in the quarter compared to last year. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased 0.7% in the quarter to $54.9 million from $54.5 million last year. These results include charges of $4.5 million related to the exit of our business interest in Venezuela. Unfavorable currency translation rates change reduced segment profit by $600,000. As a percent of net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit was 10.1% in the quarter compared to 10.6% last year. Our Latin America Coatings Group continues to operate in a very challenging economic environment. Second quarter net sales for the group stated in U.S. dollars decreased 8.9% to $181.2 million. Volumes in the quarter were negative and unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales by 11.3%, both of which were mitigated to some degree by selling price increases. Segment profit in the second quarter stated in U.S. dollars increased to $5.7 million from $856,000 in the same period last year. In the second quarter 2013, we incurred a charge of $11.8 million related to a Brazil tax assessment. In the second quarter this year, lower volume sales, increased raw material cost, and unfavorable currency translations were only partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased segment profit $2.9 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 3.1% in the quarter, compared to 0.4% in the second quarter of 2013. Although our Latin American Coatings Group results for the quarter and year-to-date are disappointing, we're committed to extending our presence in this important region and we are dedicated and working with all of these sources and expertise required to succeed in that effort. Turning briefly to our balance sheet, our total debt on June 30, 2014 was $1.69 billion including short-term borrowings of $64.7 million. Total debt on June 30, 2013 was $1.69 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $267.2 million, compared to $741.1 million at the end of the second quarter 2013 and $356.5 million at the end of last quarter. In the first six months of 2014, we spent $66.9 million on CapEx -- capital expenditure, depreciation expense was $83.5 million and amortization expense was $15.1 million. For the full year 2014, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $190 million to $200 million; depreciation will be about $170 million and amortization will be about $30 million. That concludes our review of results for the second quarter of 2014. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the third quarter and full year. Chris Connor : Thanks John and good morning, everybody. Let me begin by saying how pleased I am to have John with us on the call this morning. I am sure you'll find him to be very insightful addition to our conference call team both today and in the years ahead. At the midway point in the year, we are encouraged by how 2014 is shaping up. More than once in John's comments you heard him refer to the positive momentum in our business. Sales and volume growth began the year at a respectable pace and it appear to be picking up steam as the year progresses. Consolidated sales growth in the second quarter increased 280 basis points sequentially and June was our strongest month so far. Domestic spray equipment sales, perhaps an unscientific but nonetheless reliable leading indicator of paint sales, robust throughout the quarter. As John indicated most painting contractors including many who work in the non-residential markets are feeling very bullish about their order books going forward. Consumer group had another good sales quarter and Global Finishes is posting strong year-over-year volume gains in many industrial coatings categories. Consolidated gross margin also showed significant improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. This is a function of volume-driven operating leverage, but also of stable raw material cost. Early in the year, we identified titanium dioxide as an inflation risk in the second half. However, it was pretty apparent that the major chloride TiO2 producers have not yet succeeded in implementing price increase announced in the first two quarters. As I mentioned in our first quarter call, both of the outward pressure on industry raw material baskets is coming from high density polyethylene, which is driving up cost of plastic packaging. We've also seen higher year-over-year pricing trends in other raw material feed stocks such as crude oil, natural gas and propylene, ethylene and tinplate, but so far these are not effective raw material cost, we are maintaining our outlook for a relatively stable raw basket for the balance of the year. In the first six months of 2014, we generated $332 million in net operating cash, an increase of $30 million compared to the first half of 2013, driven by higher six month net income. Although working capital is a slight use of cash in the first half, which is entirely due to the accelerating pace of sales growth, our best measure of working capital efficiency, the ratio of working capital to sales, decreased to 11.7% of sales, from 12.0% in the second quarter last year. During the quarter, we acquired 2.03 million shares of the company stock with treasury, bringing our total year-to-date repurchase activity to 3.33 million shares at an average cost of $200.15 per share and total investment of $665 million. On June 30th we had remaining authorization require 8.83 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, up from $0.50 last year. Our confidence in the domestic building and remodeling markets continues to grow and we expect non-residential to play and increasingly important role in driving future paint and coating demand. Many of the industrial segments also appear to be gaining momentum. These positives will be offset to some degree by persistent challenging conditions in Latin America. Based on this outlook, we expect third quarter consolidated net sales to increase in the range of 9% to 14% compared to the third quarter 2015. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income for common shares for third quarter to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25 per share compared to last year's $2.55 per share. Guidance for the third quarter includes our expectations that the Comex acquisition will increase net sales $120 million to $130 million, and reduce diluted net income for common share by approximately $0.05 per share in the quarter. For the full year 2014 we expect consolidated net sales to increase 8% to 13% compared to last year. Although our sales expectations have not changed since our first quarter release, we are raising our expectations for full year diluted net income per common share be in the range of $8.50 to $8.70 per share compared to $7.26 per share earned in 2013. Included in this full year guidance is our assumption that the Comex acquisition will increase net sales by a low single-digit percentage in the year and reduce diluted net income per common share $0.35 per share. The change in our full year EPS guidance was driven in part by lower than expected dilution from the U.S. and Canada Comex business from our original midpoint of $0.50 per share to our current expectation of $0.35 per share dilution. Integration of these businesses into our Paint Stores Group and Consumer Group is progressing ahead of our original expectations. We\u2019re on schedule and on budget with respective supply chain consolidation plans and performing better than planned from an operating profit standpoint. More importantly, we are very pleased with a level of talent, enthusiasm and commitment we see in the men and women to join Sherwin Williams through this acquisition. This, above all, will pay dividends for years to come. Again, we\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us this morning, and now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial : Yes, Chris. Just wondering, you know, what\u2019s making you more optimistic about the second half outlook, because it appears even \u2013 post you changing your Comex guidance that you\u2019re looking to about $0.23 improved earnings despite a similar sales outlook. Your contractors, as you indicated, seem pretty optimistic yet the housing data still seems somewhat mixed, so just wondering if you can reconcile those two conflicting items. Chris Connor : Yeah, Don. I think that\u2019s a good point about the conflicting data we\u2019re seeing out of some of the housing numbers. We just were commenting about the most recent information. It seems that from quarter-to-quarter we have starts up permits down and the exact opposite the next quarter. I think we\u2019re still fairly bullish on the need for improved housing starts to get up to a more sustainable number. But don\u2019t forget that a solid 75% to 80% of all these architectural coatings are being used to maintain existing structures. And I think therein is the momentum that we\u2019re feeling, as John commented about, the anecdotal evidence we\u2019re getting from our contractors. We just think the second half is going to be strong. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial : And then just a clarification on your same store sales growth of 9.8%, what was the price volume mix? How much of that first quarter price increase that you posted did you start to realize in the second quarter? Sean Hennessy : You know that price increase is going well then -- this is Sean Hennessy -- and when you do, we don\u2019t really break out all those different factors, but the majority of our selling price -- selling increase was volume. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial : Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks, Don. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs : Thanks very much. Chris, you mentioned Comex was -- the integration was going faster than you expected and that provided some earnings leverage. Can you talk more specifically is that because you restructured contracts; took other cost out, what exactly has accelerated the benefit there? Chris Connor : Yeah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in any restructuring of contracts per se. [There are variable] [ph] contracts in a business like this when you\u2019re running your own dedicated store business. I think we\u2019re just getting better operating leverage for the company. Raw material cost, implementation of some of the shutdown activities have gone well, ahead of schedule, lower than expected cost impact. I think we have commented the sale of this business is still lagging what we\u2019re seeing in our core business. So it\u2019s mainly on the operating cost side that\u2019s coming in lower than expectation. Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs : And you mentioned your pretty impressive 10% Paint Stores sales, can you give us a sense what Comex is doing year-over-year and maybe what you think the overall U.S. architectural paint market might do in 2014. John Morikis : I\u2019d say that the Comex stores are lagging our store sales, and which would be typical in an acquisition like this. As far as the entire market goes, we get that information that lags, but I\u2019d say we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re growing at a faster rate than market right now. Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks so much. Chris Connor : Thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Hi guys. Good morning. First off on the Paint Stores Group, clearly volumes are well above what your competitor seem to be reporting as it has been the case last couple of quarters. Is this a function of the channel that you\u2019re exposed to, maybe commercial construction or just sort of continued share gains? John Morikis : I\u2019d say that we\u2019re experiencing very good growth in all the segments that we play, so I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s any specific area. I think we really enjoy this controlled distribution model. We\u2019ve been working hard and investing in the service and products that respond to the customers\u2019 needs and we\u2019re comfortable with our performance. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: And just as a follow-on to that as commercial construction continues to improve generally speaking how does that affect the price mix component in the Paint Stores Group? Chris Connor : Yeah. We\u2019ve talked about that Ghansham, in the past, some of these larger projects will be at lower selling prices per gallon. But what we said, the SG&A associated with servicing that business really is lower as well so operating margins for this group will benefit from gallons that we gain in any one of these end market segments. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thanks so much guys. Chris Connor : Thank you, Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fisher with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fisher - Barclays: Yes. Good morning, guys. Chris Connor : Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fisher - Barclays: Two questions; may be first for Sean. On CapEx, this year\u2019s CapEx looks like it\u2019s even more back-end loaded than normal for you guys. Can you walk through why that\u2019s split is so skewed? And then if you strip out Comex, what was the underlying incremental margin for the Paint Stores Group? Sean Hennessy : On the CapEx you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s little backward, slanted toward the back. Again, as Comex conversion, Comex starts conversion they\u2019re going to start taking place here. We\u2019re going to start to see that CapEx ramp up. A few other projects that we had -- originally had early in the year we\u2019re going -- especially with IT then completing the IT implementation of system throughout the world. We\u2019ll have Latin America here completed by next April, but we have some expenses that are coming in. So really it\u2019s Comex and diversion of the stores and some other activities that we see coming in. And the flow through on the stores without Comex, I think John mentioned the 21.7% of sale, but without Comex when you look at that that will tell you we\u2019re probably incremental in the quarter of about $50 million in the sales, without Comex we\u2019re up around $280 million, so you\u2019re talking almost 35% incremental margin. Duffy Fisher - Barclays: Okay, great. And then Chris, one question for you, a follow-on on bob\u2019s question. If Comex is going better early does that mean that the end point is higher than we thought originally, or do we just get to the same endpoint that we thought to get there quicker. Chris Connor : I mean we\u2019re just getting to the endpoint on cost side. So as John mentioned, [inaudible] are yet to really be running at the kind of rate we expect and we get too eventually. So we still have some tough sledding ahead of us here. Duffy Fisher - Barclays: Great. Thank you, guys. Sean Hennessy : Thanks, Duffy. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of P. J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Yes. Thank you. Chris, can you comment on the refinish business in light of the harsh winter we had? And did you see a pick up there in the spring? And can you also comment on the protective finishes business? Thank you. Chris Connor : Yeah. P.J., I\u2019m sorry if you could repeat it. I wasn\u2019t sure which business you\u2019re asking me to comment on relative to spring weather. P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Yeah. Refinish business. Chris Connor : Refinish business, are you talking about automotive refinish? P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Yes. Chris Connor : John, you will take that? John Morikis : Our business here in the U.S. was up slightly in the quarter. We\u2019re expecting that the customers that we\u2019re talking with are experiencing more business as a result of the winter, but we\u2019re up slightly here in the U.S. P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: And then you have this sales force that goes out and bids on projects. What are they seeing in non-residential activity, any positives or negatives there? John Morikis : Very positive. I would say that our contractor base in that space are feeling better -- much better this year versus last year, and quite frankly, much better this quarter than last quarter. So they\u2019re feeling very excited about the bidding activity. And as Chris mentioned, with the spray equipment purchases that we see that as an indicator of their confidence. Chris Connor : John and I were out recently just meeting with some of these large commercial contractors and some of them said that we\u2019re not even taking any more bids right now. They\u2019re so full up for the next 18 months. And that we haven\u2019t heard that in years, so expecting really strong performance in that going forward. P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: So would you say that that is may be in the high single-digit number? Chris Connor : Just backed in to all the guidance we\u2019ve given you P.J. and we gave you the range I think it\u2019s either high single or low double-digits for the next quarter. P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks P.J. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Chris Connor : Good morning, John. John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : So with regard to SG&A, the 15% jump or $132 million change, how are you want to look at it year-over-year? How much of that, or how should we think about what the SG&A growth was for kind of, if you will, legacy Sherwin Williams versus say some of the Comex integration and from the cost around that. Sean Hennessy : Again, the increase in the SG&A in the quarter and year-to-date really, really been driven by three factors. The Paint Stores Group, the new stores [indiscernible] the acquisition, the Comex assets operated at an SG&A rate materially higher than our consolidated SG&A, the sale, so as we anniversary that that will improve, and again, that investment I\u2019d mentioned in IT. So we\u2019re looking forward here, the SG&A was up 1.3% of sales as we\u2019ve mentioned in the first half of the year. We do expect to see that thread there to reduce. In fact, it\u2019s also part of the reason why we raised guidance. We expect the second half SG&A to be lower in percent of sales than it was last year in the last six months of the year. John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick question on the Venezuelan assets, what was the normal kind of annualized earnings for those assets so we can kind of figure out how much to pull out? Sean Hennessy : Yeah. The normalized -- it was less than $2 million a year. Unfortunately, over the last few years we\u2019ve been having sales profits there, but we could not get our cash out. So it was a small automotive refinish, but it is in Venezuela. So we picked some severance cost and we closed and we wrote our assets off totally, so that\u2019s why that was approximately $5 million because cash had accumulated and we could not get our cash out of Venezuela. Chris Connor : Venezuela is to write that asset off. John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Okay. Great, thank you. And then one last question, with regard to the case of buybacks certainly things accelerated in the second quarter. I guess how should we be thinking about that going forward? Is this kind of a good run rate for a while, or was it just opportunistic, just seeing kind of what was in the pipeline? Sean Hennessy : No. We\u2019ve taken a look at our cash flow for the year like we always do. We know how much cash we\u2019re bringing in. And what we said is by the end of the first quarter 2015 we\u2019ll be in a more normalized phase. So we actually have looked at this quarter and actually we did by two -- just over two million shares and that was actually in the form of an accelerated stock repurchase program. So we did that in the second quarter and we\u2019re evaluating what cost program we\u2019re going to do in the third quarter. Chris Connor : I think it\u2019s not the way to think about that John is that we\u2019re sitting in a higher cash balance right now than is customary for us. We\u2019re heading into the two strongest cash generating quarters of the year for us. And you know what we\u2019d like to do with excess cash. So I would expect it would be reasonable to assume we\u2019re going to remain active in the stock. John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Chris Connor : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : Thank you, and good morning. Just wondering on the same store sales can you talk a little bit about as you\u2019re seeing more contractors coming in, or are you seeing the same amount of contractors just buying more product or better mix or how\u2019s that working? John Morikis : Now we\u2019re seeing more contractors and we feel as though the share of wallet that we have with our existing customers is also growing. We\u2019re very excited with the progress that our stores organization is making with both existing and new customers. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And just one last follow-up on the non-res side of things, are there particular end markets that your guys are getting reports from that just leading enthusiasm? John Morikis : No. Actually it\u2019s pretty well diversified growth pattern. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks very much. Chris Connor : Thanks, Vince. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Good morning. Chris Connor : Hi, Kevin. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : How much did your sales of spray equipment increased in the quarter? And was that rate more than you had previously expected last quarter? John Morikis : Yeah, Kevin, as you know, we don\u2019t give you specific sales on all those various products segments inside that stores business. So just to say that the whole business is running in comp stores and at high single-digits, spray equipment was probably leading that a little bit, so double-digit sales growth. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Chris, I want to may be come back to an earlier question. I mean historically existing home sales growth has been a primary driver of demand for architectural coatings obviously, and it looks like economists have that metric in some cases anyway down a bit and yet you\u2019re seeing very robust growth. And so I\u2019m wondering why that might be the case? Is it the non-res move that you alluded to, share gains, lagging maintenance, all of the above, how would you try to square that circle? Chris Connor : We\u2019ll let out our resident economist Dr. Wells take that. Bob Wells : Good morning, Kevin. Speaking specifically to non-residential market, because we\u2019re getting contribution from other market segments as we\u2019ve already indicated, so on the residential side we think two things are happening. One is we\u2019re getting a list from home value appreciation, so more home owners who are staying in place are doing remodeling and redecorating projects. Secondly, if you look at the quality of the existing home transactions that are occurring now versus a year or two years ago, there\u2019s a far lower percentage of those transactions that are distressed or foreclosure-type sales. And as you\u2019ve heard us comment in the past, the owner occupant selling to a new owner occupant is the transaction that generates the more paying activity. We think we\u2019re benefiting from that shift. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That helps. And then last one if I may, Chris, just welcome any thoughts you have on Lat-Am and whether or not we might see volume turn around to positive of territory there anytime soon? Chris Connor : Yeah. When you\u2019re doing business in Latin America it\u2019s important that you look over longer segments. We\u2019re in one of these cycles where currencies running against us. And there\u2019s a couple of rough spots in their bigger country\u2019s economies. Having said that, and I think John commented on it, we\u2019re still very much committed to the region. We think there are opportunities for us to enhance our method of distribution and build out our infrastructure there. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re necessarily forecasting in this guidance that we\u2019re going to see volume growth in calendar year 2014, but rest assure we\u2019ll be working hard to get that fixed by 2015. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks very much for the thoughts. Chris Connor : Thank you, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Hello, thank you. First question just one, if you look back to last third quarter, Chris, it was a very strong quarter for you guys both year-over-year and I think on seasonally adjusted basis as well. And so you\u2019re going up against a tougher comp, but you\u2019re seeing a lot in pipelines you talked about driving out acceleration or a pretty similar acceleration and growth now versus the second quarter of this year. If you look across the major end channels of home improvement or repaying on the residential side, new construction residential and non-res, what\u2019s accelerating the most right now as you think about that pace? Chris Connor : Yes. So I think as John has commented, we\u2019re seeing a very broad-based recovery here, Dennis, across all these segments. New residential has been strong, residential repaint which is the largest segment, we\u2019ve been commenting on that one now for multiple quarters. Both of those will be double-digit increases over previous years to help drive comp number in to that high 9 percentage. That\u2019s encouraging for us to see those two numbers doing so well because they are the lion\u2019s share. As John also mentioned the non-residential segments, particularly new construction in that are which has been lagging for some time, we\u2019re really starting to see a lot of lift there as well too. So this looks like heading into a back half where we\u2019re going to be hitting on just about every cylinder. Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: So you talked about earlier the disconnect on some of the macro, if you just looked at new construction, residential, it is that a disconnect for you guys, are you guys seeing acceleration versus so to say, trends on a macro side? Chris Connor : Our business in very strong in new residential. One of the anomalies in the June print that just came out this morning is that most of the weakness in start were in South and that has been very strong for the about year to date. So whether that was a one month lift or something the beginning of a trend we will see, but new resident in general has been very strong. Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Perfect. Helpful. And then Sean on the Comex acquisition the trend in margins, I think what you said here now we are going to get to the targeted margin sooner, any update on how you can think about the momentum in 2015 versus what you said may be high single digit type numbers in 2015 for the acquired business. Sean Hennessy : We were looking at high single digits. I think that we are watching how the year ends, but I think that is probably good a guidance that we can give you right now. I think probably at the end of the third quarter or fourth quarter and fourth quarter for sure, will probably be able to update that, but right now we don\u2019t see any changes to that guidance. Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Okay. All right. Thanks and good luck. Sean Hennessy : Thank you, Dennis. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Thanks. Two questions. One on gross margin and consumer. On the gross margin, how much did Comex hurt in the quarter year-over-year and what did mix do to help. Sean Hennessy : Greg as you know, I don\u2019t think we have ever given the metrics. Our gross margin with and without it was dilutive and it has been dilutive. The only think I will say is given you a range at the beginning of the year 45 to 46 versus 45 last year and now as the year is going through and now we believe we are going to be at the high end to that range. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Got it. And then second on the Consumer Group. A nice improvement there, I think it was acquisitions was half of it and then volume was 5% as well in fact it was driven by retail. Could you describe that a little more, was it -- did you sign up any new distribution or was it was just strong sell through or what you really account for that. Sean Hennessy : We have a new program that we're roaring into Home Depot that we were excited about in our conference line. We've also, as I mentioned seen some nice improvement out of our European operations as well as our building materials. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Of the 5% volume, would you say that those two were majority of them. Sean Hennessy : The largest one would have been Home Depot. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Home Depot, great. Thanks a lot. Good luck. Sean Hennessy : Thank you, Gregg. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts - UBS: Thanks for taking my call. There are couple businesses I guess that might come available for sale here in North America and you seemed to be going at a measured pace, which you repurchase, keep your flexibility. Could you talk about the M&A pipeline? Sean Hennessy : Yeah John. So we've been very clear and open and transparent with the street in terms of the types of properties that would be of interest to us. We would agree that there are some interesting names in North America as well as in our industrial coating segments globally but nothing further to comment on at this time. John Roberts - UBS: Okay. And then secondly the plan A in Latin America was to get scale to get the margins to improve there. Is there a plan B given scale doesn\u2019t look achievable and at least in the near term that I can see. Chris Connor : Most of the plan B John and that C and D has to go along with that one. Just as you were representing M&A opportunities there are a number of interesting names and companies that we respect throughout Latin America. So we're certainly not done thinking about building scale through M&A throughout Latin America. And also as has been our practice, we are a company that's focused on our core development. We have good scale already in these countries. We are not the market share leader in the larger economies, but call it second or third and that's not a bad position to build from. So we have a number of imitative to really ramp up our own core group as well as to continue to think about M&A and I think as we commented earlier that you know we are very focused on this region and we expect to do better in 2015. John Roberts - UBS: Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. Nils Wallin - CLSA: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Chris Connor : Good morning, Nil. Nils Wallin - CLSA: On the Comex -- is Comex going to be more dilutive in the fourth quarter than it is for any of the other quarters and if so why would that be the case. Chris Connor : Yeah, when you take a look at the year-to-date -- when you think about the year-to-date loss on Comex $0.45 and it's compared to the 35 and then compared to last year, it won't be any dilutive. It's 18 and it's 17 in the second half of the year, but they have a sell curve just like our Stores Group and if you take a look at that volume they are closer to the breakeven points in that third and fourth quarter -- I am sorry, the first and fourth quarter and that's why they are more dilutive. Years ago if you looked to our Stores Group in the first and fourth quarter, when we were closer to the breakeven we had the same phenomenon, but we will get there with the Comex stores with higher volumes, but until that happens the first and fourth quarter will be a bigger drag than the rest of the Paint Stores Group. Nils Wallin - CLSA: Okay. That makes sense. Then in terms of having the point of sale in the Comex Stores now for a couple months is there anything you are seeing, I know before in the past you guys have said that there is pricing, lower pricing and lower fill rates. Is there anything new that you\u2019ve seen that you can make improvements on and work for those? How quick those get to share one type level. Chris Connor : We are very excited with what we are learning to the POS and we are excited about the future. We're going to be able to leverage that POS much like we do in our own stores understanding our customers better. To your point about pricing, a basket approach, what are they purchasing from us and what they are? So we're excited about that and as we go into next year, we're going to leverage that. Nils Wallin - CLSA: Great. And then just finally I know Latin America now seems like almost unfortunately a bit of an afterthought in terms of profitability and you are certainly looking to improvement it by 2015, but is there any reason that it won't get any worse. Sean Hennessy : Yeah. I think that we have currency headwinds and if you think about especially the first Brazil real the third quarter and fourth quarter can be better comparisons for us. If you look at Argentina, right now we have been running at that 8% versus 5%, that will be 8% versus 6% in the second half of the year that's a little bit of difference, but it continue to evaluate in that third and fourth quarter, but operationally I don\u2019t think that we still feel we're strides and improvement our operation. So except for that, I think that you know I don\u2019t see it going backwards from here. Nils Wallin - CLSA: And how much of you have been able to offset the currency drag with pricing. Sean Hennessy : Well, I think that when you talk -- if points were failed and shall we get the amount of currency drag when it's over 11% and again in U.S. dollars we were down around 8% and there were some volumes that did backwards, so we gave some price. Nils Wallin - CLSA: Great. Thanks so much. Sean Hennessy : Thank you, Nils. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : Good Morning. Chris Connor : Good morning, Eric. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : Two things. First of all the earning guidance change for the quarter and the back half of the year it looked like you have affirmed the sales guidance and increased the earnings guidance. So the assumptions that margins are better and Sean I know you commented about how SG&A looks into the second half versus first half, but can you provide a little bit more color inside of the core earnings guidance change. The sales mix is different or the margin is different especially out a little bit. Sean Hennessy : We don\u2019t see the sales mix changing dramatically from our original guidance. Eric, I think it really comes down to the gross margin. We did mention 45 to 46. We're at 45 halfway through the year. We think for the full year we're going to be at the high end in the next guidance. The SG&A we did mention you know the first half of the year, the comparisons were bad. We had more new stores earlier this year than we ever have. Some of the things that we were going to start anniversary we think our SG&A in the last six months will actually be below the last six months of last year. So still good thing. So I think that it's the margin in total and that's because of sales mix just because of things that are occurring and getting some of those other things out of the way in the first half of the year. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : Is the SG&A stand different in the back half than what you originally expected or is there something different within that relative to where you started that you are thinking. Sean Hennessy : I think the SG&A spend will probably be slightly below what we originally thought at the beginning of the year, but not dramatically. And I think importantly in that Eric, the SG&A spend is lower because we are integrating the stores better, we are gaining efficiency there haven\u2019t been a whole sales decision to whack programs in marketing, advertising, training, R&D, etcetera. So this is just really the company continuing to add efficiency around the fringes as we integrate businesses. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : And then second question, Chris for you. Strategically you went through a period of time with acquisitions outside of the U.S., outside of the U.S. architectural business, I heard your comment earlier about sale of Latin America, so I am just curious as you think strategically about the portfolio and acquisitions from hear and if you could give us a sense of your thoughts or your priority or what's important for you going forward. Chris Connor : I think this management team has been pretty much locked on a pretty logical strategy here for quite some time Eric that hasn\u2019t changed at all. We like the architectural coatings businesses in the Americas and we recognize that our industrial coatings are competing in a global environment or wherever we can find controlled distributions to support those American businesses or add technologies, infrastructure, important geographies and/or customers to the industrial coatings will be at the table and discussing those opportunities. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research : Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks Eric. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of [Arun Viswanathan] with RBC Capital Market. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. Good to be back covering chemicals. How the customers I guess been responding to the price increase? May be if you can just describe their behavior or given that you do expect a flat rock bucket. Chris Connor : Not really been an issue I would say with our customers. And we've had a logical discussion with them and we continue to provide them with a good quality product and great service and it's really behind us. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. And then I guess -- I just wanted to delve into the earlier comments you mentioned that you were seeing strength in the South and maybe you can just highlight what you're seeing growth on the res and non-res side regionally speaking and if there is any differences. Chris Connor : As Bob mentioned the strong performance that we are having in the new residential has been in the south. We've also had good performance in parts of Northern Area and then Western and Eastern as well. Commercial has really been strong. It's really been quite strong across all segments across all our regions. Sean Hennessy : It's been our practice to kind of give you that ranking of where the strength is coming from and so we've continued on and sometimes when we are preparing our thoughts to share with you, we think about when all the segments are doing so strong in all the geographies, it really kind of splitting areas to tell you which parts of country you are doing better. So this is really a business through the Stores Groups that is just delivering across the country, across all segments as John commented on them. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great thank you a lot. Chris Connor : Thank. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Hi. Good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about Latin America in a different way. Do you think the volume softness this quarter had more to do with the World Cup than an actual drop-off in demand? And then the second part of that, when you look at 2015 and 2016 and what the economists are expecting for housing growth and then commercial growth, what does that outlook -- what does that look like. Chris Connor : I don\u2019t know that we want to say that it was a World Cup influence our results and there are markets that we would say are impacted by the economic conditions or the environment and there is somewhere we just need to perform better and that\u2019s we are working on. I didn\u2019t catch the second part of your question. Sean Hennessy : So the expectation on the market conditions going forward, Jay, I guess we have confidence that when we look behind the results today, the housing needs going forward in Mexico, the infrastructure, that hasn't been maintained as appropriately it is a should have been perhaps in Brazil, the demand for the types of products and services we provide, we'll have to have a rebound going forward. And I think that's why we continue to stay hard at it, improving our operations investing and trying to build out our network. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Okay thank. And then the second question I have just in the U.S. if you look at single family housing demand versus multifamily housing demand. Is multifamily an increasing portion of your business and what types of numbers do you get there whether on profit margin or on volume growth relative to what you see in single family. Bob Wells : Jay, this is Bob. With respect to demand, multifamily is a larger component of a new construction markets than it was during the last cycle. And we think that's probably going to be true for some time although as you know the multifamily size is really voluble and to oscillate quarter to quarter and year to year. We think that for the time being that the U.S. is going to be more of a renders market than an owner's market for some time to come. From a margin standpoint we've always commented that it really doesn\u2019t affect us from an operating margin standpoint all of the segments that have very comparable operating margin. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Okay great. Chris Connor : Jay, the one positive on the multifamily side is that while single family homes the maintenance activity in those homes is kind of a mix of DIY to contractor on the multifamily side, it is overwhelmingly maintained by contractors, which plays to our strength. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Okay. Great. Thank guys. Appreciate it. Chris Connor : Thanks Jay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Good morning, guys and congratulations on quarter. Chris Connor : Good morning, Dmitry Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : I would like to touch base on your corporate expense line. It's been off pretty material year-over-year. Some of it obviously Comex, but a lot of it is probably not Comex. So in the context of your SG&A in the second half of the year being down as a percentage of sales versus second half of last year, how much of that is going to be corporate expense versus just better margins in the operating businesses? Chris Connor : Even with the Admin expense we were up $31 million in the first half of the year and as we take a look at the -- take that down at $25 million, that split really between stock compensation and other compensation such as bonus and the IT projects that we've been working on. The second half of the year, we don\u2019t think we are going to be up the $31 million. So that's going to help, but even if we were up, when you add up $31 million, that's a nice improvement, but really the SG&A is really been driven by the operating division. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Okay. Got it. And then can you provide us with updates, if anything is going on, or any changes with respect to the litigation in California, how that's progressing, and also given the news in the market with PBG taking a run at Comex, if that's changing at all, your mutual animosity in the courts with the Comex owner. Chris Connor : Dmitry with respect with California Litigation, there is really no changes in the status of that suite since our last call. As you know last quarter, we announced that the final judgment was entered against three companies. We immediately filed a Notice of Appeal in that judgment and we are currently waiting for the record to be transmuted from the trial court to the Court of Appeal. It tends to be a fairly long process. We think the record would probably be transferred in the third quarter. At that point the court will initiate a briefing schedule, which is going to take at least five months and once and then all arguments will begin and once all arguments conclude it's another 90 days for the court to render a decision. All totaled we continue to believe that the decision by the Court of Appeals is going to take approximately two to three years. As far as the Comex issue is concerned we are still in arbitrator and there is still a lawsuit filed by Sherwin Williams in the New York Court and at this stage we are in the process of selecting arbitrators. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Got it. Then not to beat the dead horse to death here, but in terms of your Latin-American operations obviously there's not much you can do without the facts other than maybe push through pricing which you have been doing, but for you to turn that business around and the performance of that business and actually get out on a positive trajectory either this year or next year, is there anything that you guys can do internally or do you have to rely basically on the currency and the end markets improving? Sean Hennessy : No, there's a lot we can do internally, Dmitry and it's the same kind of playbook that we assume run the company deliver the results we have. We need to knock on more doors, call on more painting contractors move more gallons of paint, be more efficient. When the economies come back and the currency runs our direction, it will be really, really good. In the mean time, we're working on the things that we can control. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : So are you increasing your sales presence there in terms of outside sales people and how do you bang on more doors? Sean Hennessy : We have invested in more people to promote our sales and our gallons in the marketplace absolutely. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : All right. Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks Dmitry. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Eugene Fedotoff with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris Connor : Good morning, Eugene. Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Congratulations on a good quarter. Chris Connor : Thank you. Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Couple of questions on store group sales for the quarter, if you can comment on anything that you\u2019ve seen maybe something outside of normal seasonal improvement and also maybe you can comment on sales in first half of July here. Sean Hennessy : We mentioned the time is good and all segments across all of our divisions and that momentum is continuing here as we begin July. Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks and a question on DIY customers of your stores. I think previously you\u2019ve talked about gaining market share in that particular segment. Just wondering if that's still the case, you are seeing strong growth in DIY presence and how was 4th July weekend for that segment I guess? Chris Connor : Performance in DIY is also strong. The weekend was good for us as well and again the momentum is continuing. Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Great. Thank you. Chris Connor : Thanks Eugene. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Thanks very much. I imagine that sequentially your tin prices in North America went up, is everything now priced in so that tin prices sequentially going forward should be flattish or is there still more realization to come? Sean Hennessy : I think the price increase we've realized what we're going to get from the price increase. We don't see a big improved increase in the third or fourth quarter Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: And you commented before that you thought that the TiO2 market was benign for the remainder of the year, when you look out over the next two or three years, do you still see it as benign or you do you see it as changing? Chris Connor : Jeff, it's always based on the balance and supply and demand in the market. Coatings demand in North America should continue to grow as we move back towards normalized levels. That said as you know, there is plans on the drawing board for a new high-capacity TiO2 plant in Mexico. There is continuing supply growth coming out of Asia Pacific. So it just all depends on how on the timing of those factors. Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you very much. Chris Connor : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates. Please proceed with your question. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Thank you and good afternoon now I guess. Chris Connor : Good afternoon, Richard. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay. In the consumer group the profit contribution from Comex at $2.7 million is that all flowing from the sales gain? My math is the $19.7 million or does some of that flow through from the paint stores like what happens in the legacy Sherwin Williams. Sean Hennessy : No that income is actually from a couple different sources that are in consumer group. The duck back products as well as the viewer business we have up in [tied in] (ph) Canada, so that process is really not being driven by the stores group. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay. Good. Okay. And second question, I guess you are trying to answer this, but for the second quarter alone for Comex, your profit, the loss was smaller than you thought, but the sales were clearly at or below the low end of your projection, what's going on -- why are the stores -- Comex stores lagging your expectations? Chris Connor : Why are they lagging our expectations, we expected them to be behind and they are. As we commented, Richard when we made this acquisition, that this was a troubled asset in North America and we are building these stores out and improving their inventory position and we've already talked about the equipment etcetera and so it's going to take us a while to reestablish those relationships and get those gallons and customers coming back. John talked about the things we're learning in this for example, the ability to add on associated product sales for equipment etcetera and these all things that are we're going to be working on aggressively going forward. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay. Fine. Now you just came out I guess the stores -- Comex stores business, which is at the low end of your expectations for the quarter. Chris Connor : Well actually expectations we gave were $0.10 dilutive for the Comex that's in the second quarter. We actually were $0.06 dilutive. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Baked in sales, the sales\u2026 Chris Connor : Right. They're at the low end of -- sales that are still at the low end of the expectation, that's correct. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay. Thanks a lot for your time guys. Chris Connor : Thank you, Richard. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : I can't believe it I still have questions left to ask. Thanks for extending the call. Couple things, I was curious first I want to make sure we get the gross profit dollar changes if it's possible by segment before we get off and then just can you tell us about what your competitors are doing? They seem to be really busy on the acquisition front, whether it's your North America last year and then down in Mexico? I am just wondering strategically how you view that and what you would like to do to kind of fortify yourself? Sean Hennessy : I'll take the gross margin dollar real quick here, so we get that -- make sure we get that, our Paint Stores Group were up $142,500,000 million, consumer was up $21,959,000, our Global Finishes Group were up $8,418,000 and Latin America Group was up $4,211,000. Then regarding our competitors there and we've long commented about this terrific industry that we compete in that we're blessed with really outstanding companies to compete against. We respect the strategies and performance of all these folks and we look forward to meeting them on the battle field and I think our results as John commented earlier particularly in the area of share gains, we're showing that we're pretty confident. We've got a good model here. We're going to continue to work it hard. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Thanks and just last thing, you wanted to get your cash balance down, is it fair to assume that historically you were kind of sub $100 million in terms of cash you would like on the balance sheet. Should we assume that that's about right for your long term or do you think you need more of these? Sean Hennessy : Yes we think that we don't think we need -- we need liquidity sources. Our liquidity sources are strong, but I believe our cash flow will be below $100 million again in the future. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Thanks guys. Have a great quarter. Sean Hennessy : Thank you, Aram. Operator : Thank you. It appears there are no further question at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Bob Wells : Thanks Jessie. As always, I will be available for the balance of today, tomorrow and throughout the coming weeks and to your any follow-up questions you might have. Thanks again for joining us today and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin Williams. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

Every major product line in our company grew in our Q3 and our diverse business portfolio continues to deliver strong results. Net sales increased 10% and adjusted EPS increased 13% in the quarter. These results were driven by a number of factors, including the successful integration of acquisitions, strong performance from China and Europe, improved sales and profitability in our Coatings segment, benefits of new growth initiatives, investments in innovative products and the positive impact of productivity initiatives. I'll now cover some of the highlights of the quarter. Coatings segment sales grew 6%, excluding Inver. Including Inver, sales grew 16%. All major product lines within the Coatings segment grew in volume and sales over last year. Within the segment, Packaging had its eighth consecutive quarter of growth with sales increasing mid-single-digits as we continue to increase our global market share. Packaging volumes increased in all major geographic regions and included strong growth in non-BPA Coatings. Sales in the General Industrial product line were up mid-single-digits over last year, excluding Inver. This is the third consecutive quarter of improvement in sales trends, driven by market share gains and modestly improving end markets in some geographies. And in Europe, the integration of Inver continues to progress extremely well. Sales in Coil coatings grew mid-single-digits, driven by new business wins and improving customer demand. And our Wood product line grew sales mid-single-digits and has been a strong performer, benefiting from new business wins in China and the improving U.S. housing market. Moving now to our Paints segment. We performed well in all regions and sales increased 4%. Our Paints segment benefited from strong growth in international markets. In China, sales grew double-digits. In Australia, sales grew high single-digits in local currency. This is our best sales growth in Australia since we acquired this business in 2010. Our rollout with B&Q in the U.K. continued to progress well in the third quarter. We're now selling Valspar Paint in 250 B&Q stores and are reformatting the rest of the stores for deployment later this year. Now before I talk to you about the U.S., let me answer the question you may have, which is if sales increased 4% and international markets performed well, why did EBIT decline? The answer is that we experienced low single-digit sales growth in the U.S. in Q3 because of large shipments made in the second quarter in advance of the Valspar Reserve launch at Lowe's and Valspar Paints at Ace. The EBIT decline was driven in large part by the planned investments in advertising and marketing to support these initiatives. So let me provide a couple of comments that will give some context in our U.S. paint sales over the last 6 months. First, if you combine Q2 and Q3 this year and compare it to the same quarters last year, our U.S. paint sales were up double-digits and volume increased mid-single-digits. Second, importantly, sales at retail of Valspar Paint in Q3 were strong. So we're pleased with our performance over the last 6 months. The paint season in the U.S. has been solid and sales of Valspar-branded paint have been strong. In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made and the market share gains of our major businesses. The improved results in our Coatings segment coupled with the growth investments we are making in the Paints segment really shows the benefits of our diverse product mix, strong competitive positions and broad global exposure. We have executed well in many key initiatives so far this year, including the integration of Inver, big launches of new initiatives in retail paints, growing our Coatings segment volumes, restructuring our manufacturing costs and continuing to drive improved productivity. Based on our year-to-date performance and our current outlook for the fourth quarter, we are updating our annual fiscal 2014 sales guidance to approximately 9% growth, which is the high end of our previous range. And we are also updating our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.05 to $4.15 per share. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim, who'll provide some additional detail and context for the quarter. James L. Muehlbauer: Thanks, Gary. This morning, I will review the key drivers behind our performance in the third quarter and discuss our expectations for the balance of the fiscal year. Starting first with our performance in Q3. Sales growth of 10% was led by volume gains in both our Coatings and Paints segments. These gains were driven by volume growth from new business wins in many of our product lines and from the Inver acquisition. Looking at the Coatings segment. Sales increased 16%, driven primarily by the Inver acquisition and included growth in all major product lines. Excluding acquisitions, Coatings sales increased 6%, which was an improvement over the last 2 quarters when sales were up 2% and down 1% respectively. Gary has already covered the key drivers behind the performance in the Coatings product lines in the quarter. I will focus my comments on providing you with a few more details on the sales and volume performance. Packaging sales were up mid-single-digits and volume increased low single-digits. All of our major geographic regions grew Packaging volumes during the third quarter. Sales in the General Industrial product line improved in the quarter. Total sales increased mid-single-digits in local currency, excluding Inver. This performance reflects continued improvement over the declines experienced last year and in the first half of fiscal 2014. Coil product line sales and volumes were up mid-single-digits in the third quarter. Volume growth benefited from the improved demand after difficult weather conditions in the U.S. during the first half of the year. Wood product line sales increased mid-single-digits and volume was up double-digits, driven by strong growth in China. Moving on to the Paints segment. Total sales increased 4% and volumes were up high single-digits. Volume growth was driven by double-digit increases in both China and Australia. As Gary discussed earlier, Q3 volume in the U.S. was impacted by shipments made to customers during Q2 to support the introduction of Valspar Reserve and the branded paint rollout at Ace. As you may recall, volume in the U.S. was up more than 10% in Q2. With that overview of sales complete, let's discuss the drivers behind gross margin. We finished the quarter with total gross margin of 34.9%, an increase of 80 basis points over last year. The increase was driven by improved sales mix in both the Coatings and Paints segments, leverage benefits from higher volumes and continued productivity initiatives. Gross margins expanded in both the Coatings and Paints segments. Shifting to expenses. OpEx in the third quarter increased 160 basis points to 21.1% of sales. We increased spending to support the key growth initiatives we discussed earlier. These initiatives are focused on providing profitable growth for the company but require investments today that we can leverage more fully as these initiatives grow. The increase in OpEx in the quarter versus last year was driven by 3 main factors, which explain most of the $42 million increase in operating expenses. First, we increased investments in support of new retail initiatives and brand-building activities in the Paints segment. These include higher advertising, marketing and overhead expenses for these businesses, which explains approximately half of the incremental year-over-year spend. Second, our expenses include the addition of Inver, which represents approximately 1/4 of the OpEx increase. And finally, we had higher variable incentive compensation expense in the quarter, which represents approximately $8 million of incremental year-over-year spend in Q3. As I discussed on the Q2 call, the increased incentive expense reflects the normal level of bonus for the year compared to the lower-than-normal bonus amounts from last year. Bringing it all together, consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 4% and adjusted EBIT margins finished at 13.7% in the third quarter. In the Coatings segment, adjusted third quarter EBIT of $122 million increased 21% over the previous year and was 18.3% of sales. The increase in EBIT was a result of Inver, the benefits from leveraging higher sales volumes, improved sales mix and productivity initiatives. In the Paints segment, the EBIT decline was primarily driven by incremental expenses to support new retail initiatives. These investments during the quarter offset improvements in volume and sales mix in the Paints segment. In total, Paints EBIT of $44 million was down 16% from the prior year and was 9.2% of sales. Looking at the balance of the P&L. Our tax rate improved, and we have an opportunity for a lower effective annual tax rate than we estimated at the start of the year. The Q3 adjusted tax rate of approximately 30% was lower than last year, driven by strong performance in our China and Europe businesses and benefits from tax credits related to specific capital projects in fiscal 2014. We now expect our annual tax rate to be between 31% and 32% for fiscal 2014. This compares to our previous expectation of 32% to 33%. We continue to make good progress on our restructuring activities, which will improve our ability to effectively serve customers. Through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, pretax restructuring charges totaled $28 million. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $526 million, an increase of 26% versus the prior year. This increase was the result of the addition of Inver and investment in inventory to support new growth initiatives, like Valspar Reserve, Ace and B&Q and other new business wins in the portfolio. Year-to-date adjusted cash flow from operations, which excludes restructuring expenses, was approximately $183 million, a decline of 16%, which reflected the timing of inventory and other working capital investments related to our growth initiatives. We expect cash flow from operations to return to more historical trends as we annualize the impact of these initiatives. Wrapping up the highlights from the quarter. We repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of the company's stock for a total investment of $81 million. Now looking to the balance of the fiscal year, we are updating our annual fiscal 2014 sales guidance to approximately 9% growth and have updated our adjusted annual earnings per share guidance to $4.05 to $4.15. Before we open the call for your questions, I hope you noted in our release this morning that we are hosting an Analyst Day in New York on December 3 this year. We're excited to take people through our business in more detail, discuss our opportunities going forward and to have you meet our senior leadership team. More details will be coming soon for this event and we hope you can make it. With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : The Coatings side seems to be hitting stride here and the Paints side seems to be in investment to get some growth on the horizon. Can you help us -- I know you're not going to call out the specific level of promotional spending. But can you give us some sense of how we should expect maybe the SG&A of the sales line progress as you go through the next year and you get deeper into the ramp of these new retail initiatives? Gary E. Hendrickson: Yes, Bob. Thanks for your question, I'll let Jim answer that, and I'll be available here to follow up if you have one. James L. Muehlbauer: Sure. So first, Bob, maybe if we can just take a step back for a minute before we look at kind of the individual quarters and the segments. The new business wins that Valspar has been successful in delivering this year has led to performance in Q1, Q2 and Q3 that takes a little bit more explaining, given how it's rolled into the business. So what I thought I could do is maybe to step up for a minute and just remind folks that when we started the year, our plans in total for the company called for sales growth in the high single-digits and double-digit EPS growth. Those plans included the significant investments that we were expected to make this year to grow our Paints business, both in the U.S. and in Europe, with the new business initiatives. The good news is year-to-date, that's essentially what's played out in our total financial results. A little bit more difficult to see if you look individual quarter. But if you look at all the quarters together, as you can see from our top line and bottom line, that's what happened. Looking to your question specifically, Bob, in the Paints segment, our year-to-date EBIT growth has essentially been flat. And that growth has really been limited by the investments that we've made in our biggest market in the U.S. to grow the business, launch new products and expand distribution. Much of the increased investment that we made in the year obviously has been focused during the key paint-selling season, which was Q2 and Q3. So when we look at the third quarter, we continued to increase investments to a similar level that we had saw in the second quarter. But the big thing in the Paints segment in the third quarter, Bob, is that we just didn't have the same level of volume growth that landed in the third quarter, given the pre-shipments that we made in advance of the selling season in Q2. That's the real reason why the EBIT decline was a little bit deeper in Q3 than Q2 for the Paints segment. Probably most importantly for us and for investors, is the investments that we had made this year are really our opportunity to launch those businesses in the portfolio, expand distribution and they're investments that we can continue to leverage as we grow those initiatives further. And as I mentioned on the Q2 call, we expected that our expenses in the Paints segment, the year-over-year growth would decline in the fourth quarter. So we expect to see a little less pressure from expenses overall. So expenses in the Paints segment are still expected to be up in the fourth quarter but not near to the extent that we saw in the last 2 quarters. Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And can you talk a little bit about the history at Ace? I know they've said good things about their paint business this year. But what the mix historically has been between private label and branded? And if you would anticipate any change in that, given the greater promotional effort to feature the paint section at Ace? Gary E. Hendrickson: I think, Bob, I think it's been rough. So this is my best estimate to try to give you an answer to the question. I think it's been 30-70 or so, private label to branded. And absolutely, we expect that mix to change over time. That's the whole thesis of our investment in branding this year. And I think our retail partner's committed to that as well. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Just as a quick follow-up to the expenses that you've talked about. So when we get into next year, does this level of expenses on a quarter-over-quarter basis sort of stay the same? Are the initiatives unchanged? Or does that lessen because there's more of an upfront expense, and so expenses, I guess, all else equal should decline? Gary E. Hendrickson: Yes. Ivan, it's Gary. So we just want to be careful about not talking about next year until our fourth quarter conference call as is always the case. But let me just say this. Next year, we expect to sell more paint than we did this year. We expect our business to grow both through growth with an improving economy and the things that we're doing in terms of investment. And we expect the investment that we need to generate that growth to decline from this year. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And then my follow-up question, your Packaging business seems to be outperforming, I guess, your competitors fairly significantly. Would you describe that as all -- you did point out that sort of un-BPA-related volume is also doing real well. What regions and what product lines are you gaining the most market share? Or is it all in non-BPA? Gary E. Hendrickson: Well, non-BPA, Ivan, is still a relatively small portion of the overall mix that we sell in our Packaging coatings business. But it is growing at a much faster rate than the overall business. We think the investments that we've made over the last 6 or 7 years in developing new technology for that business are paying off. As the market continues to convert through desires of consumers for non-BPA Coatings, we're positioned to win in that space. As we said in the opening comments, we grew our volume and sales in every geographic region this quarter. The take-up of non-BPA Coatings has been most pronounced in Europe with North America being second, very little in Asia and Latin America. So as we think about our total business, we're pleased that we were able to grow in every region, non-BPA was part of it. But I think just excellent execution of our business plan is the main reason. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Great. And Packaging is one of your more profitable businesses, correct? Gary E. Hendrickson: Our entire Coatings segment is profitable. Operator : And our next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Your paint sales grew 4%, but your volume grew 8%. What's the connection between those numbers? How do we get from 8% to 4%? James L. Muehlbauer: Yes. Jeff, a lot of the volume growth in the quarter was driven by markets outside of the U.S. Specifically, China had a very good quarter. And as we've talked before, the growth in China has been in the segment of the market that's lower-priced paints. So the translation from volume to sales dollar growth is a little lower in China. We have the opposite of that going on in the U.S. market with the introduction of branded paints in the hardware channel and the Valspar Reserve at Lowe's. The mix of our business allows us to grow top line sales a little bit more than volume. But the short answer is significant growth in the China market. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So in other words, you had a mix issue in the quarter, it wasn't simply marketing expense? James L. Muehlbauer: Yes, 2 different things, Jeff. I wouldn't call it a mix issue. We're talking about the volume growth in the China business going up commensurate with the strategy that we have in place for that market. Separate and aside, from an expense standpoint, our expense growth has been focused on the investments we're making to support volume growth in both the U.S. and Europe. So I don't look at those as a mix issue, I look at those as investments in growing both of those regional markets. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So your receivables were $871 million versus $716 million in the year ago. Why are the receivables so high? And why is your working capital becoming so heavy? James L. Muehlbauer: Yes. Our working capital is up primarily due to the investments that we've made to increase inventory associated in the new launches around Ace. But also recall that a portion of that inventory build, probably the biggest part of the inventory build year-over-year, is the Inver business, so really not a build, just not in the comparable numbers from last year yet. If you go back to last quarter, we finished Q2 with inventories up roughly 15%. Or as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, inventories now are up a little over 26%. Biggest increase between Q2 and Q3 has really been inventory we've been building to support the growth we've seen in the Packaging business and some of the improved performance we're seeing in the General Industrial markets. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : But what about the receivables? James L. Muehlbauer: Receivables primarily relates to the timing of sales in our Packaging business and the agreements that we have with vendors and the sales in the U.S. market around paints. I think the best way to look at this, Jeff, is when we anniversary and we get into the fourth quarter and we look at the kind of a full year-end balances, we expect more normalized behavior. We've just got a bunch of new product launches that have happened in Q2 and Q3 that are changing our timing a little bit within the year. Nothing fundamentally has changed with our payment terms to individuals or our receipt terms from our customer bases by segment. Operator : And the next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How much did product load-in related to your initiative contribute in the U.S. business during the quarter? And why was there such a big disconnect in performance between Valspar and the peer group business that sell-in to the big-box retailers? James L. Muehlbauer: Yes, 2 things. First off, I would not say that we experienced a load-in, in the third quarter at all. Basically, our sales volume was highest in the U.S. business during the second quarter in advance of the paint season. So the additional inventory -- or sorry, the additional shipments we talked about in our prepared remarks were really in Q2. And then to answer the second part of your question, I would not say that our sales of paint in the U.S. market were lower than our competitors. I think what you're compared potentially is information that's presented based on end sales to customers with our competitors. Recall, our business is sold through retailers. So there, we pool [ph] our sales numbers are shipments into retailers versus some of our competitors who are reporting direct sales results to customers. But we absolutely see that our results in the U.S. have been very good during paint season. Gary E. Hendrickson: Yes. I think back to -- this is Gary. I'd go back to the comments I made in my script. If you put Q2 and Q3 together, our sales were up double-digits and our volume was up mid-single-digits. And as I said, I'm not going to call out the exact sell-through of Valspar Paints at retail. But I would say that we're satisfied with the sell-through as well. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. Just a related question, apart from new products, are you guys maintaining share at your largest customer? Gary E. Hendrickson: Yes, absolutely. Operator : And our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : A couple of questions. First, on raw materials, some prices in epoxies and other resins seemed to be going up. So can you comment on that? And then the question on TiO2, do you see any chance of a price increase in this calendar year? Gary E. Hendrickson: It's Gary, P.J. So our raw material basket in the quarter was relatively flat, I will say that we have seen in our China business some early signs of modest inflation. But with respect to answering questions about specific commodities, we got out of that business a long time ago when we got tired of answering the TiO2 questions. So I can't help you. The bottom line is I can't help you on individual commodities. P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And let me ask you on pricing. In the U.S., how much were prices are up in Paints year-over-year? And as you sell more volumes through Ace, how will it impact your price mix in the U.S.? Gary E. Hendrickson: Okay. Well, in terms of pricing, I think pricing in the channels that we serve has been pretty steady. I think there had been price increases in the stores channel, which we all participate in. But so that's the answer to your first question. The answer to your second question is as we continue to be successful with Reserve and the branded paint initiatives at Lowe's, we expect our mix will shift in a positive direction. And we actually see that in our results. P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I mean, my question was is Ace pricing point lower than Lowe's pricing point? Gary E. Hendrickson: No, they're always going to be higher. Operator : And our next question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Gary, could you just discuss China Coatings, how those markets are progressing, off-road, Wood, et cetera? Gary E. Hendrickson: Yes, David, we've had a very good year in China. Our overall business is up in the mid-teens. It was in the quarter and it has been for the full year. And all of our businesses in China have contributed more or less at the same level. So just as a reminder of the businesses that are significant to us in China, it's our consumer business, it's the Wood coatings business, it's our Packaging coatings business and the 2 industrial businesses that we call out in terms of product lines, are Coil and General Industrial. All of the businesses in China this year have had a positive year. So one, just 1 thing to think about, last year was a relatively weak year for us in China. It's was one of the contributors to the results that we had last year, which didn't meet our expectations. Our businesses have come back this year. The markets have recovered, I would say, modestly. But we've done a very good job in executing and taking share. We're a small player in every market that we participate in, in China. And we've done a nice job of taking share. David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Very good. And just in the U.S., Gary, how would you characterize this U.S. paint season : normal, above normal, below normal? What would you say? Gary E. Hendrickson: I'd say it's near normal. With the internal research that we -- just in terms of our sell-through, as I've said, we've been pleased with the sell-through of Valspar Paints at retail. That's 1 indicator. And then our research, our internal research says that people, consumers in the U.S. are thinking about painting projects in more or less the way they have historically in terms of when they're going to do it and why they do it, et cetera, so normal is what I -- is the short answer. Operator : Your next question will come from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : The question I have is regarding the Ace business. When you acquired the business, it was sort of a breakeven-type of an operation. And then just thinking was that by the end of this year, it's going to get to the high single-digits as you close a couple of plants. Sort of where you versus your expectations? Gary E. Hendrickson: We're more or less in line with what we expected. You're talking about the private-label piece, Dmitry? Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Correct, the private label. Gary E. Hendrickson: There are 2 parts. There's a branded piece, which is incremental business for us. And then there's a private-label piece, which we acquired and we lost money on for last year and in the first part of this year. But that's a business that we have a contract on a cost-plus basis and we had to close a couple of factories in North America to get to the terminal cost structure that we committed to. We closed those factories, and now we're operating it as it should. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. So I know you don't like to talk about 2015 expectations yet. But as we play with our models and as you look into 2015, that roughly $100 million business is going bring in margin this time around. Gary E. Hendrickson: Yes, but not a ton, right, cost plus. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Second question is your debt continues to climb. And I know typically, as with your inventories, you build them during the winter months, and then you sort of liquidate them into the summer months, this year being different because of the new programs you're rolling out. Can you talk a little bit about what your debt strategy is and sort of where you're comfortable with the debt level? Are there plans to take the debt down materially? Or should we think about it basically staying at these levels, and then you utilizing your free cash for share repurchase and acquisitions? James L. Muehlbauer: Yes, Dmitry, it's Jim. Our priority is obviously from a cash flow standpoint is to take the cash that we're generating from operations that we continue to expect to increase as we grow the initiatives both in the Paints and Coatings segments and deploy that first against good capital ideas against our portfolio, whether it's adding new production or improving productivity. Certainly, from that standpoint, as we've done the last couple years, using cash flow to make acquisitions that make strategic sense for the company. We're not in the business to hoard cash for our shareholders. We've got a nice balanced portfolio of enhancing returns through share repurchases as well. So really I look at the leverage we have on the businesses as appropriate and modest. We've got capacity to do more from a leverage standpoint if an M&A opportunity comes along that makes sense to us. We also have the opportunity to issue a little bit more debt to continue to fund the business and continue to fund share repurchases going forward. So we're really looking at it from a debt strategy standpoint. We've got plenty of capacity to do the things that we need to do to grow the business organically. And we're in position if we need to increase leverage a little bit for an M&A opportunity overall. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then just final question, I want to make sure I have my math right in sort of putting together some of the things you've talked about. The incremental SG&A expense of $40 million quarter-over-quarter, you talked about half of that or maybe about $20 million being the advertising and marketing expense, mostly tied to the Paints business, I would assume. Without that incremental expense, would it be fair to say that your Paints operating profits would have been up about $10 million? James L. Muehlbauer: Yes. I mean, we could have driven higher operating income if we weren't making those investments for the business. What I want to call out specifically, Dmitry, is that you can't look at -- well, our intent isn't to say that 100% of those incremental expenses are one-time in nature and are not going to recur next year. A portion of those expenses that I called out in my prepared remarks are ongoing support costs for the business. And we'll absolutely have opportunities to continue to support the growth in those businesses next year. But to the point that Gary made, we expect to grow volumes in the Paints segment next year and we expect to get better operating margins by leveraging those investments as we have a full year behind us in those initiatives and as we continue to see growth in both the big box and in the hardware channel in the U.S. Operator : And our next question will come from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Yes. Just a follow-up on the SG&A, so as we look at the balance of this year, again you're up $40 million year-over-year. Does the variable IC -- of $8 million kind of -- does that become flat year-over-year? And with the promotional expense of around $20 million, would that kind of fall in half on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal fourth quarter? James L. Muehlbauer: Yes. So I'm not going to talk about specific components of what's going to drive SG&A. But from a macro standpoint, similar to what I've been saying earlier, our expense growth in Q4 is expected to be less than what we've experienced during the last 2 quarters. We are going to have a little less pressure on variable bonuses, given the activity and turnback we had to do last year based on the performance of the business. But that will be contingent upon where we finish the year. Certainly, our incentive bonuses will be set based on our final year-end performance, and we'll do any true-ups we need to do in the fourth quarter. Coming out of the key element of paint season, just our year-over-year increases in spending in that segment are expected to come down in the fourth quarter from what we experienced in Q3 and Q2. Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. And then you mentioned that you thought your sales or volumes were up mid-single-digits, which you thought was in line with the market. What's your overall expectation of the market this year versus last, given the slowdown that we're seeing in some key housing metrics, like home turnover and new residential construction? James L. Muehlbauer: Yes. I mean, we have a pretty, I think, balanced view of the full year from a housing standpoint when we started. We certainly saw that there'd be continued tailwinds around the recovery of the market. But we did not set an overly optimistic view of where housing was going to go. Quite candidly, our focus this year has been on launching new products and executing in the home improvement channel, which we believe has been very successful, and expanding some very significant and important new distribution in the hardware channel. So while the underlying housing trends may have softened a little bit, our view for the year started off, I think, as kind of down in the middle of the fairway. And secondly, we've been executing really hard on some new growth initiatives. So our results are probably more akin to that this year versus the market than any specific changes in the market. Operator : And our next question comes from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research : I was wondering, it sounds like in Australia, your volumes, I think you called out about high single or double-digit-type volume growth in Australia. So wondering, how does that compare to the market over there? Do you continue to gain share? And also how is your margin profile going over there? I know there's been a lot of restructuring over the past couple years. So are you starting to see now that you're getting that volume, a nice pickup in margin as well? Gary E. Hendrickson: Yes. Kevin, it's Gary. So yes, it was a great quarter for that business. And it did translate into improved earnings. That's a leverage, to some extent, a leverage play now. We've done our restructuring. We've got the cost structure that we want. And incremental volume is very profitable volume for us. So that's the second question that you asked. The first question is we took share again this quarter in both trade and at retail. And that is fundamentally the reason that we got the nice growth that we did. Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research : And you called out at least all the major product lines within the General Industrial were improving. I was wondering if shipping container, if -- I know that's been beaten down for a while, if you're starting to see that turn as well. And if this agreement that you had with Maersk, I know you announced a couple quarters ago, if you're starting to see some new business opportunities as a result of that as well. Gary E. Hendrickson: So we saw what I would call a very modest increase in shipping container construction in the quarter for our legacy business. It didn't move the dial in terms of our overall results, but it was positive. And then the Maersk partnership has been very good. We're selling our product to Maersk. We're making containers and that's a significant change in the industry. Obviously, it's new sales for us, but it's also -- they're also a reference customer for that industry. And for Maersk to convert from a solid-based coating to a water-based coating bodes well for the sustainability of that industry and it bodes well for us as a first mover. So no great improvement in the market yet, but our business is doing just fine. Operator : And the next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : We're seeing some channel checks about your efforts at being cute that suggested you might actually be gaining more shelf space in some of the stores than you had initially targeted. Can you comment on that at all? Gary E. Hendrickson: I don't know, Vincent. I'm not trying to be evasive. I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about. Our program, as it's set, has been pretty consistent with the planograms that we established right in the beginning of the program. So I'm not sure exactly what you're talking about. I will say this, sell-through of Valspar has been really good. We're very pleased with it. And I think our retail partner is very pleased with it. The best is yet to come with B&Q. We've got 250 stores, roughly 250 stores set with about 100 left to go. The 100 remaining are the ones that really drive the volume in the business. They're the large format stores, B&Q has 3 formats. So we're just now in the process of setting the large format stores. And that'll take place over the next few months. So yes, it's gone a little bit slower than we expected just in terms of the overall program, where there's more complexity in the big format stores than we anticipated. But sell-through of Valspar and consumer acceptance and desire to buy Valspar Paint has been very strong. James L. Muehlbauer: Yes. And we're looking forward to the day when we can turn advertising on effectively in the marketplace. And to your point, Vincent, our presence in the stores is strong and noticeable for customers. It's not a value proposition that's tucked away in the department. It is something that stands out as new and big in the portfolio, so we're quite excited to see how it develops. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Just to be clear, maybe I wasn't clear. The feedback we were getting was that it was going very well and was doing better than expected, and the retailer was quite pleased with it obviously. The rest of my questions have been answered, so I'll pass along. Operator : And the next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.: Most of my questions have been answered. But I was wondering if you could give us a feel for the success of Valspar Reserve. We are now at the end of the season. Did you sell or did Lowe's sell as much as you anticipated? Gary E. Hendrickson: It exceeded our expectations. I won't comment on Lowe's. But it definitely exceeded Valspar's expectations. The penetration into our overall mix has been higher than we planned. Consumer acceptance has been phenomenal. The basic thing that we set out to do was to provide consumers with an exceptional paint, better than the product that we had at the top end, more features and attributes. We thought we could convince the Lowe's associates in store that consumers would pay up for that price point. And all of that has proven to be true. So we couldn't be more pleased with both the execution of the launch and consumer acceptance of the product. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.: Well, that is great. And, Gary, looking at Europe, other companies have said that while certain areas were growing, like automotive, construction was still in the doldrums and, in some cases, still declining. Could you give us a better feel as to where you are doing so much better in Europe besides Packaging? Gary E. Hendrickson: All of our businesses' product lines in the quarter and the year, Rosemarie, have performed better than last year. So Packaging has performed particularly well. But our General Industrial business is doing well. I mean, big news there this year was Inver and the integration of our legacy business into Inver. That's been substantially completed and has been a success for us. Our Coil business has improved pretty substantially in the year. And we've improved distribution in other parts of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, particularly the Middle East, where our business in the Middle East has been stronger this year. So it's been a very positive year for our team in Europe. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.: Gary, any particular end markets that are doing better than others? I mean, so the Coil, for example, where is it going? Gary E. Hendrickson: Let's just call it pan-Europe. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.: All right. Well, I meant end product, refrigerators versus something else that I cannot think of. Gary E. Hendrickson: No. I mean, I can't give you that. I'd hate to speculate on that, Rosemarie. Our Coil business is mainly building products. So that would be the end market. But for us it's been about taking market share as much as it is about the overall market. In General Industrial, we're still a small player even after the Inver integration. We're certainly not 10% of the overall market. We're probably closer to 5% in industrial coatings. So we've got lots of opportunities to grow even if the market is not growing. That's the way we look at our business in Europe. We look at our business that way in Latin America. And we look at our business that way in Asia. Operator : And our next question will come from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Strong results in Australia notwithstanding one of your partners there, Masters, seems to be having some difficulty with its store growth and revenue growth. Would you help us understand how the split is between your strong growth, I guess, in Wattyl as well as Masters versus what we're seeing in terms of on the Masters' side not really growing at all? Gary E. Hendrickson: Yes. I'm not going to comment on Masters. That would be a question that you'd have to ask them. They have 50 stores. They expect to build 10 to 15 stores over the next few years. All of those stores will require paint. I think the paint department within Masters is performing pretty well. And Masters is still a relatively small portion of our overall portfolio in our Australia business. If you recall, Nils, about 2/3 of our businesses is trade business, about 1/3 is retail. And we have distribution that is not Masters distribution. So 50 stores, 10 to 15 a year, that gets them close to 100 stores in a few years. And that's nice business. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division : No, that's helpful. I know you said that your non-BPA offering was pretty small. But as it gets bigger and there's more interest in it in Europe, in the U.S. and perhaps at some point in Asia, is there going to be a meaningful mix uplift from that offering just on pricing or margin? Gary E. Hendrickson: We're not going to commit to that. Our job is to grow our business and we're going to -- we have a very significant opportunity to grow our business in Europe, in Latin America and in Asia, where our share, percentage of market, is much lower than it is in North America. And so we're focused on growth, and it is a profitable segment for us. So if we get market-average margins and we're growing, then our investors will be satisfied with that outcome. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Got it, understood. And then just finally, I know you said that in Coatings, pretty much all lines had saw growth, didn't call out anything on the off-road or machinery, which had been an issue in the past. Has that corrected itself fully? And are we going to start seeing positive comps anytime soon? Gary E. Hendrickson: Yes, I think we're just trying to get away from, to the extent that we can, talking about the subsegments within GI. So the way our Coatings segment is organized, it's Packaging coatings, Coil coatings, General Industrial coatings and Wood coatings. And when we disappointed ourselves last year, we were pretty specific as to the product lines within our portfolio that hurt us. We like to try not to continue referencing back to those product lines all the time and would rather talk about the main product line within the segment, which would be General Industrial. So I'll say this, within the General Industrial product line in our Coatings segment, every one of those end markets improved at least modestly in the quarter. So I'll answer your specific question, and hopefully this will be the last time I answer it on a call. We took a lot of market share in China. And that's been part of the improvement. And I would say that the overall growth of that segment, you'd be better served reading the earnings transcripts from Caterpillar and Deere, who are the market leaders in that segment. They would be able to tell you with more precision than we can how the overall market is performing. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Schwartz with First Analysis. Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Gary, in your prepared remarks, when you talked about the EBIT margin for Paint and you compared second quarter and third quarter, you noted that you shipped more of the Reserve in the second quarter. And you'd expect that, that would help overhead absorption. But I'm not quite sure how that reduces or negatively impacts margin in the third quarter unless there's some cannibalization. Am I reading that wrong or hearing it wrong? James L. Muehlbauer: Yes, 2 things in that, Steve. First off, I think in Gary's remarks, he was referring to volume and sales and not EBIT between the quarters. But to maybe just rewind a little bit, the volume growth we had in the U.S. in the second quarter was comprised of certainly kind of our base recurring businesses but also supporting the launch of Valspar Reserve and the Ace branded sets for Valspar Paints. So as we moved into Q3, we increased spending along both initiative lines. But part of the volume that was actually sold in Q3 by our retail customers, we had actually sold into the channel during Q2 before the start of the season. So what we were trying to provide transparency in explaining is you really need to put the 2 quarters together to look at the performance of the Paints segment. The traction that we're seeing with Valspar Reserve per Gary's comments and what we're seeing in overall offtake is in line with what we expected for the total season so far. Our EBIT, being flat in Paints year-to-date, is a product of the top line growth we're driving to those new business initiatives plus expenses we need to do to support the business in the near term that we know we can leverage more fully going forward. Operator : And our last question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Neal P. Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : This is actually Neal Sangani with the follow-up. It sounds like the B&Q rollout is going very well. Have you figured out or how are you looking at your long-term supply plan for the region? Gary E. Hendrickson: We're going to supply from Europe, Neal. It's just a question of getting the right structure in place. And we're talking with multiple parties that are interested in partnering with us, and we've -- our team knows that next year, we expect -- I expect that we're going to be supplying B&Q from Europe. And our team will make that happen. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 12 :30 today, running through Tuesday, August 26 at midnight.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Seymour. Please go ahead, sir. Bill Seymour : Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter earnings call. We have two speakers today, Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll have plenty of time to take your questions. Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate Web site at valsparglobal.com. And finally, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with GAAP numbers that we'll report in our Form 10-K. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release. Before I hand over to Gary, I wanted to remind you that we're hosting an Analyst Day in New York on December 3rd. Please contact us if you need further information about this event. With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary. Gary Hendrickson : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Today I'm going to provide highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance. I'll also cover our outlook for 2015. Our strong fourth quarter capped off a record year of sales and earnings for Valspar. Net sales in the quarter increased to 11%, and adjusted EPS increased 42%. The Coatings segment continued its positive momentum with sales growth of 15%, and all product lines delivered increased volumes. Excluding acquisitions, coating sales were up 11%. In the Paints segment, sales increased in all regions, and we significantly increased EBIT. Highlighting the performance in paints was continued growth of the new Valspar Reserve premium paint, and strong growth in our international regions. Moving on to the full year, we grew sales 10% and EPS 23%. These record results continue to demonstrate the diversity and strength of our business portfolio. This excellent performance was driven by volume growth in the Coatings segment, continuing benefits from our new growth initiatives in paint, excellent performance from our international regions, including the successful integration of the Inver acquisition, benefits from new product introductions, and the positive impact of our productivity initiatives. Now, let me cover some segment-specific comment. For the year, our Coatings segment had very strong sales growth of 14% and adjusted EBIT growth of 19%. All product lines were up in sales and volumes for the year. Some highlights include the successful integration and positive performance of Inver, which gives us a solid foothold in the large industrial coatings market in Europe. We grew market share in packaging coatings, driven by our leading position in non-BPA coatings. And our coil and wood product lines benefited from improving end markets and new business wins. In our Paints segment, sales grew 7% and EBIT grew 11%. Highlighting the year were some significant product launches and new business wins including the highly successful launch of Valspar Reserve at Lowe's which won Lowe's Vendor Innovation of the Year award; the launch of Valspar paint in over 3200 Ace stores, and the launch of Valspar paint in over 300 B&Q stores in the U.K. In our international regions, our paints business had a very good year. Paints in China grew double-digits in 2014, as we continued our share growth in this key market. And our business in Australia experienced improving trends throughout the year. The fourth quarter was the fifth in a row of share gains for us in both the pro and DIY channels. In 2014, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to enhancing shareholder returns by increasing our dividend by 13% and buying back 5% of our stock, and this morning, we announced that our Board approved a 15% dividend increase for 2015, making it our 37th consecutive year of dividend growth. We also announced Board approval of a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization demonstrating our continued confidence in our business. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect another year of growth. In our Coatings segment, we expect relatively stable end markets and growth from business new initiatives. In the Paints segment, we expect that continued growth in China, Australia, and Europe will be offset by an adjustment to our product line offering at a customer in North America. We expect the revenue impact of this change to be in the range of $150 million to $180 million in fiscal 2015. This impact has been included in our 2015 guidance. Obviously given this headwind, we're making adjustments to our cost structure to mitigate the margin impact, and these adjustments are included in our earnings guidance. For some perspective on the situation, we won a lot of new paint business in North America over the years. Last year, driven by new business wins on the home improvement channel, Ace, and the independent channel, our revenue in North America was up double-digits. Business wins and losses are normal in the retail industry, as retailers continually adjust their product offerings. Fortunately over the years, we've won a lot more than we've lost. As to the future, our relationship with this customer remains excellent, and we expect to continue to grow our North America business from a reset base over the next few years. In summary, our 2014 results demonstrate the diversity and strength of our business portfolio. We have momentum, and we have exciting growth opportunities for this coming year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide more details on the results and outlook. Jim Muehlbauer : Thanks, Gary, and good morning everyone. Gary has covered the key performance highlights for the year. I will focus my comments this morning on the drivers behind our fourth quarter performance and discuss our expectations for fiscal 2015. Starting first with our results in Q4; sales growth of 11% was led by volume gains in the both the Coatings and Paints segments. The increase in volume was the result of new business wins, core market growth, and from the addition of Inver. Our fourth quarter sales also included the benefit of a 53rd week that increased sales by an estimated 3.5%. Excluding acquisitions, our total sales in the quarter were up 9%. Sales in the Coatings segment increased 15%, and volumes increased in all major product lines. Excluding acquisitions, coating sales increased 11%. Within the Coatings segment, packaging sales and volumes were up double-digits, and all geographic regions performed very well. Growth was driven by market growth, share gains, and the success of our non-BPA products. General industrial product line sales and volumes also increased double-digits in the quarter. These results exclude the impact of the Inver acquisition. The increase in sales was primarily the result of new business wins in Asia, and improved results in Latin America. Coil product line sales were up double-digits, and volumes were up high single-digits in the quarter. We benefited from higher demand in the U.S. driven by improved non-residential construction trends and from new business in Europe and Asia. Rounding out our product lines in the Coatings segment, wood sales were flat, and volume was up low single-digits in the quarter. Moving on to the Paints segment, total sales increased 7% and volumes were up high single-digits. Our international paint regions had a very strong quarter with double-digit volume increases in China, Australia, and Europe. China growth was driven by increased points of distribution and market share gains across all channels. Growth in Australia was primarily driven by new store openings and new business at Masters. We also saw market share gains across all channels in Australia. In Europe, we saw continued growth from the rollout of Valspar branded paints to B&Q stores in the U.K. market. And finally, sales in North America increased low single-digits as we were up against double-digit sales growth last year, driven by the initial load-in of Valspar branded paints at Ace. Q4 sales in the home improvement channel increased high single-digits. Moving on to gross margin performance, we finished the quarter with total adjusted gross margin of 35.1%, an increase of approximately a 180 basis points over last year. This improvement was the largest increase of the year, and reflected growth from both the Coatings and Paints segments. The increase in gross margins was driven by leverage from higher sales, favorable price cost, and benefits from productivity initiatives. Shifting to expenses, Opex in the fourth quarter increased six basis points year-over-year to 20.9% of sales. Operating expense dollars increased 12% versus the previous year, and reflected an improvement over Q3, when expenses were up 20%. This improvement was the result of lower marketing and promotional spending on new growth initiatives in the Paints segment in the fourth quarter. In addition, we reached the one year anniversary of Inver. So these operating expenses are now in our base. Bringing it all together, consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 28%, and EBIT margins increased to 180 basis points, to finish at 14.2% in the fourth quarter. In the Coatings segment, adjusted fourth quarter EBIT of a 117 million increased 25% over the previous year, and was 16.9% of sales. The increase in EBIT was the result of increased volume, acquisitions, improved price costs, and productivity initiatives. In the Paints segment, EBIT of $70 million was up 41% from the prior year, and was 14.6% of sales. The increase in EBIT was the result of strong sales performance in all international regions, and modest sales growth in North America. We're beginning to see some of the benefits from the investment spending made earlier this year to support our new growth initiatives in paints. These benefits will continue to improve as we more fully leverage these investments with higher sales volumes in the future. With that overview of Q4 complete, I'd like to touch on a couple of items related to our full year fiscal 2014 performance before we discuss the outlook for next year. We finished this year with an effective annual tax rate of approximately 30%, which was 100 basis points lower than last year. The reduction was driven by our geographic mix of earnings from strong performance in China and Europe, and from benefits from tax credits. Our operating model continues to generate significant cash flow. This allows us to invest in growing the business and to enhance shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. Cash flow from operations excluding cash restructuring expenses finished the year at approximately $390 million. For context, this amount included some unique non-recurring uses of cash in the year, and the impact of a balance sheet reclassification, which has no impact on cash. Excluding these items, our adjusted cash flow from operations excluding restructuring was closer to 440 million, and increased approximately 7% on a comparable basis. Please note that our GAAP operating cash flow will not include the above items and will therefore be lower. Wrapping up the highlights for the year; after investing in CapEx to grow the business we paid $87 million in dividends representing a per share increase of 13%, and repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of the company stock for a total investment of $349 million. With this as context on fiscal 2014, I'd like to move on to discuss our outlook for fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, we expect annual adjusted EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.65. Within this guidance are the following assumptions. Total sales growth in the low single-digits, reflecting growth in our Coatings segment from stable end markets and new business wins. In the Paints segment, we expect continued growth in China, Australia, and Europe to be offset by the changes in North America that Gary discussed earlier. Even with this headwind, we expect to grow our operating earnings in 2015. Our operating model is strong, and remains positioned to deliver growth for the future. We're planning an effective annual tax of 31% to 32% in 2015, and CapEx of approximately $120 million. In addition to the above assumptions, I'd also like to highlight three other significant items that impact 2015, and are embedded in our guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we had a 53rd week in 2014, and consequently one less comparable week in 2015. This is approximately 1% headwind to sales and $0.04 to EPS in 2015. We've also assumed that FX will have a negative impact of approximately 3% to sales and $0.12 EPS in 2015. And finally, we're planning to take advantage of favorable credit market conditions, and issue new long-term debt during fiscal 2015. As a result, our guidance reflects approximately $75 million in annual interest expense, an increase of $10 million or $0.08 in EPS versus 2014. Proceeds from these issuances will be used to fund existing maturities of long-term debt, and to reduce our short-term borrowings. So summing all these three items, the lack of the 53rd week, FX, and increase in initial expense, the total impact to sales and EPS as outlined in our release today is a reduction of approximately 4% to sales growth and $0.24 to EPS in 2015. In closing, we delivered very strong performance in fiscal 2014, reflecting the breadth of our portfolio and leadership positions in coatings and paints. Moving into 2015, we remain focused on executing our winning strategies that have delivered superior returns for our shareholders. With that, we would like to open up the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research. Kevin Hocevar : Hey, good morning, everybody. I was wondering if you could comment a little more on the North American product line that seemed to be a loss. Could you comment on if this was a certain product line, was it a price point, and could this lead to losses of other products with this customer in the future? Gary Hendrickson : Yes. Good morning. Thanks, Kevin. It's Gary, and we've asked the question that's probably on everyone's mind. First, keep in mind that our customer hasn't publicly announced their retailing plan for 2015. And so, that limits what I can talk about today, but here's some additional information that might be helpful. First, while we are disappointed at losing some business, our relationship with this customer remains excellent. This is a partial reset of their alignment, of their line-up, something retailers do on a regular basis. With the strength of our relationship and the performance of our brand and products, we fully expect to grow again with this customer of the reset base of business. So the answer to your question about incremental losses beyond this is a no. Second, over the past several years, we've grown our global paints business significantly through the strength of the Valspar Huarun and Wattyl brands, new retail programs with many customers and through acquisitions. We're going to continue to do these things. Keep in mind, we've got a diversified portfolio of businesses that both Jim and I mentioned, both consumer and industrial, all of which are doing well as evidenced by the great year that we had, and the exceptional fourth quarter. So the breadth and the diversity of our overall business will support our revenue and earnings going forward, and I think the way to think about this, the way I think about this is the one-year step back in our plans to consistently deliver double-digit earnings growth, which I'd expect that we'd pick up again in '16. Kevin Hocevar : Okay. And then in terms of raw materials, I'm wondering with the declines in oil prices that we're seeing, what you're seeing from a raw material standpoint, and if you think that this could be a tailwind for you guys in 2015? Gary Hendrickson : Well, we're not seeing much, Kevin, because we really -- other than solvents and a couple of other products that we buy, our overall basket is -- it doesn't have a direct correlation with the price of oil, and supply and demand plays a larger part than the oil price. So we're seeing -- we don't expect to see significant inflation in 2015. We're looking for something that is flattish to potentially slightly inflationary again because of supply and demand issues more than the price of oil. So yes, we had a relatively benign raw material environment in 2014, and we're expecting a relatively benign raw material environment in '15. Kevin Hocevar : Okay, great. And then just a final question; I wonder if you can give a little color around operating expenses, because I know you made some investments throughout 2014 to support these new business wins. So how should we think of operating expenses in 2015? Jim Muehlbauer : Hey, Kevin, it's Jim. You correctly point out that -- as we've been talking about the last several quarters, we've made some investments in growing in our business specifically in the Paints segment, related to the new business wins not only at Ace but B&Q. So as you saw on our fourth quarter results, just consistent with our plans as we came out of the paint season, our spending declined pretty significantly from Q3 to Q4. Looking forward into next year, those operating costs from those new businesses are in our base. So from a total company standpoint, we're going to have a lot less operating expense growth next year versus what we experienced in 2014, and it's probably going to track the growth in operating income next year should be a little bit less than our sales growth for the year. Kevin Hocevar : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Rob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Rob Koort : Thanks very much. As you might guess, Gary, more questions on the U.S. business loss. How far how do you know these things and what can you guys do to offset it? And it sounds like the scale of it is pretty substantial, about as big as the Ace business you're brining on. So, is there still scope for some fixed cost leverage and margin expansion in that segment or as with your earnings growth sort of differing that double digits for year, does this differ your chance to move margins up and paint in 2015? Gary Hendrickson : Okay, Bob. You asked as you normally do you asked about four different questions in one go. So I've taken notes and I may not hit them all. So we'll come back if I miss one, okay? So, you know about these things, you know about -- we know about this, it's fairly recent news, I'd just say that retailers are constantly changing their retail line-up through process called to line review that happens on a regular basis. There are other changes that take place during -- for us what would be the painting season, but in this particular case, it's relatively recent news for us. As I said, our customer hasn't announced their retailing plans for '15. So I'm not going to -- I'm not at liberty to talk in detail about what's going on. I was going to say as I answered Kevin's question, this is a partial reset of their line-up and something that retailers do on a regular basis. You'll recall that Valspar has been the winner in some of these partial resets of retailer's line-ups in the past. In this case, obviously we're not the winner. Yes, the number sounds like a big number, but I'd say this, it's a manageable number, and the proof point for that is the confidence that we have in our guidance for next year. We're going to grow our operating income, and we're going to grow our EPS next year. Part of that will be about cost, and cost that we have to take out of the business to deal with this, and part of that will be continued growth in that segment. Both products that are not impacted by this partial change at the retailer in question, growth in Australia, growth in China, and growth in our business in Europe. So again -- I'm sorry, I can't give you a lot as much detail as you like on it, because we really have to wait until our customer discloses what they're doing with their retailing plan in 2015. But I'd like you to think about it as a manageable situation for us. Rob Koort : And just to clarify, you talked about EBIT growth at the corporate level or at the paint segment level? Gary Hendrickson : As we always do, Bob, we try not to talk about segment level EBIT. So I'm talking about overall company EBIT. Rob Koort : And can you tell me what you're appetite is for the pace of your repurchase that you might do, I mean, the scale of it is pretty substantial but it's open ended. So, how shall we expect last few years maybe 5% or 6% net reduction in share count? Is that a reasonable expectation going forward or do you think it will be a little more subdued than that? Jim Muehlbauer : Yes, Bob, it's Jim. We've not changed our view of share repurchases going forward. So what we've announced today really is a continued reflection of the past that we've been on over the last four or five years in adding shareholder value through share repurchases. So you shouldn't read into that a stepped up pace from share repurchase activity, and our publicly-stated goal is to reduce share as by 2% a year. As you pointed out, we've done a little better than that in the last several years. We'll do better than that next year, but I think at the high-end of the range you have here, that's a little bit more than we're currently planning for next year, so ordinary course of business repurchase authorization over the next few years. Rob Koort : Got it. Thanks very much. Jim Muehlbauer : Hey, the second thing I wanted just to clean up from Kevin's conversation, I believe I've mistakenly said that the growth in operating income was going to be less than our sales growth. What I intended to say, that for 2015, we expect to grow operating expenses less than our sales growth during the year. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Ivan Marcuse : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Real quick on the packaging coating, sort of your outlook for growth and lookout for 2015; do you expect that to continue to grow or do you expect that momentum to increase with the non-BPA continue to take hold the sort of your view there? Gary Hendrickson : Yes. Good morning, Ivan, it's Gary. Yes, our packaging product line had a great year in 2014. We're fortunate that with the exception of the North America market, we're seeing market growth in all of the regions in the world, and we've got our fair share of that market growth. Our target for this business has been for 20 years that I have been involved with packaging coating at Valspar to grow at least twice the market rate, and we feel like we did that this year. We did that through good execution as the leader. We have a lot of levels that we can pull in packaging coatings. We did that through good execution and the long relationships that we have with our customers delivering new technology and some pretty significant wins with our new non-BPA technology both in North America and in Europe. So, our outlook for 2015 is to continue to grow, and we'd be targeting as we always do growth of that lately two times market growth. Ivan Marcuse :  Great, but you're not expecting this is some sort of non-BPA or some reason -- give a little bit of a boost beyond what typical market growth is? Gary Hendrickson :  Yes, this year. They did in '14, and I'd expect that we'll see some tailwinds from that again in '15, Ivan. Ivan Marcuse : Great, thanks for taking my question. Gary Hendrickson :  You're welcome. Operator : . : Q \u2013 David Begleiter :  Thank you. Hey, Gary, just on gross margins, I know you were talking about benign raw materials environment in next year, but just go back to 2009 when raw materials dropped a lot, you saw substantial expansion in your gross margins and you're trying to be conservative about it. Why wouldn't we see at least gross margin expansion next year given that what we seen already on the oil side? Gary Hendrickson :  Yes, it's just hard to predict what beyond a quarter, David. So it's hard for us to predict what raw material cost will do. We look at the same macro data that you do and as I said to Kevin earlier supply and demand has a much larger role in our overall basket than the price of any particular commodity. So that's why we're remodeling in our guidance for the year relatively benign environment. Keep in mind too that if you look at our guidance for next year, you think about our gross margin, we're going to have an impact of this North America situation that we talked about, and that will be an offset to what might have been a bit more gross margin expansion than anyone would have expected. Q \u2013 David Begleiter :  Fair enough. I just find the increase in debt. You're going to increase your actually amount of debt next year or we're not giving some pay-off of existing short term. A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer :  Hey, David, it's Jim. By the year end next year, it will be up a little bit. In the near term, what we're essentially going to do is term out some of the commercial paper, what we're using today to manage the business. As you know we're using a large chunk of our annual cash flow after CapEx to repurchase the company's shares. Obviously that's a long-term commitment to the growing shareholder value. We want to match that with the favorable long-term credit environment that we see right now on the loan interest rates for the future. We've been out in the market about every two years with the debt offering, so this is just ordinary course of business. Q \u2013 David Begleiter : Thank you very much. A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer : Thanks, David. Operator :  Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Ghansham Panjabi :  Hey, guys, good morning. Happy thanksgiving week. Gary Hendrickson :  Same to you. Ghansham Panjabi :  Yes, thanks. Just on the quarterly earnings distribution for '15, obviously lot of moving pieces and did you call that the extra week for 4Q of next year, but 2014 also had a lot of moving parts with the Ace load-in and the SG&A movement around et cetera. So anything we should keep in mind, Jim as we kind of think through the quarterly distribution for the year? A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer :  First, congratulations on having an excellent memory, because you correctly pointed out a number of the drivers we'll be up against next year. One of the benefits of having a growing business is that we have got the opportunity to invest in new business, add significant amounts of volume that results in load-in patterns with retailers. If we look into next year, you're correct, Ghansham, that we are going to anniversary a lot of those activities. We're going to have pressure on volumes in the first half of the year in our Paints segment, because we were loading in the branded Valspar Paint at Ace during the first half of the year. So that's going to put some pressure on the top line. You'll also recall that we had the highest level of EBIT performance in Q1 of last year in the Paints segment, because we really hadn't matched that volume with the investment spending in promotional and marketing support that happens during paint season. So we're looking at the growth for next year to be more focused in the back half of year from the front half of the year, and Q2 is probably going to be one of our bigger challenges in total, just given the volume load-ins we had in advance for paint season in both the --primarily the North American business. As we get into the back half of the year, we'll see the roll over benefits of the initiatives that we have both in B&Q and Ace and we'll continue to see further expansion from the strong performance on our coatings businesses. Ghansham Panjabi :  Okay that's helpful. And just to clarify your 2Q -- for your fiscal year 2Q is when you'll see the impact \u2013- will start seeing the impacts from the market shares, correct? A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer :  Yes, I think we'll see a little bit potentially at the mid end of Q1 here, but most of that will start in Q2. Ghansham Panjabi :  Okay. And then switching to packaging, if you could just give us some feedback on your technology on non-BPA coating the customers are sharing relative to some of the other alternatives that would be helpful too, thanks. A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer :  Sorry, I don't hear you. Could you pass that question again, Ghansham? Ghansham Panjabi :  Yes, just on packaging, just your feedbacks from customers on your technology for non-BPA coating particularly in the food can side versus some of the other alternatives that are out there? A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer :  I think our customers would say that we're leading. Ghansham Panjabi :  Okay, thanks. Operator :  Thank you. We go next to the line of P. J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. P. J. Juvekar:  Yes, hi good morning. China seems to be slowing and Australia is heavily depended on China. But you're quite bullish on those two countries given that you already gaining share there. so can you talk about competitive landscape in those two countries in architectural paints that is allowed you to gain share? Gary Hendrickson :  Yes, P. J. It's Gary. First, I'll talk about Australia first. We've owned Wattyl for several years now. And really for the first three years, we were focused on fixing what was fundamentally a broken business. And it was broken in many different ways; operationally, cost-wise, relationships with customers weren't good, distribution was not right, there were some product issues. We had lots and lots of problems. We fixed those problems now. And for the last five quarters, we've been taking share, and this is independent third-party data from the Australian Paint Manufacturing Federation that says that our Wattyl team has been taking share in both DIY and the pro. So we expect in Australia that trend will continue. We also believe that at a minimum, the Australian housing market has bottomed out and is starting to improve. Their data points would suggest that the market is improving somewhat. We have the ability to grow our business now because of the changes that we've made and the very positive improvement that we've made both in our business model and our team there. We feel like we have the opportunity to grow into that market. At retail, in particular, our success with Masters and the partnership we've with Masters has been fabulous. I can't quote the exact number, but the vast majority of the paint that's sold in a Master store is the Valspar brand or one of the Wattyl brand, and Masters will continue to build out their stores. We'll have the benefit of the stores that were set halfway through '14 carrying over into '15. So we expect to be growing in the retail side, in the independent hardware channel, excuse me, in the big box channel. And in the independent hardware channel, which is the third channel in Australia, we've had some market share wins in '14 that we're carrying into '15. So, our competitive position in the Australian market is very strong, and as I said, we believe that the housing market is recovering somewhat. In China, it's true that the growth rate in China if you believe 7.5 or so GDP growth, it's lower than it used to be, but it's still 7.5% GDP growth. And recently the Chinese government has reinitiated their support for the housing market in China. This is a potentially large change for us. For the last four years at least the China government has not been supporting housing. This would be the first year that our team has the tailwinds of a China government in a long time that has tailwinds of the China government that's supporting the housing market. We think the macro in China is good, but we've grown roughly double-digits for the last four years or so, even in an environment where the housing market wasn't in a great shape, and we've done that through increasing our point of distribution with our exclusive retail. I think you know that we opened up nonexclusive distribution. We have something like, Bill, what's the number, 4000 to 5000 points of distribution, that we didn't have a few years ago for our affordable housing products that go through nonexclusive distribution. And in the project channel, which is the basically the direct sale to big housing projects, we've gone from a very small base to a reasonable sized business in the last few years. So in all channels in the Chinese market we're having success as well, and we believe that the housing market is going to be supported by the government for a while. So, probably a longer answer than you wanted, but you asked for it, P. J. P. J. Juvekar: Thank you. I appreciate that. And just one quick question on your U.S. business that you lost; it seems that your customer gives you business for a full year and for next couple of years it gives business to your competitor to keep everybody at a balanced and fair. Is that the right way to think about it? Gary Hendrickson : I don't think that's the driver. I mean, retailers are always trying new things. I mean, they've -- consumer tastes are changing -- are constantly changing, and retailers are constantly trying new things to adapt to changing consumer taste, and they're trying new things to bring more customers into the store. And I think that's the real basis for which for the retailer making a change in the product line. P. J. Juvekar: Okay, thank you. Gary Hendrickson : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning, guys. If you look at the sales in the paint store, what kind of volumes you're expecting ex the loss of this one piece of business next year in your guidance? Jim Muehlbauer : Yes, Duffy, it's Jim. We're not going to break out the detail volumes by the channels in our business next year as we said. This is going to put some pressure on our growth trajectory in paints in total next year, primarily driven by the North America business. We're going to be able to offset some of that pressure, with the growth that Gary described in Australia, China and certainly does continue to roll out as B&Q. But, yes, we're not going to get into the detail around the volumes in the North American channel. Duffy Fischer : But would -- I mean, would North American volumes and general store continue to grow ex this one piece of business that you lost, I mean, from a volume standpoint. Is that fair to assume? Jim Muehlbauer : Yes. That's kind of the -- Duffy, that's the point I made earlier when I was speaking with Kevin about a reset base, I think about this as a reset base. So we lose some business that we set the base, and we expect that all of the other products around that lost product like at this retailer will grow -- we expect that will grow eight volumes next year. And we expect it will grow volumes with the other 5000 or so independent retailers that -- the small retailers that we do business with. Duffy Fischer : Okay, great. And the two issues that are a little bit of a hit issue, obviously the loss of that piece of a business and then the interest rates step up, how should we think about the hangover from those two things as we get into '16. It feels like these will start to roll in probably in near Q2, so maybe we have one quarter of annualization [ph] when we get to 2016. Is that the right way to think about both of those? Gary Hendrickson : Yes. I think that's right. I think a vast majority of the business change in North America will be this year while this little tail on in Q1 next year, and same as through for the step up in the interest expense. Duffy Fischer : Okay, great. And then just a last one on the BQ business, you mentioned you are in 300 stores there. I mean, just give us a rundown how is that going both from a penetration standpoint and then from kind of an operations profitability standpoint relative to your original expectations? Gary Hendrickson : Okay. Well, it's -- we're a little bit slower in rolling the program out than we originally thought and that's because these are large format stores at B&Q are more complex to reset than both parties thought. But we expect to have all of the stores is that at the end -- by the end of this year, it'll be 350 stores. And this was a deluded program last year; it will be an accretive program this year. What changes this year is that after we get all 350 stores set, we turn on marketing. So that will be more expense in the business, in 2015. So we'll be selling though our paint at 350 stores and so we have the gross margin dollars to support the expense. So the business starts to look like a normal business and 2015 up here's another way to say that. And you asked about customer acceptance or how is it performing. This is a tinted program. We essentially brought in the same type of a program that we use with retail. Retailers in North America, where consumers have a lot more color choice and retailers carry a lot less inventory because we tint our products up of base colors. And so we set a goal and we're at the point now we're at the tinting processes within that store, is about two racks what it formally was in the stores that are set. And again, that's before we turned on any marketing, any promotion. So, we expect that the program I think our retail partner believes that the program is going to be very successful and hit all the metrics or receive the metrics that we set out in the beginning. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thanks, fellas. Gary Hendrickson : You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to the line of John McNulty at Credit Suisse. John McNulty : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, in the coating segment, if I recall ex acquisitions, you saw a 11% sales growth in and kind of high single-digit volume growth. Should we assume that the rest of that is price mix around the packaging business or are there other parts that are helping to carry some of that weight as well? Jim Muehlbauer : Yes, John, it's Jim. Most of that is volume. Price mix, as Gary talked about before is been relatively about benign for us. We'd certainly done better given the mix shift a little bit more heavy packaging, but a vast majority of the volume improvement across each of the coatings businesses. John McNulty : Okay. Gary Hendrickson : Someone asked me this question last call. All of the businesses that we have in our coating segment, our all the product lines are very profitable. Our profitable product lines are to at this point in time. Some products within those product lines are more profitable in the overall average and that's where we get out mix benefit, it's not necessarily we're selling more of one product line or another but it's the mix within the product line there that can be helpful and that was the case in this quarter. John McNulty : Okay, fair enough. And then it does sound like a lot of the volume growth came from some wins on the BPA free coating side. Where there any other big pockets where volumes were noticeably higher than kind of the industry growth rates or growth rates that you're servicing that we should be thinking about? Gary Hendrickson : All are packaging, the packaging growth rate in general was higher than the industry. It was at least two ex the industry growth rate. Everywhere with the exception of Asia where I think we grew probably more or less at the market growth rate for some unique challenges that we had this year, but we still grew the business double-digits and I think next year will be even better, but it was just solid growth across virtually all the product lines and all of the segments within each of those product lines. It was just a good quarter all around. John McNulty : Okay, fair enough. And then just with regard to the North American paint market, would you say the competitive environment has changed over the past few years or is it basically kind of the same? Gary Hendrickson : Well, we -- I mean, the industry structure has obviously changed with Axel no longer in the picture. So that's been a significant change. I wouldn't -- beyond that I wouldn't say that it's changed significantly, John. John McNulty : Okay. So it's not that it's more aggressive of a less aggressive that part seems like it's relatively stable? Gary Hendrickson : Yes. John McNulty : Okay. Thanks very much for the time. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Don Carson : Yes. You talked earlier about B&Q but I wanted to ask you question on your other retail growth initiatives, Lowe's, Pro, and Ace first off. I assume Lowe's Pro is still a program you'll have next year, that's not the one you lost, but I know the past you talked about that being a $125 million opportunity, Ace being a 150 million. So do you think you'll hit that run rate in 2015 and in what incremental accretions should we expect from those initiatives next year? Gary Hendrickson : I think we'll be at our run rate at Ace. The run rate that we said would be about a $150 million in 2015, we will be at that run rate and that will be more accretive than the year we had a partial year of dilution at Ace in '14, Don, so the full year next year, we'll be accretive at Ace. And our business -- Pro business that Lowe's grew in the year, and I expect that it will grow next year. Don Carson :   Okay. And then in terms of your mix that sounds like paints that you must have lost a high-priced business because you're talking about revenue, I think being up more or up less rather than volume once again next year. Is that -- am I interpreting that correctly? Gary Hendrickson :  Yes, I'm not going to say it, Don. That's too specific. I'm just going to stick with my language, which is at least my customer would expect two years which is to say that it's a partial reset of your line-up. Don Carson :  All right, okay. Thank you. Gary Hendrickson :  Thanks, Don. Operator :  We go next to the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Matt Grainger :  Hi, this is Matt Grainger on behalf of Vincent. I was wondering if you could speak more to what you're seeing on the ground in Europe and the drivers of differentiation there between your success and the broader macro environment. A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson :  Sorry, Matt, I missed your -- I was taking the notes and I missed your name. It's Gary, sorry. So our business in Europe, just to make sure that everyone is clear what I'd think about it. It's a packaging business and an industrial business. A large very successful packaging business where we feel like we're differentiating particularly on non-BPA products and our Europe packaging business last year had a fantastic year. The other parts of our businesses our industrial business which is a combination of Inver, the business that we acquired in 2013, and our legacy business which is a general industrial and coil business. We integrated Inver last year. We optimized the supply chain. We organized our sales force. We did a lot of good things and complicated things. And in the midst of all that, the leadership there grew the business and made the business more profitable. So we feel like we're very well-positioned in Europe market now in packaging and industrial. And the third part of our business is B&Q, which we talked about with previous callers. Matt Grainger :  Great. Thanks, folks. I'll leave it there. A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson :  Thanks. Operator : We go next to the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Dmitry Silversteyn : Good morning, guys. Couple of questions if I may; first of all, your general industrial was up double-digits in the quarter which is quite strong and probably little bit stronger than the market overall, especially from what I'm understanding is the Ag business continues to drag in terms of capital equipment and probably will continue to do so in 2015. So how do you look at your general industrial business in 2015 in terms of our deltas in Ag getting easier to overcome with the growth in another general industrial businesses, or is there something specific sort of beyond the Inver or maybe the Inver brought you that allows you to grow faster than the market? A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson :  Dmitry, now we had a rally strong year and a really strong quarter in China. That was the region of our general industrial business that grew the most and influenced the overall product lien results. Europe was good, North America, I wouldn't say that we probably grew in line with the market. Europe, I think we probably grew a little bit faster than the market. So you take those three factors together -- and Latin America is a small business for us. So U.S. at the market, Europe grew faster than the market, and Asia, a phenomenal quarter that we got the double-digits. Dmitry Silversteyn :  What was the phenomenal -- I mean that's my question I guess. Did we get through sort of the worst of the impact of the drivers that cause your 2013 to be a down year in terms of general industrial and the Ag and mining equipment sales? Is the anniversarying event or the improvement in that market, what's behind this strong result? A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson :  We've had a very successful few years, Dmitry expanding our penetration into the heavy equipment market in China. And we're doing our bulk of business, a number of customers that we do business with in that market today is much larger than it was a couple of years ago. Many of the local players in the China market are now customers of Valspar. I wouldn't call a rebound in the Ag and construction market anywhere. Some of the plants that we weren't doing business are the multinationals -- customers that we have been not running their plants in 2013; we're running plants in 2014. But there are pretty reduced rates. It felt kind of like an inventory fill rather than you just topping the inventory rather than any significant rebound. So now the results in general and industrial, keep in mind, in general and industrial we have in China we have Ag and construction, we have pipe and rebar and we have our container business, and remember that we started at the Maersk container line last quarter, sorry, two quarters ago and our third quarter, and that line is running more less at operational rates now. So we got to benefit from that as well. Dmitry Silversteyn : That's helpful, Gary. Thanks. And then one follow-up question on the Australian business, you described sort of the efforts that went into fixing Wattyl, I think at one time this was like a free percent operating margin which you got up to about 6% and then you started seeing volume growth in the past quarters and it got up into double digit range. What's your expectation for 2015 margin for that business as the growth continues? Can it approach the low timid teams you're seeing in your North American paint business? A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson :  I think that might be one year early. That's what we're expecting for 2106, Dmitry. Next year we're going to be close to consistently double digit EBIT margin rates. Thanks. Dmitry Silversteyn :  Got it. I mean in a little bit of growth almost doubling your margins next year is still a pretty strong earnings driver from the way I look at it, at least. A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson :  Well, we're not calling a doubling of earnings in Australia. We finished a little bit higher than you think I think you think we did this year. Dmitry Silversteyn :  Okay, all right. Okay, thank you. Operator : We go to the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Nils Wallin : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just curious how much the Australia and/or the China market can grow before you need to make further investments to fulfill that market need? A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson : Nils, we worked fine in Australia. They can roll a lot before we -- I don't know the exact number, but we have plenty of capacity in Australia. In China, you may recall that we announced 18 months or so ago that we're building a new plant in Tianjin, that plant is still under construction and that's to support the future growth of our consumer business than in some of our industrial businesses. So it will be another couple of years at least before we need another plant in China. Q \u2013 Nils Wallin :  Understood. I know that obviously it's still fairly early on the B&Q roll out and seeing how that goes but certainly there is a lot of opportunity there into the Kingfisher store. So curious whether its months or years before there might be a decision to expand into the Kingfisher as well? A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson :  Well, it's not our decision to make. So I really can't call that one. We are focused now this year is to execute extremely well at the end Q. and we think if we do that there would be other retailers possibly Kingfisher that would like us to do something with them in Europe. Q \u2013 Nils Wallin : Understood. And then just finally we haven't spoken other than Inver, when lapping that, but not a lot of M&A recently and some of one of your competitors has spoken publicly of seeing some degree of acceleration. I'm curious what you see in terms of pipeline and where you're most excited whether in coatings or in paints? A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson :  I don't know that necessarily that -- we'd say there has been an acceleration. We're talking to a lot of people and we will continue to talk to a lot of people. I'd say it's probably more there lot more -- there's a lot more fragmentation in the industrial markets than there is in paint market. So I'd suggest that you'd see more consolidation in that industrial market. We did do one a couple of weeks ago. You may not record it. That was a small one that we have acquired a company in Canada that's in pipe coating industry, a very well-respected 30-40 year old company with global approval for the water pipe and water infrastructure market, which is the tuck in for our pipe coating business that we think is going to be very good for our sales and our customers. Q \u2013 Nils Wallin :  Understood. Thanks very much for the color. Bill Seymour : Operator, this will be the last question, and then Gary will have some closing comments afterwards. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks, guys. I guess coatings were fast, it looks like you really broader margins there. What's going to drive further margin expansion in that business operating at historical peaks? Gary Hendrickson : Arun, it's going to be that growth, and the operating leverage, and other benefits that we get from growth. So as I said on this call and several other occasions, if we can maintain these margin rates, which I believe we can, and continue growing the business, then we're going to -- that growth is going to be very accretive to Valspar's bottom line. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. And then just to clarify, what are some of the -- couple, maybe one or two assumptions that you have that will push you to the bottom end or the upper end of your guidance range for next year? Thanks. Jim Muehlbauer : Yes. Arun, it's Jim. Clearly without getting into detail, the eventual sales volume for next year is obviously the biggest driver in how we'd perform overall, plus what we may or may not see in the raw material environment next year, up, flat, down, that's going to be probably the second biggest driver of the mix. Apart from that, we obviously have the most control over. These are variable spending. And we as always toggle that as best we can with the long-term goal of continuing to drive value for our shareholders. So I really say sales trends from a macro standpoint and commodities environment being the two biggest drivers in our range. Arun Viswanathan : Okay, thanks. Gary Hendrickson : Arun, thanks for setting up my closing comment. Let me sum up the call by explaining why we're confident about our 2015 guidance. First, our strong momentum in 2014 will continue into 2015. The U.S. economy is improving, and that bodes well for our general, industrial, and coil coatings. And improving U.S. housing markets is good for all of our paint business, and all of our retail customers in the U.S. and for our wood coatings product line. Additionally, as we talked about on the call, the sectors we serve in Australia and China housing markets are growing. So, in an improving environment we have a full fiscal year of Valspar paints at Ace, B&Q, and Masters, and at Lowe's Valspar Reserve has been an outstanding success, and we'll continue to grow next year and beyond. Our coatings business also has good momentum, particularly in Europe and Asia as I mentioned with Dmitry, and the shift to non-BPA coatings in Europe and North America is a plus for our packaging product line. Thus we expect to continue to take market share. On the cost side of the ledger, we expect carryover benefits from the productivity programs in 2014. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll be implementing new productivity and cost reduction programs in 2015. And we'll have fewer shares outstanding as more shares are purchased as part of our buyback authorization. So I'll conclude by saying that Valspar is in great shape, and all of our employees are looking forward to another year of growth in 2015. Thanks for your time today. I hope you have a happy thanksgiving, and we look forward to seeing you next week in New York at our Investor Day. Operator : Thank you.

Welcome to Valspar's First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Bill Seymour. Please go ahead. Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations : Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2015 first quarter earnings call. We have two speakers today, Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Muehlbauer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll have plenty of time to take your questions. Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valspar.com. Also please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report in our Form 10-Q. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release. And finally we have posted a new supplemental slide presentation to the IR site, which includes commentary on our first quarter results and historical data for fiscal 2014. We will provide this in future quarters as well. With that, I will turn the call over to Gary. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today I'll cover some of the highlights of our first quarter performance. Jim will then provide some additional details on the quarter's financials and our outlook for the year. We're pleased to report a good start to the year. Sales increased 4% and adjusted EPS was up 21%. These results reflect continued growth in both sales and profitability in our Coatings segment, benefits from new business wins, strong performance from China and the positive impact of our ongoing productivity initiatives. Like most multinational companies in the U.S., the strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our results for the quarter. Q1 sales growth in local currency was up 7%. We've not changed the full year outlook in local currency terms, but the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar has led us to modestly revise our sales outlook for 2015. Jim will take you through that later. Now I'll cover some specific highlights for the quarter. I'll start with our Coatings segment, which had another very strong quarter. In fact all product lines and regions grew both volume and sales even with the currency headwinds. EBIT in our Coatings segment also increased significantly in the quarter as a result of leveraging higher volumes and internal productivity initiatives. Some highlights include very strong volume growth in our general industrial and wood product lines driven by new business wins and market share gains. Our coil product line also benefited from new business wins. In our packaging product line, we continue to grow our sales and market share in all regions and in the non-BPA segment of the market. Looking at our Coatings segment from a geographic point of view, all regions grew, with growth in China being particularly strong. Turning now to our Paints segment, volumes increased and sales were up modestly in local currency. Strong volume growth in our international regions was partially offset by the expected softness in North America. So let me provide a little bit of additional context on Paints sales in Q1. As you may recall, we had a very good first quarter in the Paints segment in 2014, when total Paints sales were up 10%. This growth was driven by the rollout of Valspar-branded paint at Ace Hardware. And our paint business in China was up more than 30% in the first quarter last year. In the quarter we just completed, we faced those tough comparisons and we also began to see the impact from the previously disclosed adjustment to our product line offering at Lowe's. That being said, our international regions in Paints performed very well. As I mentioned earlier, our overall business in China was strong and our paint business was no exception. Volumes in China were up almost 10% against the extremely strong comparisons in 2014. In the UK and Ireland, the Valspar Paint program has now been set in all 350 B&Q stores. And during the quarter, we began shipping to B&Q from Europe as a result of a recently completed manufacturing agreement. We're excited to be in all stores, and we'll begin our advertising program as we move into the spring. In Australia, we continue to see good growth at both Masters and the Pro channel. At Masters we're benefiting from strong sell through of new products and Master store growth. In our trade business, sales to professional painters were up in the high single-digits in the quarter in local currency, and we continue to grow share in this channel. Into North America, we're looking forward to the first full year with Ace Hardware. In addition of Valspar being Ace's national paint brand, Ace has recently chosen Cabot as their national stain brand. Cabot will now be available in over 1,500 Ace stores starting in the spring. In the North America home improvement channel, we're looking forward to the paint season and growing the Valspar brand of a reset base. We continue to have a very strong product line up at Lowe's that spans price points and categories. At the high end, Valspar Reserve continues to sell very well and in the Pro category, we continue to make inroads. We have an excellent relationship with Lowe's and look forward to continuing the successful growth of the Valspar Paint brand in this channel. So in summary, we're pleased with the solid start and are optimistic about the rest of the year. Our first quarter results once again demonstrates the diversity and strength of our business portfolio. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide more details on the results and outlook. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Thanks, Gary and good morning everyone. I will review our first quarter performance and discuss our expectations for the balance of fiscal 2015. I'll focus my comments this morning on the key drivers in the quarter. As Bill noted, we've posted some additional details on our segments and product line performance on our website. Starting first with our Q1 performance highlights, sales increased 4% and volumes were up 7%. The impact of FX lowered sales by approximately 3% in the quarter. Sales improved 7% in local currency. Our Coatings segment delivered a very good quarter. Segment sales increased 7% and grew 10% in local currency. Volumes increased 10% in the quarter and reflected improved momentum from Q4, when Coating volumes were up 5%, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. Volume was up in all Coatings product lines. General industrial sales and volumes were up double-digits, driven primarily by new business wins in Asia and in the U.S. Wood product line sales and volumes were also up double-digits in the first quarter. This growth was the result of new business wins and market share gains within the Asia market. The coil product line had another strong quarter with volumes and sales up mid-single digits. Growth in coil was also driven by new business wins. The packaging product line also continued to grow with volumes and sales up mid-single digits in the quarter. Sales in local currency were up high-single digits, reflecting solid growth in all regions. Moving on to the Paints segment, total sales decreased 1%, but sales were up 2% in local currency. Total volumes increased 5% driven by double-digit volume increases in China, Australia and Europe. China growth was driven by market share gains in the non-exclusive retail channel, where we increased our distribution points by 1,400 locations. In Australia, volume growth was driven by growth at Masters, and in our stores business. And in Europe, the significant volume growth was driven by the rollout of Valspar Paint across the remaining B&Q stores. The increased volume from international was partially offset by a single digit decline in North America. This decline was the result of the two items that Gary touched on earlier. First, we had very difficult comparisons to Q1 last year when North America Paint volumes were up over 15%. These very strong results included the initial shipments of Valspar-branded Paints to Ace in the first quarter of last year. Second, in Q1 this year, we began to experience the impact of the adjustment to our product line offering at Lowe's. Both of these factors were included in our plan assumptions for the year. In Q2, the difficult comparisons will continue, given the new product rollouts to Ace Hardware and from the launch of Valspar Reserve last year. In addition, the impact from the adjustment in our product line offering at Lowe's will increase in the balance of the year as this transition fully occurs. Moving on to gross margin, we finished the quarter with total adjusted gross margin of 34.1%, essentially flat to last year. Improvements from productivity initiatives and leverage from higher volume were offset by unfavorable product mix, primarily in the Paints segment. Looking at expenses in Q1, adjusted OpEx in the first quarter decreased 40 basis points to 22.4% of sales. Operating expense dollars increased 2%, driven by increases related to higher sales, partially offset by productivity initiatives and the impact of FX. Bringing it all together, consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 9% and EBIT margins increased 60 basis points to finish at 11.8% in the first quarter. In the Coatings segment, adjusted first quarter EBIT of $91 million increased 16%. The increase in EBIT was primarily the result of significantly higher volumes in the quarter, along with the benefits from our productivity initiatives. In the Paints segment, adjusted EBIT of $29 million was down 16% from the prior year. As I discussed earlier, our Paints segment was up against a difficult comparison to last year, when sales were up 10% and EBIT was up 50%. The decrease in EBIT in the first quarter of this year, was primarily driven by the impact of the initial shipments of Valspar at Ace and very strong results in China last year. Q1 EBIT was also impacted by the customer product line adjustments that I referenced earlier. Moving on to a couple of other items in the quarter, our Q1 adjusted tax rate of approximately 29.5% improved 340 basis points driven primarily by favorable tax credits and the geographic mix of our earnings. We continue to expect that our annual tax rate will be between 31% and 32% for fiscal 2015. Q1 reported results included a pre-tax gain on the sale of assets of approximately $48 million. This gain was from the sale of assets, primarily IP, related to a non-strategic product in our Coatings segment. The gain has been excluded from our adjusted results for Q1. This sale will have an insignificant impact on sales and operating results in the fiscal year. On our Q4 call, we discussed plans to issue new long-term debt in fiscal 2015. In the first quarter, we issued $500 million of debt, which included $250 million in 10-year notes and $250 million in 30-year notes. As a reminder, our fiscal 2015 guidance reflects approximately $75 million in annual interest expense. Wrapping up the highlights for the quarter, we paid $25 million of dividends representing a per share increase of 15% and repurchased 983,000 shares of our company stock for a total investment of $84 million. With this as context on Q1, let's move on and discuss the outlook for the balance of fiscal 2015. We continue to expect annual adjusted EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.65. Let me provide you a little more color on a few components of this guidance. First, as you saw on the release today, we modestly lowered our annual sales guidance to approximately flat sales compared to fiscal 2014. This compares to our previous guidance of growth in the low single-digits. This adjustment reflects the impact of a stronger dollar on our sales outside the U.S. As you know, over the past few months the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many key currencies. The assumptions utilized in our original guidance from November did not reflect these recent changes. Second, in terms of phasing for the year, our plans continued to reflect that the Paints segment will be up against more challenging comparisons in the second quarter from the continued rollout of both Valspar Paint at Ace and the launch of Valspar Reserve last year and from the product line changes at Lowe's. In closing, our Q1 results reflect strong performance and execution. It's early in the year, but we're off to a good start and remained focused on delivering on our full-year performance goals. With that we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Operator : We'll first go to the line of Michael Klein with Piper Jaffray. Go ahead. Michael A. Klein - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi. Good morning. General industrial grew faster than the market, can you talk about what you're seeing in the end-markets to support continued growth and maybe provide some color around the types of productivity initiatives that we can expect as the year progresses? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Mike, it's Gary. Good morning. Yes, we had a really strong quarter in general industrial, which followed a good year last year. So we're seeing good growth in our pipe business, our partnership with Maersk in container is proceeding well and that plant in China is up running full time. And we also saw extremely good growth in the construction and off-road segment in China. So China was a pretty significant driver of the really solid results that we saw in general industrial, as well as I mentioned the pipe coatings globally. So we are always \u2013 relative to productivity, I mean I can't give you a \u2013 I won't you give a specific comment except to say that every one of our product lines and businesses has productivity goals for the year, and there is a whole spectrum of things that they could do to achieve that productivity from restructuring on the one hand through many other activities around Lean Six Sigma. So productivity, we have a saying at Valspar that it's productivity forever and there are many, many things that are aggregated into that catch phrase. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Mike, it's Jim. Just to add on to Gary's comments, from a productivity standpoint, you may recall, we did some restructuring activities last year that were provided as a result of the Inver opportunity. So in the general industrial business, we're able to lower some of our manufacturing cost with those restructuring activities, and that's some of the benefits that we're realizing in the P&L now. Michael A. Klein - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Sure. Okay. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, can you talk about the impact from low oil prices and how much of the potential benefit you think you can capture? I don't think you have many long-term sales contracts in Coatings. So I would assume those conversations are pretty fluid with customers? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, to the last part of your question, I mean it's a natural question for a customer to ask, given the headline of crude prices that are substantially lower than they were. But I'll say this, in Q1 we saw de minimis raw material benefits. The reason for that is that our raw material basket is not weighted heavily to oil based materials, and in fact only a small portion of our basket is linked directly to oil. We buy complex chemistries that are well down the process and value stream from crude oil. So supply and demand is much more determinant of our raw material cost than the price of crude. Even the relatively small amount of materials linked to crude, there's a lag between the price of crude declining and a price change in the downstream commodity. So that's the past up until now. Looking forward for the balance of the year, we would expect to see a modest benefit if a lower oil price is sustained and the way we're thinking about that is potentially a low single-digit decline in overall basket for the rest of the year. Michael A. Klein - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): All right. Thank you very much. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And next we go to the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital. Go ahead please. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I had, so you mentioned a lot about new business wins. How much of your growth was driven by I guess new business wins versus organic if there is any way to split it out? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't know Ivan. We have a metric that we track internally, which we call net new business, which is business won by business lost. And in the quarter that number was approaching high single-digits for us. So how much of that is organic growth and how of it is new, it's really hard to tell with thousands of customers. But my guess is, it's maybe 5% of it was new business and 2% was market, something like that. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And then, Jim, you mentioned when you gave your outlook in November about FX being an impact on EBIT. So how much has that increased? And how much did you see it impact I guess in the quarter and now sort of your outlook for the full year versus when you gave the guidance in November? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Sure. Well, if you recall back in November, Ivan, we talked about the impact of FX that was embedded in our guidance of roughly 2.5% to 3% for the year. As we look now and we see where rates have gone, that number is probably looking more like 4% to 5%. So as Gary mentioned, we felt it prudent to take down our top-line expectations for the year based on the expected changes in FX, but we're still marching due to the same local currency plans we have for sales in each of our businesses. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So is there not a change in your, I believe, you gave an EPS impact? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yes. Clearly there is a flow through impact to the bottom line as well that we partially factored into our guidance, but we're going to have a little bit more headwinds from that. In the big scheme of things, given the fact that we're only in the first quarter, we've got a lot of business in front of us for the balance of the year. And we've got a $0.20 range in our EPS guidance. We think it's prudent at this point in time just to let the business play out and we'll update our view of the year as we get more business behind us. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And then last question, I'll jump back into queue. You mentioned that you're now sourcing supply from paint to go into B&Q. How much of a savings will that cause? And is it just basically a total agreement or did you have to build a plant or what's sort of the moving parts and how's that going to be impactful to B&Q's profitability going forward? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. It's a total agreement with a company in mainland Europe, Ivan. And I think we called it out. It's in the low single-digit millions of dollars in terms of freight savings that we'll achieve. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning. Could you give us a quick tutorial what actually happened in France with the BPA coatings in January? And it looks like the UK and some others are trying to sue them. Have people actually rolled over to non-BPA on coatings? And is there a chance that that goes back, or can you kind of just layout what is actually happening around France and maybe the contagion to that other areas? Or does it get put back in the bottle at the end of the day? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Duffy, it's Gary. On January 1 of this year a ban went into effect in France. So there are no BPA based coatings on cans being sold in France today. And I'm actually not familiar with what you referenced in terms of someone suing. I hadn't heard that, so I'll just tell you a little bit more about what I do know. What I know is that a fairly significant part of the food and general line market and other segments in Europe have started the conversion to non-BPA coatings. And with respect to beverage, there's been some conversion of beverage containers to non-BPA coatings as well. So I think you may have called it a contagion. I don't know I'd go that far but people are, brand owners are switching their coatings from epoxy-based coatings to non-BPA coatings in a pretty significant way across most of the packaging segments in Europe. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then, if you use that as a reference point, obviously you would have had some market share in the epoxy base before going to now the non-BPA or whatever the politically correct term is for it. How would your market shares compare kind of before and after in the sample set that we have so far? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Our market share on Europe it is materially higher than it was in the past. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you guys. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : In the segments that I just mentioned. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : And we'll now move to line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. And I appreciate the added disclosures and color in the slide that makes our lives a little easier. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Anything to make your life easy, Bob. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: What about \u2013 Gary, just what you are seeing on two counts around customer deferrals or maybe some deceleration; one, you mentioned raw materials haven't shown much relief for you yet. Is there a sense from your customers that maybe there could some coming? Have you seen any inventory destock in more raw material sensitive businesses? And then secondly, maybe across things like oil and gas and pipelines and maybe some of the end markets where there continues to be a little bit more challenge, have you seen any changes in order patterns there? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : No. the short answer is, no to both of your questions, Bob. I mean, it would be logical if crude pricing \u2013 natural gas pricing stays low for a long time, that you would see some projects laid off, but we certainly haven't seen that yet. And with your first question about supply chain, it looks like, most if not, all of our supply chains are behaving the way we would expect them to at this point in the year. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I think Gary you guys do sell some resins to other paint companies, adhesives companies, et cetera, have they demonstrated any behavior that would be consistent with expecting some help on pricing there? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. No, most of the paint companies are buying as we do. We don't buy inventory. We don't necessarily arbitrage the input costs versus carrying finished goods inventory. So I can't help you on this line of thinking because we just haven't seen it, Bob. Frankly I think it's because, as I mentioned when I answered Mike's question in the beginning is that we're not seeing a ton of change in our raw material basket yet. And I'm not certain that we will, and I think others are probably feeling the same way. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And if I might ask one last one, Jim you gave some indications that some of the year-on-year comps in North American paint were going to remain tough. How should we think about that relative to the year-on-year erosions you saw in the first quarter? Does it get greater, lesser? And how does it cycle through towards the end of the year? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yes. Bob, it's similar to my comments on the Q4 call. It's going to be more in Q2 for the following two reasons. We're going to continue to have the impact of the rollout that we did last year at Ace. We also loaded in some inventory at Ace last year in the second quarter to support promotional activities that they were announcing. And then you may recall we started to load in Valspar Reserve at Lowe's last year in the second quarter. So those two factors combined with the product line of change at Lowe's, we'll see a bigger impact of that in Q2 than we saw in Q1 because the transition was just starting at the end of Q1 on that product line. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yes. Thanks, Bob. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Dave Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Gary and Jim, given those headwinds in Q2, plus any weather impact potentially, could you grow earnings overall in Q2 year-over-year on EPS basis? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Hey Dave, its Jim. What we are focused on obviously is growing the business for the entire year. So we're going to be up against some challenges in Q2 in the Paints segment for the reasons that I just highlighted. So those challenges at this point aren't any greater than what we assumed in our planned guidance for the year. So we're going to have the most pressure on earnings in the second quarter for the top line items I talked about. But we're committed to delivering the year as originally outlined earlier based on what we see in the marketplace so far. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So would a flat year-over-year assumption for Q2 be reasonable? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Dave, we don't give quarterly earnings guidance. But what I'm trying to do is give you enough color, to shape your phasing to reflect the outcomes for the full year. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. And just on your Coating margins year-over-year were very strong up 120 basis points roughly. Would you expect the similar progression in Coatings margins year-over-year for rest of the quarters? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yes. The margin growth in Coatings is really been driven by the favorability of the higher volumes that we're experiencing and also the benefit of the productivity and restructuring initiatives that I talked about earlier. So those initiatives are going to continue, as we move into the year. We'll have a little bit of comparison pressure as we get later in the year, because we made some of those restructuring moves at the end of last year, but you know on balance we continue to feel like we're going to have a very nice run this year in the Coatings business and drive EBIT growth. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Thanks, Dave. Operator : We'll now go to the line of PJ Juvekar with Citibank. Go ahead. PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, hi. Good morning. So far you've talked about sort of limited raw material impact on your business. Gary, can you discuss how lower raw material prices impact each of your segments, sort of differentiate for us as it relates to the magnitude and timing on each segment? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm not going to do that PJ. As I said, we're not seeing it yet. So, I would be speculating \u2013 to answer that question will be pure speculation on my part. I said earlier that, I think that if we see sustained lower oil price and we're going to see some bleed through into our overall raw material basket in the low-single digits. But that's about as far as I think we can say at this point in time. PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And can you talk about historically, last time, when oil prices went down, whether you... Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that's interesting because the last time that we saw a decline like this was 2008-2009. And if you did the research, you probably have to model, you saw that margins for most coatings companies were up at that time, yet the interesting thing though is, you actually have to look back a little further than that and see that just prior to that big oil price decline, we had massive inflation in our raw material pricing and most coatings companies were out with pricing. I think the timing was such that pricing was hitting just as the price of oil was declining. And it may have looked to people like the margin expansion was due to a correction price of oil, when in fact that was not true. What was true was that pricing went through and improved coatings margins, at the same time that we randomly saw a reduction in the price of oil. So that's context. To answer your specific question, we would expect \u2013 I'll say it again this way, we would expect that if oil pricing remains depressed for a sustained period of time that we're going to see a modest benefit to our overall basket. PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I can't say more than that now because we haven't seen, we haven't ever seen a period of time when the oil price stayed low for a long time. Even back in 2008-2009, it was more or less a V-shaped recovery, it dropped from wherever it was to about $40 and then it started climbing pretty rapidly after that. PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Thank you for that. And just one more question from me on TiO2. The supplier seemed to be struggling with pricing, do you anticipate any pricing this year in TiO2? Thank you. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think TiO2 pricing is probably reached bottom and is pretty stable, and I don't expect any movement one way or another PJ. PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Company. Go ahead please. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning. It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good. Thank you. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. The 10% volume growth in Coatings was impressive. How sustainable is that number, it seems like it was mostly driven by new business wins, but was there any one-offs in the quarter worth noting? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : No, no material one-offs, it's really a continuation of the strength we experienced last year and as we highlighted during our prepared remarks, each of our product lines within the Coatings segment contributed to that growth. So I would not call out a specific one-off in that mix. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. And I appreciate the color on the progress of B&Q. Has there been any pushback from competitors, any new competitors there just given your push into the European market? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean, the only place that they could push back would be B&Q and there was some promotional activity a while ago, but I don't think that we're seeing anything unusual. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. And then just one last one. Do you expect Paint volumes overall for the year to be positive regardless of the North America share loss, just because of international growth that you're seeing? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yes. Well, it's difficult to grow the total volumes in the business, given the change that we talked about in North America. What we're focused on obviously, is continuing to drive the positive growth that we see in our international markets, and we'll have to just play though the rest of paint season in the North American business. But volume growth overall, we're not expecting material volume growth in the Paints segment, as a result of the changes in North America. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you so much. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yes. Thanks for your questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Can you remind me again, how much business on an annual basis you believe that you lost at Lowe's? And in the quarter, I imagine that this wasn't a stronger quarter because the transition is not entirely done. Can you sort of size how much that business was down in the quarter? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yes, Jeff, it's Jim. Just to remind you that the original expectation for the year, when we laid out guidance, we said that the net impact of the changes in the product line at Lowe's, we estimated to be about $150 million to $180 million sales impact to the business. I'm not going to go through kind of the quarter-by-quarter build on that, but as you correctly noted, that transition really just started to happen at the end of Q1 and those product sets are going to start moving into the Lowe's stores. So we did see some impact, but the impact will be much greater in each of the next three quarters as that transition fully takes place. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Are Cabot stains being deemphasized at Lowe's, and is there some sort of trade-off between Cabot going down at Lowe's and going up at Ace? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, we don't sell Cabot at Lowe's, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, is there any \u2013 do you expect any sequential price decreases in your coatings business or do you think that that would be pretty flat in the scheme of things? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : In aggregate, I would expect that it would be pretty flat. As I said, those price reductions come around two ways generally through competitive situations, which I would say the competitive dynamic in most of our markets is as it usually is. There's nothing unusual about this year. And for raw material reductions, and as I said, we may see some modest raw material reductions and our customers may ask to participate in that, and in fact, we will have a constructive conversation about what's there. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, lastly what's the revenue impact of the asset sale or the intellectual property sale, if there was one for 2015? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yes, Jeff, it's going to be really modest, probably a little less than $10 million. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : It was really a nonstrategic product line of the business. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Thanks for your questions, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Operator : We'll go now to the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Go ahead. Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Just had a question on your paints mix. Price mix was down 3%. It looks like your price mix was actually positive in North America because sales were down less than volume. So is the negative price mix just the fact that as international sales grow, that tends to be at lower price points? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yes, two things, Don. From a total Paints segment standpoint, biggest impact on price mix is that last year in the first quarter, we were selling in a much higher, richer mix of Valspar branded product at Ace, which has got higher price points. Second piece as you noted is as we have been successful in growing our international business, the price points on those products, especially in China, are lower than our average for the segment, so the combination of the two of those is what drove the negative price mix variance. Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : To follow-up on coatings, you mentioned the container initiative with Maersk. You haven't talked about that for a while. Where are we in that whole container coatings cycle? You had outlined quite a drop from peak to trough recently. Are we starting to see a recovery there or is it just that you're getting better economics with onsite manufacturing now? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Don, this is Gary. I don't think much has changed in terms of overall demand for containers. But with Maersk, we're up and running and that's a significant factory and it's a big factory, and it's consuming $30 million, $40 million worth of coatings on its own. And one interesting dynamic that's occurred is that the Chinese government has levied a tax on solvent-based materials in some areas where container manufacturers are operating, and we think that's a net benefit for us as our Aquaguard material is a water-based product. So there is a bit of renewed interest from some customers that we are not currently doing business with. They've been trialing our water-based material as a consequence of that solvent tax. So, we're still sanguine about the container industry in the long-term, but it's not robust at the moment. Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley : Hi. This is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. To clarify, in regards to the guidance range being maintained, but full year sales are now expected to be lower than previously anticipated. I'm wondering if you could clarify how your perspective on margins might have changed. Is there any expectation of raw materials embedded at this point? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yes. Once again, it's Jim. It's early in the year. We took the top line down, just given the changes in FX. And just want to highlight, we're at the end of the first quarter. As we look at the full year and the various puts and takes we see from a business and macro standpoint, our view in total hasn't changed materially. We have enough levers at this point in time in the year to manage within the guidance range we have. And as we get more business behind us and see how all the lines of the P&L perform, we'll be in a better position to judge what the full year impact is going to be. Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks. And then in regards to packaging, with some of your competitors taking more aggressive aim at non-BPA business inside of the can, I'm wondering if you've noticed any changes in the competitive landscape there. And then at what point would mean reversion be possible in terms of your multiple of growth to the overall can consumption? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : I mean anything is possible. But we feel very comfortable with our leadership position in non-BPA coatings. As I said earlier, our market share in Europe as an example was materially higher than it was before the start of the transition. So we feel like we're leading and we're not going to comment on this call specifically about competitors, but the packaging business is a large global segment. And there are others that would like to be in it, and would love to have the position that we have. Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go now to line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Go ahead. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just a follow-up on that last question. I mean you've been gaining share in packaging fairly consistently through this BPA transition, as well as before, and I understand not all the gains are BPA related. You're already a market leader, so it stands to reason that at some point your growth rate will start approximating more market growth rate. How long of a runway do you think you have in packaging, where you can continue to materially outperform the market and your competitors? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think, if you went back to \u2013 Dmitry, it's Gary. If you went back to our Investor Day when we talked about packaging, we are a global market leader. But we're not the market leader in Europe, and we're not the market leader in Asia and Europe. But we are the market leader in North America, but in those two other markets we're not. And those other two markets combined are much larger than the North America market. So we've got a very long runaway ahead of us, as this non-BPA transition occurs, and frankly as the packaging market continues to grow. Our business, in the quarter, in Asia as an example was up 20%, which is about two times, at least two times the market growth. And that's not a non-BPA market, that's an epoxy market. So we feel good about our packaging business. We've got positive volume growth for 10 quarters in a row, significant volume growth in the last three quarters or four quarters and we expect that to continue for a while. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Very good. Just kind of circle back on the Australian paint market. We had a little bit of a recovery I guess, after a couple of years of some housing issues. But now it's \u2013 at least from what I'm reading, it looks like the housing market may be losing steam a little bit there. Currency obviously is going to be a significant headwind for you. Is it possible for you to maintain, the growth rates, that you've seen in your Australian business and more importantly, are you getting sort of the needed leverage, from volumes, and margins to where you are, getting close to your double-digit intermediate goal for that business? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think most of the growth that we've seen over the last number of quarters, and it's been five quarters or six quarters now at least, we've seen positive volume growth in Australia, Dmitry, has been through Masters. And so, to think about two channels, a retail channel and a paint stores channel, those are our two main channels. And Masters continuous to build stores and we continue to win shelf space at Masters, and which we've been growing there. And then on our stores business, we did a lot of things, two years, three years and four years ago that shrunk the size of our business, but they were the right things to do, to get to the cost structure that we needed and the right store footprint. And we're now starting to see the benefit of the things that we did and we're growing off of that reset base. So, I would \u2013 as we said, our stores business was up high single digits this quarter. My guess is that, most of that is market share wins, not market growth. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And as far as your margins goals in that business where are you versus sort of your plan, as you revised it and versus your long-term goals? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well. I would say that we're right on the glideslope. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : All right. Fair enough, Gary. One final question on general industrial, you talked about some of the strengths in the businesses including sort of the off-road and construction part of the market, agricultural and mining equipment markets continue to be fairly weak, they are \u2013 to my understanding, at least a meaningful portion of your general industrial business. Can you talk about what's going on there, sort of, both on year-over-year basis and sort of how the market feels going forward and what the upside could be, should that business recover in 2016? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, just to size it, Dmitry, that whole segment for us globally is about $125 million to $150 million segment, right. So it's reasonably big, but it's \u2013 we're a $4.5 billion company. So you've seen the headlines from our two main customers and they're projecting a pretty weak year ahead. We are going to feel the impact of that. But on the flip side, but they are not our only two customers. And so we're \u2013 we've had an initiative going on in China and in Europe post the Inver acquisition to expand our point of view on that whole market segment. And we're achieving some significant success both in China and in Europe, so in the quarter and last year in the face of declining agricultural equipment sales and construction equipment sales we are growing that business. So that's the way we think about it. We think that that team has got to grow through whatever weakness that occurs in that market, and we can do it, because we're not a huge player, $150 million is not significant in the context of a multibillion dollar overall global market. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, but thanks for sizing that business, because that's \u2013 that answers my second part of the question on what the recovery there can do for you. Thanks, Gary. That's all I had. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question will be from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Go ahead, please. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Thank you, and congratulation on a great first quarter. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Looking at packaging coatings, Gary, you had a very strong first quarter, but then the comparison with last year's \u2013 you know next three quarters and particularly the second half of the year, which showed a top line growth of 16% and 15% is becoming really quite difficult. Can you still grow year-over-year in the second half or are we more likely to have a flattish type of revenue? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I expect that business to grow in the second half, Rosemarie. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. And looking at paints, if we look at \u2013 considering Ace, considering Lowe's, and B&Q can it be down more than 5% year-over-year in what is becoming the strongest season and therefore the strongest impact on your top line? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yes, Rosemarie, it's Jim. As I mentioned earlier, as we look at total volumes for the year in our Paints segment, given the changes that we've seen in some of the North American businesses, it can be very difficult to grow total volumes significantly. With that said, we continue to expect strong volume growth in Europe, based on the initiatives at B&Q, continued volume growth in our business in Asia, as we expand the points of presence within the non-exclusive retail channel and grow the balance of the wall and room business, and as Gary just mentioned, based on the growth we continue to have from a market share standpoint in Australia. So, we're expecting solid gains internationally to be muted by the impacts in North America. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Thanks. And if may, regarding China are you doing a lot better than the market? Are you seeing some help from the government changes regarding the housing, pushing housing or at least helping housing or is it all your own, and we have yet to look forward to that particular tailwind? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I think, the results we've seen in the quarter are really driven by the expanded point of distribution in the non-exclusive channel. So adding 1,400 new locations is really about building share in that marketplace, less from recent announced changes around the Chinese government supporting the housing sector. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: So, you haven't seen anything, not even any signs of some kind of a tailwind coming your way? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I'm not personally close enough to know, but I see nothing material that has shown up in the first quarter results. Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thank you. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks for your questions, Rosemarie. Operator : And we'll move now to the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please go ahead. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. You mentioned certainly the effects of some of the restructurings you did last year flowing through this year, but curious as to any additional productivity programs you might be able to either enact this year and pull forward and how much of the overall productivity gains are likely to help you make your guidance for this year? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we've got our annual productivity assumptions that are built into our guidance as they always are every year. So we're going to continue to see benefits of some of those productivity restructuring initiatives, as we go on through the balance of the year. As we identify opportunities to improve our cost structure and improve customer service, we'll be happy to look at those future restructuring activities, but embedded in our guidance for this year is no material changes from new restructuring initiatives. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Yes, thanks. And then just in terms of Ace, I know that there was a differing levels of contribution between the Ace branded products and bringing in the Valspar brand. Would you help us know where you are right now in terms of the different shares and how much you think additional share gains by Valspar in the Ace retail channel could help your price mix? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, well, maybe to back up a little bit from a historical standpoint, talk about the mix of branded and private label just from a context standpoint. You may recall Nils when we introduced the Valspar relationship with Ace, we initially started providing them just private label products in the first \u2013 really first three quarters of our relationships. So, we were closer to \u2013 we were a 100% private label that point in time, that mix last year shifted dramatically more towards branded as we loaded in the initial product sets for the store. So as we look at this year, our mix is going to be more heavily weighted towards private label than branded, which is always been the plan in the business, and we anticipate that we're going to continue to be able to grow the branded \u2013 the branded sales within the portfolio with the partnership with Ace as we grow that business going forward. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : So did the \u2013 the year-on-year comps in private label versus branded was that a negative effect or positive effect on price mix in the quarter? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Put them together in Q1, we were loading in much more branded product in Q1 last year than we did this year. So it was a negative impact this quarter. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, thanks very much. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You are welcome. Thanks for your question. Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations : This will be the last question, please, operator. Operator : Okay, thank you. And that will come from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, please. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks guys. Yes, so I just had a couple of questions, I guess first off in U.S. architectural, do you think we can get back to kind of a normalized level of gallons that we saw post recession maybe around 750 million gallons or so and what would be Valspar's participation as we climb up from maybe the 700 million or 750 million level where we're now? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you correctly point out, that we've got a ways to go to get back to the levels that were available pre-recession, I think, that certainly achieving those levels from an industry standpoint, that would require a level of new housing starts, that we're probably not going to see in the near future anyway. So I think the broader point certainly from the model that supports the investment thesis that we've laid out for our business is that, the North American housing recovery is going to continue to grow modestly and given that we've got a very widely distributed brand in North America through the various channel that we participate we think continues to provide a very nice tailwind of growth for our businesses. So, continued growth in housing in North America is a positive for the business and we look forward to having the Valspar brand available for a full year within the Ace business, and then certainly with our relationship in the home improvement channel with Lowe's, having Valspar reserve available for a full year as well as consumers continue to generate awareness around those brands. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Great, and just as a quick follow up on the raw material side. Can you just help us understand how long your supply agreements are in those kind of propylene based materials and TiO2, is it less than a quarter or how do you look at that? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sorry, Arun, we're not going to talk about that. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Fair enough. Thanks. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Welcome. Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations : Okay. That was the last question operator. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference service.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Seymour. Please go ahead, sir. Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations : Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2015 second quarter earnings call. We have two speakers today : Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll have plenty of time to take your questions. Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valspar.com. Also, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report in our Form 10-Q. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release. Before I hand over to Gary, let me cover one housekeeping item. We have updated accounting policies relating to the classification of freight costs for shipments to our customers. This reclassification has no impact to our overall results. We provided more details of this in our supporting earnings slide presentation on the IR site. With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll cover highlights of our second quarter performance. Jim will provide additional detail on the quarter's financials and our outlook for the year. I'm pleased with the results for the second quarter, which were right in line with our expectations. We grew EPS 4% in the quarter. We achieved this despite significant headwinds from the impact of currency translation and the expected volume decline in our Paints segment in North America. Of note in the quarter was continued strong performance in Coatings, driven by new business wins and benefits from productivity and cost savings. In the Paints segment, our international business has had a good quarter with volume and sales up in local currency. Moving on to cover some segment specific highlights, our Coatings segment had a seventh straight quarter of solid growth. This great business continues to show the benefit of our diversified, yet focused portfolio and strong market positions. In Q2, Coatings volume was up, sales were up in local currency, and net new business was up 5%, driven by market share gains. We grew EBIT by 160 basis points, as we leveraged our growth, restructuring and productivity initiatives. I'll turn now to our Paints segment where I'll cover a number of important initiatives ongoing across the world. Let me talk about our largest paint business first in North America. As we expected, volumes in North America were down in the quarter, driven by two factors. One, the previously disclosed product line adjustment at Lowe's; and two, the difficult prior year comparisons relating to new product launches at both Lowe's and Ace last year. As you all know, we lost a price point at Lowe's as we entered the paint season this year. The good news is that sell-through of the remaining products at Lowe's was up double digits in the quarter. This strong performance is testament to our great brand and to our world-class team working with consumers in Lowe's stores every day. We have a very strong product line up at Lowe's that spans many price points. In this spring, we introduced a new lineup of Pro paint. The new Valspar's series of professional paint products includes multiple SKUs, including lines that are now zero VOC. And speaking of zero VOC products, a leading consumer publication recently rated Valspar Reserve the number one zero VOC paint in the U.S. And overall, Valspar had four of the top eight ranked paints. In the independent hardware channel in the U.S. where, just as a reminder, Valspar has sold in over 8,000 stores, we just finished setting a new Cabot stain program at Ace and we jointly kicked off a new marketing and advertising campaign. We continue to make great progress in this channel. Our international consumer paint business had another good quarter of performance. Volumes and sales were up in local currency in all regions. China had strong volume growth, driven by continued expansion of our distribution network. In Australia, we continue to see good growth at both Masters and in our stores business. Sales were up high single digits in the quarter in local currency in the stores channel, and it was the seventh quarter in a row that we've grown share with professional painter in Australia. More good news in that region. Mitre 10, a leading home improvement retailer in New Zealand, recently selected Valspar as its new strategic paint partner. Valspar Paint will be available in all 81 million Mitre 10 stores this fall. In the UK and Ireland, we're now set in all B&Q stores, and we've had great feedback on our paint and the new advertising campaign launched this spring. So, looking at the quarter in aggregate, our overall results were solid and in line with our expectations. Our performance once again demonstrates diversity and strength in our business portfolio. And today, we're pleased to announce that we have further strengthened our portfolio with the pending acquisition of the performance coatings businesses of Quest Specialty Chemicals, which includes coatings for automotive refinish and industrial applications. In 2014, these businesses generated sales of approximately $190 million. Quest Automotive Products, the larger of the two businesses, brings advanced technology products for professional refinishers, primarily in North America and Europe. This acquisition will effectively double the size of Valspar's existing auto refinish business. Our customers will benefit from an expanded portfolio of preferred brands, a broader suite of high performance products, increased distribution channels and a stronger service network. Quest Industrial Products serves both the professional and consumer market with aerosol spray products and highly specified coatings for industrial applications. This business nicely complements our existing aerosol business with enhanced supply chain, technology and distribution. These businesses are a great addition to our portfolio and we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first full year. With that, I'll turn over to Jim to provide more details on results and our outlook. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I will review our second quarter performance, discuss expectations for the balance of fiscal 2015 and provide some additional context on the Quest acquisition we announced this morning. Starting first with Q2 performance, reported sales decreased 7% and volumes were down 3%. Excluding FX, sales declined 2%. These results were in line with our expectations that called for a continued volume growth in Coatings to be offset by lower volumes in Paints. The decline in Paints was the result of the Lowe's product lineup change and the difficult comparisons to several large product launches last year during the second quarter. Similar to last quarter, the FX translation impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar lowered our reported results. We estimate the currency changes lowered sales by approximately $55 million and adjusted EPS by $0.04 in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of FX, adjusted EPS growth in Q2 was approximately 7%. Looking at sales in the Coatings segment, we delivered another strong quarter of growth. Sales increased 5% in local currency and volumes grew 3%, driven by new business wins. Coatings growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in the general industrial and coil product lines. In packaging, sales in local currency increased and volumes were down slightly. The volume decline was the result of lost business comprised of lower margin products. New business wins in non-BPA products increased sales and more than offset the impact of this volume. As Gary said, Coatings is having a very good year. For the first half, volume was up 7%. Sales in local currency are up 8% and adjusted EBIT margins are up 140 basis points. Moving on to the Paints segment, Q2 sales decreased 12% in local currency and volumes declined 12%. We saw another good quarter of growth from our international paint businesses where volumes increased. This growth was more than offset by a double-digit volume decline in North America. The decline was driven by the product line changes at Lowe's and the difficult comparisons to last year's Ace rollout and the launch of Valspar Reserve. The Paints segment also includes our auto refinish product line, which in the future will reflect the results of the acquired Quest businesses. In Q2, Valspar's existing automotive refinish product line increased volume high single digits and improved sales mid single digits in local currency. Moving on to gross margin, we finished the quarter with total gross margin of 36.5%, up 280 basis points year-over-year. The improvement in gross margin was the result of several different factors. The largest driver was improvements tied to our productivity initiatives and restructuring activities. These included benefits from supply chain restructuring programs and manufacturing consolidations in North America and Europe. In addition, we had favorable comparisons to last year when we incurred some one-time costs related to supply chain disruptions. Second was from cost price. We saw some modest benefits on select inputs including solvent-based items and input costs in Asia. As we move into the second half of the year, we do not anticipate a similar level of improvement to the gross margin rate as we experienced in the second quarter. Costs are showing signs of firming in Asia and other markets. In addition, we will not have the benefit of favorable comparisons to the prior year as discussed above. Looking at expenses in Q2, OpEx of 21.9% of sales increased 140 basis points due in part to deleverage from lower sales in the Paints segment. However, operating expense dollars were down slightly, driven by the impact of FX and benefits from our productivity initiatives. Bringing it all together, consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 3% and EBIT margins increased 140 basis points to finish at 14.5% in the second quarter. In the Coatings segment, adjusted second quarter EBIT of $110 million increased 9%. The increase in EBIT was primarily the result of benefits from productivity initiatives, cost price and increased volume. In the Paints segment, adjusted EBIT of $47.3 million was down 17% from the prior year. This decline was driven by the impact of lower sales from the product line adjustments and difficult comparisons to last year that I referenced earlier. While total Paints segment EBIT declined in Q2, Paints EBIT growth outside of North America was up mid single digits. Wrapping up the quarter, we paid $24 million in dividends, representing a per share increase of 15% and repurchased 1.1 million shares of our company's stock for a total investment of $93 million. With this as context on Q2, let's move on and review the outlook for the balance of fiscal 2015. We continue to expect annual adjusted EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.65. As noted in the release today, we modestly lowered our annual sales guidance to a decline in the low single digits compared to fiscal 2014. This change reflects an updated estimate of the impact from FX for the fiscal year. We look forward to adding the Quest businesses to our portfolio during the third quarter. Let me provide you with some quick comments on the expected financial impact of the acquisition. First, the fiscal 2015 guidance we just discussed does not include the impact of the pending Quest acquisition. But let me give you an idea of what we preliminarily expect. Given the partial year of sales and expected integration investments, the EPS impact from Quest is expected to be slightly accretive in fiscal 2015. More importantly, looking forward into fiscal 2016, we preliminarily expect the acquisition to add approximately $35 million in EBITDA. From an EPS perspective, this would result in approximately $0.07 to $0.09 of adjusted EPS in fiscal 2016. This preliminary estimate includes the negative impact of $0.04 to $0.05 in non-cash amortization charges related to purchase accounting. In closing, our Q2 results reflect solid performance. With half the fiscal year complete, we've performed in line with our expectations and remained focused on delivering on our full year performance goals. With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Operator : And our first question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks very much. Gary, you had mentioned that in the Paints segment, both Asia and Australia had a very good volume trends, but the sales realization wasn't as great. I assume a function of that currency, is part of that also the continued move towards affordable housing in Asia and was there any move down in the price point curve in Australia? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. In China, Bob, it would be \u2013 as we have really strong volume \u2013 less sales and volume because we're \u2013 the non-affordable house \u2013 the affordable housing segment or we also refer to it as non-exclusive distribution is still growing strongly and that's the reason that you're correct when you call that out. In Australia, it's all currency. I mean, the Australian dollar has probably been impacted more than any other currency that we translate back. So, yeah, we had really good quarter in Australia. Volume was up high single digits, sales were up mid-single digits, but as it translated back, it looked \u2013 it didn't look that good. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Can I ask you on your initiative at B&Q, I noticed they've got a new Chairman or leader and there's been some change in strategy a little bit under B&Q store based closing some stores. Do you sense that creating any headwinds for you or reducing the growth expectations you had previously? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Not really, Bob. I mean, it's \u2013 I think they announced that their plans were to close about 15% of the stores in their network. I think it's safe to assume that those stores were underperforming to begin with. They believe that they can keep at least a third of the volume from those stores, so if you do that math, it says that the potential business that we had with B&Q is reduced by, say, 10%. And if you remember, our number there was 100 \u2013 a little over $100 million, so it's immaterial to \u2013 certainly to the company. It will still be good and profitable business, but I think more importantly as we've said a number of different times, B&Q for us is an important venture because of the optionality it gives us on the rest of the European consumer market which is very, very large, $6 billion or so and very fragmented market. So, it gives us the opportunity in addition to partnering with a great retailer. We're building a team, we're building a supply chain and we believe that we'll be able to expand that business from that base. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. And just an editorial gratitude to Jim and Bill in terms of getting those slides out, it's much more helpful, I appreciate the greater disclosure there. Thanks. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. You're welcome. Operator : And our next question will come from Eugene Fedotoff at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just to follow up on Europe, could you tell us what the volume growth was in the region in the quarter? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Volume growth in Europe was flattish. And it's mainly as a result of our packaging business and I apologize this issue now I'm sure will come up later because we have been showing strong volume growth in our packaging coatings business for the last several quarters and this year, it was slightly negative. And now as a result, as Jim mentioned, of a competitive situation in Europe on a large volume, low margin product, and one of our competitors got a little bit more aggressive on price than we were comfortable with. So we let the business go. But packaging in Europe overall had a good quarter, offsetting that volume loss and had sales in the low single digit, approaching mid single digit range. So, in Europe, in general, had a good quarter, sales were up mid single digits in local currency. So, the headlines to that, say, Europe is improving, that's possible certainly our business there remains strong. Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks for the color. And then, North America, the changes at Lowe's, was the impact on volume in the quarter? Was it more or less than you guys expected? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right in line. Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Ram Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. This is Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. How are you? A quick question on raws. Can you just parse out what you're seeing in solvents versus resins? I would sort of expect given much weaker propylene and propylene derivative pricing, you guys would look to see a bit of a benefit as we work into the back half of the year, but just curious to hear your thoughts there. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We usually don't talk about \u2013 we had a policy of not talking about individual commodities. And \u2013 but we will say that and Jim said it, I think, in his prepared remarks is that we did see some softness in pricing in the quarter in the commodities that are related to oil and that would be solvents that \u2013 the type of commodities that you expect to see behave cyclically. So we saw that in the quarter. And as Jim also said, toward the end of the quarter and certainly as we look forward through the remainder of the year, we see pricing firming in those commodities, particularly the ones that are related to oil, which on average is at a higher price now than it was during the second quarter for us. Ram Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. And then, just on your performance coatings acquisition, is it possible just to give a little bit more color on the mix? How much is comprised of refinish versus industrial? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's about three quarters auto refinish and about a quarter industrial. I mean \u2013 so there are two businesses that we acquired, Ram, one is the auto refinish business and that's the larger of the two, and then the smaller is an industrial aerosol business. Both businesses are highly complementary to our existing businesses and broaden our product offering and distribution channels. The auto refinish piece, which I'm sure most of the folks on this call know (21:58-22:05) extremely attractive from sales and will increase our presence in the North American market more than that percentage. We'll finally be at a significant scale in the North American market. The industrial business \u2013 the industrial aerosol business, I think you know we have an aerosol business that's mainly a consumer business today. It's highly complementary from the standpoint of supply chain, manufacturing, and technology. So we're very excited about these businesses and we expect they're going to be great contributors to Valspar earnings going forward. Ram Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. In terms of the Quest purchase, you probably can't disclose precisely what you're paying for it, but is it roughly $400 million? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Less than that, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'm sorry, couldn't hear you. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry, Jeff. Bill Seymour is controlling \u2013 Seymour is controlling the electronics here. For some reason, he had you muted. So it's less than $400 million. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Less than $400 million. Okay, that's great. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Jeff, yeah, it's \u2013 I would say the transaction is consistent with industry multiples in terms of our purchase price. After synergy, we're looking at something like paying seven times EBITDA. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And your prices were up a couple of percent in Coatings, can you talk about which areas were up, was that a particular industry area or a particular end market? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't believe that we got any significant pricing in the quarter. Jeff, what you're looking at is a mix improvement. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Is a mix improvement. Or where was the mix better? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Packaging with the increased sales of non-BPA coatings. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : And the coil business. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And our coil business, which had a really strong quarter and we leveraged the strong growth into stronger margins. And we also had \u2013 we had a number of different product launches in our coil business over the last couple of quarters that have incremental margins that are higher than the base. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yeah. The coil business also as part of the mix grew in the first half of this year. Remember, we had very difficult weather conditions in the first half of last year, so coil mixed heavier in the portfolio this year. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. So I think early in the call you said something like on an apples-to-apples basis, you are up double-digit at Lowe's, meaning exclusive of the price points that you lost. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're right. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Was that growth faster or slower or the same as the other suppliers to Lowe's. Do they also have a similar increase or do you feel you're doing better or worse than competition? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I don't know the answer to that, Jeff, and I am not sure if I did I \u2013 it would be appropriate to answer that specifically. It was \u2013 we were very pleased with that. As you know, we have several hundred, over 400 Valspar employees that work in the Lowe's stores supporting Lowe's sales efforts. And as I said in my remarks, the strength of our brand and the strength of our product lineup combined with those 400 professionals led to really strong growth in the quarter. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Lastly, when you think about your raw materials, were there particular regions where raw materials were down more and particular regions where raw materials were down less? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Asia was the largest \u2013 we saw the largest reduction in costs in our Asia business, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Um-hum. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Europe and North America were more or less similar. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question will come from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, fellas. First question probably for Jim. On the comments we're \u2013 coming out of Q1, we're going to be flat on overall sales, now down low single digits. But the change in your accounting policy actually increases your year-over-year or your sales from last year. So was some of that dropped down to low single digits down because of that accounting change or can you help me apples-to-apples year-over-year? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yeah, Duffy. Thanks for the question. No, the change in our estimate does not reflect that accounting change, reclassification change because what we've done, Duffy, is we've adjusted both years. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : So we're looking at an apples-to-apples sales number for the full year end for the individual quarters. So really it's just updating our expectations around what we've seen happened with FX since our Q1 call and it's about, call it, $50 million to $60 million sales impact due to worse FX since our last estimate. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then, on the Lowe's product change, is there still going to be a little bit of a hangover in Q2 next year in that there was still some of that price point that was sold this year that will go away next year? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : I think most of it will be wrapped up by Q1 next year, Duffy. I mean there might be immaterial parts certainly in the first part of Q2, but as we get through the first quarter of next year, we'll have anniversaried most of the product line-up change. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then the last one and you teased a little bit of it out, but I was wondering if you could just ramp the whole segment. Coil coatings looks like it crushed it for you guys up double digits and I'm not sure if it was Gary or somebody mentioned maybe it was a little bit of weather in there. But can you walk through why that was so much better on a volume basis being it's a fairly mature industry? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Well, our teams have done a great job winning new business in that space. That's one driver. The other driver, as I mentioned in, I think, in the Q&A session, is that we talked in the first half of last year about softer results due to the abnormally cold weather and wet weather in Q1 and Q2. So we're lapping some \u2013 a little bit easier compares, but the vast majority of the reason is our team did a nice job winning new business. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yeah. Thanks for your questions. Operator : And the next question will come from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Thanks, guys. I guess I just wanted to follow up on the Paints segment a little bit. Just trying to understand, you said, you know, you were up double digits existing business at Lowe's and I didn't fully understand that. So do you think it was due to some share gains or is it really strong start to the paint season this year or what do you think is going on there? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think our people in the stores are doing a great job (29:12-29:21) selling, and when a customer comes in, they intercept that consumer and they are helping Lowe's grow their Paints department by selling Valspar. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And so, as you look out over the next year or two, do you expect that that growth to continue and potentially offset some of the share loss you did experience last year? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. That's a good question, Arun. Let's just \u2013 let the paint season play out. The first quarter or the second quarter of this year is not the high volume of the year, it's not the high volume quarter... Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Sure. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : ...as the third quarter is. So let's see \u2013 let's defer that question until our third quarter call and I'll be able to give you more specifics. I'd just be speculating now. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Right. And then last question I have was just in Coatings, what are you seeing in heavy equipment and then also in Europe, are you seeing any emergence of green shoots or do you expect that to emerge in the next couple quarters? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, as I said, our Europe \u2013 address Europe first. Europe business had a good quarter. And that comes on the back of several \u2013 many actually, good quarters. So we haven't been impacted in Europe to the extent that, say, other businesses have. In the heavy equipment market, I'll just say it's still down. I mean you \u2013 I'm sure you read the announcements from the main branch Caterpillar and Deere. They're not expecting a strong year in heavy equipment. Our heavy equipment segment is doing extremely well, because we've taken significant amount of market share with local players in the China market as well as some others globally. The Inver acquisition was a real enabler of our growth strategy. So we've taken share in the off-road market in Europe. And as I said, we've done really well in the China market as well. So we're offsetting the softness at the few large customers where market share growth was. Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : And the next question will come from PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. It's Dan Jester on for PJ. Can we go back to the strategic rationale for the Quest acquisition? Did you feel like you need to get bigger in the auto refinish business to compete for the multi-shop operators that seem to be consolidating slowly the U.S. auto refinish market? And the auto refinish business doesn't seem to have been historically as big of a focus for you in the past, but going forward, is this going to be the fifth leg of your Coatings platform, and should we expect more investment in auto refinish in the future? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Dan, those are great questions. I'll answer the last one last. Yes, we do expect this to be a fifth leg to our Coatings platform. And we didn't need to do the Quest acquisition, but we wanted to do the Quest acquisition. We have, I think you know it was in our Investor deck, the refinish business, that's about $150 million pre-acquisition of Quest, and it's been growing nicely. We've been in the refinish business for 15 years and it's always been a reliable grower, it's always been a very profitable piece of our business and we've always wanted to get larger in refinish. The Quest acquisition gave us that opportunity. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, just on the New Zealand business that you won that you mentioned briefly in your prepared remarks, 81 stores by the end of this year. What kind of revenue and profit contribution can we expect from that in the future? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's not huge, Dan. New Zealand is a small country, but we called that out because for that team in Australia, New Zealand, $10 million or $15 million of business, which is roughly what we're talking about initially is significant and more significant is that the brand \u2013 our brands are \u2013 will be more widely distributed in the New Zealand market. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : I think as we've also talked about in the past, our business there, we spent last few years restructuring the cost base of the business. So, it's highly sensitive to improvement based on adding incremental volume. So, examples of adding Mitre 10 really helps build the infrastructure of the business and allows us to get to the level of profit that we anticipated from the Australian portfolio. Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Thanks for your question. Operator : And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning. Just a question on your other segment showed less of a loss in the quarter sequentially in year-over-year and I think in general just wondering what caused that and if that whatever it is sustainable? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yeah. Good morning, Vincent. Thanks for your question. Yeah, a lot of companies I know consider the other part of their portfolio to be primarily corporate expenses and things of that nature. I just remind people on the call that for Valspar that other business segment includes our internal and external resin business. It also includes some of our furniture protection business that we have and it's got some corporate expenses in there as well. The biggest change in the improvement in that segment during the quarter was really the performance of our resin business. Our resin business has been increasing volumes, high single digits and doing a nice job of growing their portfolio both in the Q1 and Q2 with a much smaller part of the change was really timing of corporate expenses within the quarters. But again, biggest element is business driven volume increase from our resin business. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just as a follow-up, I just want to make sure I understand the bridge on the guidance because if I heard you correctly and I might have missed part of it. You reduced your sales forecast on FX, but the EPS range is staying the same, but you're not anticipating really any material \u2013 raw material benefit in the second half. So I am just wondering what are the other moving part \u2013 and Quest isn't in there, what are the other moving parts that keep you in the range or so just what the other moving parts, I guess? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yeah. So let's go back once. You're correct. We commented that the impact of the Quest acquisition, which is expected to be accretive, but not significant for the year will roll in the full impact of that after we close of the deal and when we talk about our Q3 results. From an EPS standpoint, excluding the Quest business, what I said was we've lowered our sales guidance slightly simply to reflect our updated view of what we think FX is going to do for the year, so we'll see where that actually lands. The other comment we made in our prepared remarks is that why we expect our gross margin rates to improve in the back half of the year, they will not be at the same rate that we experienced in the second quarter because of the anniversarying of some of the benefits we saw in the back half of last year especially Q4 and the fact that we see some of the prices in the marketplace firming as we look into the back half at this point in time. So we do expect gross margin expansion in the second half, just not at the rate we saw in the second quarter. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning, guys. A couple questions, if I may, mostly follow-ups. On the packaging business, when do you expect to anniversary this loss of the large low volume business that's been sort of holding back the last couple of quarters, is it going to be done by the end of the year or is it going to carry over into 2016? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : It will probably carryover, Dmitry. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It will probably. By the way, you know this business really well and you know what the product line is. This happens. We win some. There are basically two suppliers in this segment and we buy them back and forth a little bit year-in and year-out. So this is not a big deal. And it's not particularly profitable, so \u2013 but \u2013 and it usually lasts about a year before you have another opportunity to bid. So let's call it a year before we anniversary. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Got you. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Fourth quarter next year \u2013 sorry, second quarter 2016. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Got you. Okay. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment in Coatings? I know in Paints that's generally fairly stable and is kind of independent of raw materials, at least some are deflating. But Coatings tends to be a little bit more fragmented and a little bit more competitive business. Has the raw material really been meaningful enough for coating suppliers due to starters containing share gains through lower prices or customer pressures of lower prices? Can you talk about the pricing environment both in the second quarter, but more importantly, your outlook for the rest of the year? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think our customers understand our cost structure pretty well, Dmitry, and understand that we've got long-term relationships with most of the customers in our Coatings businesses and they understand that commodity driven fluctuations in raw material costs are not the basis to talk about structural reductions in pricing or structural increases in pricing if it goes the other way. And the impact just hasn't been significant enough, yeah, for us to engage in extremely detailed conversations with most of our customers. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. So you would characterize the environment as being fairly benign in the sense of not much changing. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would say fairly benign is the way I would say, yeah. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. All right. With respect to the tough comps that you are seeing in terms of getting the Cabot stains into Ace and the Valspar lines into Ace last year and Reserve into Lowe's, when do you expect to anniversary the channel fill? Is it pretty much done in the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter or is it going to impact you for the rest of the year and we have to look towards 2015 to see more robust delivered year-over-year growth? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yeah, Dmitry, it's Jim. You went through a couple of different pieces there. Let me just break them down. So the first is that you commented on Cabot, that's really a \u2013 that's the activity we're doing this year... Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : ...in the Ace stores. So it really doesn't have \u2013 but doesn't put pressure on this year's results. Obviously, it's a tailwind. In the North American business, if you recall, in Q1 and especially Q2 of last year, we were just finishing the build-out of the over 3,000 Ace stores with the Valspar brand. We also launched Valspar Reserve at Lowe's, a lot of those sales got loaded in Q2 \u2013 our fiscal Q2 last year so that our retail partners could sell them during the paint season. So we'll see some of the pressure of those headwinds mitigate in Q3 in the business. The pressure that we have from the product lineup change in Lowe's, though, it's going to continue through the balance of the year and into the first quarter. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. That was \u2013 my second question, you preempted a little bit, but... Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : I was reading your mind, Dmitry. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : You are, but I'll rephrase it a little bit. Is the biggest impact of the loss of the Lowe's product points, was it in the second quarter or will be \u2013 the biggest impact will be in the first quarter in terms of year-over-year comps? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : No, it's pretty similar in really Q2 to Q4. It'll be a little heavier during the key paint season in Q3, but not meaningfully. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yeah, thanks for your questions, Dmitry. Operator : And our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Quick one on the Quest business. It looks like \u2013 at least at first glance, it looks like the margins are at least a little bit lower than your Coatings division margins. I assume with synergies that that more than gets taken care of, but I guess can you walk us through how to think about the magnitude of the synergies and as they \u2013 how we should think about them rolling in over the next couple of years? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yeah, John, a couple of things. So we'll put this business like we have our existing auto refinish business in the Paints segment. So our EBIT margins are actually a little better in this business and our EBITDA margins will even be greater because the thing that I called out in my comments as well is we're going to have some non-cash amortization that's going to impact EBIT margins. But I think as we look forward into the synergies not unlike the deals the company's historically done like Inver, we're going to have manufacturing synergies, we're going to have commodity synergies, and most importantly, we're going to have sales synergies being able to leverage both of the companies' products against the existing distribution networks in the companies. So looking at a EBITDA margin, call it, roughly 18% today that can continue to grow over time with those synergies and go north of 20%, we think it's a great attractive business to not only deliver higher bottom-line results but also to accelerate the top-line in our refinish business. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Absolutely. Okay. And then thinking about other M&A opportunities, I guess do you see a relatively decent pipeline out there or should we view this as a one-off and this does look like a pretty decent asset for you. So I guess how should we think about opportunities for more of that to come throughout the year? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I mean they're just \u2013 they're unpredictable, John, as you know. I mean we have a number of things that are in progress, nothing at $200 million, but a number of smaller ones, at least one or possibly two I would expect to come through in the balance of the year, but maybe not just \u2013 deals come and go and sometimes we pause and revisit, so we'll just have to go. But as you know, it's still a rich landscape in the paints and coatings industry particularly in Asia and in Europe still extremely fragmented. We've been a consolidator. We expect to continue to be a consolidator. And the historical growth that we've achieved through M&A as our target growth for the future which is about half of the company's growth that gets come through M&A, we expect that will be the case in future. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. And then maybe just one last question. So now that you're ramped up at B&Q kind of full out, I guess how long \u2013 because you've said this is the first step into potentially targeting a much bigger platform throughout Europe. I guess how long do you go through this trial period to see if it resonates well, if the strategy works before you either move to the next level with your partner, or maybe put it on hold or put an end to it. I guess how should we think about the signpost or what we should be looking for in terms of whether this gets taken to the next level or not? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yeah, minimum. We want to get a full year behind us, certainly with B&Q where our focus right now, John, as Gary mentioned, is on winning with that retailer, winning with consumers of that marketplace and seeing how the business plays out with the full year of advertising, full year of training and support of the stores. That will put us in a good position to read out either a) how we should make some modest adjustments to the model; or b) can give us continued confidence that we can invest behind that with other retailers in the marketplace. But it's good to get a full year's result behind us through a full paint season to understand how the consumers are reacting to the value proposition. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. So thinking about it from a one-year to two-year perspective is probably the right timeframe, is that right? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yeah. I think so. I mean really at the end of this year, we'll probably have a full year of a complete set underneath of our belt, good time to re-evaluate. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks very much. Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Thanks, John. Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Brett, this will be our last question. Thank you. Operator : You're welcome. Thank you. And that will come from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please go ahead. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. A question on wood. Last quarter, it was up double digits in terms of volume. This year, it's down low single digits year-over-year. Could you help us understand what's driving that volatility in volumes between the two different quarters? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : Yeah. It's primarily coming from the performance in our Asia business. So if I blend the two quarters together, I probably have a more representative run rate. There are some changes that have been taking place in the Asian marketplace around the government providing \u2013 or requiring taxes on certain types of solvent-based products. So we believe we have some customers pre-order some inventory in advance of those regulatory changes. So really if you look at blending of the two quarters together, we probably have a more representative, very strong run rate in that business and the North American business has performed pretty consistent in both those periods. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Got it. Then just on your FX headwind, it seemed a little bit lower, what dropped to the bottom-line was maybe a little bit less than one would expect, was there any transactional benefits there or is there something else that's preventing the FX headwind from really hurting you as much on the bottom-line? Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer : No, it's really all translation and just given the mix of the business we have in each of those markets. As you would imagine, some of our European businesses aren't at the same margin levels as our established, more profitable North American count \u2013 as our established more profitable North American counterparts. So it really has more to do with the regional mix of EBIT. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Got it. And then just finally, Masters is rolling out some new store formats in Australia, but then they're also looking to reduce at least or they are decelerating the amount of store openings that they are looking for in the next couple of years, but how \u2013 netting all that out, how is that going to look for your volumes in that part of the business going forward? Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't expect a material change, Nils. I mean, we've been growing nicely with Masters and they are about 10% of our business in Australia and so a modest change in their plans doesn't impact us very much. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Understood. Thanks for taking my questions. Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations : Thank you, everyone. Operator : And that does conclude the conference for today. Thanks for your participation, and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference service. You may now disconnect.",

Following the Company's review of the third quarter financial results and outlook for the fourth quarter and full year, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells, Senior Vice President Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Sir. Bob Wells : Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are going to begin the call as usual this morning with some prepared remarks by John Morikis, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Chris Connor, Chairman and CEO. Following their remarks, we will open the call to questions and Sean Hennessy, our Chief Financial Officer, and Al Mistysyn, Vice President Corporate Controller, are here with us this morning to participate in the Q&A session. Before I pass the microphone to John, let me remind you that this conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings, and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in our earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. In the interest of time, we've also provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website at www.sherwin.com under investor relations third quarter press release. With that, let me turn the call over to John to review our performance for the third quarter. John Morikis : Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Our results in the third quarter 2015 clearly demonstrate the earnings power of this business model. Although we faced some difficult headwinds to revenue growth mostly related to currency devaluation, further softening in demand for industrial coatings, and a slow recovery in domestic construction activity, diluted net income per common share increased 18.5% to $3.97, an all-time high for any quarter in our history. Sales volumes lagged in many of our operating segments, but our domestic architectural paint volumes remain strong and drove operating rates higher in our US manufacturing and distribution facilities. This resulted in significant operating leverage in the quarter. This operating leverage, combined with stable pricing, favorable raw material costs in most of our domestic businesses, and good SG&A expense control across the Company drove consolidated gross margin, TVT margin, and net income as a percent of sales falls to record levels. I will spend a few minutes highlighting overall Company performance for third quarter 2015 compared to third quarter 2014, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased of 0.1% to $3.15 billion. Solid domestic demand for architectural paint was mostly offset by weak volume demand in our non-domestic business and currency devaluation. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $103 million year over year to $1.57 billion and gross margin increased 320 basis points to 49.9% of sales from 46.7% in the third quarter of last year. Selling, General, and Administrative expenses for the quarter increased $9.3 million to $993.6 million. As a percent of sales, third-quarter SG&A was 31.5%, up 30 basis points from last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million, an increase of $970,000 over third quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $76.7 million or 16.2% to $551 million. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter this year was 32% compared to 31.2% in the third quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30%s compared to last year's rate of 31.2%. Consolidated net income increased $48.3 million or 14.8% to $374.5 million. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 11.9% compared to 10.4% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 18.5% to $3.97 per share compared to $3.35 per share in third quarter 2014. Unfavorable currency translation decreased earnings-per-share $0.09 in the quarter. Now looking at our results by operating segment. Paint stores group turned in another strong profit performance in third quarter, although sales were lighter than expected. Segment sales increased 2.9% to $2.09 billion. In comparable-store sales, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, grew 2.1%. Regionally in the third quarter our southeastern division led all divisions followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, and the Eastern division. Paint stores group segment profit for the quarter increased $75.6 million or 17.5% to $507.4 million. Segment profit as a percent of sales increased to 24.3% from 21.3% last year. During the quarter our paint stores group continued to expand its store footprint, opening 23 net new stores. This brings our year-to-date net openings to 45. We remain very confident in the long-term market opportunity for this group and we are on pace to open between 100 and 110 new stores this calendar year and close between 20 and 25 redundant store locations. Today, our store count in the US, Canada, and the Caribbean stands at 4048 compared to 3959 a year ago, an increase of 89 locations in the past year. For our consumer group, sales increased 9.4% to $421.6 million from $385.2 million last year due primarily to the volume contribution from our HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams Paint program at Lowe's stores. Segment profit for the consumer group increased $9.3 million or 11.8% to $88.3 million from $79 million last year. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 20.9% from 20.5% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group. Sales in US dollars decreased 9.3% to $486.1 million in the quarter as global industrial coatings demand declined further and currency headwinds strengthened. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 8.3% in the quarter compared to last year. Global Finishes Groups business in North America performed better than any other region; however, volume declines in all regions in the third quarter compare to the same period last year. Segment profit in US dollars decreased 9.2% in the quarter to $55.1 million from $60.8 million last year due primarily to currency translation and a $6.3 million gain on the early termination of a customer agreement recorded in the third quarter 2014. Unfavorable currency translation reduced segment profit $9 million. As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit was flat at 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year. Our Latin American Coatings Group continues to operate in a very challenging economic environment. Third-quarter net sales for the group stated in US dollars decreased 22.1% to $156 million. Volumes in the quarter were negative, and unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales by 23.6%. Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in US dollars, decreased to $2.1 million from $11.8 million in the same period last year. Lower sales volumes, currency-related raw material cost inflation, and unfavorable currency translation in the quarter were only partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased segment profit $5 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment profit was 1.4% in the quarter compared to 5.9% in the third quarter 2014. That concludes our review of results for the quarter so I will turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. Chris? Chris Connor : Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. I think John's opening comments pretty much said it all. Revenue growth was weaker than expected in the quarter, but the earnings power of our Company has never been stronger. Volume demand lagged our initial expectations for the quarter in virtually every market we serve, but we remain focused on delivering positive results regardless of the demand environment. I feel confident in saying that is precisely what we did in the third quarter and have done throughout the year. In the first nine months earnings per share increased 22.3% over last year on revenue growth of just 2%. Our year-to-date consolidated operating margin and gross margin are both at all-time highs, and we maintain our pricing discipline despite soft demand in a very competitive market environment. Our paint source group provides the clearest picture of domestic market conditions and there were some noteworthy bright spots in the quarter. Sales of residential retained contractors through our paint stores continue to grow at a double-digit pace. Sales volumes for the new construction markets, both residential and nonresidential, also increased compared to last year, but at a slower pace than the residential retained market. Our DIY business was down slightly in the quarter and protective and marine coating sales were down significantly. In total, Paint Source Group grew third-quarter revenues by just under 3% with volume growth slightly stronger than that, and architectural paint volumes well outpacing revenues. Our consumer group is working closely with Lowe's to build momentum behind the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program. As we indicated on our second quarter call, HGTV sales through Lowe's are trending towards the low end of our target of 2% to 3% of consulted revenues for 2015. Consumer group's core business performed better in the third quarter than second, constant roughly flat to third quarter last year. We continue to see deteriorating demand for our product outside of North America. Sales volumes in most Latin American countries fluctuated modestly compared to third quarter of 2014, with the exception of Brazil where volumes and revenues declined significantly. The impact of currency devaluation once again was worse than anticipated in the quarter. Global Finishes Group also felt the brunt of softening industrial coatings demand and deteriorating currencies in both Europe and Latin America, but made progress in offsetting these effects through price increases and tight SG&A control. Our third quarter was also a record quarter for past generation. Net operating cash in the first nine months was $902.5 million, up about $21 million over last year, the third quarter accounting for about $553 million of the total. We're on pace again this year to generate net operating cash at a rate above 10% of net sales or at 10.3% year-to-date despite higher working capital required to support the HGTV HOME program at Lowe's. Nine-month working capital picked up slightly to 11.1% of sales from 10.8% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $557 million compared to $583 million last year. We continue to invest a portion of the Company's cash back into the business in the form of capital expenditures. Through the first nine months of 2015 we spent $158 million on CapEx. Depreciation expense was $127 million and amortization expense was $20 million. For the full-year 2015, we anticipate CapEx spending to be in the range of $220 million to $240 million. Appreciation will be about $170 million, and amortization will be about $26 million. In the third quarter we repurchased 325,000 shares of our common stock on the open market, bringing our year-to-date total to 2.575 million shares and an average price of $282.20. On September 30 we had remaining authorization to acquire 2.65 million shares. On October 21, our Board of Directors approved an additional authorization to acquire 10 million shares of the Company stock for treasury which will be added to the 2.65 million shares remaining from the previous authorization. The Board also approved the quarterly dividend of $0.67 per share up from $0.55 per share last year payable on December 4 to shareholders of record on November 13. Looking ahead to the balance of the year we anticipate our consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter will be low single digits and percentage terms compared to last year's fourth quarter. With sales at that level we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.95 per share compared to $1.37 per share earned in the first quarter of last year, an increase of 33% at the midpoint of the range. For the full-year 2015 we expect consolidated net sales to increase off by a low signal digit percentage compared to full-year 2014. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance calling for diluted net income per common share for 2015 to be in the range of $10.75 to $11 per share compared to $8.78 per share earned in 2014, an increase of almost 24% at the midpoint of the range. Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys. Good morning. John Morikis : Hey Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi : Maybe John with the new high watermark for margins. John Morikis : He's up to the task, don't worry Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi : John, good luck with that. First off on the Paint Stores Group and your 2.1% reported same-store sales, can you sort of parse out for us the performance between architectural and some of the other protective coatings in that market that you saw in that channel? Chris Connor : The architectural side was by far the strongest. We had a very good and strong performance in architectural and our industrial protective and marine side we clearly faced some headwinds there. We do very well, particularly in the petrochem area, we out index probably the market by quite a bit and with the softness there that has a netiquette impact on our volume. Ghansham Panjabi : So architectural two to three times? Chris Connor : Yes. Ghansham Panjabi : And I guess on that note should we expect same-store sales to continue to be pressured by these categories in 2016 or do you think there will be a tailwind from the [indiscernible]. Sean Hennessy : This is Sean Hennessy. When you look at 2016, I think we're putting that together right now and I think in January when we discuss the fourth quarter we'll also be giving you some guidance on 2016 and give you a clearer picture. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the raw materials side. We did have some declines here as well in the third quarter. Are you still kind of sticking to the mid single-digit decline in 2015 and what's your outlook for 2016? Bob Wells : Yes. This is Bob. We are still sticking to our mid single-digit decline for year-over-year average raw material basket for the industry. We think in the back half it is likely trending to the high end of a mid single-digit range just based on the trajectory of raw materials over the course of the year, but we're standing by ever mid-single digit outlook. For 2016? Arun Viswanathan : Right. Bob Wells : I'm sorry, Arun. Maybe I misunderstood the question. We are really not in a position to give a raw material outlook for 2016 yet. We will do that on our year-end call. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Appreciate that. As a follow up, on the volume side, 2% comp in the quarter. I was just curious how that played out versus your own expectations. I think last time we were expecting a slight increase in Q3 versus Q2 which did a 3.9 and then I guess similarly maybe you could just talk about if there's been any structural changes to the market which would prevent you from going back to the kind of mid single-digit level for next year? Thanks. Bob Wells : I would tell you when you look at our sales guidance for the third quarter to where we came in, I think that we were a little disappointed in the comps store and stores group. We were not disappointed at all in the architectural performance. We felt that we continually said over the long run we think we can beat the market by one and a half to two times. We think we are right there. On the protective marine side there was a little bit of a challenge, maybe a little more of a challenge than we thought and that hurts us two ways. That hurts us in the volume and secondly the average selling price. So, that has a little more effect on the cause of that Q1 to be lower. Structurally, those type of things on the architectural side we still are as confident as ever. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Aram Rubinson : Thank you. Two questions. First of all on the paint stores. You did indicate that the volumes were higher than the comp. Can you just give us a sense on the price mix element? I think last quarter it was a negative 1.5%. What are we looking at in the third quarter for price mix and maybe break it down? And then also I know you were going after the R&R contractors a little bit more. That might have hurt your mix in Q2. What did we do with that in the third quarter? Sean Hennessy : I think the biggest impact of the price mix, Aram, has been the comments that you are hearing this morning about the struggles continuing into protective and marine. As a reminder, these are gallons that can sell upwards of $100 a gallon for us. As we commented, the pricing disciplines of the Company are in great shape. You see that in the margins. Our residential repaint numbers are up double digits as we commented, so the price mix issues are really holding up fine on the price side, it's just the types of end market gallons are having a little impact here. Aram Rubinson : Then could you help us. I think you guys are doing some things on the store front that you may not have talked about which is kind of leaning down the stores, doing more centralized deliveries, working capital being a bit more centralized. Are there things you are doing on the store side that are worth airing in that regard? Chris Connor : No. Nothing worth talking about truthfully. Our focus is on making sure that our people and our products are where our customers need them. So anything that we're doing in the field is to better align our resources with our customer's needs. John Morikis : And there is really no programs that we're undertaking, Aram, in that space at all. That is just not beyond our normal efficiency practices. Aram Rubinson : And then just if you can give us the gross profit dollar increase by segment and then I'll leave you guys for the next questioner. Sean Hennessy : Okay. Give me one second. Gross margin dollar changed in the third quarter by segment same-stores group increased $89.2 million. Consumer was increased by $34.2 million. Global Finishes Group was down $5.6 million, and the Latin America Coatings Group was down $[17.8] million. Aram Rubinson : Got it. Thank you. It looks like your Paint Store Group gross margin was about the same as the house from our map. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Question on how you achieve your awesome margins in Paint Stores. Obviously if volumes were not as strong as you had anticipated -- incremental margins are very strong, so every gallon you don't sell should hurt. The mix seems to hurt in protective and marine as a higher ASP so I'm assuming more profitable, but yet you just crushed the margins. Can you talk through how you were able to do that? John Morikis : A couple things. Again, just back to the point that Chris just reiterated, I think architectural gallons we're really good, I think that any time we get those architectural gallons going in the right way. I think that number two we had really good SG&A control in Storage Group. So when you see our total SG&A up $9 million, I know it's 3/10 of a percent of sales so, that's going pretty well. And the Comex. We had the Comex integration in the third quarter. We are now fully through it. We think the third quarter was you see the full effect of the Comex. You see it in two places. When you talk about this Comex you see it in Stores Group as well as you see it in Consumer Group. And you look at the operative margins that consumer was able to generate, so that Comex acquisition is doing very well now, integrated very well by our teams in the field, and you're seeing those types of things in both of the segments. Duffy Fischer : Okay. And then maybe just a to shift a quick to the HGTV. We've gone through one paint season trending towards the bottom end of the range you thought about. What's the after action review on that? What went well? What didn't? Is it just going to take a little bit longer, brand recognition and stuff like that, and what should we expect different next year? John Morikis : Duffy, as we look at this going forward we're quite excited. We have got a good partner with a good relationship there. We've learned, there is no question about it, and we're comfortable with the direction we're going here. We continue to work hard with the store associates as well as Lowe's corporate. We've expanded our SKUs just recently launching into a satin finish which is a very important finish in the home center channel, so we're expanding our SKU count, we are getting more in tune with our customer, and quite frankly we're looking forward to a strong future with this program. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thanks, guys. John Morikis : Thanks, Duffy. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates. Dennis McGill : Thank you. I guess this question is on the overall gross margin. Setting a record high and I think you've obviously said that a lot of times over the years, but is there a point where you worry at all about competitive actions or worry more than normal about competitive actions or threshold where you feel like you have achieved everything on the margin side? John Morikis : Dennis, we worry about that every day, so thanks for calling that out to our attention. Obviously the market dictates the prices we can get for our products. We compete in a very respected industry. The quality of our products and the services can command a price in the market I think you're seeing the leverage of the business model come to fruition here. Dennis McGill : Okay. And on the protective and marine, can you maybe just split out a portion of revenue within that segment that would be tied to that piece of the business? John Morikis : Tied specifically to the petrochemical part of it? Dennis McGill : Not just petro but the protective and marine as a total within Paint Store? John Morikis : Inside the store's business? Dennis McGill : Yes. John Morikis : That would be low to mid teens, Dennis, 13% to 15% of the Paint Stores Group revenue. Dennis McGill : Okay. Great. Thank you and, Chris, thank you for the honesty and humor over the years. We'll miss you. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. It's [indiscernible] in for Jeff. How are you? You said that your core consumer gross was flat in the quarter, so that means that HGTV contributed maybe $40 million to sales? Is that about right? Bob Wells : That's in the range. Unidentified Analyst : That's an range. Okay. And another gross margin question. So, prices went low again this third quarter and as best as we can tell nobody has realized those benefits yet. Very few raw material inventories probably in the fourth quarter. Do you expect to have more raw materials benefits in the first half next year? Bob Wells : We obviously give a detailed raw material outlook on our year-end call in January. We have commented that based on the current trajectory of the petrochemical side of the raw material basket, raw materials should be a tailwind next year. We will give you a little more color around that at year end. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And lastly, do you have in outlook for your corporate expense in the fourth quarter? There was a pretty large environmental component in the fourth quarter last year and probably reappear? John Morikis : Exactly. When you look at it, we do not have the environmental repeating. I think when you see the EPS guidance we have given you versus last year, you can see that -- and that environmental went into the admin segment so, yes, just because of that you're going to see an improvement in that admin segment. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar of Citi. Dan Jester : Good morning. It's Dan Jester on for PJ. I think I heard you correctly that you said that the DIY business at the stores was down in the quarter. I was just wondering are you seeing any evidence that maybe the program at Lowe's is taking DIY customer away from your store? Bob Wells : No. We don't think that is the impact in the quarter at all. That HGTV program was a de minimus part of our store's business. We've always felt that the customer that chooses to shop in a specialty paint store is a fundamentally different customer than a big box customer. And in the quarter, softness was really driven over some timing and promotional activity earlier in the quarter and it's actually been rebounding nicely. We had a good September in DIY stores to our stores business. Dan Jester : Okay, and then kind of sticking with that theme. I believe you talked previously about kind of re-energizing your investment plans and some of your other brands and consumers like Dutch Boy and Pratt & Lambert. Should we be thinking about any major programs using any of those brands in the future? John Morikis : We are obviously looking at every brand and evaluating the investments that we go in there. We're going through our planning process right now with our teams. You would expect that our diversified brands team is in fact looking at some of those brands to get behind and we will be talking about those as we roll into next year. Dan Jester : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Chris Evans : Good morning. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. The challenging environment outside of North America, if you could talk about how you plan to sort of manage those declines you're seeing in Latin America in your global finishes brand? John Morikis : I think that as a company we've always taken a look first and foremost when you're looking in Latin America if you look at the history of us, making sure that we remain cash positive and just like Argentina in 2002 and some of things that happened in the 90s with hyperinflation, we continue to make sure and we stay cash positive which makes it easy to continue to invest in those kinds of countries. Secondly, whether it's even in United States stores group, in Houston in the 80s or other places, if there's something -- we try to take advantage of these types of markets and we're looking at assets and we're looking at investments down there that eventually will come back. We think Latin America is having a tough time currency-wise, but the things will be able to do in Mexico this year and we're still investing in the rest of the Latin America group for us. We feel very good about the long term of this business. Chris Evans : Thanks. And then you talked about raws and margin expansion a bit and maybe I missed it, but did you break out or could you break out what portion of that margin expansion was from raws? John Morikis : Yes. What we prefer to say is when you look at the Comex integration, the ability for us to take those gallons through our own footprint and I think that's completed and gallon gains. You have the gallon gains over in Stores Group as well as Consumer Group, so those factors are well over half. We don't break it out in those -- we say those, that's the majority of the margin improvement and raws is just the smaller piece of that. Bob Wells : Chris, the other thing is if there's a positive mix shift with Stores Group growing faster than any other segment, that has a positive effect on gross margin as well. Chris Evans : Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. You guys addressed a lot of the mix and margin questions with Paint Stores, but I want to make sure understand something. If you're looking at some of these protective and marine coatings, obviously they can sell for quite a bit more than the architectural. Is it right to assume automatically that they have a high margin and then what happens when we're dealing with the strong operating leverage in the architectural gallons? John, can you talk about how all that mixes together in the final margin number we see? John Morikis : Yes. When you look at the protective marine that's going through the stores group, it's not very different. The operating margins, the SG&A and so forth, it's very close to the architectural business, but as you say, the costs are higher and the selling prices are higher. Bob Wells : So that means the strength in architectural volume was really driving the train? Chuck Cerankosky : Yes. Alright. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is [Matt] [ph] in for Vincent. I was wondering if you could speak to the underlying demand environment in Canada and the impact Paint Store Group and Consumer there. John Morikis : Demand in Canada has been spotty. With our new acquisition, Comex, rolling in now, we're excited about the future here. This brand that we bought in and the conversion we're going through offers us opportunity as we consolidate the general paint brand into our Sherwin brand. So, going forward it may in fact come from market share gains, but we're expecting to move forward in Canada. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. And then in terms of the impact of inventory cycles in the big box retailers, did you feel any effects from that throughout the quarter? John Morikis : No. Nothing to speak of. No. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Dmitry Silversteyn : Good morning. I think a lot of my questions have been answered but I would like to follow-up on obviously the shortfall in revenues and your performance for the earnings line above the top end of the guidance you provided from the first quarter. What were the one or two sort of biggest differences between your expectations regarding cost for the margin side heading into the quarter versus what turned out to be the case? Sean Hennessy : I think what it really came down to, Dmitry, was protected marine sales and secondly was the currency. The currency was -- we did not have the Brazilian Real getting close to 4 to 1 and those two things, but when we looked at what we thought we could do with the Comex integration and the selling price and the architectural side, it was pretty close to what original guidance was. Dmitry Silversteyn : So that's my question, Sean. You had revenues that were lower than you expected for a variety of reasons but your earnings were above the top end of your expectations or top end of your guidance, so something must have happened between the revenue line and the net income line. Sean Hennessy : Okay. I think it was the SG&A control. No doubt about it. I think the gross margin might have been a couple cents different than we thought, but I think the SG&A increasing only $9 million in the quarter. I know the divisions has been working really hard to get that SG&A down and I think that is the operating margin difference. Dmitry Silversteyn : Are those levels of SG&A spending sustainable when you see the business going forward or was this sort of a reaction to what you saw going on in the market with the currencies and demand and we can expect those SG&A levels to recover somewhat as you head into 2016? Sean Hennessy : No, they are sustainable. Going forward, we believe we can continue to run. Dmitry Silversteyn : At these levels. Okay. Secondly, can you talk a little bit about it sounded like your pricing was relatively flat both in the core group and the consumer group. Can you talk about the impact on the mix, if you will, on the revenue lines from lower protective and marine coatings and whatever else may be driving that as well as the consumer line? Sean Hennessy : I'm sorry, Dmitry. Bob mentioned that protective and marine accounts for low teens percentage of our stores business and by design these are products that sell for two and three times what a typical architectural product sells for. So a lot of that mix shift is coming as a result of the softness in that business. I think we've commented that pricing is holding up well. You're clearly seeing that in the margins performance, so with the exception of kind of that customer shift inside that business, there hasn't been a lot of mix. We did comment that the residential repaint customer continues to grow at a double digit piece for us. Those are good, solid architectural gallons for us at reasonable pricing and you can see the impact of that go into the chain. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. If I'm looking at the price mix components and assuming that your prices flat year-over-year, if I'm hearing sort of low single digits, negative mix is that sort of the right way of looking at it? Sean Hennessy : I think that -- with one exception, Dmitry, and that is we've talked about competitive pricing in the large commercial project that has a little bit of a negative effect on a very small piece of the market but by far and away the largest impact on the difference between sales and volume was that negative mix from primarily protective and marine. Dmitry Silversteyn : Got you. And then if I could follow up. I want to make sure I heard you correctly. Did you say that sales were approximately $40 million for the quarter for HGTV at Lowe's? John Morikis : Yes. Because of the comment we made about relatively flat without and that's where the computation will get you to. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. That's down almost 60% from the second quarter which I understand benefited from that but if I'm sort of the $40 million number coming up with 150, maybe 200 from a prior quarter in the maybe warmer months, that's sort of low end, below the low end of the guidance that you issued for this business. So, are we sort of going to grow into this with a full paint season and maybe a couple more in 2016, 2017 or was there some level of disappointment with the performance of this product at Lowe's this season versus\u2026 John Morikis : It's on the low end of our range so, yes, we're disappointed. We strive to exceed that range, but going forward we have great confidence in our team and we have a great partner with a great relationship. As I mentioned we've added a SKU here that's an important SKU in the satin finish and we continue having great discussions about other opportunities, so I think you're right, we're going to grow into this and were excited about the future here. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. Very good. Let me follow-up. Typically when offers discounts and prices my understanding is [indiscernible] on the paint supply on a 50/50 basis more or less. I understand it's your agreement with Lowe's may be a little different. Are you participating in this by one get one free gallon offer that is going on at Lowe's right now? John Morikis : We will not comment on that Dmitry. We don't comment about the specifics of any customer. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Thanks, good morning, guys. Two questions. If you look at gross margin which was up 320 BPS for the Company, how would you break that down year-over-year between raws and mix shift, whether it be geographic or product? How should we think of that overall? John Morikis : Greg, as an ongoing basis we have never broken price mix gallons out. What we try to do from an earlier question is we're saying that when you look at the 320 you have the Comex integration which was very positive for us. We've taken their gallons and their footprint through our footprint. I think also the increasing gallons of the Stores Group as well as the increasing gallons in the Consumer Group and also as we've always said that the Stores Group has the highest SG&A as a percent of sales, so when you look at the operating margins that means that the gross margins are the highest as we sell directly to the end user. As they become a bigger and bigger piece of the Company, that is going to create that mix. And then there was raw materials in there. Those are all the factors and what we said is if you look without -- raw materials really didn't drive this. It was the other three factors that drove it. Greg Melich : So the order you gave them we should assume is a rough order of importance? John Morikis : Yes. Greg Melich : Great. The second question I had was a bit on the outlook and also what impact of the quarter. You mentioned wet weather delaying some construction. I know that was something that happened in the second quarter in June. Could you give us some ideas of where that is and how that might be looking as you look forward? John Morikis : Yes, Greg. It looks very positive. We commented on the call that the residential repaint activity has remained strong. It's actually been strong for going on three years now and if you look at housing activity in general, there's a lot of reason to believe that the recovery is still in full swing. Household formations have been very strong and have remained strong. Existing home sales are up almost 8% year over year. Pending home sales up almost 10%. Average home values are pricing and continues to rise which is healthy for the industry, and on the new construction side it's even stronger with new home sales up almost 20% and single-family starts up more than 10%. Non-residential starts slowed a little this year, but the interesting thing this year there is that in 2015 despite it being down slightly from 2014, it's the second strong this year since 2008. We have back to back to back strong years of starts in nonresidential activity which is going to drive commercial painting in the years ahead. Greg Melich : I guess I have one last one since we have Chris and John and the whole team there. There's enough turmoil going on in the world. Sometimes this is when opportunities really arise. Are there parts of the word that you think Sherwin should be more greatly involved where for the next year or two if it gets worse could be a good opportunity to enter? Thanks. Chris Connor : We are always looking for those opportunities. That could be by customer or by segment and we keep a close eye on to those. As you should expect, our teams on the ground are empowered and pursuing those opportunities as they present themselves. Greg Melich : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc. Ivan Marcuse : Thanks for taking my questions. Real quick on the consumer business. Why did margins continue to remain flat if you have higher volume and raw materials coming through? Why wouldn't you see some leverage there? Sean Hennessy : Our operating margins in the consumer group were up 40 basis points in the quarter for the year. We said that the Lowe's business is fairly neutral. It's not accretive or dilutive this year. How with all the sales could you get the operating margin up? So I think you can imagine what kind of increase that has. That's really where -- I think it's a great positive story that again integration from Comex is creating that kind of value that the Lowe's business at close to zero operating margin is not affecting the total operating margins for the consumer. In fact, remember, at the beginning of the year many people thought that the Consumer Group would go backwards in operating margins because of that Lowe's business. Ivan Marcuse : Great. And just a quick question probably for Sean, this is for you. Interest expense, if I did the math right, it looks like that was down a little bit. Why did interest expense jump and what would you sort of expect the run rate and is there any plans to add that, et cetera? Sean Hennessy : Yes. In the month of July we issued bonds, took out the short-term debt. We issued $800 million at effectively 4%. That's $32 million. When you look at next year we expect that our interest expense will be higher as we term that out. You can imagine we were paying 20, 22 basis points for that $800 million in the short-term market and now we're at 4% with that, but we expect -- what we said is we think our interest expense will be up. In fact, Marybeth asked this question a couple quarters ago and that's about 20% next year. Ivan Marcuse : The interest expense will be up 20%? Sean Hennessy : Yes. Ivan Marcuse : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli & Co. Rosemarie Morbelli : Good morning everyone and congratulations. Since most of the questions or all of the questions have been asked about the operations in the third quarter, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your new announcement, you're paint shield and give us a feel for the market size, how unique which may not be that unique, to have something. Can you touch on that particular basis? John Morikis : Well, actually no one has a product like this. This is a very unique and exclusive and patented technology and it is a product that we are very proud of. The market size that you asked, it's a little hard to define as we're finding more and more opportunities for this. We look for the opportunities in schools, athletic facilities, in senior care facilities and hospitality settings, even in residential areas, wherever these infectious bacteria may exist we feel as though this product offers an application. And in a nutshell what we have here is our Company has successfully suspended compound in a paint product that will kill bacteria. It's very unique. If you look at the issues, the hospital space, it's quite an issue. The product that we have will kill 99.9% of staph, MRSA, E. coli, and a couple of other bacteria that really pose a serious challenge to our hospital and these other areas that we mentioned. To develop a product that does not just inhibit these microbes but actually kills bacteria is very unique and it's the first EPA registered product of its kind. So, there might be other products, but nothing like this. Rosemarie Morbelli : So you say EPA registered is that -- how do you go through that process? Is that similar to FDA or do you take already an approved bug killer, I can't pronounce any of those, that has been already approved and then you only need the EPA to approve the fact that you can actually put it in your paint? John Morikis : No. And the way you go through this is very painfully would be my answer. It took us a number of years and quite an effort on our team's part. We are very proud of our team and the process that they went through. So, it is a product that is, as I mentioned, EPA registered. It's the first microbicidal paint that kills these bacteria. It lasts up to four years. We really believe this is a game changer in the industry. We're very excited about it. We had a wonderful launch yesterday and we're really looking forward to the opportunity that this product will present. Rosemarie Morbelli : And you can't share more or less what your anticipation, revenues that can be generated from this product over the next I don't know, three or five years? John Morikis : We just do not disclose that type of information. We're very excited though, I will say that. We're very excited. Rosemarie Morbelli : Otherwise you wouldn't do it. John Morikis : That's fair. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you very much for your help. Operator : Our next question comes from Jay McCanless of Sterne, Agee. Jay McCanless : Good morning, guys. First question I had is, and this is going back to the oil and gas and the protective, when the oil prices starting rolling over last fall did you see the gallons start to roll off at the same time or was there a lag effect and has that carried through to the last two to three quarters while oil prices have been coming down? John Morikis : I would say there was a little bit of a lag. We didn't see it immediately, but it has accelerated recently. Jay McCanless : Okay. And then could you disclose for global what percentage of that is going to be under the protective and marine and petrochemical, what percentage of revenues? Sean Hennessy : Yes. We don't break that out, but I will tell you the majority of that is actually in the Service Group. Jay McCanless : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. John Roberts : Chris, my thanks as well. Was all of the HGTV sales in the quarter sell-through or was there still some sell into the channel going on? Sean Hennessy : There was no sell in, it was all selling out. It was through. There was no loading in. John Roberts : And then some of your competitors talked about significant destocking in the retail channel at the end of the season. Were your gains in spite of seeing that or did you really not see much of that? Sean Hennessy : We didn't see that. John Roberts : You didn't see it. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Wong of Morningstar. David Wong : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I just had one since a lot of them have been asked already. Can you give us a sense of your operating leverage that you discussed. Can you remind us what portion of your costs are fixed versus variable, especially on the SG&A line? Sean Hennessy : On the SG&A line we've always said that a high percentage of our SG&A is fixed and we've always said that because we wouldn't open a store without a manager, assistant manager, the right to staffing model. When we open a store we consider a lot of that fixed and that's how we manage a company. We say if we're going to open a store, probably when I sit there and look at it, the way we look at it, almost 90% of it is fixed, 10% is variable. David Wong : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Nils- Bertil Wallin : Thanks and good morning, just about. I had a question on your top-line expectations for the fourth quarter. Obviously this year-on-year for the third quarter was kind of flattish and you're assuming some sort of growth maybe mid single-digits in the fourth quarter. What's the cause of that inflection point? Sean Hennessy : I think if you look at the way, and we're guesstimating here on the foreign currency, but if you remember, fourth quarter is when it really started to fall off. If you think about the value of the dollar just jumped in the fourth quarter, so we comparisons get better, we don't think the currencies may get stronger, but just the comparisons get better. So we're seeing that. And just looking at the business and where we're at in the other areas. Someone said it earlier, even though there was a lag we did start seeing some of the protective and marine in the fourth quarter being negatively affected. We think those are the reasons you see the 1/10 going up to the mid low single digits. Nils- Bertil Wallin : Understood. On the HGTV and Lowe's I know another participant asked about the buy one get one free, and I believe that was in the third quarter. It's continuing into the fourth quarter, so I'm just curious how you think about that in terms of brand recognition, brand quality. Will this type of discounting cause you to rethink how the brand will be positioned next year? John Morikis : Again, this would be a better discussion for Lowe's. Their pricing of that product is something that they determine. Nils- Bertil Wallin : Okay. And then just finally I guess in Global Finishes there was some degree of organic of weakness. Is there any market share shifts happening because others who are in the refinish business seem to still see some growth there? John Morikis : In the automotive refinish business I'd say we do see some pressure there. There's a great deal of consolidation that's taken on in that space. We have found ourselves on the wrong side of some of the transactions that have taken place, so we felt a some pressure in our market share. Nils- Bertil Wallin : And how do expect to address that? John Morikis : Well, every day we're trying to address that. Our products and our services we think are good. We are trying to align ourselves with the right customers and ensure that the introductions that we have of both new products and our people are in the right place doing the right things at the right time. Nils- Bertil Wallin : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Bob Wells for any closing remarks. Bob Wells : Thank you again, Carrie. As always, I will be available for the balance of today, tomorrow, and throughout the coming week to answer your follow-up questions. I would like to thank you again for joining us this morning and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your line. Have a great day.",

In the interest of time, we provided some balance sheet items and other select financial information on our website www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations January 28 press release. Our consolidated sales in the fourth quarter increased 1.4%, $2.6 billion, due entirely to higher paint sales volume through our Paint Stores and Consumer Groups. For the full year, sales increased 1.9% to $11.34 billion. Unfavorable currency translation decrease consolidated net sales 3.6% in the quarter and 3.3% for the full year. Consolidated gross profit in the fourth quarter increased $104.3 million to $1.3 billion and gross margin expanded to 50.8% of sales from 47.4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, gross margin increased to 49% of sales from 46.4% of sales last year. The increase in gross margin in the quarter and full year was due primarily to volume driven supply chain productivity and lower year-over-year raw material costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $6.1 million to $991.5 million in the fourth quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 38.1% from 38.3% in the same quarter last year. For the full year 2015, SG&A expense increased $90.6 million to $3.91 billion, an increase as a percent of sales to 34.5% from 34.3% in 2014. Incremental SG&A to support the new HGTV Home program at Lowe\u2019s, and new store openings and sales territory additions accounted for the majority of the SG&A increase in the year. Other general expense decreased $12.6 million in the fourth quarter and $7.2 million for the year due primarily to lower environmental expenses in both periods. Interest expense for the quarter increased $4.1 million to $19.5 million. For the year, interest expense was $61.8 million compared to $64.2 million in 2014. Profit before tax in the fourth quarter increased 57.4% to $297.2 million, and for the full year, increased 23.1% to $1.55 billion. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2015 increased to 33.4% from 29.7% in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, our effective tax was 32% compared to 31.2% in 2014. Consolidated net income for the quarter increased $65.3 million to $198 million. For the year, net income increased $188 million to $1.05 billion. Net income as a percent of sales in the quarter increased to 7.6% from 5.2% last year for the year net income as a percent of sales increased to 9.3% from 7.8% in 2014. Diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter 2015 increased to $2.12 from $1.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, diluted net income per common share increased 27.1% to $11.16 per share from $8.78 per share in 2014. Now let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 5.9% to $1.68 billion, thanks to higher architectural paint sales volumes across all customer segments. For the year, net sales increased 5.2% to $7.21 billion. This full year sales increase was also driven by higher architectural paint sales volumes across all customer segments. Comparable store sales increased 5.1% in the quarter and 4.2% in the year. Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Mid-west divisions led all divisions, followed by Eastern division, Southeastern division and Southwestern term division. Fourth quarter segment profit for Paint Stores Group increased 27.8% to $316.1 million, due primarily to higher year-over-year paint sales volumes. For the full year, Paint Stores Group profit increased 19.3% to $1.43 billion from $1.2 billion in 2014. The increase in segment profit for the year resulted from higher paint sales volumes that were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. Segment profit margin for the fourth quarter increased to 18.9% from 15.6% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2015 increased to 19.9% from 17.5% in 2014. Turning now to Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased 13.6% to $314.6 million. For the year, Consumer Group sales increased 11.1% to $1.58 billion. Most of the increase in sales for the fourth quarter and full year was from the HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams Paint program at Lowe\u2019s. Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 67.9% to $50.9 million from $30.3 million in fourth quarter 2014. For the year, segment profit increased 22.1% to $308.8 million from $252.9 million in 2014.  Consumer Group\u2019s segment profit as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter increased to 16.2% from 11% last year. For the year, segment profit margin increased to 19.6% from 17.8% last year. Most of the improvement in both fourth quarter and full year segment profit margins was from volume driven operating efficiencies. For our Global Finishes Group, fourth quarter net sales in U.S. dollars decreased 9.5% to $454.8 million and full year sales decreased 7.9% to $1.92 billion due primarily to unfavorable currency translation. Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 7.1% in the quarter and 7.5% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Global Finishes Group segment profit in the fourth quarter increased to $50.6 million from $39 million last year. The increase in segment profit in the quarter resulted from the good expense control and lower year-over-year raw material costs that were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which reduced segment profit $4.8 million. For the year, segment profit increased four tenths of a percent to $201.9 million from $201.1 million last year. This full year profit improvement resulted from good expense control and lower raw material costs that were mostly offset by unfavorable currency translations of $26.5 million. As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group\u2019s operating profit was 11.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 7.8% last year, and 10.5% for the year compared to 9.7% in 2014. For our Latin America Coatings Group, net sales decreased 23.5% to $158.7 million in the fourth quarter and decreased 18.2% to $631 million for the full year, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices. Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 21.4% in the quarter and 19.3% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group segment profit in the quarter decreased to $2.8 million from $13 million last year. For the year, segment profits decreased to $18.5 million from $40.5 million in 2014. The decline in segment profit in both the quarter and the year was primarily due to unfavorable currency translations and lower volume sales, partially offset by selling price increases. Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $5.3 million in the quarter and $16 million in the full year. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 1.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 6.3% last year, and 2.9% for the year compared to 5.2% in 2014. That concludes the review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2016. John? John Morikis : Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As we announced last October, on January 1 of this year, I assumed the duties of Chief Executive Officer. Back in 1971, British Rock Band THE WHO recorded the now famous lyric, Meet the new boss, Same as the old boss. In our case, the same may not hold true literally in every respect. But it is certainly true when it comes to our mutual confidence in the Company\u2019s strategy, our focus on growing market share through superior products and execution. Our adherence to key performance metrics like return on net assets employed. And net operating cash to sales and our shareholder friendly capital allocation. These are the things that will define the value of Sherwin-Williams in the years ahead. And I believe they are all moving in the right direction. 2015 was a year of ups and downs. Our full year revenue of $11.3 billion set a new record for the Company, but are well short of our original expectations. One reason for this was stronger currency headwinds than originally anticipated. Another was the weaker than expected demand for industrial coatings in certain categories. Particularly those used to maintain oil and gas production and storage assets. And in the middle two quarters of 2015, we broke our long standing practice of not giving weather reports on earnings calls as heavy rainfall across much of the country clearly affected paint demand. This lower than expected revenue performance however, did not translate to lower than expected profit or cash flow. Our full year profit before tax, net income, earnings per share and net operating cash, all met or exceeded the expectations we set back in January 2015. Net income eclipsed $1 billion in 2015 for the first time in our Company\u2019s history. This strong profitability in cash generation was largely due to the successful and accelerated integration of the Comex stores and consolidation of Comex manufacturing assets coupled with volume driven sales supply chain productivity in North America, good SG&A expense control and raw material cost tailwinds. Looking ahead, we expect the year-over-year incremental margin benefit from the Comex integration to diminish as we go through 2016. Architectural paint sales through our Paint Stores picked up momentum in the fourth quarter but was again offset to some degree by negative volumes in protective and marine coatings. Sales to residential leasing contractors continued to grow at double-digit paces. Sales volumes to the new construction markets and DIY customers also increased compared to last year, but at a full place than residential repaint. In total, Paint Source Group grew fourth quarter revenues by just under 6% with architectural paint volume growth outpacing revenues. In the fourth quarter, we opened 38 net new stores bringing our full year store opening total to 83 new locations. And our total store count at year-end to 4,086 stores in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. We\u2019ve remained confident that our next milestone of 5,000 locations in North America is realistic and we intend to get closer to that goal by 90 to 100 stores this year. Consumer Group also turned in a solid performance for the year. The launch of the HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams Paint program at Lowe\u2019s was one reason, but we also saw strong sales growth from another valued home center partner [indiscernible]. As a result Consumer Group\u2019s business grew by low-single digit percentage space in the fourth quarter. Markets and economic conditions outside North America continue to be very challenging. Sales volumes in most Latin American countries fluctuated modestly compared to fourth quarter of 2014, and with the exception of Brazil where volumes and revenues declined significantly. The impact of currency devaluation once again was worse than anticipated in the quarter. Global Finishes Group also felt the brunt of softening industrial coatings demand and deteriorating currencies in both Europe and Latin America, but made progress in offsetting these effects through tight SG&A control. In 2015, we generated record net operating cash of $1.45 billion, thanks in part to the terrific working capital management by all of our operating segments. In spite of the incremental working capital required to support the HGTV Home program at Lowe\u2019s, our working capital ratio at year-end dropped to 8.6% of sales from 10.1% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $963.5 million compared to $665.7 million last year. We used this cash from operations to fund capital expenditures increased our dividend and buyback shares for treasury. Our capital expenditures in 2015 totaled $234 million. Depreciation for the year was $170 million, and amortization was $28 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $185 million to $200 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects. In 2015, we\u2019ve returned more than $1.28 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 1 million shares of the Company\u2019s stock for treasury, bringing our full year to 3.575 million shares at an average cost of $278.57 per share, and a total investment of just over $1 billion. At year-end, we have remaining authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. We paid $249.6 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2015 marked our 37th consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a stream we intend to continue. This year, at our February meeting of the Board of Directors, we will recommend approval of an annual dividend of $3.36 per share, an increase of more than 25% over 2015. Looking ahead to 2016, the demand for paint and coatings in most domestic markets looks encouraging. Growth in residential starts and existing home turnover was solid throughout 2015 and the outlook for 2016 is equally encouraging. Although, contracts for new non-residential projects dipped slightly in 2015, it was still a strong year in absolute terms, which bodes well for paint demand in the segment. Outside the U.S., it appears likely that sluggish market conditions and currency devaluation particularly in Europe and many Latin American countries will remain a challenge. Our raw material basket has many moving parts. But in total, we believe we\u2019re likely to see lower year-over-year input cost in 2016. The continuing fall in the price of crude oil will no doubt have a positive impact on these petrochemical side of the raw material basket. But these commodities will not necessarily move in linear relationship with crude. The price of high-grade chloride TiO2 continued to slide over the back half of 2015, due to weak global demand and over capacity, but bottom. Based on these factors, we would expect average year-over-year raw material cost for the paint and coatings industry to be down in the mid-single digit range in 2016. Our outlook for first quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the low-single digit percentage range compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share, compared to $1.38 per share earned in the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect net sales will increase in the low-single digit percentage range compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2016 will be in the range of $12.20 to $12.40 per share, compared to $11.16 in 2015. Again, I like to thank you for sharing \u2013 yes, being with us this morning. And now we\u2019d like to - be happy to open up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Good morning, guys. John Morikis : Good morning, John. John Roberts : John, I think, one of the big tip on that. \u201cThe Who\u201d album was won\u2019t get pulled again. On that note, what is your thinking about raw materials, given the volatility in oil as your guidance assuming relatively, conservatively not much benefits here it\u2019s going to take some time for oil to work its way down the supply chain? Bob Wells : John, this is Bob. We think that there could be some benefit in the petrochemical side of the basket maybe as much as we saw in 2015. We think that, we saw a pretty big move in TiO2 in 2015 and we\u2019re unlikely to see that figure move in 2016. So mid-single-digit I think is a reasonable outlook for the industry. And well as we usually develop a catch as we go through the year. John Roberts : And then, it is 83 store openings per year for the Paint Stores segment, is that right rated to be a kind of steady state there? John Morikis : Yes. I think there\u2019s about average for us. Will adjust that as we go but I think that\u2019s about where we want to run. John Roberts : Okay. Thank you. Bob Wells : Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mehul Dalia : Hi. Good morning and this is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing? John Morikis : Hi, Mehul. Mehul Dalia : First up, 4Q same store sales is an acceleration over 2Q and 3Q, so just wanted to know what changed and how did the non-architectural piece perform on a relative basis compared to the previous two quarters. Sean Hennessy : If you look at the \u2013 this is Sean Hennessy. And so I\u2019ll take first \u2013 the second part first. I think that non-paint sales performed fairly well. I think that consistently throughout the year, we had a nice year in the non-paint sales but they accelerated also. I think that the Paint Store Group had a very nice quarter and there is chance have we don\u2019t usually talk about weather, but the maybe weather helped us a little bit. But I think that what\u2019s when you look at the second and third quarter versus fourth quarter. We did use weather in the second and third quarter. Thank you. You see parts of that. Mehul Dalia : Got it. Also what\u2019s your estimate how the industry grew in the U.S. how it changed on perspective in 2015 and what are your expectations for 2016. Bob Wells : Yes. Mig, this is Bob. We have very few data sources to go to help us with estimates of industry volume. The American Coating Association models industry volume over the course of year. They currently stand at an estimate of 5.5% growth for 2015, we think they are a little high. We were thinking more in the 3% to 3.5% range but as we collect more data, year-end data, we'll kind of fine-tune that outlook but I think it's likely the industry will end up in the 3% to 3.5% range. Mehul Dalia : And your expectation for 2016 similar 3% to 3.5%? Bob Wells : It could be a little stronger than that. It depends on the weather patterns relative to last year, but that's not a bad range. Mehul Dalia : Great, and just one last one before I turn it over. With the three selling season, quickly approaching, can you talk about some of the lessons learned at Lowe's in 2015 and if any strategy shift or anything that you guys are going to do in 2015. Thank you. John Morikis : Yes. I don't think there is a strategy shift at all. I think lessons learned include the importance of being very responsive obviously to our customers. Really working well with associates in the aisles and helping them to be successful and knowledgeable in our products. So I think we've got a very good strategy there. I think we've got a very good relationship there and I think we're working very hard to be the best customer there as we do with all of our customers. Mehul Dalia : Great, thank you so much. John Morikis : Thanks, Mehul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson : Yes, question for Sean just on gross margin. Just when we think it can't get any better it does, so particularly in the fourth quarter. So I'm wondering how much of that was volume driven was there any sort of true up against your standard cost [indiscernible] turned out to be lower than you originally thought when you made the estimate on standard costing. And what's been your outlook for next year if you in the year on a 50.8% gross margin that signal a pretty strong performance as we get into the paint season this year? Sean Hennessy : Yes. Don, if you take a look at that 340 basis points approximately half of that was due to the paint volume increases for our North American supply chain. That's really the number one thing that drove it. That also includes integration of that Comex business that has been a nice piece of that. Also you have to remember the mix because of the foreign currency exchange. As U.S. becomes bigger and bigger piece of that, of our total sales, our paint store group does have the highest gross margin. So that helps on the other piece. Now having said that LIFO is always trying to catch what you think is going to happen with the laws and the way the raws came in a was a slight help from the LIFO. LIFO did help us especially in the Consumer Group and also a little bit in the Storage Group. If you take a look about the long-term, in the long-term I think we try to give you guidance what we think is long-term we think probably our long-term when you look at the makeup of the company and where we are going is in the mid-47 to the mid-49s. I think that again when that foreign currency changes around instead of being at 80% U.S. in North American sales you\u2019re going to start seeing that come down back into the 70s, that will have the reverse impact on the gross margin so when we feel like we\u2019re running at a normal area we think we are going to be in the 47.5% to 49.5% gross margin. Don Carson : Sean, what was the LIFO adjustment either in dollars or percentage terms? Sean Hennessy : We are not going to break that out. I would tell you that it was a help because you asked that question I wanted to point that out but it\u2019s not enough that we\u2019re going to put it in the K. Don Carson : Alright, thank you. Bob Wells : Thanks, Don. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. PJ Juvekar : Hi, good morning. Bob Wells : Good morning PJ. PJ Juvekar : Just on follow up on HGTV rollout that you had last year I understand that you were delayed in some stores and then you had a wet spring so given on that last year what are your expectations for this year in terms of volume growth and what are your margins for HGTV paint? Sean Hennessy : I\u2019m going to jump in real quick. I just want to remind everyone we\u2019ve over the years have been very careful not to break out customer P&Ls and because of the differentiating factor of HGTV in 2015 we try to give you some guidance but we really don\u2019t have any kind of plans to break the sales or the absolute gross margins or the operating margins. We think it\u2019s in our core now and you\u2019re going to see it going on in the future but so from that standpoint I think we are going to shy away from giving that customer specific P&L but John you might want to comment? On the sales side I think we expect. John Morikis : As I mentioned, we are working closely with all levels of Lowe\u2019s, and we\u2019re feeling good about the momentum as I mentioned. I think it\u2019s a matter of execution now and as I said we\u2019re going to focus on being the best partner we can for them and every customer that we have. PJ Juvekar : And John, you have just under 4,100 stores today and you said 5,000 is the target is that a saturation point for you in terms of numbers of stores and when do you think you might get there? Thank you. John Morikis : Let me be clear 5000 is not our target, it\u2019s a milestone. And I often say that \u2013 I refer to it because it\u2019s between 4000 and our next number 6000 and so we\u2019re going to stop at 5000 on the way. We don\u2019t see a saturation point. We continue to add stores each of our district managers maintain a real estate strategy and a plan to continue to invest in their stores and there\u2019s not a one of them that is raised their hand to say that the and really see no additional markets that they can add to. It\u2019s our expectations that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in those markets and continue to penetrate the opportunities in those markets and we are excited about that. PJ Juvekar : Is there a particular area where you want to add stores? John Morikis : We are obviously looking at the West Coast. We shared with the community here that we look at households per paint store and we see a terrific opportunity in the West area of the country and again we remain very confident in this model. This model in our ability to grow market share and to grow our operating leverage as we grow that incremental volume that gives us that confidence. PJ Juvekar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Good morning, fellows. John Morikis : Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer : In question there\u2019s a number of ways just to triangulate it, but if you look at it Q4 you delivered and in the Q1 that you\u2019ve guided to just take the mid-point in extrapolate that through 2016 there\u2019s a disconnect between how good those quarters were and kind of where the mid-point is for 2016. Is there something in the back three quarters where there\u2019s a little bit a step down that we should take into account or is that just a good case of conservatism? John Morikis : No, I think when you look at it way you just guided us to I think the first quarter, I just want to remind you in Consumer Group because of the HGTV expenses if you remember the SG&A expenses \u2013 we had a jump in the first quarter and we pointed out last year that that was going to be 100% SG&A, zero sales. So I think this year we\u2019re going to have relatively close to the same amount of SG&A but some sales going against it so. I think that helped us. I think if you look over two years I think the first quarter would look more normal to you and would probably look more like the other three quarters we have in the guidance. Duffy Fischer : Okay great. And then one of the issues in 2015 was it seems like your customers were running up against their bandwidth as far as just the number of painters they could employ. Is your sense that they have been able to expand their paint force and therefore the opportunity for more sales is bigger this year in the U.S? John Morikis : That\u2019s improved to some degree. It\u2019s hard to put your fingers exactly on that but I\u2019d say in the market I think it\u2019s gotten a little better. Duffy Fischer : Okay great. Thanks fellows. John Morikis : Thank you, Duffy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort : Hi, John. Good morning. John Morikis : Good morning, Bob. Bob Koort : I was curious what your appetite was for spending money down in South America opportunistically and what\u2019s going on down there or maybe there\u2019s a little bit of greater fear about forging ahead more aggressively what are your thoughts on? John Morikis : I think there\u2019s a little difference everywhere. I think that two years ago we were really nervous about putting money down in Argentina. And when you think about the exchange rate now with 13 times you look at Chile now they\u2019ve changed their government out, so we feel okay investing in Chile. Recovery long-term we still feel good about Brazil but we\u2019re watching both of those governments and seeing what happens with some of the policies down there. If the right opportunity would appear we would actually buy it. I think that we still are looking at the long-term, but I think on the marginal investments we\u2019ve been very careful on what we\u2019re going to spend down there. When I say marginal I\u2019m not talking about distribution, or manufacturing, or marketing. I think more on the admin side, system sides those kinds of sides how much working capital will allow it to grow and so forth. We\u2019re watching it. We feel good about that. We\u2019re still cash positive each and every country and that really helps us stay the course. But, we think eventually it might be a while it was interesting we were going through what we went through in the late 80s and early 90s when we actually had to do inflationary accounting in South America which I had to look at some of the rules like it had been so long. We take a look at this spot and we\u2019re watching these things but we\u2019re being careful on the margins. Bob Koort : In a follow-up, what are you seeing in results in Canada given the commodity influence growth rates there and what you see the path forward for 2016? John Morikis : Okay, we don\u2019t break it by region but I could say directionally as you would expect the oil and gas market there has experience the pressure that one would expect. We are growing in the market our acquisitions of the brand that came along with Comex general paint are in the process of integrating that in and we\u2019re really excited about the momentum we\u2019re gaining up there. On the architectural side we are continuing to grow the Protective and Marine side we continue to see some pressure. Bob Koort : Got it, thanks so much. John Morikis : Thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with our question. Vincent Andrews : Thanks I\u2019ve got a few quick ones. Starting with the fourth quarter you beat the consensus estimate by about $0.18 and I couldn\u2019t help noticing that your guidance range for the entirety of 2016 is about $0.20, so I\u2019m just wondering why the range seems so narrow for 2016. Maybe we could start there? Bob Wells : If you took a look at the guidance we gave at the beginning of 2015 about a year ago we gave you $0.20 and $10.90 to $11.10. I think we\u2019ve changed this spend many, many times. Back in 2009 we gave you a guidance range of $1. I think there\u2019s been a lot of moving parts but I think that we feel confident that we\u2019re able to \u2013 whether it happens, adjust to different things I would think we\u2019re going to be able to get that kind of improvement. Vincent Andrews : Okay and then on your tax rate in the fourth quarter stepped up a bit. How should we think about that tax rate in 2016? Bob Wells : Yes. I think that when we take a look at it the full year was about 32.1%. I think it\u2019s going to be approximately right around that number to maybe - if it comes in at 31.5% or 32.5% I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And then lastly what\u2019s on the guidance you have an FX headwind baked in there? Bob Wells : Yes. We do. just think about how the Brazilian real, even the Canadian dollar we are talking about before we definitely have a foreign currency. Foreign currency when you take a look at 2015 was much higher than we originally expected because I think everybody knows how the currencies are going and we thought it was prudent we definitely have foreign currency headwind in there. Vincent Andrews : And how much is it? Bob Wells : We don\u2019t break that out. Because there are so many different currencies and so forth but it\u2019s significant. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thanks very much. Bob Wells : Thanks, Vincent. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks, good morning guys. Bob Wells : Good morning Arun. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning. I just had a couple of questions. Following questions on the guidance topic can you help us understand maybe what you were thinking as far as architectural and paint stores and then the other segments on the top line basis looks like you\u2019re guiding to low single digits for the full Company. Do you expect more of the same i.e. weakness in Protective and Marine and our performance in architectural? Bob Wells : I will tell you that, when we look at our guidance I think the fourth quarter is pretty interesting. Total we were at 1.4% sales gain, Store Group was 5.9% so four times what we thought that we are going to be at. I think that currency other things, I think that, we don\u2019t break out our guidance by segment but I think that to give you some indication that tells you where we think the growth is going to be John Morikis : But we do see to your point the issue of Protective and Marine we expect that pressure is going to continue for the foreseeable future. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. And then, this is just as a follow-up on the raw side obviously some decline incremental in 3Q and 4Q. If I go through the math I guess you expect that to continue to be a benefit in 2016. Is there any reason why we shouldn\u2019t expect a nice benefit on the raw side and maybe you could just elaborate on the oil versus TiO2? Bob Wells : Yes. Arun, and this is Bob. We do expect to continue to see benefit from raw materials and we\u2019ve commented that on the oil side it does take longer for a drop in propylene and ethylene to work its way through the acrylic chain and actually get to market. So there\u2019s probably more tailwind on that side of the basket in the year to come than there is on the TiO2 side. TiO2 took a pretty sharp drop in the back half of last year. We\u2019ll see that obviously the benefit of that in the first half of this year but TiO2 is approaching kind of its historic starting place of $100 pound on the spot market. So we don\u2019t necessarily see a lot of further runway for TiO2 to decline. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Just one more thing up I can get in on the share buyback side what you are guys expecting to do in 2016? Thanks Bob Wells : I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent with our cash utilization and I think that we feel pretty good about the cash generation of the Company. I think we\u2019ve been consistently generating cash and strong cash over the last 15 or so years and I\u2019m going back to when we took, we\u2019re put into these jobs. I think you\u2019re going to see us continue to invest in the business in CapEx in new stores and so forth. I think that we\u2019re going to pay out dividends. You heard the dividend going over $3.30. And then, when we look at acquisitions and we\u2019re going to look at buying back stock and I would tell you I\u2019d be surprised if we were holding cash at the end of next year. Arun Viswanathan : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Arun. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Chris Senyek : Hi this is actually Chris on for Aram. Bob Wells : Hey, Chris. Chris Senyek : I had a couple questions. One is housekeeping. Can you give us the gross profit segment by segment by any chance? Sean Hennessy : Sure. Just give me one second here. Paint Store Group was up $97.8 million in the quarter. Consumer Group $27.5 million. Global Finishes Group was down $4.8 million and Latin America was down $15.1 million. Chris Senyek : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just want to dig in a few brief questions in terms of Global Finishes, so what you attribute like a sudden step up and profitability obviously GM is going help a little bit but what made major improvements did you put on the cost side and how sustainable is that in the next several quarters? Sean Hennessy : Right. When we look at that Global Finishes Group in the fourth quarter was up 29% it was the operating profit was really driven by SG&A expense control. And favorable raw material costs which more than offset the negative currency because they had to go against currency also and I would tell you we feel pretty good about this SG&A savings that we have. I will tell you years ago when this Global Finishes Group was operating at 3% to 3.5% after we bought the Becker, Sayerlack and Inchem acquisitions, we said eventually we felt that could run at 12% and so we think that we\u2019re at a pretty good spot. We think in the future a lot of that improvement has come from those efficiencies we are going to get and I think in the future it\u2019s going to be driven by market share gains and sales gains. John Morikis : Team there has done a really nice job of streamlining the noncustomer facing functions and give their team a lot of credit for continuing to focus on that. Chris Senyek : Okay. Great. And this one quick one. You called out in the \u2013 one potential reason for strength in the consumer segment was there something going on there in terms of a new program launch or you can name it from that what kind of drove that strength? Sean Hennessy : We have a very good relationship with a very good customer there. And so we are continuing to focus our efforts there as I mentioned earlier we want to be the best supplier to each of our customers and so we\u2019ve really just tried to listen to a very good customer being responsive and help them grow and that\u2019s our game plan. Chris Senyek : Alright, great. All thanks. Thanks again. John Morikis : Welcome Chris Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Scott Rednor : Hi. Good morning. Sean Hennessy : Good morning, Scott. Scott Rednor : I just want a better understand the planning assumption for 2016 you guys posted 27% earnings growth last year and over the past four years it\u2019s been about 20% to 25% on average in this year that you are guiding to 10%. despite the fact you continue to feel good about the architectural paint market and raw material tailwind so I guess there is an offset from Comex not being as accretive but what else is in the budget that we should consider that should contribute to lower earnings throughout the share? Sean Hennessy : I think that the FX headwinds, where I would say be a little more our estimate is a little stronger than it was going into last year. I think that Comex was a really strong one and I think you heard Bob\u2019s comments about raw materials. Even though they are going to be a nice tailwind I don\u2019t see the tailwind being as strong in 2016 as it was in 2015. Scott Rednor : And now you guys done on Comex. I thought the previously Comex you had a multi-year runway so what inning are you in with that integration? Sean Hennessy : I would say we are in inning eight. That the bottom of the eighth and the home team is winning big. I think we\u2019re going to see it, we were able to accelerate it. John Morikis : Who we do sort out the \u2013 we are continuing to invest in the store transitions over team Sherwin so Sean\u2019s point largely on the supply chain side I think that team did a terrific job and we\u2019ve clearly moved some of that up from what we have expected to see in 2016 into 2015. And we were successful also on the store side but there\u2019s still some work to do on the store side and that\u2019s what we are working on here as we roll into 2016. Scott Rednor : Great. Very helpful. And just one last one for you Sean. The cash flow conversation for sales, that you guys kind of talked to investment community about it, right around 13% this year is that is it something unusual or is that kind of the new run rate of the company going forward? Sean Hennessy : I think we were helped with if you look at the working capital again we define working capital as receivables plus, inventory minus payable was driven all the way down to 8.6% and I would tell you that our long-term goal is to reduce that working capital as a percent of sales. So that we can go from 10% to 11% and the long-term cash as a conversation from sales and I will tell that our working capital at 8.6%. our inventory is in great shape. Our receivables are in great shape but I think our payables were favorably impacted by timing of some payments year-over-year. So I think that our payables, the accounts payable will be lower next year which will raise the working capital backup into that, our more near-term target of about 10% of sales. So I think the 13% is nice and I think it was just because of the timing of payments. I think you\u2019re going to see us going back in that 10% to 11% of sales in the future. Scott Rednor : Great. Nice quarter, guys. Thanks for all the detail. Sean Hennessy : Thanks Scott. John Morikis : Thanks Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks. I had a couple hopefully housekeeping follow-ups it sounds like - do you give a number for what raws were down in 2015 and love that and also buyback is or isn\u2019t in the guidance for EPS? Bob Wells : On the raw material question, Greg. We said that for the full year over 2014 raw materials would be down in the mid-single digits. In the back half we mentioned the fact it was trending a little higher than that or at the high-end of mid-single digits just due to the trajectory of materials over the course of the year. Greg Melich : And it sounds like given what Sean said that probably finish that the high-end so maybe down 6% or 7% the higher end of mid-single digits? Bob Wells : For the second half. Greg Melich : It\u2019s over 2015. We could that raws were down at high-end of mid-single digit. Bob Wells : Now for the full year, you\u2019d be in the mid singles. Greg Melich : You\u2019d still be in the singles but more in the back half. Got it. Bob Wells : Yes. Greg Melich : And then on the buyback and EPS? Bob Wells : We definitely have in our guidance some buybacks. We did not have any cash were not holding any cash in our guidance for the end of the year. Greg Melich : Okay. Great. And then really, I want to ask business it looks like that fourth quarter demand trend nice improvement with the comp. What was the volume comp when you packed out mix and what accounted for the acceleration if you think about it versus second and third quarter was it architectural was it maybe some of the other weaker businesses not being as weak? Sean Hennessy : It was largely the architectural, Greg and if you look at what we\u2019ve seen there clearly it\u2019s an improvement in third quarter over fourth quarter and we continue to be excited and encouraged by the comments we\u2019re hearing from many of our customers. Our home builders that saw a more mild weather which enabled them to catch up on some of the lost work days that were previously an issue. There\u2019s just a momentum there that we are working hard to make sure we capture more than our share. Greg Melich : And if you look ahead on the commercial side do you think the backlog there looks like acceleration as well? Sean Hennessy : The nonresidential side didn\u2019t slowdown in 2015 to 2014. What we feel as an absolute number it was still a good performance. Our relationship in this business as we look at the large commercial contractors and how we are positioned there we feel really good that with the market we\u2019ll grow well beyond behind what the market trends will grow. We\u2019ve got a very good position here. We work hard on every aspect from product specifications color and we expect to get again quite a bit of that share as we grow into 2016. Bob Wells : The other issue to keep in mind on the non-res new side is that there is a long lag between starts and paints in that market so starts were strong in 2014 and just down slightly in 2015 so that bodes pretty well for painting on new construction new nonresidential construction in 2016. Sean Hennessy : So if you look at residential repaint we been experiencing double-digit gains here for quite some time we\u2019ve got good momentum there good position in the commercial side and we expect as Bob mentioned that that pipeline is going to work in our direction. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot and good luck. Bob Wells : Thanks Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. Nils Wallin : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I believe you said that paint volume in the stores group was greater than revenues and revenue growth that is and so given your estimation of 3% or 4% overall growth for the paint gallons it suggests that you are probably taking share. How would you characterize those share gains? Are you actually seeing competitors close down or you just somehow that their growth is \u2013 there are not opening stores as fast as you are? And then finally, are you actually seeing any distributors kind of leave the business. Independent distributors? Sean Hennessy : Well. There are stores that close. It really varies by market. It\u2019s a very fragmented market and we compete with local competitors so each market is bit different and we often say inside our four walls that we don\u2019t discriminate by where we will grow our share. Some of them will be larger competitors and some of them might be smaller but our teams locally are focused on their customers that offer opportunity and it may be in any channel that they see those opportunities but they are really focused on growing and we\u2019re winning. We feel pretty good about the pace in which we are winning. Bob Wells : The other thing I would point out, we didn\u2019t commented on over the last couple of years we\u2019ve done very well with international accounts since the recession as a consolidated supplier base we are the only paint supplier that has a truly national footprint of contractor friendly outlets so that helped us a lot in that arena. Nils Wallin : Got it. And then where are you in terms of your capacity to supply the market? Do you anticipate you\u2019ll need to expand capacity in the next two to three years or it\u2019s maybe five years out? Sean Hennessy : I think that the when we take a look at the capacity I think our manufacturing footprint has been expanded each and every year from efficiencies. We\u2019ve taken a look at our capacity utilization. we\u2019re in nice shape. We went through a nice growth here we did an integration of Comex. We might see down the road five years where we might have to do some type of major expansion on our plant but in the short term here we don\u2019t have a game plan to open a new plant. Bob Wells : The teams are doing a really nice job as Sean mentioned in some of those investments might be on our billing line or something like that but we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s got a mindset of continuous improvement and they are working hard to capture additional capacity. Nils Wallin : And then just one final one, I know that stated all year some of the raw material headwinds in your Latin American coatings group is there any opportunity to change sourcing\u2019s that you don\u2019t have going forward. Sean Hennessy : I tell you why. What happens with most of the major raw materials. So 87% of raw materials where purchasing down there. Our purchase spend U.S. dollar, so when the raws go down mid-single-digit I will say five and then currencies fluctuates losses 25% to 30% such as in Brazil. your raws on a local basis are going to go up. That\u2019s really the big driver not sitting here saying can we go from one supplier to another. Nils Wallin : Got it. Thanks very much. Bob Wells : Thanks, Nils. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Cerankosky : Good afternoon, everyone. Sean Hennessy : Hi. Chuck. Chuck Cerankosky : Tomorrow afternoon. First John can you talk about where pricing might go in the Paint Stores Segment in 2016? John Morikis : Well, we\u2019ve not announced the price increase and Chuck as you know many years of falling us our first communication is to our customers and then we would quickly update you as quickly as we can but right now we\u2019ve not announced anything. Chuck Cerankosky : Should we assume that the shelf prices will at least be stable? John Morikis : Yes I\u2019d say that\u2019s a safe bet. Yes. Chuck Cerankosky : Okay. What about the interest rate in environment? Any comments on that about what it might be doing to end market demand specially on the architectural side, residential architectural side? John Morikis : I think Chuck. You\u2019ve seen a lot of projects. It\u2019s seems like people are still investing, the markets are open. The interest rates are low but we\u2019re watching the starts and so forth. I think it really comes down to if they can utilize these assets they are investing in them. Chuck Cerankosky : Now what are you referring to Sean when you say utilizing assets? Sean Hennessy : Whether it\u2019s commercial or people building multi-family dwellings and so forth that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Chuck Cerankosky : And then a question based on something you mentioned earlier the call you were integrating general paint in Canada, could you provide a little detail about that? Will that banner go away? John Morikis : Much like we did with every past acquisition that we\u2019ve done with every past acquisition we look at the customer base and the customer dictates to us the pace in which we move the Sherwin-Williams brand is the ultimate brand that we end up with. Some of these products then end up a sub brand inside our Sherwin-Williams stores. We are able to leverage the advertising and the communications that we have that promote the Sherwin-Williams brand once they become a Sherwin-Williams banner store. And so we move in that direction but we move at the pace that we are able to get through the tunnel and in short when we get to the other side that we have our customers with us. Chuck Cerankosky : And then in the guidance it sounds like Latin America Sean, you guys are being very cautious on everything from currency to the regional economies. Is there anything else that we should think about in terms of the Latin America segment? Sean Hennessy : No. I think you hit on them. I think that the basic business is again we're watching it. We have not forecast the Brazil is going to be robust economy next year Argentina will be. I think we'll see what happens in Chile. Mexico seems to be doing fine but I think when you look at some of these areas. There is a reason why the currency continues to devalue and I don't see Brazil being a positive this year. Chuck Cerankosky : All right. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks [indiscernible] Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you for taking my question after the timeframe just for me, John when you talk about being \u2013 Comex being at the bottom of the eighth inning whatever that means. Does that mean you are done about three quarters done in terms of the integration of what you want to do? John Morikis : Rosemarie, this is John. Because I was trying to make the point that John came back and said that on the operational side, on the admin side, on the systems side, the integration of raw materials and so forth. I would tell you we've completed that. Where the pieces that haven't been completed is what John said about the general paints and different pieces there. But inside United States, I would say all the operational and the reason I said bottom of the eighth is to referred that some of the incremental gains we expected were brought forward into 2015 and that's what I was referring to is the EPS gains. Sean Hennessy : Right. And so those improvements are now part of our everyday operations. We've taken those facilities out of the supply chain and now we're running those volumes through our existing plants and the additional point that I was making Rosemarie was that now our focus become how do we get the most throughput on each of those stores? Some that had transitioned earlier and some that were in the process now but now that they've been \u2013 many of them been converted to Sherwin stores, our opportunity to grow our sales in many segments that they weren't selling in the past become the opportunity moving forward. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you. That is helpful. And still in the Consumer Group last year, you were building the channel at Lowe's, so as the margin benefited from strong volume. Are we to expect a slightly lower volume because now it is really repurchasing a selling at the channel? John Morikis : I would say yes because 100% of the architectural paint we've sold to Lowe's last year was incremental. So and the other reason at our core we \u2013 that's definitely was 100% incremental this year. Last year in 2015 and 2016 will not be. Rosemarie Morbelli : So how much do you think it will cost you about 100 basis points or could be impact of the lower volume being higher than that? John Morikis : You know what, we will see but it's definitely going to \u2013 it will definitely be a reduction. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay, thanks. And on the Ti02 the producers have been announcing several price increases, they all seem to be getting their act together. Are you taking it or in part of your comments about the fact that now it's the bottom meaning a low floor or a beginning of price increases on the Ti02. John Morikis : Yes, Rosemarie. We often comment that these pricing cycles in Ti02 typically begin with pricing below $1 a pound. Oftentimes peak above $2 a pound and then settle back on the back end of the cycle below $1 a point again. We're hovering just above $1 a pound. And we realize that there's been price increase announcements in the market. Ultimately, the balance of supply and demand in the market will determine whether those increases our successful and we'll see, but it feels like we are approaching the bottom on the downside of this cycle. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. And you find that the supply demand is getting I mean could it be balance by the end of this year or that is too early and we need another couple of years. John Morikis : I think it's too early. It really depends on demand growth. Demand growth outside of North America has been very weak. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. And lastly if I may, could you bring us up-to-date on some of the press releases that you have published saying that you are working with Lowe's towards introducing other product lines. Can you give us a feel of what that is and then tell us how the antibacterial is doing? I know it's early, but. Bob Wells : Let me start with your question on the \u2013 on our product paint seal it's exciting new technology for us. It's the first EPA registered paint that kills 99% of these five specific infection causing bacteria that have been exposed for two hours and there's nothing like it in the market, nothing. And so we're excited about it. It actually lands and it begins to sell in our stores beginning February 1. So you are right. It is little bit early. We just finished up our sales meetings with our team where we've done some extensive training with our team on the product and we're really looking forward to it. We did launch it last year and the feedback from the medical community has just been outstanding. It's just terrific. We\u2019re very excited about it. So we're looking forward to a good year with the product. Rosemarie Morbelli : That is in the new category [indiscernible] Bob Wells : We\u2019re not in a position to talk to anything like new categories or new products. I think that\u2019s important that we respect our customer\u2019s position and anything that they might be launching we think should be coming from them. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, Rosemarie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Ivan Marcuse : Hi thanks. Just a real quick question in terms of 2015 the way I understand mix was a bit of a drag in terms of higher commercial volumes and lower protective and marine. 2016 within your sales guidance is mix, do we lapped that mix become sort of de-minimis or is that still a bit of an issue as commercial continues to grow and in the fact that continues to be a bit of a drag? Bob Wells : I think that it's going to be smaller than it was this year, but it still will be somewhat of a drag. Ivan Marcuse : Great, thanks. John Morikis : Thanks, Ivan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jay McCanless, Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question. Jay McCanless : Good morning, everyone. John Morikis : Good morning, Jay. Jay McCanless : I've heard you all make some comments about SG&A, but did you provide formal guidance on what we should expect for SG&A as a percentage of sales for 2016? John Morikis : No. We're basically giving you sales and EPS guidance. We didn't go down the factors of that. Jay McCanless : Okay, all right. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Jay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. John Morikis : Good morning, Eric. Eric Bosshard : The store comp in 2015 moved around more than we're used to seeing from an 8 or 9 to a 2 and now back to a 5. The question in terms of 2016, the factors that moved it around during 2015, can you just remind us of what those were and then how you think about that as it relates to 2016? Bob Wells : Yes, I think that one of the first thing and as John said that you won\u2019t repeat it. We usually did not talk about weather, but weather did impact that second and third and I believe the fourth quarter. We had some nice weather and I think that homebuilders have said that they caught up more than they thought they were going to in the fourth quarter and I think that's probably a very accurate statement. And I think that we're not expecting, we probably expecting a little more normal in that area. I would say that's probably the big driver. The second one is probably the labor and how the labor was working and I think John's comment earlier that our customers seem to feel that they are in a better situation with labor going into 2016 than 2015. Eric Bosshard : So I know you don't guide on a segment basis, but when you go through that it sounds like if more normal weather and more normal labor that I guess and your guidance wouldn't seem to imply that we're going back to 8s or 9s in the stores group. And so in terms of again the difference between what you are guiding in 2016 and the days of the 8s again what's the difference? Bob Wells : I would just say market. John Morikis : And if you go back five years price too. Price in a lot of those years. Bob Wells : Yes. John Morikis : And as long as raw materials are benign, you are unlikely to see a lot of price. Bob Wells : Yes. Eric Bosshard : Very good. Thank you. Bob Wells : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn : Well, now for sure, good afternoon, gentlemen. Very much for being so accommodating just a couple clarifications on the fourth quarter just make sure I understand the direction that the business is going. It sound like a Latin America, you saw a little bit faster volume declines. And I mean you complain about volumes being down offset by a higher pricing for a few quarters. But it looks like it was sort of way down in the fourth quarter. Is that sort of the pace of that we should expect to see there in 2016 in other words kind of a mid-single digit decline in organic growth of volume plus price? Bob Wells : I will just tell you right now, Demetri, you are right. We don\u2019t break this out. We didn't see that dramatic of the difference between the fourth quarter and the other quarters in the year. By country, you saw different things go back and forth. I would say it was the dramatic change in the Brazilian real and some of these things that hit us harder than what we thought they were going to be in the fourth quarter. And when you sit there and take a look at that we have to get some price back, back to the comments about where we are. So I think things are from when you sit down and look at that gallon number and the sales number, I think it had more to do with FX than it did for business. John Morikis : Yes, I would say that the one area that we clearly felt an impact, Dmitry was in that oil and gas and mining operations. We have a very good presence there and there's a lot of pressure there. Dmitry Silversteyn : Got you, got you, okay. Just question book keeping question for Sean, the tax rate expectations for 2016 about 32% same as 2015. Sean Hennessy : Yes. I think that \u2013 we've been in that range for probably 8 years to 10 years. And I could see us staying in that range. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay, very good. And then just on sort of the incremental margin and I know it's not the right way calculating. But I mean you've delivered like a 73% incremental margin in paint stores if you look at the change in revenue versus the change in profit dollars and as in the EBIT line and about 55% in the Consumer Group. Would lead me believe that a lot of your raw material benefit happened in the fourth quarter because I don't think your incremental margin really is that high, is that the right way to think about that? John Morikis : Yes, because if you think only about fourth quarter, gross margin it really came down to two things. Gross margin in SG&A and gross margin definitely had the larger impact in that SG&A. But don't discount that what we've been talking about with this Comex integration. I think that when you think about the expenses that were admin expenses, those kind of expenses we basically now at a nice run rate for all the different systems and admin expenses for Comex. Dmitry Silversteyn : Got it. One final question just on new store growth, you keep guiding to sort of the 100 stores a year or so. You get close in 2014 at about 95, you only get 3 this year. So what's holding you back from getting to that 100? Is it finding the right locations or some constraints on personal or sort of how should we think about your not exceeding 100 stores if you have 100 stores as a yearly average. John Morikis : It really does come down to a level of comfort that we have with the expansion and making sure that we have the human talent to be able to deliver on our promise. And so as we add the stores incrementally important if you will to have the right people at the right level to be able to deliver on every brand promise that we make. And we just feel that 85 to 100 range is the right range and you're going to see that fluctuate, sometimes it just in the timing of when they are going to hit. You might have a heavier first quarter or heavier fourth quarter, but that's a range that we just feel comfortable with. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, Dmitry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Perrella : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call. A real quick one, are you still taking 1% to 2% of Ti02 out of the formulations per annum or have you sort of had a technical limit with reductions. John Morikis : Yes. I think there's a lot of discussion about the formulation a couple years ago and the reaction for the rapid rise in titanium dioxide. But we said then that a lot of our formulation for depending contractor. And we know that 1% to 2% was put up there by some of the competitors we have and we said that we're pretty careful not to change the formulas of these were of courses in the products. Bob Wells : Yes, I like to make sure. We\u2019re very clear on that. The consistent for our product to our customers, we describe at this way, the closer than close enough for our customers. So we have had the opportunity to formulate for robustness that might modify the amount of Ti02 but the quality of our product is something that we will never ever put at risk. I mean the customers that come to buy our products are expecting a consistent product. Ti02 is a important part of that and the formulations that we've been able to help maximize the productivity by formulations is not at the cost of just simply removing Ti02 and having product that's going to perform differently. Christopher Perrella : All right. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. John Morikis : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Wong with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. David Wong : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. With the decline of raw materials in mid-single digit last year, presumably your competitors also benefited from that, have you started to feel any competitive pressures from your customers savings. Sean Hennessy : We typically see the pressure on large bid projects and that's typically been the same for as long as I've been in the industry of 31 years. And while the average pricing might tick down slightly the margins are not. And so we worked very hard to ensure that we remain competitive on those large projects. It's a relatively small percentage of our total sales. They are good projects. They are often times, they are important projects to us and so we work to keep those projects Sherwin-Williams. David Wong : Great. And you guys said res repaint double-digits with DIY little bit slower, how did new res fair for you guys. Sean Hennessy : New res was a good performer for us. It was slightly behind res repaint, but it performed well for us. We\u2019ve got have a very good relationship with many of the home builders in the marketplace and we have products that perform specifically for their needs. As well as what Bob mentioned we've got a distribution platform that allows us to make commitments across the country and be responsive to their needs. David Wong : Great, thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi, thanks very much. John Morikis : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas : Do you think that the weakness in oil and gas and in the southern and southwestern domestic economies is lowering your paint store volume growth rate by a pointer to and in general are Global Finishes volumes growing? Do you expect them to grow in the first half of 2016 and do you feel any slowing in domestic economy or in the global economy? Sean Hennessy : I will take the Global Finishes first. We had a positive accounts in the Global Finishes North America was our strongest continent by far in total those were fine. When we look at \u2013 We don't break this out but I would tell you that I think your first question about when you have so many stores you got to be careful but it does appear that some of the weakness is starting is starting to affect some of the store sales in pockets. You go out to West Texas or some of these other places Oklahoma. I think we're starting to see it Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas : Yes. And then \u2013 go ahead, I\u2019m sorry. Bob Wells : Well, I was going to say were starting to feel it in areas and yet construction in Texas in many parts of the states are still hanging on so it's a bit of a mixed bag. It offers opportunities. We are seeking them out. Jeff Zekauskas : So domestic retail sales have slowed in the U.S. does you feel that or when you look at your order pattern or what your organization says does it feel like the U.S. is slowing down a little bit but that's not something you detect? Bob Wells : When you take a look for us and I'll go to the store side the store side it's 85% painting contractors. The retail side is pretty \u2013 when you segment the retail you\u2019ll look at the people that we're selling in our retail stores I think we have probably not felt that it as strong as probably others. On the Lowe's side as I mentioned to a prior question is result incremental for us. We probably have a better picture down the road for you but I don't think we should be \u2013 I don\u2019t think we are the indicator for you. Sean Hennessy : And Jeff a lot of the survey work I've read has indicated that home-improvement have actually held up better as a retail category than retail in general. So I think there has been an impact on home-improvement but it's been less than on other retail categories. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Bob Wells : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates. Please proceed with your question. Richard O'Reilly: Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you, gentlemen. Bob Wells : Hi, Richard. Richard O'Reilly: I\u2019ve got two questions. One I wanted to follow up on the finishes group. You just said you had positive volumes. Now oil and gas Protective and Marine were down, what areas were up for you? Bob Wells : We also have finish in their. We have some other businesses but I don't know if we want to cut it down to that kind of segment inside that Global Finishes Group. Richard O'Reilly: Okay you did have positive volume growth in 2015. Bob Wells : Yes. Richard O'Reilly: Okay. Second I want to follow-up on the raw materials your first question you said your projection of down mid-single digit seems conservative. And I know you talked about the Ti02 but propylene is down 50% in a year or so, so can you talk about the basket of your inputs and maybe give us an idea of why it's only down in mid-single digits. You understand that. Sean Hennessy : Richard actually a mid-single-digit decline is a pretty significant decline across the entire basket. We spent a lot of time talking about Ti02 in the latex and Resin side of the basket which granted is the lion's share of our raw material basket by value but there are also categories of packaging and specialty chemicals that maybe moving the opposite direction. And offset the deflation in Ti02 and resins and latex to some degree. The other thing I would caution you want is assuming that Resin and latex pricing is tracking in line with propylene or with crude oil a lot of times because these are specialty formulas they are often times owned and controlled by our supplier. That gives them some measure of pricing power in the short-term. The Resin that you use in a particular paint formula has a very significant impact on the performance of the end product and they're not interchangeable parts. If the supplier wants to hold on to some of the benefit of lower cost propylene for a period of time in the long run we believe we'll get the benefit but the benefit tends to come to market slower than in the commodity category like Ti02. Richard O'Reilly: Okay, good. Thank you for that answer. I appreciate it. That\u2019s it. Bob Wells : Thanks, Richard. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the fall back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Bob Wells : Thanks again, Jessy. I'll conclude the call this morning by asking you to save the date of Thursday, May 26 on your calendars. That's the day we'll host our annual financial community presentation at our headquarters in Cleveland. The program will consist of our customary mourning presentations by management with a Q&A session followed by reception and lunch and then will also be some special program options offered in the afternoon to help commemorate our 150th year history. Again that date is Thursday, May 26 and we will be sending out invitations and related information and a link to our registration website in late March. So please watch your e-mail. As usual I'll be available over the balance of the day in the coming days to answer any remaining questions. Thanks for joining us today and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.",

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Jessie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we provided some balance sheet items and other select financial information on our website, sherwin.com under Investor Relations, April 21 press release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the first quarter 2016 compared to the first quarter 2015, and then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 5.1% to a record $2.57 billion, driven primarily by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and Consumer Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 2.8% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $129.3 million in the quarter to $1.26 billion. Our consolidated gross margin increased 280 basis points in the quarter to 49% of sales from 46.2% in the first quarter last year. Most of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $73.2 million over the first quarter last year to $1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 38.9% in the first quarter this year, from 37.9% last year. Roughly half of this increase was from acquisition-related costs. Interest expense increased $13.3 million compared to the first quarter last year to $25.7 million. This increase resulted from the shift to long-term debt from short-term that occurred mid-year 2015 and acquisition related interest expense. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $23.1 million to $216.4 million, due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $9.4 million or 4.9%, compared to the first quarter last year. Our effective tax rate was flat at 32% compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30% range. Consolidated net income increased $15.7 million to $147.1 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 5.7% compared to 5.4% in the first quarter last year. Finally, diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 13.8% to $1.57 per share from $1.38 per share in 2015. Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2016 increased 10.5% to $1.62 billion from $1.46 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 9.4%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic paint and equipment sales across all end markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter. Regionally in the first quarter, our Eastern division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division, Southwestern division and Canada. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. Segment profit for the group increased $77 million or 43.6% to $253.5 million in the quarter, as higher paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 15.7% of sales from 12.1% in the first quarter last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars decreased 24.7% to $125.2 million due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 22.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $900,000 in the quarter from a profit of $9.5 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs, and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America's segment profit $6.2 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was a loss of 70 basis points in the quarter compared to a profit of 5.7% in the first quarter of 2015. Turning to the Consumer Group, first quarter sales increased 7.5% to $378.1 million. As a reminder, in March, we annualized the start of the initial shipments of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program to Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 of last year. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $8.6 million to $64 million in the quarter from $55.4 million in the first quarter last year. The profit improvement in the quarter was due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and higher sales volumes. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 16.9% from 15.8% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 3.3% to $454.2 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 4.7% in the quarter. First quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars increased $9.7 million or 24.9% to $48.6 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material costs and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $3 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 10.7% from 8.3% in the same period last year. That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I'll now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. John? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. First quarter 2016 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams from both a revenue and profit perspective. Architectural paint volume growth in North America was the strongest we've seen in the past 10 years or longer. Industrial coatings demand also picked up some momentum in North America and Europe. Even with a 2.8% drag from unfavorable currency translation in the quarter and continued soft market conditions in Latin America, our consolidated sales growth exceeded 5% for the first time since third quarter 2014. To get a clearer picture of our profitability, you need to back out the acquisition-related costs we recorded in the quarter. Ex acquisition costs, diluted net income per common share increased 31% on sales growth of just over 5%. As a percent of sales, gross profit expanded 280 basis points year-over-year. Operating profit improved 300 basis points and profit before tax improved 190 basis points. Our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 48.6%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales, the result of higher SG&A spending by our Paint Stores Group and the acquisition-related expenses. Both our domestic operating segments delivered strong results in the quarter. Paint Stores Group recorded double-digit revenue growth in four of the five customer segments we track, led by residential leasing, new residential and DIY. Comparable store sales growth of 9.4% was the strongest comp performance we've seen in the few years. Our optimism is fueled further by our professional contractor customers reporting very healthy order book trends that extend well into the year. During the quarter, Paint Stores Group opened 20 new stores and closed seven redundant stores. But plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada, and Caribbean stand at 4,099, compared to 4,010 a year ago. Consumer Group's 7.5% sales increase and 110 basis point improvement in the segment profit margin in the quarter, primarily reflected strong results from our national account customers. Sales to commercial, industrial and MRO customers also showed good progress in the quarter. Strong sales growth and volume-driven productivity gains by our global supply chain organization resulted in a very healthy 32% profit margin on incremental sales from our Consumer Group in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation continued to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and our Latin America Coatings Group. Global Finishes Group did report positive volumes and positive sales in local currencies, driven primarily by improving marketing conditions in North America and Europe. They also managed the expenses very well, resulting in an impressive 240 basis point expansion in segment operating margin. Sales volumes in most Latin American countries continued to decline, with Mexico standing out as the notable exception. The impact of currency devaluation once again was worse than anticipated in the quarter. Our net working capital increased in the quarter due to the strong upward inflection of our business in the first quarter, evaluated over the trailing 12 months of sales. This increase in working capital resulted in a net operating cash use of approximately $80 million in the quarter, compared to a use of about $55 million in the first quarter last year. Our capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $52 million, depreciation was $42.9 million and amortization was $5.8 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million, and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016, as we complete some facility renovation projects. During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On March 31, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As we indicated on our call announcing the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal. This along with the cash required to service the debt after the close, will significantly curtail our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Yesterday, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, North American architectural paint demand is strong, driven by a steadily increasing level of residential construction and remodeling activity. As we move into the prime painting season, we're also encouraged by growing signs of a more robust non-residential recovery and improving demand for many industrial products. This growth will continue to be offset to some degree by challenging conditions in Latin America and currency headwinds, particularly in the first half of the year. Our outlook for second quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low to mid single-digits percent compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 per share, a 9.5% increase at the midpoint compared to last year's record $3.70 per share. For the full year 2016, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are raising our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $12.50 to $12.70 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015. Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good morning. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Good morning, Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, in recent quarters you called out some of the non-architectural end markets within PSG is being challenged. Just curious as to how these markets performed during the first quarter? Just wanted to understand why there was such a meaningful acceleration in 1Q sales trends in that Paint Stores Group have been? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've spoken about the commercial side that we feel pretty good about that, Ghansham. The area that we've spoken of having some pressure would be the Protective & Marine business. Particularly in the Protective side here, if you break down the areas that are impacted by the oil and gas, that's probably had no significant impact. We have seen other areas that we've increased our focus on start to pay greater dividend, and we are excited about the results that we are experiencing as a result of those impact, of the actions we are taking. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then in terms of full-year sales guidance, I guess, why not raise that higher given your big first quarter and also strong sales guidance for the second quarter, particularly with FX easing as the year progresses. You expect any sort of moderation during the year in PSG? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : No. I think that what we expect is the Paint Stores Group will continue to lead the sales gains for us. I think second quarter is going to be in the same situation we're going to see the Paint Stores Group. I think that the first quarter, many years, we don't even change the guidance after the first quarter because it is the smallest quarter. We did raise the EPS. I think that we'll review it at the end of the second quarter. I think this year, if you remember, I think that Consumer had a very nice first quarter. We'll finalize the load-in -- anniversarying the load-in of the HGTV program, and I think that \u2013 so we've got that sort of a headwind a little bit in the second quarter, specifically about the second quarter, but make no mistake about it. I think the Paint Stores Group is where we've \u2013 as John said in his comments, I think the Paint Stores Group will lead us in the sales gains each and every quarter. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say the customer base that we enjoyed relationships with inside their stores organization are feeling pretty bullish about the outlook this year. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Perfect. Thanks so much, guys. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you. It obviously appears the spring season is already off to a solid start on reconstruction R&R. But can you also comment on the competitive environment in the big boxes and also any preliminary expectations for Infinity? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The big-box environment is always competitive. We expect that our role there is to continue to add value to all of the customers that we serve, and our job is to make sure that we're aligned with their goals and driving customers into their stores. Regarding Infinity, it's our practice to let our customers speak to what their expectations are. We have very high hopes. It's a really terrific quality product in that can, and our expectations would be that's going to be very strong. But, we don't want to get ahead of our customers. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you. And then just a quick follow up. Obviously, it's still early, but do you have any new color on the Valspar approval timeline, now that the process has begun, just any reminder there will be appreciated? Thank you. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we've begun the review process, and when we announced the acquisition, we committed to provide you with updates, and we had material \u2013 if we had material news, we really have no material news to update right now. And I think it's only fair to say that, our thoughts are that when there is a material update that we'll provide that, but given the day-by-day or play-by-play will be a bit much. Our thoughts are to keep you up to speed with material actions. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's appreciated. Thank you very much. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the gross margin? You mentioned the incrementals as they flow through the P&L statement, but the gross margin particularly is pretty fantastic. What should we expect as you go through the rest of the year there? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Bob, this is Sean. I probably should have said that last time I answered, but this is Sean. And when you take a look at how our gross margin was last year, and if you look at the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter, how strong it was, if you think about the way the raw materials were moving last year, we felt that at the beginning of the year was really where we were going to have to make most of our improvement in the gross profit as a percent of sales and the improvement. We were \u2013 last year we were at 46% in the first quarter, we jumped all the way to 48.8% and then we got to 49% and then over 50% in the last three quarters. So, we feel good about where our gross margin is. We think that the raws will continue to \u2013 the raws goodness will continue to shrink and we're going to hit at length somewhere later in this year where we expect that that will be negligible, so. We felt that we had to have this kind of an improvement in the first quarter to have improvement throughout the year and we feel good about where we are with the gross profit. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then, maybe related to that, I think last year you talked about in some of the contractor bids there was a little pressure, but you've articulated today some building momentum in those markets as well. Can you characterize how the pricing dynamic is in the professional painter market at the moment? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'd say it's very similar to what we've always expressed and experienced. We have spoken about those larger projects that typically go to bid and are a little more aggressive in pricing. But outside of that I'd say it's always a competitive market and it continues to be and we continue to try to differentiate ourselves, not only with the quality of the product, but the services that we provide. But, we expect that our competition will be out there and we've got to earn every gallon that we sell. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, John. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, fellows. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Question just around raw materials. Could you split them out a little bit, talk about the organic and inorganic side? Obviously with oil moving higher, has there been a material change in how you're thinking about raw materials throughout the rest of the year? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : On the petroleum-based side, we primarily priced off propylene and chemical-grade propylene has averaged around $0.30 a pound for a while now. Barring no major outages in propylene or monomer production, we anticipate a relatively flat polymer pricing market for over the balance of the year probably. On the titanium dioxide side of the equation, we said on our year-end call that we saw prices kind of flattening, but we didn't see a lot of pressure in supply demand balance. Those fundamentals have pretty much played out as we expected. There is obviously a December price increase announcement that we think may be gaining some traction amongst smaller customers, another price increase announcement has been stacked on top of that. We do believe that it's going to take tight market conditions, or tighter market conditions, for those price increases to gain significant traction. But I think it's safe to assume that we're not going to see further declines in TiO2. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then just on the back of that, if let's say oil moves a little higher and you get a little pressure on raw materials, philosophically as we get into next year, would you guys be able to go out with price increases do you think if raw materials were moving higher? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Duffy, our practice has always been to talk to our customers first. So, if we do that it will be \u2013 we'll talk to you about it after we've shared that with our customers. I think the band that gross margin chart that we often talk to that demonstrates our ability to operate in that band, I think is where I would point you. In areas or times where we've had significant pressure, we've been out with price increases, and I think it also demonstrates the discipline that we have when there haven't been raw material increases for us, not to go out with price increases. And so, our first effort is to mitigate or drive more efficiency and drive down the costs, anyway we can to avoid having to put price increases in. But if we find ourselves in that situation, I think we've also demonstrated our ability to put those effective price increases into the market. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, fellows. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Duffy. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Good morning. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just a question on weather. If you look at the last four quarters, particularly the first three, we had some challenges, and then 4Q last year was helpful. This first quarter seemed to be, the feedback we got, was somewhat mixed. So, against all that sort of sequential rollercoastering, where do you think things are now? Do you think the quarter and the performance in the Paint Stores Group is really reflective of sort of state-of-the-art instant demand? Or do you think we're still making up lost gallons from last year, or is there any risk that we pulled some forward from later this year? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think demand in our stores clearly improved from fourth quarter to first quarter. How much if any of that was due to the mild weather in the first quarter is really very difficult to determine. I would say this that we're very encouraged about the comments that we are getting from our customers. They're very bullish about the paint season. As I mentioned in my comments that the discussions that we're having with them, they're feeling very good about the market, and that keeps us very excited and focused on growing with them. So it's hard to say how much if any, but most importantly, their outlook for the year is very positive. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just as a follow-up, the guidance you gave at 4Q presumably included some share repurchases. Is that correct? And if so, could you quantify how much do you think you took out in the new guidance? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I will just tell you that at the beginning of the year we did have share repurchase. I think, the guidance \u2013 when we take a look at \u2013 I'll go back to some of the comments John made in his comments. Our plan has changed. Our plan is to accumulate cash. In prior years, we always utilized that cash, our plan was to utilize 100% of the cash. And this if you think about what we're trying to do with the acquisition and acquire and accumulate cash for that closing of the Valspar deal, implies very little cash is going to be used for buybacks and \u2013 versus you probably \u2013 we're looking at spending another $700 million, $800 million, $900 million on stock. So, it probably was significant. And you can pick what you think the average purchase price would have been for the year. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. We'll do that. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes. Thank you. John, I just want to go back to your views on the architectural paint market. I know, last year, we had subpar growth about 2%, 2.5%. So, as you look at what your customers are telling you, what kind of gallonage growth do you see for the industry in the U.S. this year? And given that outlook, I'm wondering why you only have mid \u2013 low to mid single-digit sales growth expectations for Q2? I know you're running some tougher Consumer Group comps, but it would seem that, especially with the weather snapback in Q2, that that PSG should have a very strong performance? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. And this is Sean and I'll let John talk about the market in total. And I just go back to some of the comments I made earlier about the guidance. I think when you look at the second quarter, we've got other things moving; currency is still going to be a little bit of a headwind. We're going to finally have 100% of the load-in from the HGTV program completed. But, we want to make sure you know that Stores Group is going to be the driver in the second quarter, just like it has been for the last many quarters or so. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And, Don, just, so I'll make sure I get your question right, were you referencing first quarter or second quarter? Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I was referencing second quarter just low to mid single-digit revenue growth, but just wanted to also get your comments on your outlook for the industry architectural volumes for the year as a whole, how much \u2013 we had subpar growth last year, what kind of a growth are you seeing this year? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. We don't forecast those gallons specifically, but I would tell you that in speaking with many of our customers around the country, there is a general sense of confidence and a bullishness that is very exciting to us. Many of them are looking at the book of business that they have and are excited about the outlook for the year. So we're going to be very responsive to them and try to ensure that we're the benefactors of that, but our customers are feeling very good, very good. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Don. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Arun. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. I guess I just wanted to ask that question again. You had very impressive same-store sales growth in the first quarter. You guys have been comping kind of 1.5 times to 2 times the industry, so would you say the industry was up 5% or 6% in the quarter? Or was there something specific that drove you guys well above the industry? And then, do you expect your numbers to kind of continue in that range? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Arun, this is Bob. When we do \u2013 when we estimate industry volume, we typically do so in part by listening to the reports of our publicly traded peers, and along with our volume growth, and triangulating to get what we estimate to be the market growth. For one quarter \u2013 for first quarter, it's a little too early to tell because we haven't seen enough market data yet, how much the market grew in the first quarter. Going forward, our expectations are based not on any macro assumption for market growth. But as John indicated on the feedback that we're getting from our contractor customers on their order book volume. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. We're working very closely with them on the projects that they're looking out and estimating, and many of them have already booked, and they're feeling, as I said, very positive about the year. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : It appears that the industry growth accelerated in the first quarter, but I think it's \u2013 ours certainly did, but it's a little too early to make a call on the industry at this point. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Great. And maybe you can also just give us an update. Are you seeing the price increases in TiO2? I know you described it's safe to assume that prices aren't going to go any lower. But, why are the producers actually having any success with increases if supply demand is still in your favor? Thanks. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : I think the simple answer to that is because they may be getting some price increases justified solely on the poor financial health of the industry. We do not believe the supply demand fundamentals support the increases that are in the market today. But I \u2013 at the very least I think it's safe to say that the increases in the market \u2013 the announcements that the producers have made have stopped the downward trajectory in TiO2 pricing. We said a few quarters ago that it felt like TiO2 was approaching a bottom and clearly there is a bottom in the market and we think we're there. We would expect flat pricing as probably the best case scenario and whether these price increases gain traction as we go forward, time will tell. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Our TiO2 costs are still down significantly year-over-year because of the downward trajectory over the course of 2015. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. If I could just one more just on the non-paint sales in your Paint Stores, could you just describe what you're seeing there in the spray equipment and so on? Thanks. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Very positive numbers. We're having \u2013 in spray equipment, ladders, applicators, across the line we're having a very good performance. It gives us the confidence about the future. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, good morning. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): John, you mentioned that the contractor order book is quite strong. Is that driven by a residential business with repair and remodel or is it more driven by commercial side of things? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's actually both sides. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Can you drill down a... John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm sorry P.J. I thought you were done. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): No, no, I'd just say, can you drill down a little bit on the commercial and industrial side? Thank you. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I'd say that it's on both sides of the business, both the residential and the non-res. The confidence in our contractors and the discussions that we have going with them are very positive on both sides. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : And just as a reminder from previous calls, while it certainly appears that non-residential starts are slowing in late 2015 and early 2016, we are \u2013 our business tracks more closely with project completions. So, we're painting project that were started more than a year ago and the pace of starts in 2014 and the first half of 2015 were very healthy. Those are the projects we're on now. And looking forward if you believe the Dodge forecast, non-res starts should be healthy this year and for the next couple of years. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And a quick question for Sean. Sean, you always said that your costs tend to lag oil prices by two quarters to three quarters. So with this recent move in oil price, do you expect maybe later in the year that you begin to see your costs sort of begin to inch up? Thank you. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. And I think that was what I was trying to imply when the question came up about the gross profit and the incremental profit in the first quarter versus the remainder of the year. Again, we \u2013 gross margins in the first quarter was benefited from the paint volume and our North American supply chain and the mix towards paint service group. The raw material deflation was a material factor, and we think that material factor will continue to diminish as we go throughout the year, and I think a lot of \u2013 the basket in total, which the oil is part of. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, P.J. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Mike. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : I was curious if you could comment on what impact the timing of the Easter holiday may have had on your sales? Presumably that would have been a drag year-on-year on contractor sales, but maybe a positive for DIY? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think that's a pretty good thought. The DIY I think was probably strengthened by the change from the second quarter to the first quarter, and the contractor and that period we had a couple of days where it was probably depressed because of the Easter holiday. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : And then, I was also wondering if you could comment on the efforts that you're making at Lowe's to get the paint department employees a little more familiar with the HGTV HOME product line? Can you maybe give a little bit of detail on what your expectations for underlying volume growth will be adjusted for the load-in that we're lapping here? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I can certainly talk about our efforts there in Lowe's. We're choosing not to talk about the gallons or forecast or our customer. I think it's only appropriate that we let them speak to those expectations. But that said, our efforts are I think right on track. We have continued to work on training the Lowe's associates and making them familiar with our products. We had a terrific opportunity with the introduction of the Infinity product that you mentioned to get some of the product out into the hands of the Lowe's associates applying some of it, and making them familiar with the product. The process of training them on our entire product line as well as colors continues, and we're feeling pretty good about the momentum that we have there. Our goal is clearly to \u2013 and has always been to focus on driving customers into all of our customers, and you're asking specifically about Lowe's, our goal is to drive customers into that department, make sure that the employees there are very familiar with every aspect of our product and our color systems, and we think we're well on our way. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious about Consumer, I know there's been some moving parts in there besides Lowe's in the past. But when you break out Lowe's and the load-in and the new products, is there a reason that it's not seeing any sort of organic growth? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually our experience in organic growth, if you \u2013 in Consumer, we had January and February sales this year with no history from Lowe's. As I mentioned in my opening comments that we are experiencing a good traction in many segments within that business unit. So, we're actually feeling very good about the momentum that that business unit has. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : The entire national account category is doing very well. And John also mentioned industrial MRO customers are up year-over-year. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Got it. Thanks. And then, in your 9% or so same-store sales in Paint Stores Group, how much of that was the new SKUs being pushed through the legacy Comex stores? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We feel very good about those stores, and what we said and have said is that, we believe we're going to have a 100% of our purchase price cash and all that would be cash neutral. And actually I think we're going to beat the third quarter. We probably said in the third year anniversary, which would have been this September, we're going to have a 100% of our cash back. We're probably going to be quicker because those stores are doing very well. It's \u2013 but now they're fully integrated, and it's hard for us to breakout results, Comex stores and non-Comex stores, but I can tell you, when you look at the markets they're in, they're doing well. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And I would add to that though, I think it's getting specifically to your question, bringing those high-end products into those stores has been a definite win to those stores in the market and our customers. In many cases, the portfolio of products that they were offering to many of those Comex stores were more focused on the new residential side, less on the DIY side. So, to your point, as we introduce the residential repaint and DIY customers into those stores at the higher end band of our product line, it's certainly helping us as Sean has discussed there. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And one final point on that Nils. Just keep in mind when you're asking the impact on comps, you're talking about roughly 275 stores on a base of 4,100. So it's not really that significant. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Yeah. Fair point. Thanks. I'll pass it along. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning guys, and congratulations on a solid start to the year. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Dmitry. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Couple of questions that I want to follow-up. First of all, when you talk about your Latin American business and obviously it's challenged by all kinds of things. But, I'm interested in sort of which raw material pricing has been going up, I knew that impacted margins. And also, sort of what's your outlook like for the volume performance of that business, it's been comping down volume for a couple of quarters now. Is it sort of industry related or are you deemphasizing growth in that market, sort of kind of what's going on with the volumes there as well as raw material costs? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd like to just talk about the deemphasizing growth question, and then I'll turn it over to Sean. The answer is no. We're not ever deemphasizing growth. There are some things to your point in the market that we can't control and there are a lot of things that we can control, and we're working very hard on those things that we can control to better position ourselves in the market. I'll turn it over to Sean to answer the rest of your question. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, back to the \u2013 one of the parts you asked about the raw material cost and the cost of goods sold going up in Latin America, it's 100% currency and I'll tell you why. The Global Finishes Group is doing a great job looking for efficiencies and we're doing fine there on the conversion cost. But, Latin America buys the majority of its raw materials in U.S. currency and dollar denominated, and when you look at it, the currencies devaluation has the same effect on the raw materials as inflation. So the raw materials really are negatively affected by that currency. When you ask about in total what are you thinking about on the conditions down there. We don't expect to see improved economic conditions in the region in 2016. I think we've been consistent with this for a long time. I mean, we think that applies to currency and volume demand. We're starting to see currencies change a little positively. The Brazilian real went from about R$4.10, we thought it could get close to R$4.25, now it's down in the R$3.50, R$3.60. But in U.S. dollars, are very close to the breakeven levels. And so, our plan for 2016 calls for this segment to report a profit, but lot is done outside the realm of possibilities, and there's a risk of negative results for one or two more quarters just like the first quarter. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Got you. That's helpful, Sean. Switching quickly to Stores Group. Since you've increased your Canadian exposure there, there's been a little bit of a foreign exchange headwind there. Can you talk about sort of what the magnitude of that was in the first quarter? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I can tell you exactly. I think that \u2013 just give me a second here, Dmitry. I thought I had it right here. All right, yeah. It was \u2013 it's very small, it was just over $4 million, three-tenths of a percent of sales, but... Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So we're pretty happy the way Canada is going, Bob in his remarks, so Canada is coming on for us pretty good. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've got a good team up there, dedicated on Canada, Western Canada with the influx of the acquisition of General [Paints] has given us a new platform up there, a lot of competition up there as well. But we're working hard in earning our space there. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Got you. Thank you very much, gentlemen. That's all the questions I had. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Dmitry. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good morning, everyone. Great quarter. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Chuck. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : I'd like to just revisit the Paint Stores Group performance a bit, 9% comps growth. Any help in price per gallon there either from a few price increases getting through or the average price per gallon sold, improving maybe because the industrial is getting stronger? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : You know, Chuck, when you look at it, just want you to know we haven't really had a price increase in Paint Stores Group since 2014. So the price did not help us at all. The deterioration of what was happening to us last year because of the Protective & Marine, John's comments earlier told you, we didn't have as much of a headwind there. But it was just solid volume growth there. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Do you think any of that's market share growth, could the market have been growing that strongly? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We believe, I think we believe if you take a look at it, I think we'll know later in the year. Bob mentioned when some of the other public companies may \u2013 we'll get there and look at their results, but we feel pretty good about the way that Paint Stores Group has developed with the products, the distribution and people. We feel pretty good that we're taking market share. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's some pretty good programs, Chuck, that we're executing on very well. And I have to hand it to our leadership team there as well as our team in the field. They're doing a terrific job of really by market finding those customers that offer opportunity and really earning their business. And we're proud of that team and expect that it's going to continue, that momentum will continue. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : John, are you speaking of the field reps, and is that reflected in the somewhat higher SG&A spending, I think Sean mentioned earlier? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we do have some stores that have an annualized and reps. So, we're investing in there because we're feeling very good about the momentum that we have. So, yeah, I'm speaking to the new reps and new stores, but that's a big base. We've got a lot of stores and sales reps that have been out there for some time, and they're really embracing the new programs and initiatives that we have to grow market share as well as introducing our new products to our customers, who are responding favorably. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right Thank you. Best of luck for the rest of the year. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Chuck. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Chuck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking. Real quick, what were the gross profit changes in the segments? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Give me a second, I got it right here. Paint Stores Group was up $122 million. Consumer was up $15 million. Global Finishes was up $5.2 million and Latin America was actually negative $12.7 million. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then environmental costs were bumped up. Is there anything special in there or is it just sort of the timing of how these things flow through? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Actually, we had an accrual for the Passaic River, it was specifically the Passaic River, there was, I think, negotiations going on between the EPA and the consortium of companies that will be involved in the clean-up. We're a very, very, very small piece, and there was a major change in what the clean-up on the Passaic River is going to be. So even though we're less than 5% player in this Passaic River, all of a sudden we have increased our accrual by $17 million. So you could imagine the total cost went up dramatically. And so the plan is now in place and we'll start doing it, and we believe we have the majority of the expense for the Passaic River now covered. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And you may have said this in the beginning of the call and I may have missed it, I apologize if I did, interest expense. Are you planning on issuing any debt before Valspar closes, and do you expect the interest expense to sort of maintain where it's at right now, or how do you expect debt to go up and down? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. I think that we do not plan on issuing debt before the close. We've put our bridge in place. We've put a term loan in place; so our acquisition financing is in place. The first quarter, you see the expense was really more involved with the bridge financing. But the second quarter and beyond, we're going to have the term loan in there also. So that's why acquisition financing is in place. What we have done is put some interest rate swaps, I mean treasury rate locks and so, in the Q, you're going to see that we've entered into a series of treasury rate locks on a confined notion amounts of $1.7 billion. We will go higher than that. So we have taken some of these interest rate changes risk off the table and throughout the year depending on the say, you'll see us take some more off the table. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Ivan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Good morning, Rosemarie. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: If I \u2013 Sean, if I understood you properly, you have made up the gap in the gross margin in the first quarter, and if we keep the following three quarters at a flat level with last year, then we should be higher for the full year. So do you \u2013 is that more or less the trends you're expecting or do you think that Q2 gross margin will still be above last year? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think that we should have a slight positive, we will be positive in the second quarter. I think for full the year, I think that we \u2013 your characterization of flat to \u2013 we in that area, I think that after the second quarter, after we see some raw materials I think we can give you a better picture on what we think the gross margins, we'll narrow it down. But, I think, your characterization of the full year is probably pretty good. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thanks. And you mentioned that you were focusing on other areas outside of the oil and gas industry and were successful. Could give us a better feel for what you are doing and where? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would just say that we look at the industrial business regularly and we try to find those opportunities that offer us both the \u2013 opportunity to move gallons, but also bring solutions to our customers and we've really identified some of those that that we really have some unique technologies too that help provide solutions in getting the assets back in service quicker, to provide protection against various ambient conditions and we have good momentum. Rosemarie, I'd rather not get into any of the specifics of where they are, we'd rather just put the points on the scoreboard right now. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Sure. And if we look at your existing customers in that category and, I'm thinking the Deere, the Caterpillar type of companies. Are you seeing an improvement there or are we still in the doldrums? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd say our relationship with them is improving with many of those heavy equipment. The business itself I'd say their outlook, I think they have spoken to us to how their business is performing. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: All right. So no change? Thank you very much. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Rosemarie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Hi, good morning, or close to good afternoon. Just real quick, any notable difference between your exterior gallons and interior gallons in the Stores Group this quarter? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Exterior had \u2013 I mean we had a good interior and we had a very good exterior. So, exterior were strong. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: So, Sean, within the guidance maybe just help us to see that, that \u2013 potentially that normalizes, how do you guys think about that? Is there still easy comparables through the balance of the year or is there some risks that some of that got pulled forward? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We've been talking about this and it's interesting. You go back to after last second quarter last year, if you remember, because of the weather in the second quarter and so forth and we saw a really nice comp gain in the fourth quarter, and people talked about the weather there, this quarter, you've heard different customers say that they had the opportunity to catch up and including builder. So, we're sort of interested in that situation. I think the second quarter is going to draw \u2013 give us a complete vision of that. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But I would say, going back to the comments I made earlier, Scott, that the takeaway that I have, or the confidence that I have revolves around the book of business that these customers are referencing as to going forward. So, to Sean's point, we may have had some that got pushed back, we may have had actually some that got pulled forward, but they are feeling good about what they're looking on the pipe and they're saying, it looks good. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Great. Thanks, guys. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jay McCanless with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Good morning, everyone. Just one quick question. With the flooding that we've seen in Huston and some of the heavy rains we continue to see in Texas, what impact have you all seen from that yet, and could you maybe quantify what Texas in that part of the world means for the Paint Stores Group? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's impacted our business as we've had stores and customers impacted naturally. Texas is a good part of our business. We've a good representation there and good distribution of stores. I don't know right now what the \u2013 how to quantify that for the years. There will be some slowdown in the near term, and then there will be a pick up on the other side as repairs are done. So it's hard to say in a year how that will impact us. Obviously, in the very short-term when you have stores closed, Jay, the obvious that those stores being closed will impact it, but on the other side, we'll pick up some business as repairs are done. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Jay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions. I just \u2013 if you could update us on your guidance for raw materials. If I remember how \u2013 at the beginning of the year, you thought for the full year, the industry will be down. Do you think that's still the case and have you changed at all as part of your updated guidance? And then I have a follow-up. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Greg, this is Bob. We have not changed our outlook for raw materials. As a reminder, to put a little finer point on it, we expected raw materials for the full year to be down low mid-single-digits. So below \u2013 less than 5%, but in the mid-single-digit range. That's for the full year. And 1Q was at the high end of the mid-single-digit range, because we're annualizing full year declines from 2015. So, actually most of the savings year-over-year are already locked in based on the history that we're going up against last year. We think the price of many of the raw materials that we've used have stabilized, but the benefit \u2013 and so the benefit will diminish as we go through the year, but the benefit is already locked. Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI : Got it. And then the \u2013 I guess two other questions, one on Global Finishes, and a little bit of housekeeping. Remind me how you do leap day? Is that in the comp, not in the comp, is it in the total sales? And then Global Finishes, I know you took some great cost out there, but how much longer can sales not grow and profits grow? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think, first of all, you know the comp stores are the Paint Stores Group that we don't report any type of comp metric for the Global Finishes Group. I think that again we feel very good about, operationally, what we're doing there. I think that what helps there, and I think it goes back to John's comments, we've \u2013 if you compare it to the Latin America group, our volume has been good. When you look at the total, the volume has been good, and so when we get volume, we get the opportunity to basically increase that margin. So, I would say it's not going to be \u2013 we definitely and we've talked about over the years, we need some more market share in the Global Finishes Group to really get it kicked and going, but because of the volume gains, they've been able to get margin improvement. Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI : And so basically FX took sales down a little bit, but you had some sales growth, and that was enough to get that nice margin expansion? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. Yes. Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI : Okay. And just to be clear, was there an extra day in the quarter because of May or February 29? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : When you put everything together, the February 29, was there, but we also had Easter and we \u2013 going back there was an extra day, but Good Friday, just because of the way things are, never, never that week is Friday is never the same as a normal Friday. So moving that Good Friday into the first quarter here is why I answered the question earlier. Yeah, we got a day, but it just felt like it was negated by the Easter move. Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI : I got it. Thanks a lot. Great job. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. I had a longer-term question. The Valspar SEC filing indicated that there was a second company that whoever acquired Valspar might also be interested in acquiring the other company as well, but it indicated Sherwin-Williams wouldn't be able to acquire the other company. Would that simply be size or do you think maybe after you pay down some debt from the Valspar deal, you might have an opportunity to do another significant transaction? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think \u2013 first, we don't know who that company was and that's not something that we would want to comment on without having that information, John. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. I was fishing, obviously, but since it's out there, I apologize, I'll give it a try... John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks for your honesty. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Good quarter, guys. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, John. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Jessie. Let me close with two items. The first being, we're frequently asked actual diluted share count outstanding on December 31 \u2013 on March 31, it was $92,495,113 for those of you who are still on the line. The second item is a reminder that our annual financial community presentation is scheduled for Thursday, May 26, it's at our headquarters in Cleveland. The program will consist of our customary morning presentation with a question-and-answer session, followed by a reception and lunch with company management.

Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, July 21 Press Release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter 2015, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 2.8% to a record $3.22 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 1.5% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $105.8 million in the quarter to $1.64 billion. Our consolidated gross margin increased 200 basis points in the quarter to 50.8% of sales from 48.8% in the second quarter last year. More than half of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $54.7 million over second quarter last year to $1.1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.7% in the second quarter this year, from 31.9% last year. A relatively small portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses. Interest expense increased $28 million compared to second quarter last year to $40.9 million. This increase includes $20.7 million in acquisition-related interest expense with the balance resulting from a shift to long-term debt from short-term that occurred mid-year 2015. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $31.4 million to $539.2 million, due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $3.3 million compared to second quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.1%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. For the full-year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30%s, excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. Consolidated net income increased $28.1 million to $378.1 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 11.7% compared to 11.2% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 7.8% to $3.99 per share from $3.70 per share in 2015. The $3.99 includes $0.09 accretion from the accounting change and $0.16 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the second quarter 2016 increased 6.2% to $2.11 billion from $1.98 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic architectural paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter and Protective & Marine coating sales were a modest drag on revenue growth. Regionally in the second quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, Canada and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every geographic division. Segment profit for the group increased $75.6 million, or 17.4% to $509 million in the quarter, as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 24.1% of sales from 21.8% in the second quarter last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group, second quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars decreased 11.2% to $133.3 million, due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 16.4% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $9.6 million in the quarter from a profit of $4 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $1.3 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was negative 7.2% in the quarter compared to a profit of 2.7% in the second quarter 2015. Turning to the Consumer Group, second quarter sales decreased 2.6% to $477.5 million. As a reminder, in April, we annualized the completion of the load-in of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program in Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 last year. Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $6 million to $108.3 million in the quarter from $114.2 million in the second quarter last year, due primarily to lower sales and increased SG&A spending, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies. Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 22.7% from 23.3% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 1.3% to $499.2 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 2.6% in the quarter. Second quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars increased $8 million, or 13.9% to $65.2 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material costs and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $1.5 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the same period last year. That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So, I will now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full-year. John? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I think it's fair to say our results for the second quarter were mixed. Architectural paint volumes through our Paint Stores Group held up well in the quarter, resulting in solid revenue growth and continued strong earnings leverage and flow-through. Our Global Finishes Group also did a commendable job of managing both gross margins and SG&A, resulting in a respectable 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest volume growth. We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and the U.S., and currency headwinds in Latin America are starting to ease. Those were the positives in the quarter. On the other hand, while we expected difficult comparisons in the HGTV HOME paint program due to heavy stocking orders in the second quarter last year, some of the retail programs we thought would generate growth in the quarter fell short. We are supporting many of these programs with incremental SG&A investment and we have high return expectations on these investments. Finally, while currency comparisons have improved in many Latin American countries, demand trends remain difficult and our outlook for this segment for the full-year continues to deteriorate. Our earnings per share results in the quarter include expenses related to the Valspar acquisition as well as a tax benefit related to the adoption of a new accounting standard. If you back out these items, diluted net income per common share increased 9.7% on sales growth of less than 3%. As a percent of sales, gross profit increased 200 basis points year-over-year and operating profit and profit before tax, both expanded a little more than 50 basis points. Excluding the acquisition expense, our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 36%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales. The result of higher SG&A spending by Paint Stores Group, channel investment by Consumer Group and expenses related to the Valspar acquisition. Paint Stores Group delivered another strong sales performance in the residential segments, which includes residential repaint contractors, new residential construction and DIY. Combined, sales to these three segments grew by more than 10%. Sales to commercial, healthcare and property management customers also generated solid year-over-year growth. The outlook for continued growth in these segments over the balance of the year remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor segments, extending into 2017. During the first half of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 45 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations. This completes our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the full-year still calls for store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,117 compared to 4,025 a year ago. We anticipated a modest sales decline from Consumer Group coming into the second quarter. This, combined with the elevated SG&A investment tempered our second quarter outlook which is reflected in our guidance. We remain confident that the great work our Consumer Group teams are doing in strengthening our brand positioning across all retail channels and the investment we are making in many of these channels will pay handsome returns in the years ahead. Consumer Group's commercial, industrial and MRO business continue to show good progress on both sales and margin in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation continues to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group. Both segments reported positive sales in local currency in the quarter and Global Finishes Group volumes were positive, thanks in large part to improving market conditions in North America and Europe. Volume sales in most Latin American countries continue to decline with Brazil standing out as the most notable exception. Although Brazil's volume momentum improved in the quarter, margin pressure from raw materials continue to challenge profitability in Brazil and throughout the region. In the first six months of 2016, we generated $510 million in net operating cash, an increase of $161 million compared to the first half of 2015, driven by higher six-month net income and good working capital discipline. Working capital was a use of cash in the quarter, increasing by about $3.8 million year-over-year. Working capital as a percent of sales decreased to 11.6% from 11.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. Our capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $62.1 million. Depreciation was $43.8 million and amortization was $6.2 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects. During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On June 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. At the close of the second quarter 2016, our cash balance was $402.7 million compared to $75.1 million on June 30, 2015. Yesterday, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the next six months remains very positive, and we should see steady improvement from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset, to some degree, by continued weakness in Latin America. As we've commented over the past few quarters, the gross margin tailwind we have enjoyed in recent years from raw material cost deflation will diminish, as we go through the back-half of 2016. Our outlook for third quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low to mid-single digits percent compared to last year's third quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share compared to last year's record $3.97 per share. The full-year 2016 earnings per share guidance we provided at the end of the first quarter did not include expenses related to the acquisition of Valspar or the tax benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard. Today, we are revising our guidance for full-year consolidated net income per common share to reflect these two impacts. For the full-year, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low-single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are revising our expectations for full-year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.65 to $11.85 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015. Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And, now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we would be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you very much. Could you just comment on your performance in the DIY channel specifically at the home centers? And how HGTV trended versus Infinity inventories? And then also whether or not you believe there is a large inventory \u2013 or excuse me, a pull forward from March as well? Thank you. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think that there was a large pull forward in the first quarter. I'd say that our performance in the second quarter, we feel as though inside our largest customer with Lowe's that we're continuing to gain momentum as far as the performance in the market, I think we're going to let them comment on how their performance rated against the market. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. And just a quick follow-up. You outlined a few trends in LatAm and indicated you still expect some continued weakness. But can you offer a little more color on what you're seeing here and whether or not you believe you've reached an inflection point in terms of the magnitude of operating losses? Thank you. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes, I think that last year we earned positive profit in each one of the quarters last year. And for the year, we think that this year is going to be the exact opposite. But I do think when you look at the investments we're making, we think we're doing the right long-term and we think that the markets are troughing. I think that when you look at specifically at Mexico and Brazil, we're closer to the end. What we said last year, we felt that Brazil, you wouldn't see an improvement during 2016, maybe mid-2017. I don't think we've seen much difference there with political and so forth. In Mexico, we think Mexico is doing better. We think that's doing fine, but Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, we're still having some headwinds there and so we do believe that for the year we're going to lose money in Latin America. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But as we've spoken in the past, we feel this is an opportunity for us. We see rather than just waiting for the market to correct, and we do think that the market will improve, that there are some steps that we can be taking and we're taking those steps, and ensuring that we've got the right products, the right channels and the right people in those markets and we're making very good progress in the improvements down there. So, as the market does improve, we expect to outperform the market. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's great detail. Thank you very much. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good morning. First off on the 5.2% same store sales increase that you reported during the quarter, did that come in basically where you thought it would come \u2013 where you thought it would heading into the quarter? And in terms of the outlook, do you sense any change in industry fundamentals either in residential or commercial construction, or any particular region within the U.S.? Thanks. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : This is Sean Hennessy. And the 5.2% is fairly close to where we were. We have said that in the first quarter that was tremendously strong. We're almost double digits in the comp store, so we did feel that it was going to be lower than that first quarter, but the 5.2% in that materially different than what we had in the guidance. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And regarding the market, Ghansham, I'd say it's been great deal of my time with our customers and with our people in this segment, and there's a strong sense of bullishness in this area. There's continued growth in the residential repaint area. This is yet another quarter for us with double-digit gains in residential repaint. Our commercial customers are really speaking of a very solid book that currently exists, as well as a number of bids in the pipeline. So, on the architectural side, we're really excited about this market. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And just my second question, in terms of the \u2013 maybe you can share the raw material costs including titanium dioxide and inflation more broadly including labor inflation from the back half of 2016 and heading into 2017. I guess I'm asking because the industry has not seen a paint price increase since 2013, it seems like the case is increasing for one in 2017, would you sort of agree with that? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Yes, Ghansham, this is Bob. On the raw material outlook, we still see low mid-single-digit deflation for the full-year 2016. Although, you asked specifically about TiO2. The majors in TiO2 we think are probably gaining some traction on the second quarter price increase that they announced, that is off to December 2015 lows. The implementation at this point as near as we can tell from an industry standpoint is probably in the mid-single-digit cents per pound, so not a significant increase in percentage terms. As expected, they've been out with a third quarter announcement. We think that it's likely they may get some traction, but how much they get really depends on customer size, on location geographically. So, we're likely to see some year-over-year inflation in TiO2 as far as the rest as the basket. The feed stocks for the latex and acrylic monomer market have been very stable. Chemical grade propylene has been steady at around $0.31 a pound. So we don't necessarily see inflation in that side of the basket. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And on the labor side, we're putting our game plans together for 2017. We've done a lot of work on 2017. But we don't see \u2013 in our guidance, we still see productivity gains, especially in the Stores Group. So, when you look at that labor expense \u2013 and we're evaluating 2017, as we go. And as always, before we announce in the market what we're going to do with pricing, we would talk to our customers first. So, those plans are being developed right now. And if we do go, after we've talked to the customers, we'll be pretty transparent and let you know. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. When you look across the paint industry in United States and you compare the performance of company-owned stores, whether it's yours or those of other companies, to the amount of paint that's going through the big box retailers or through channels that are non-company-owned stores, do you see differences in volume growth or are they comparable? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think, when you look at the results, I think, it's showing up, Jeff, that the painting contractor is the faster growing \u2013 that the painting contractor is growing faster than DIY. I think that's our perception, and I think the facts bear that out. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And is there a different conduct of the big box retailers toward inventories; that is, are they taking steps to meaningfully push down their inventories either temporarily or permanently? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I think that our customers have always done a very good job in managing their working capital, and we're constantly working with them. We want to have the right inventory on the shelf, Jeff. And there are times when that means that they're little lighter in some areas and a little more in others. And so I'd say it's just an ongoing discussion that we have with our customers. We want to help drive their key metrics cumulatively or any others that they have. And so, as they are reviewing what it is that's working for them, we want to be a part of that. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, fellas. Question just on the raw materials again. For Global Finishes, you called out that raw materials was down and a benefit for LatAm that was up and a headwind, what's the dichotomy going on there? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think that Latin America 100% of the raw materials are based on U.S. dollar and it's fully affected by the currency changes. In the Global Finishes, we do have a portion of that business that's in the United States that doesn't have that same effect and I think that's what \u2013 that's really the dramatic difference there. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. In the 2016 since you called out on the acquisition cost, what was that pre-tax and where did that roll through the P&L? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. 100% of it went through the admin section. It was $25.2 million pre-tax which we broke down to $15.4 million after-tax, which gave $0.16. $4.5 million approximately went through SG&A, the other $21 million went through the interest expense. And again, that was 100% in the administrative segment. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, fellas. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Duffy. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Morning, thanks. Just a question on the same stores, I think you do both Protective & Marine in there, so is that a fair assumption that your architectural sales were above that 5.2% and maybe you can just gauge what kind of range your Protective & Marine was tracking in the quarter? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Your first part of the question and sort of your implication is exactly right. Architectural was the fastest growing and the Protective & Marine was dampened. Really don't have a metric that I think we can share with you that we'd be comfortable with. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But I would say this, Arun, is that, all along as we've been going through this, just as we just talked about Latin America, there are a number of segments within the Protective & Marine opportunities for our company. And so while we've been experiencing some pressure in oil and gas, the teams are pivoting and really focused on other segments that offer opportunities in both sales and margin. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. And just similarly on those points, though, would you say that both in Latin America and in Protective & Marine you're nearing kind of a bottom in those comps and is your guidance kind of embed and using in those comps through the year? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think so. Yeah, I think as we move forward, the comps \u2013 we're going to lap those comps. And at the same time, some of the good work our teams \u2013 what they're putting in place right now will continue to, I think positively benefit us going forward. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think that even though the comps are getting easier, we're basically saying I think that we're in a trough now. I don't think we're ready to say that we're going to see some major growth in either the Latin America or the Protective & Marine, but I think we're in a trough. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : In the oil and gas. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then, just last question, you had put out earlier that your belief is that you can potentially get to 820 million gallons in the next peak, is that still your belief and when do you think you can get there in that cycle? Thanks. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It is, Arun. And we base that belief on the fact that the install base of square footage that requires maintenance has grown pretty dramatically since we considered mid-700 million gallons to be normalized. So this peak should be well above the last peak just at normal build rates and we're not back to normal build rates yet. We consider normal to be closer to 1.4 million, 1.5 million residential starts and a little stronger non-res activity than we're seeing right now. So, once we get build rates back there and once the maintenance cycles have returned to kind of normalized repaint activity, we think we're going to see normalized volume in the 780 million to 810 million gallons and very likely that this cycle should peak above that 810 million gallons. Whether that takes three years or five years to get back to, time will tell, as the rate of recovery in the residential market right now, I think, that is probably going to take at least three years to get back there. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. Thanks. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Scott. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Good morning. So, I just wanted to \u2013 a little longer-term oriented question, just trying to understand, your gross margin obviously up nice in the quarter and gross margins been coming up quite a bit. Obviously, raw material cost has something to do with that. But as you guys look at kind of like your normalized gross margins, what are your thoughts about that? Can we still see things come up here and \u2013 I just wanted to get your thoughts on that? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I think that the way we run the business, we believe that in the long-term, we're going to continue to raise the ROS. I think that the gross margin, we've had great expansion. And basically because of three things \u2013 really nice gallon growth especially in the Stores Group, an integration that is complete now from the Comex North America, and raw materials have been a tailwind but those things have occurred. I think that in all cases, we're always looking long-term. I like your term \u2013 really looking in the long-term. And again this year, we're taking a balanced approach to where we're going. We're investing. There is times when the gross margin will lead our ROS improvements. And there is times that SG&A \u2013 and in fact that gallon growth that we've had in the Stores Group is because of innovation. I think that we continue to do a lot of innovation, and innovation has helped us in all the different segments. So when you look at where we're going this year, our mid-point of our range is $12.60; last year was $11.13 \u2013 a 13% increase \u2013 and then when you take a look at a challenging global environment and no share buybacks. Our original guidance had approximately $0.25 worth of buybacks in there. So, we're generating net operating cash at record levels, and we're continuing to make prudent investments in the business. So, you're going to see SG&A probably this year isn't going to be in the improvement in the ROS, it has to be in gross margin. And we had the tailwind. We've clearly said there wasn't going to be a tailwind. We had the innovation. We had Stores Group going away. But we're pretty confident that those investments will earn solid returns in the future, and that's how we do this balanced approach for the long-term that you asked. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : That's perfect. I appreciate all the color. And just maybe switching gears just a little bit to capacity levels that you guys are seeing right now, one of these \u2013 where are they and what will they look like if you successfully close the Valspar acquisition? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We always have said that we were \u2013 88% to 92% is the sweet spot for us. And 2008 and 2009, when the market did go down 25%, 30% in that one year, we managed it. We did not take all the capacity out to get down to that level. And that's where the earlier question about the 820 million gallons, we were shooting for that 750 million gallons, 770 million gallons. So that capacity \u2013 we live with the capacity in the low 70%. We're now much closer to that 88% to 92%, and that's why our margins are doing very well. Since then, that North America acquisition of Comex \u2013 I think those gallons going into our footprint, but we've hung onto a couple of the assets they have and when we look at the Valspar, we think that they have some great assets to give us for capacity. We think that gives us another leg in the stool that give us the ability to have that capacity utilization go down in the short-term, but then gives us the ability to grow without a great deal of CapEx. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : All right, awesome. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Just to dig in a little bit more in Consumer Group, you mentioned a couple of programs you were running at retail that didn't get the traction that you were looking for and you obviously have some increased spending against that. So, what is just sort broadly or specifically, what's the course correction that you're looking to do and is it something that you can do this year or is it something that we have to wait until next paint season to see the results of? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think what's important here is that there is some investment here and we see as the clear opportunity. We do go into this with our eyes wide open. We know that there are investments made that may not come back in the first quarter that we make those investments, maybe not the second. But if you look at our market share in this segment, there's terrific opportunities, we believe a disciplined approach and aggressive approach here can help us to grow our market share and manage our margins for our shareholders. So, we're moving in this direction with a very disciplined look. We're making the investments and we think that there are opportunities out there for us to grow. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : And... Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And just as a \u2013 go ahead, sorry, Bob. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Yeah and as far as the timing as you mentioned, we're patient. We think \u2013 but we don't see it snapping back in the next quarter or so. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay and just as a follow-up, you mentioned Consumer Group should improve sequentially through the balance of the year; but, I mean, should we be modeling 3Q still flat to down, or how should we be thinking about that on the top-line? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : You know on the top-line, I think, as we settle sequentially, we'll improve I think that; but, you know, with some of the situations we just talked about, we think it's going to be flat to up slightly. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Vincent. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes, thank you. Question first just on your overall impression in the architectural market, you know, last year was obviously \u2013 I know, you don't like to talk about weather, but it was weather depressed and growth was 2% to 3%, are you seeing the snapback you expected this year or has that been moderated again by weather? Bob, what's kind of your outlook for the U.S. architectural market growth this year? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Yeah, Don. For starters, we don't think there was much of a weather effect in the numbers this year. We think that build rates are holding up very well, but they're not on fire. Residential construction is up about 10% year-over-year in square footage terms. In the commercial markets, starts are down but completions are up pretty significantly year-over-year. So we're seeing solid demand growth in the new construction market. In the repaint market, while the pro-residential repaint business has been really solid, what's hard to determine at this stage, because we just don't have the data is how the DIY channels held up in the second quarter. So, I hesitate to say, that there's just not enough data to call market growth in the second quarter yet, but I think that's the truth. The contractor market seems to have grown nicely, but it's hard to tell on the other piece. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And, John, a question, maybe you can update us on Valspar synergy outlook, to the extent you've been able to talk to your counterparts over there and have meetings about combining the two companies. What's your updated outlook for synergy potential or as \u2013 what's your updated confidence level in the original target you set out? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. I don't think we're going to move the original target and \u2013 but I think that as time goes on, we continue to feel very confident that we're going to hit those numbers. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Don. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Mike. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on the solid margin performance you had in the Global Finishes Group? I know you mentioned the price and mix was improving. What exactly was driving that and how sustainable could a number like 13% margin be as we get into the second half in that segment? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : I think that when we take a look at that group I think that the improvement stems from really four focused driving that product technology I mentioned earlier into the market, improving SG&A, capturing pricing in the \u2013 where to offset currency and then capturing reductions in the raw materials that they occur in the United States. So, these combination of four things I don't think are going to change. You'll see the slide. For the longest time, we used to talk about 12% and I think that this has given us great confidence that we can say 13%. And with some market share gains, I think, we can actually beat that number. So, I think the game plan has worked very, very well. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. Great. And then a question on Latin America. You'd sounded like you mentioned that you expect to be below breakeven for the rest of the year. But just wondering, as we get into the heavier paint season there in Q4, is there a chance that we get north of breakeven? And also wondering if there was some unusual costs in Q2 that help explain a pretty significant sequential weakening in terms of the earnings in Latin America? Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : The answer to the last question is, no, there really was no one-time thing that I would point out. I just think it was the operation as it is. I think we come closer to breakeven and maybe there is a chance that if we have a little stronger sales \u2013 the fourth quarter definitely is the closest to breakeven for the remainder of the year. But right now, I would not come out here and say we're definitely going to make money in the fourth quarter. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Two questions. One was accounting and charge clarification and then second on the business. Sean, the income tax benefit \u2013 could you explain what that actually is? And is it just simply as straight as $0.09, $8 million is coming into taxes? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. And what that is, is when we've expensed \u2013 when starting the new rules many, many years ago, expensing stock option, RSO grant and so forth, you charge the P&L for the Black Scholes amount. So, whatever the Black Scholes value was on the day of the issuance, basically, you straight line to a three-year or a five-year option vesting period. Then what would occur is, if the stock \u2013 the differential between when the day of vesting, a differential between the Black Scholes value and the actual value was actually that difference would use to go to retained earnings. We always took it on our tax return, and that was one of the differentials between book and cash taxes. So this change, this accounting change for us has nothing to do with and won't change our cash performance; but instead of having that differential for us as you said in the second quarter, $8 million go to retained earnings and now goes directly through the P&L. So that's why it was $0.09 in the second quarter. Year-to-date, it was $0.28 and the reason why it was $0.19 in the first quarter is because of the \u2013 in the first quarter when the vesting occurred of our long-term RSOs, so that many people around that, so that's why it hit in the first quarter, second quarter was really driven by stock options that were exercised. So, that's what it is. It does have a cash differential that's why we pointed it out. We adopted it this quarter, so we can do it the accounting this way. I think as time goes on, I think January everyone has to go on it, so I think what we took the opportunity to do it now just to get this noise out of our P&L next year. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : And so we should see something else in the next two quarters? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : More like the second quarter not the first quarter? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. And just so you know when we try to say, we guesstimated that number will be $0.45 for the year. So, when we were talking about when we show that schedule in the back, that's where that $0.45 comes from. So 2017, we're seeing 2017 in the next two quarters, so $0.085 a quarter or something in that range. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Thank you. That's a great catch up. So, then back to the more fun stuff, John, I guess, what will be helpful is understanding through the quarter I think there were a couple questions that sort of tease it out, if I remember last year we had a wet June and that may have had some impact, would you say that the business was quite steady in Paint Stores Group through the quarter or was there strengthening or weakening or how would you put that together? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'd say, it was pretty steady if you compare apples-to-apples, Greg, the performance inside stores still go in the right direction but consistent throughout the quarter. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : Okay. Got it. And I think in the prepared comments you mentioned that in Consumer, what was weaker than expected was other retail programs. I think I got \u2013 I hope I wrote that down right. Explain to us what that is, is that other architectural paint programs or is it some of the spray paints or sealants or give us a little more color on that would be helpful? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Those are few things that we're working on, Greg and quite frankly, we prefer that our customers start talking about that when the timing is right. We're leaning forward in that area. And as I mentioned and it is important in a very disciplined fashion. We didn't feel as though that the return would come back in the first quarter. Sales-wise, we have high expectations for ourselves and we're going to continue to push to grow our sales. We have a high regard for our team there and they're pursuing some opportunities with customers in a number of different channels and in a number of different segments and spaces. So, it's not one but a number of areas that we are investing in and believe that we can grow. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : But it specifically wasn't the HGTV that cycling the sale in last year, that was on plan? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's correct. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI : All right. Thanks. Good luck. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Yeah. Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. First is on non-res starts, as Bob, I think you said completions have been good this year so that's obviously helping your business. But starts themselves have been down meaningfully in the first part of this year. Does that mean that there's going to be a fairly significant headwind next year and what you do to sort of get ahead of that? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Yeah, Nils, on average, as we typically point out, the time between starts and completion runs about 20 months to 22 months in the non-residential space, which means that next year we're primarily going to be completing 2015 starts. 2015 was a pretty strong year. Not as strong as 2014. 2014 was the strongest year since the recession. 2015 was the second strongest and today so far year-to-date we're running down about 9% in square footage of starts. So, we will see the non-residential market trend downward in terms of completions over the next couple of years. As a reminder, the non-res market you're talking about, a-third of the new construction piece of the market, which new construction totals less than 20%. So it will be a headwind in out years just not a real significant one. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Got it. And then, at your recent Investor Day, you guys highlighted quite a bit of the innovation particularly Paint Shield, wondering how that's tracking and obviously there's back \u2013 tying into the non-res starts, there has been some quite a bit of strength in healthcare. So, wondering if you've been able to get in on the ground, so to speak. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'd say, with the new technology like this, as expected in this area that there will be a little bit of a ramp-up. We're working with a number of different decision makers and influencers in this area. Trend-wise, it's going in the right direction. And we're going to continue to focus on it. But the comparisons, as we go forward here, while we expect to continue to improve. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Understood. I'll pass it on. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Nils. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, can you give me the gross profit changes on the Paint Stores, Consumer and Global and Latin America? Give a chance. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Paint Stores Group was an increase of $116 million. Consumer was flat. Global Finishes was up $2.5 million, and Latin America was down $13 million. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And then in terms of the Paint Stores, the significant contribution margin has been pretty largely probably due to the volume leverage and outflow of raw materials. Does raw material sort of level out? Do you look for that contribution margin to sort of go back to the traditional 25%, 30% type of flow through to the bottom line, as you go through the back-half? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I think the 60%, 70% flow through are nice. But you're right. Not just that raw materials grew, we're fully integrated now with Comex. And those things have really helped us over the last two years, three years. So, yeah, we see as time goes on, we still have great flow through. But probably you're going to see it closer to maybe a little higher than what we've done in the past. But yes, it will. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then the last question. In terms of the acquisition-related costs, how much of \u2013 what are the big buckets that these costs are going into and how much of them are cash? And are they big enough where you're sort of getting ahead of what cost may be when the deal finally closes in the first quarter? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. In the first quarter, the acquisition cost \u2013 I'm going to just speak to PBT. I won't talk about it unless you want me to. But if you take a look at the big buckets, there were advisor fees there. And then another big piece of that niche, that's the cash-out in the third quarter because of the timing and so forth, but that plus the bridge and turmoil fees, we're amortizing those bridge and turmoil fees today, that's cash. Then we have some legal fees that are cash, but the big hit will be Valspar's advisor and legal fees, which will occur at the close. So, when we look at that $0.72 that we show in the fourth quarter to finalize the 132, the majority of that is going to be a cash hit that's why a lot of times we look at the cash needed to close this $11.3 billion, we look at it closer to $11.5 billion because we have these $200 million worth of pre-tax closing costs in total. The majority of which will be paid back at that time. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Ivan. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good morning, everyone. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Most of my stuff has been covered already, but I want to go back to the Consumer segment. Just focusing on the segment rather than the customer, John, Sean and Bob, how would the sales change year-over-year look if you could take out the load in sales of a year ago? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It would be up slightly. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : So, 2%, 3% is that a good way to put it slightly? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Thank you. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Hi. Good morning. Question for Sean, when you're referring to SG&A been elevated for the balance of the year, the 70 basis points of deleverage that we saw in 2Q, is that the run rate we should consider for the back half of the year? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think you're not going to be far off, it's not going to be exactly that, but that's probably not a bad number. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: And then when we think about the 70 basis points in 2Q, is that all Consumer or are there investments elsewhere that cause deleverage? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think the majority of which was in Consumer, but LACG \u2013 but we're still investing in stores. I think that the stores investments have not changed. We think this is a continued driver. So, the SG&A increase as a percent of sales was not in stores, but we still are investing in the stores as heavy as we ever have been. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Right. So just a tailored question, maybe the consumer \u2013 given that you had heavy investment last year and then you have heavy investment this year that might be related to other programs. Do you think this is needed to sustain that flat to low single-digit growth you guys have guided to longer-term? Or should we expect the growth rate to be better than that once you get a return on these investments? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're going to be trying to drive that higher, Scott. Investments that we're making here we believe can help us. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Hello and good morning, everyone. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: I guess it is still morning. I was just wondering if on the Global Finishes Group you could talk a little bit about the areas where you are seeing some improvement outside of oil and gas, which markets or which industries are actually growing? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Inside our Protective & Marine we're focused on a number of them. Rosemarie, I prefer not to highlight those for obvious reasons, but our teams are really pivoting into some areas where we've had some presence in the past, but we feel as though we could be more meaningful in the marketplace. And so we're investing in sales rep time and specification effort as well as some product development to help us. So, as we're pursuing these segments we're \u2013 sometimes adversity brings out the best. We're finding that we have technologies that will help customers in adjacent segments. We have people that are knowledgeable and we can pursue better. So, we're after them. I'd rather not highlight them right now, but rest assured that we're out there and pursuing them. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: So when we look at the industrial world or the industrial market what you are seeing is, I am just making sure I understand, is that you don't want to talk about those particular areas which are actually doing better than what we read in the paper, for example? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's correct. And in some of the areas that we just have a lower share in the very profitable segments that we can increase our share in. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. And for Sean, if I look at that \u2013 the impact on the interest expense from the acquisition expenses. So, I am actually calculating that your regular interest expense is $20.2 million more or less. Is that the right number to look at for the balance of the year, until you are actually borrowing the full boat for the Valspar acquisition? Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes it is. We did borrow last year in July. And so, we've now fully anniversaried those bonds that we issued. So, we're 100% fixed right now because we're not in any variable interest. That's a very good rate. That $20 million is a very good number. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. And then lastly, if I may, and you may not want to respond to it, but anything new on the regulatory front regarding the Valspar acquisition. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I wouldn't say that there is anything new. We disclosed that we've received a second request, and we're working with the FTC to provide all the information that they need to complete their review. So, we're trying to be as responsive as we can to provide them with the information that they're asking for. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: And with that in mind, do you still expect to close at the end of the first quarter? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We still are anticipating closing in the first quarter, yes. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Rosemarie. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks, guys. Housing may not be at a peak again yet, but Cleveland certainly seems to be on a high right now. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Wait till October and the Indians in the World Series. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : There is a lot of questions on the call here about the sustainability of paint demand at these levels. On your pro customers, do you have insights into their backlogs? When you talk about them being bullish, do you think their backlogs or business are higher or just because there has been such a strong first half, they probably run off a fair amount of backlog that it would be hard for them to maintain the same level? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually, John, the discussions I've had with many customers around the country would say that they've got a good book of business that they're dealing with right now. They've got a good book of business that they have in the pipeline either secured or believe that they're going to secure. But what gives us, perhaps, most excitement is the pipeline of bids that they're looking at down the road. They also feel \u2013 that's why I mentioned earlier that they are bullish about those as well. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Are they buying spray equipment and ladders that would be supportive that they have a lot of confidence in their outlook? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: They are, yes. I'm going to say that we have strong equipment sales, as we pointed out in the first portion of our discussion. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Yep. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hello, everyone. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Just in your 2016 guidance I was hoping you could give me a little more directionality or specificity on your same store sales number that you're implying? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that we've never broken out segment win inside our guidance but I think what we freely have said for probably 14 quarters in a row when you look at that guidance number, the Stores Group again will [lead our] sales in the third quarter and fourth quarter and for the full-year. So I think that the first half of the year is probably a pretty good indication of where you'd see, when you break out your sales in the model that Stores Group is going to be number one and those comp stores are going to be strong. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, John. And then another year you're expecting 90 to 110 net new stores, you put out some pretty good targets out there on 6,000. Can you just talk about sort of what gives you guys the confidence to say that you're not hitting or you won't hit a saturation point or some diminishing returns with that level of continued growth? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : I'd say we spend a lot of time on this metric. We've been watching to see how the new stores today are creating cash and the metrics versus the metrics we've done over the years. We compare it to the market. We compare it to how that market is in relative size to stores per household and the metrics have all been going in the right direction, which would tell you if your incremental stores continue to perform like that, you're probably \u2013 and the markets are performing that you're probably not at a saturation point. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Chris, we often cite that we're blessed with a number of very good competitors and there's plenty of opportunity out there for us to continue to grow and new stores is one channel for them. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then just one more really quick one with share repurchase side lines, decent amount of dilution in the quarter just kind of wondering, is that a reasonable run rate to expect as we go through the year or is that kind of unique to this quarter? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I think it's pretty reasonable. I think when we look at what we think our share count will be in the fourth quarter because of that dilution it's slightly higher than in the second quarter. But I think your point is well taken, again, approximately $0.25 of our original guidance we came out of January with had share repurchase. So when you look at the share count if you go out to the fourth quarter and have a slightly higher number than the second quarter, I think you're in good shape. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks guys. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: John, I wanted to circle back, you had talked about steady sales kind of month-to-month in the quarter, and hearing pretty good things from the customers, the painters from the channel in terms of what's going on. Curious how we look at the comp of 9% in the first quarter and 5% in the second quarter and look at the guidance it implies, the 2Q comp is the right number through the rest of the year, something in that neighborhood, what's the difference between 1Q and 2Q? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the size of the number, obviously, when you look at the first quarter just the raw number versus the second has an impact on it, Eric and what I was speaking to as far as the comparisons month-to-month, we didn't see any significant highs and lows within the quarter that they were pretty consistent in our year-over-year comparisons. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. And so the \u2013 and I understand the scale and the magnitude of the quarters can make \u2013 can sort of hide the impact or overstate a little bit the impact of growth, were there pieces of the business that just grew faster in 1Q than they grew in 2Q? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, not that I can think of. We have, again not to be too repetitive here, but we had a terrific quarter and then in residential repaint, double-digit gains. As talked about in the first portion of our comments about the whole residential, new residential DIY, all performing well and I don't know that there was any significant swings from the first quarter to second quarter. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. I'll circle back to get more detail. All right. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Wang with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just had two. First is, wanted to get a little bit more understanding on the margins. So overall incremental margins are around 36% with Paint Stores performing particularly well. Are we close to the sweet spot in your capacity utilization and if so, is there much operating leverage remaining as we ramp up to what your estimate for mid-cycle paint volumes would be, or is this going to be more of a headwind going forward where we wouldn't see as much incremental margin for new paint volumes? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Yeah, I think that we're getting closer to the sweet spot. I think that there is still some room when it comes to looking at that incremental margin. I think, when we were in the low-70%s, we had a great deal of room, and so you saw a greater impact. But I do think the incremental margins will still be strong. They will be higher than our ROS today. And I think that's the key for us. We are always trying to make sure that our incremental margin \u2013 our incremental flow-through, as we call it, is greater than our current ROS. So I still see that happening. I just don't see it happening at the 60%, 70% incremental margins. John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've got a terrific operating team that's constantly working to improve and unlock capacity in our facilities. And so that process continues. And we've got a wonderful team there that's working diligently to do that on a regular basis. David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): So, currently we're not at the 80%, 90% or so utilization? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's true. David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Great. And then a second question on normalized paint volumes. I think your new forecast for 780 million gallons to 110 million gallons is a bit higher than your prior forecast. I think what we discussed a few years ago was normalized volumes of around 760 million. That's probably closer to what we are at today. And it looks like a large portion of the difference between your previous expectation and your new one is higher mid-cycle levels for res repaint and DIY. I know you guys discussed having a larger base of homes that would need repainting. But to the extent that the mid-cycle and new res forecast hasn't changed much, is it that we just expect the cycle to have a much bigger rally in the near-term before normalizing the mid-cycle or, I guess, what is driving the main difference? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Well, David, the question you're asking is why is what we consider normalized growing? And I think you answered the question. It's growing because the base is growing. And if you look at the overall U.S. architectural paint market, more than 80% of average annual volume goes toward repaint and it's applied to structures that already exist. If you look at that 740 million to 760 million normalized range that dates all the way back to the late 1990s. And we've had three building cycles since the late 1990s that have put a lot more square footage in place. Our population has grown significantly since then. So, we think it's reasonable to adjust the normalized expectation up based on primarily repaint volume. The other thing you see is, as the housing market continues to improve and get healthier and that health is oftentimes reflected in home values, you'll see the frequency of repaint activity increase. So at the peak of this cycle, people are painting more, just like they are remodeling more. David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): All right. So, there will be no change to your estimates for, say, housing starts for the peak or normalized? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Well, no, for normalized that normalized band would assume housing starts in the range of 1.4 million to 1.5 million. We think that's sustainable given our current rate of household formation. David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): All right. Great. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Lalli with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brian J. Lalli - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks for the time here late in the call, guys. I appreciate it. Just a quick question from the debt size and I apologize if I missed any prepared remarks in this but if could \u2013 could we get an update on the plans for, I guess, the longer term debt financing around the Valspar acquisition? And then, secondly, as a follow-up to that, Moody's specifically had comments on the ratings front being at risk for downgrade potentially even out of investment grade depending on the structure. So if you could maybe just comment on your commitment to IG rating and how that might guide your financing decisions as we get closer to closing, that would be helpful? Thanks a lot. Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : First of all, what we said and I don't have this in front of me, but I think I'm going to be very close. Bob can tell us on the financial community presentation that's now in the Sherwin.com under IR, so we have a schedule and I actually show you what we think our debt to EBITDA would be all the way out to I believe 2020. So, I'd ask you to do that but I think what we try to show there is that the day of close our leverage is going to go over 6% if we close, and based on closing first quarter 2017 our debt to EBITDA would be over 4%, approximately 4.25%, and so by 2019 we'll be at 3% and by 2020 at 1.9% which is under 2%. And I think that's a big goal by 2020 to be under 1.9%. What we said is, and I want to answer this way because immediately after that financial community presentation, we were asked, does this mean that you're not going to buy any stocks through 2020 and I said no, we are going to buy stock when our debt to EBIT starts to approach 2.5% to 1%. So that will give you a little picture of what we're thinking. And then on the Moody's front, I think that we read the same thing from Moody's. Every summer after the second quarter we've always had an individual meeting with Moody's and Fitch and S&P. We did have a meeting prior to the announcement of the Valspar acquisition, which is some \u2013 and I think that we're going to go see all three of the rating agencies during this quarter and it's been \u2013 we're optimistic that we keep the investment-grade. Investment-grade is very important to us because in the first quarter of every year our cash flow is negative, because we're building inventory for the season so we're in the commercial paper, we want to be in the A1/P1. We don't want to have one of them not be an investment-grade. We take a look at the metrics and we feel pretty good about the metrics long-term. And so, the investment-grade is pretty important to us. Brian J. Lalli - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the response. I appreciate it. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rich O'Reilly with Revere Associates. Please proceed with your question. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon now gentlemen. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Hi, Rich. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Hi. On the Protective & Marine business I thought in your opening comments you talked about that under the Paint Stores Group. Was I correct? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay. Is there also \u2013 there is also a Protective & Marine in the Global Finishes segment? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Yes. That's correct, Richard. The Protective & Marine cuts across three segments. There's also some Protective & Marine business in Latin America. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay, fine. So is your comment that you made for under the Paint Stores Group a preferable to all three other segments, where the other segments, Protective & Marine being down? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Yeah. In terms of the impact of the current oil and gas pricing and the depression in mining activity, yes. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay, fine. Okay, thanks. Now, in the Paint Stores Group for Protective & Marine it's being sold by the local stores versus one of your major distributor centers is that the difference there? John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's correct. We use the 4,000 plus stores as a point of distribution. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay, great. Second question is, I don't want to sound stupid about this, but in the Consumer Group, when you talk about making investments I'm not sure exactly what that means? If it means, your people in the stores, training the stores people, shelf space, can you elaborate a little bit on that? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : I think, number one, that's a partial list, but all three \u2013 all the things that you just mentioned plus different point of purchase materials, displays, maybe even thinning equipment, color matching equipment \u2013 all of that will go into that. Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates : Okay. So, that's what you mean by making the investments. Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks, Rich. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew Skowronski with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Stephen Skowronski - Longbow Research LLC : Hey, guys. I'm Matt Skowronski on for Dmitry. Looking at Brazil and Latin America, Brazilian currency is kind of flat year-over-year. So, do you guys expect positive FX comps in the second half or are other currencies kind of going to weigh you down like the peso or the Argentinian peso? Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : No. Don't worry about the Argentinian peso. The four currencies that drive us \u2013 and I'm talking specifically Sherwin \u2013 are Brazilian reais, which is better than it was in the first quarter but still a headwind in the second quarter. We were still in the 3.11. We expect that possibly by the fourth quarter that's not going to be a headwind. That's going to be a tailwind. The second is Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar has continued to be weak. So, we expect that's going to be a headwind for the remainder of the year. The euro, which is relatively flat, and so we think \u2013 but we have a big presence in the UK. And with the Ronseal brand, the [Lee's] paint brand, the Geocel and the Great Britain pound is now a headwind \u2013 a significant headwind. Matthew Stephen Skowronski - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Perfect. That's all the questions we have. Thank you so much. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Okay. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact : Thanks again, Jesse. As always, I would be available over the next few days to handle any additional questions that arise out of this morning's call. If you'd like to be placed in the queue for a follow-up call, please call Christy Johnson at 216-566-3001, and she will add you to the callback schedule. That number again 216-566-3001. I'd like to thank you again for joining us today, and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, October 25 Press Release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased $127.2 million or 4% to $3.28 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and the impact of a change in revenue classification related to third-party service revenue and related costs. The change in revenue classification increased sales 2.3% in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales by 0.8% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $61.7 million or 3.9% in the quarter to $1.64 billion compared to $1.57 billion last year. Consolidated gross margin was 49.9% of sales flat compared to the third quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $64.5 million or 6.5% to $1.06 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.3% in the third quarter this year, up 80 basis points from last year. A portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses. Interest expense increased $27.1 million compared to third quarter last year to $44.1 million. The vast majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $15.1 million or down 2.7% to $535.6 million, due primarily to acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $4.6 million compared to third quarter last year. Consolidated net income increased $12.2 million or 3.3% to $386.7 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 11.8%, compared to 11.9% in the third quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.8%. A comparable effective tax rate to 2015 would be 30.5%. For full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30%s, excluding the impact of the accounting change. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 2.8% to $4.08 per share from $3.97 per share in 2015. The $4.08 includes $0.09 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.24 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased earnings per share by $0.03 in the quarter. Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter 2016 increased $140.6 million or 6.7% to $2.23 billion from $2.09 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, excluding the change in revenue classification, increased 2.1%. Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher architectural paint sales volume across most end market segments and the impact of the change in revenue classification. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter and Protective & Marine Coatings sales were a significant drag on revenue growth. Regionally in the third quarter, our Canadian division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Southwestern division, Midwest and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. Segment profit for the group increased $10.9 million, or 2.1% to $518.3 million in the quarter, as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin decreased 100 basis points to 23.3% of sales from 24.3% in the third quarter last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group, third quarter net sales, stated in U.S. dollars, was $156.6 million, up $618,000, due primarily to higher year-over-year selling prices that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and volume declines. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by $12.8 million or 8.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased $1.2 million or 54.6% to $1 million from $2.1 million in the same period last year. The negative impact from higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation was only partially offset by increased selling prices. Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.6 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 60 basis points in the quarter compared to 1.4% in the third quarter 2015. For our Consumer Group, sales decreased $8.7 million or 2.1% to $412.9 million from $421.6 million last year, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and declining sales to certain retail accounts, commercial customers and in our European business. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by $5 million or 1.2%. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $3.8 million or 4.3% to $92 million from $88.3 million last year, due to improved operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 22.3% from 20.9% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased $5.4 million or 1.1% to $480.7 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by $7.1 million or 1.5% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 14.6% in the quarter to $63.2 million from $55.1 million last year, due primarily to good SG&A expense control. Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $0.5 million in the quarter. As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year. That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So, I will turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. John? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year-over-year basis showed modest improvement. Consolidated sales increased 1.7% to $3.2 billion. Consolidated gross margin was 50.9%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Operating profit improved 1.9% to $591.8 million. Profit before tax grew 3.9% to $572.4 million, a 30 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Net income increased 6.2% to $397.9 million and earnings per share increased 6.5% to $4.23 per share. These results are consistent with the GAAP guidance ranges we provided for both revenue and earnings, but they fell short of what we envisioned at the start of the quarter. Revenue growth at the lower end of our low single-digit to mid-single-digit range was disappointing. And the ongoing investments we are making in new stores, sales territories, retail merchandising, advertising, training and store service weighed heavily on earnings, particularly in light of the slow revenue growth. Our sales trend by quarter so far this year is similar to last year with growth decelerating each quarter as we go through the year. At this point, it is unclear whether the mid-year slowdown in sales over the past two years is a result of labor constraints in the construction trades or an indication that the housing cycle is slowing, which is contrary to what most of the data would suggest, or something else entirely. Whatever the reason for the slowdown, our response is the same. We will continue to make prudent investments in the things that drive our long-term growth and profitability. Architectural paint sales through our Paint Stores Group once again significantly outpaced revenue growth for the segment as a whole. High single-digit growth in the new residential and residential repaint contractor business was partially offset by a modest, but unexpected year-over-year decline in DIY sales. Sales to commercial and healthcare customers also generated solid year-over-year growth, while the Property Management segment showed modest gains. The outlook for continued growth in residential markets over the balance of the year and into 2017 remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends, reported by most of our contractor customers. On the other hand, the revenue headwind from our Protective & Marine business in Paint Stores worsened sequentially in the third quarter. During the first nine months of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 69 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations, completing our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the year still calls for the store openings in a range of 90 to 100 net new locations. To-date, our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,141 compared to 4,048 a year ago. Finally, the upward inflection in input costs and operating expenses that we've seen in the recent months, including raw materials, wages and benefits, rent expense and more, warrant a price increase by our Paint Stores Group. Effective December 1, 2016, our Paint Stores Group will be implementing a price increase in the 4% to 5% range across most product lines. We also anticipated a stronger sales performance from our Consumer Group coming into the third quarter. We saw widespread weakness across our commercial, industrial and MRO customers. Our Ronseal brand business in Europe also had a soft quarter. Despite the weaker than expected sales results, the Consumer Group continued to show good progress on margins in the quarter. Our Global Finishes Group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A in the quarter, resulting in a 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest sales declines. We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and in Asia. Finally, our Latin America Coatings Group reported positive revenue growth in the quarter for the first time in 12 quarters. Despite this improvement in revenue and volume momentum, margin pressure from raw materials and higher SG&A spending continue to challenge our profitability throughout the region. Third quarter was a strong quarter for cash generation. Net operating cash in the first nine months was $966.5 million, up about $64 million over last year, with third quarter accounting for about $456 million of the total. We're on pace again this year to generate net operating cash at a rate above 10% of net sales. We were at 10.7% year-to-date, despite higher working capital. Nine-month working capital ticked up slightly to 11.5% of sales from 11.1% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends was $560 million compared to $557 million last year. Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $173.1 million. Depreciation was $128.3 million and amortization was $20.2 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovations projects. During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for Treasury. On September 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. As a result, our cash balance at the close of the third quarter 2016 was $702.6 million compared to $91 million on September 30, 2015. Last week, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the balance of the year remains positive, and we expect to see steady improvement from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset to some degree by continued weakness in Latin America. Over the balance of the year, the input cost tailwinds are likely to turn to headwinds and the slower pace of sales growth is unlikely to fully offset our investment in new stores, territories and retail programs already in place. For the quarter, we anticipate our core consolidated net sales will increase a low single-digit percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter. At this anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share include costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling $0.71 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.03 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, fourth quarter EPS will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.23 per share compared to $2.12 per share earned in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect core consolidated net sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2016 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.30 to $11.40 per share. Full year 2016 earnings per share includes costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar, totaling approximately $1.35 per share, and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.40 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, full year EPS will be in the range of $12.25 to $12.35 per share, a 10% increase at the midpoint of the range over the $11.16 per share earned in 2015. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on the other press release we issued this morning. Last week, our board of directors elected Al Mistysyn to serve as our next Chief Financial Officer, a position held for the past 15 years by Sean Hennessy. This change will take effect January 1, 2017. I'd like to close my comments with a few words about my great friend, Sean Hennessy. My relationship with Sean spans our 30 years together at Sherwin-Williams. He has always been an excellent advisor, contributor, and importantly, friend. We've traveled around the world together on many occasions and Sean has regularly impressed me in so many ways. So, it's no surprise that Sean has once again impressed me with his selfless decision to do what he believes to be right for his family. Sean's decision to step down from the day-to-day responsibilities of CFO in order to provide more time and flexibility to address family priorities is yet another example of the quality individual we've all grown to respect. We appreciate his willingness to stay on as Head of M&A activities, to provide support for the Valspar integration planning process, and to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities. This past year, I've spent more time with Sean than any other executive on my team, travelling with many of you, to immerse myself in this important aspect of my job, and to gain as much information as I could from Sean, knowing this time was coming. Well, it's never a good time for a high performing executive like Sean to leave such an important role. The timing of his decision sets us up well for the year ahead. Now, Mistysyn's promotion to CFO is the natural conclusion of a long, careful and thoughtful development plan to prepare him for this position. Al has been Sean's right hand man, and the architect of many of our financial programs and successes. Al is my choice for this important position. He is a proven seasoned executive and I'm truly excited to have him on my side as we move forward. We've assembled a full Valspar integration team that has been hard at it for several months now, with Al actively involved on a daily basis. We're also in the process of building our operating plans and budgets for next year, with each of our segment teams and having Al on my side for these important meetings is crucial to his fast start. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you very much. Can you guys just add a little more color on the key trends throughout the quarter both from an end market perspective and geographic perspective. And how that rolled through Europe, PSG, same-store sales comp. And then also, if you could comment just very quickly on any margin differential pertaining to the reclassification of revenues? Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. So initially, I would maybe add sort of this way. We did see high single-digit growth in our new residential and our residential repaint business. We saw a solid year-over-year increases in our commercial and our healthcare businesses, and modest gains in our Property Management. As I mentioned, just a moment ago, we did see a modest decline in DIY, and our P&M worsened sequentially. So, our outlook obviously remains very positive. We see the fundamentals of the business are very solid, and have great confidence in the investments that we're making that we're going to continue to be able to grow market share. We talked \u2013 actually Bob just covered geographically about the growth with Canada leading the market, and talked about the different geographies. So, I think we captured that in the comments just a moment ago. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes, Chris. And importantly \u2013 this is Bob. Importantly, we mentioned that the Eastern division was down the most and it's likely that that was at least some weather impact, because they had inclement weather in the quarter. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hey, Chris, this is Al Mistysyn. I'm going to talk about the revenue reclass. And I'll just talk about it broadly, and then talk about the impact on the operating margin. But, we use third-party contractors to complete a variety of things for our customers. Previously, these immaterial amounts were netted and then included in the SG&A. We determine these buildings to customers should be grossed up as sales with a payments contract as included in cost to goods sold for a net immaterial impact on gross profit while reducing gross margin and operating margin. So, no impact on the consolidated dollars, but excluding that revenue reclass and the impact of the acquisitions, our operating margins would have been up slightly. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you. And then just very quickly, within the big boxes, can you just comment on any key trends you saw during the quarter between DIY and DIFM? And whether or not are there any major puts or takes based on your new products specifically INFINITY? Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, we prefer to let our customers talk about the trends within those areas. We do work very hard to work with them, to support them, and we're proud of that INFINITY product. We think it provides a terrific technology for an important customer of ours, but we'd prefer to let them comment about their specific results. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Fair enough. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. You suggested that you're going to increase your paint prices here in the stores as of January 1, 2017. Is that the limit of your price increases or are there other areas where you plan to nominate increases for 2017? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: We made it a practice, Jeff, to talk about our stores pricing. We prefer not to talk about pricing outside of the stores organization. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And, Jeff, this is Sean, I just want to \u2013 you mentioned January first, so I just wanted to put on your radar, it's going to be effective December 1. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: That's right. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. I'm sorry about that. Okay. Is there also a revenue readjustment to come in the fourth quarter from your accounting change or is it taken care of in the third quarter? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes, Jeff, this is Al. We did the adjustment because it's immaterial on a perspective basis, so the third quarter only has a third quarter adjustment, the fourth quarter will have an adjustment and then we will make a first quarter and second quarter of 2017, so the full year 2017 won't have any impact. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Okay. Thank you so much. And the fourth quarter adjustment is something of the same magnitude as the third quarter or it's different? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: It will be similar. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And in general, the revenues are offset by increased cost of goods sold. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Good. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good morning. Sean and Al, congrats, and, Sean, you'll obviously be missed by all of us. Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hey. Thank you. I appreciate that. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So I guess going back to same-store sales for PSG, just kind of being erratic over the past few quarters, you're obviously bullish on the outlook. I guess, John, what are customers, in particular, sharing with you in terms of why growth has been so choppy quarter-by-quarter? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Your point is a good one. The confidence that we have, we believe is built on the fundamentals of the market and we continue to believe that investing in this business is going to be a key part of our success, but the contractors that we've spoken to continue to believe that there are plenty of opportunities ahead. I mentioned the residential business that we saw growing, nearly double-digit increase in residential repaint over 9%. And speaking to these customers about the constraints that they feel as a result of the labor has had an impact on their business. So, we're confident in this model that we have. We're continuing to invest in it. We believe that the investment in our stores, reps and products are going to continue to allow us to continue drive that operating margin. We're going to have a good operating margin improvement this year. We expect to have a good operating margin improvement next year, and we think that the fundamentals of the market support the contractor base that we're focused on. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just... Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Ghansham, this is Bob. Let me fill in that based on our volumes by quarter, it appears to us that the third quarter is the busiest quarter for contractors. So, if there is labor constraints in the market, it would most likely show up in the third quarter, or it would show up more in the third quarter than even in the second quarter. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, for just sticking with PSG and same-store sales, if you stripped out Protective & Marine, can you give us a sense as to what their same-store sales would have looked like? And then, on P&M, are we, John, sort of, at least in your perspective, close to realistic bottom for this business? Thanks so much. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. I'll take the first piece on the bottom of the P&M. We do feel as though that we're nearing bottom. This has been a tough road here with the oil and gas predominantly under a lot of pressure. We have, as I mentioned in previous calls, worked to pivot our efforts into accelerating in other segments where we've been focused on for many years, but we expect to be able to accelerate our sales in those areas. The fact is that the oil and gas is a big part of our business. It's been an area that we've been focused on for many years, and we've had significant success, and it's had an impact on our business as it's slowing down. But, we're continuing to growing in areas within oil and gas, as well as some of these other areas within Protective & Marine. Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. And if you look at the comp stores, I don't have it exactly, but it would be in the mid-single digits. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks for confirming. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Great. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes. Bob, a question on the overall market. I mean, we've seen lower growth from other companies who've reported in the architectural space as well. So, just wondering, snapback that we are all expecting this year, because it \u2013 you know, easy weather comps from last year. Did that not materialize or whether there's some volumes that were brought forward in a very strong first quarter you had? Just wondering what comments you'd have on the overall market growth? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes, Don, in John's prepared remarks, he talked about the sales trend or the sales trajectory by a quarter being similar this year to last year. And we think that's a reflection of the market overall. We're seeing that, that year-over-year growth tends to slow as we go from even second quarter to third quarter sequentially. And we're not sure if that's the function of market capacity or it doesn't feel to us like it's a change in demand trend. Our customers are still reporting very strong order book volume, and so it doesn't feel like third quarter jobs were pulled forward into first quarter and second quarter. It just feels like we're seeing some constraints in the rate at which contractors can get on those jobs. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. The overall tone from our customers remains very positive on the architectural side. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And then a follow-up on your guidance reduction. Is that driven primarily by volumes or how much of a role did raw materials play, you know, are raw materials now going to go \u2013 be up more than you expected for the industry in 2016 and what's your outlook for 2017? Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I'll take the fourth quarter. I think it was driven by the volume side. I don't think that the raws are materially different than what we took a look at. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. On raw materials side, Don, we think it's likely that the raw materials will swing from a low single-digit tailwind in the third quarter to a low single-digit headwind in the fourth quarter, but we've kind of being guiding to that all along. We've said that the benefit from raw materials will diminish as we go through the year. The headwind, if there is one in the fourth quarter will be primarily driven by modest inflation in TiO2. The TiO2 producers got some traction on both their second quarter and third quarter price increases during the year \u2013 or during the second quarters and third quarters. So, we haven't put together an outlook for 2017 yet, but fourth quarter 2016, it's going to be flat to \u2013 raw materials are going to be flat to up low single digits. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Good morning, Arun. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Congrats, Sean. Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just I guess I wanted to follow up on the growth question. Over the last several years, we've seen Paint Stores Group kind of grow 1.5 times to 2 times the market. This quarter, it looks like the 2% growth is kind of in line with the market. Is that a fair assessment and is there anything that changed that led to this kind of performance? And then also in Consumer, it looks like the 2% decline is kind of bit below, and you just discussed that a modest decline in DIY, maybe you can just help us understand what drove that? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. I think it's a bit early to tell if there's the issue with market, I don't think we have enough data right now to know how our growth in the market compared to our competitors. Our third quarter last year showed the same sequential softness, as Bob mentioned before rebounding in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And as I mentioned, we believe that the growth that we saw in the architectural side in residential repaint and new residential, a very high strong performance, the solid year in commercial and healthcare that I mentioned as well as the modest gains in Property Management, we still feel as that we're growing share, and most importantly I would say would be the fundamentals, the position that we have in the marketplace with the contractor continuing to outpace the market and our positioning there and our continued investment there is what gives us the most confidence. These stores that we're adding, the reps that we're adding, the new products that we're adding as well as our core locations we believe will allow us to continue to grow our share. Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: When you ask about the Consumer Group, again our Consumer Group this quarter was negatively affected by the European businesses as well as some of the commercial, industrial and MRO that are also embedded in there. So if you look at the North American architectural business, we were pleased with those results. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And if you back out the European business, our North American business was positive. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just as a quick follow-up on the price in raw materials side, usually you take pricing I guess in the beginning of the year. Is there a reason that you kind of pulled that forward, you discussed the low single-digit headwind. But presumably, if you're announcing it December 1, you won't see that in Q4. So, is it safe to assume that that'll start flowing through in Q1 or what's the cadence on realizing that pricing? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, I think it speaks to what we've spoken about frequently which is, when we know, we typically go. And the fact is that, the last price increase as you know that we took was in the first quarter of 2014. Many of our operating expense categories have risen since then, our wage and benefits, our store rent and presumably, as Bob just mentioned, we're going to see some raw material increases. And so, we knew it was time for a price increase and we decided to go ahead and move on it. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good afternoon and good morning. Within Paint Stores Group, obviously, the results were below your expectations. And you outlined the different sub-segments of it. But it wasn't clear to me, which one of those came in below your expectations. You talked about high single-digit residential; doesn't seem like it would be that. So, was it DIY, was it the healthcare or Protective & Marine, what went wrong? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, I think obviously our DIY with a modest decline was clearly below our expectation. For Protective & Marine, we still have high expectations for this team. We recognize that a big percentage of the business is growing in this oil and gas. But we are focused on a number of these other segments. And we have been involved in these other areas and our expectations for all our teams are to continue to improve. So, I'd tell you that even our residential repaint up in nearly double digits, our expectations are that we want to grow faster. So, clearly some of those underperformed to a little greater degree in the DIY and P&M, Protective & Marine that I mentioned, but it's safe to say that our expectations are we want to grow faster in every one of those segments. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, just a follow-up, internally, as you guys assess the weather impact on any given quarter, do you have any particular means by which you do that? I mean I think about a hurricane going up the Gulf Coast \u2013 sorry, up the East Coast in September. Then we had another one in October for the fourth quarter. So, how do you guys think about assessing the impact of lost painting days or even 4th of July moved a day during this quarter from a Saturday to a Monday? So what is the impact of that type of stuff and is it worth speaking about in advance to the extent that we know about it? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: We don't like to talk about it, to be truthful with you. I mean our discussion internally as you mentioned is that we've got shareholders with high expectations, and we've got to find a way over the hill. And yes, we had to close stores in areas that were affected, but we're not leaning on that. We have a determined effort on this side of the call to continue to drive and improve. And quite frankly, it's something that we don't want to point to. We know it was there... Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: ...but we have high expectations of ourselves. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I appreciate that. I'm not looking for excuses. I just want the explanation and it might be helpful going forward just to understand the change in results, particularly as they get more lumpy. But I'll pass it along. Thanks very much. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Vincent. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, good morning, fellows. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Good morning, Duffy. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Question just as you think through the incremental margins, sales were down in both Consumer Group and Global Finishes, but yet income was up. So what was happening there that you were able to drive better income results than revenue results? Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Duffy, this is Sean. I think it really goes back to just the lumpiness, the question that we asked earlier I think, as John said, when you look at the year-to-date, I think that just the way different sales and SG&A comes in, in these different areas. So, I think when you take a look at the full year in Global Finishes back in 2014, the operating margin was 9.7%, last year it was 10.5%, this year through the first nine months it's 12.3%. So, we look at it more that way. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. And I'd add this to it, Duffy, that organization, that team is doing a terrific job as well I think, at looking at opportunities, back office expenses where we can take some synergies through the organization. They've also got a strong focus on customers and positive mix of products. So, we knew that this was going to be a challenging year for them, and they went into it with the right frame of mind that we had to show improvement, and we had to pull a number of different levers to be able to get there. And they're working hard to do just that. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And then on Consumer Group, a similar trend. If you look at 2014 operating margin at 17.8%, going to 19.6% last year and up 40 basis points year-to-date, they're doing a nice job of controlling SG&A and getting operating efficiencies with the volumes that we're generating through Paint Stores Group. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then on oil and gas, when was the peak of your oil and gas sales, and what's the magnitude of the headwind do you face revenue-wise since that peak? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I don't know of the exact timing of the... Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think it very externally (43:27) correlates to the price of oil. I think... John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. I was just going to say it. Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. I don't know the exact date, but I think as the price of oil came down, the CapEx spending began to decrease and I think \u2013 and that's why we're in the situation we are. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. So, obviously impacted by the CapEx spending that Sean talked about and as we mentioned the opportunity to pivot into some of these other areas. Infrastructures is an area that the team is focused on as well as some of the other segments within our focus there. So, plenty of opportunity here; some heavy lifting to do. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, fellows. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you, Duffy. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Good morning, Bob. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: John, I was wondering if you could talk about, are there prior precedence where you've taken up price in the stores that there has been pressure in the DIY channel and I guess I ask that in the context of your major DIY competitor talked about increased promotions and rebates and those sorts of things. So it looks like maybe there is some pressure on price through DIY. So, what's your thoughts about historically being able to push through the stores prices if the broader DIY market might be under some pressure? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Bob, I've been in this industry now, coming up on 32 years and every day of my experience has been competitive. We work hard in what we do to add value to our customers. And as I mentioned, a piece of this, we expect will be raw materials, the other components that we have invested in to be able to supply our customers with a greater value are key drivers for our ability to put a price increase in, and we don't take that lightly. To your point, we know it's competitive. We've got to be able to demonstrate a value to our customers. And so, the combination of our products and our services have to make our customers more money of what they do or we don't deserve the business. And we understand how competitive it is out there. And so, we're investing in the right things to better position ourselves to better help our customers. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Makes sense. And then let me ask if I could on the \u2013 Bob Wells, I think you talked about low single-digit raws' inflation. John, you mentioned 4% to 5% seeking price in your stores business. How should we think about the gross margin path into 2017? Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think that 2017, when you look at it, we're very focused on operating margins, as you know, you've been with us for many, many years. And I think over the last three years-plus, the gross margin has been driving those margins. I think that we all know that the gross margin is not going to be as robust when it comes to year-over-year. I think that we're going to continue to do things for efficiencies in the plants and warehouse. The price increase to make sure that the gross margin is somewhat positive as I read it, but it's not going to be the driver it's been for the last three years, but that operating margin is going to be also helped by the work that we're going to do in the SG&A. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. Every year, is different as you know, Bob, and we set out with a plan on January 1, and by January 2 it changes depending on what's happening in the market. And the one thing that will be true to Sean's point is our focus on this operating margin improvement. And so, the efforts that we'll be taking will get us there. We'll figure out a way to do that. It may, as Sean mentioned, not be the margins in the past, it may be greater leverage on the SG&A while driving sales. But our commitment is the improvement in operating margins going forward. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks for the help. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Sean, you've been a great CFO, but I still don't think your stock would take it this hard that you're going to be phasing back. Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. I know what you mean. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Wishes going forward. You're going to open up about 40 stores in the fourth quarter here, which I think you've done before, you're usually backend loaded, but could you talk a little bit about the labor market for staffing 40 stores in a quarter and lease rates and things like that? I'd assume store openings are costing you more now than they probably ever have? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I don't know if they are costing us more than we ever had, and in our ability to recruit on campus has been terrific. We hire as you know, John, having travelled with us, between 1,200 and 1,400 management trainees a year. The performance of our company and the brand has allowed us to recruit the highest caliber trainees and you know, I'd say that that just continues, the more time I spend with our trainee class, the more I'm impressed with our ability to recruit such high caliber people. So, we've got confidence there. We've been able to negotiate good rents and leases with our track record. And we're becoming more and more choice in these markets, because of our ability to ensure the financial strength of the company, and what we bring to the market. So, we're actually in a very good place right now and our focus continues to be on accelerating the performance of those new stores. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : And then secondarily, do you think the down DIY volume has anything to do with the channel positioning in advance of the Valspar closing? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No, I don't think so. I think that we'll see what happens in the market on DIY specifically, but I don't think that it has an impact on it at all. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Oli Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC : Yes. Good morning, guys. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Good morning, Oli. Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC : Regarding the comps throughout the quarter, did we see a very similar progression throughout the quarter that we saw through the year or so, beginning if the quarter was stronger and then tailing off? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I don't understand. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No, I think we were pretty consistent on the cadence of sales throughout the quarter. Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Got it. And then, just you mentioned that on the total sales, there was a 2.3% help on the revenue reclassification. Was there a similar impact on the comps in PSG? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No, the comps in PSG were not impacted by the change in revenue reclass. Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. And then lastly, just the reduction in the full year guidance, you left the sales guidance up low single digits, basically unchanged. So is that more of a function of gross margins or SG&A? Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think, it comes back to I think the \u2013 it probably had more to do with the sales volumes in the third quarter than anything else. Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. Thanks very much. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Oli. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Couple of questions, first of all just wanted to follow up on the Paint Store comp, so you had 2.1% same-store growth and you had 2.3% from the reclassification of revenue, which still leaves about 2.5% or 2.3% sort of unaccounted for. Is that the price mix benefit or how should I think about classifying that especially since you've talked about a little bit of an FX headwind? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: You also have to factor in the new stores in that delta and then the rest of the price mix. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Price mix, okay. Fair enough. If you look at \u2013 you mentioned a couple of times that higher SG&A expense in the Stores Group in Latin America grew. Was that around just store openings or was \u2013 I mean or promotional activity or are you staffing external sales people more, can you talk about sort of what's driving the higher SG&A and why we should not look for that to continue into 2017? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: The majority of the SG&A increase was related to the new store and reps. I think the teams are doing a nice job of controlling the other SG&A around the fringes, based on the sequential slowdown in sales. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. But I mean your store growth this year is not that different from what it was last year and yet you called out SG&A expense. So, that's why I'm asking I guess. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: We also had, if you recall in the second quarter, we talked about the investments we were making in the Consumer Group and some of those have continued through. So, between the new stores and the continued investments in Consumer Group, that's what's driving the increase in SG&A. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. All right. And then just a quick question on tax rate, you talked about it being in the low 30%s for 2016. If you kind of look at Sherwin in isolation, and forget about the Valspar piece that's being added and what that can do to your tax rate, if you just look at Sherwin, is kind of the low 30%s tax rate is what we should be thinking about or the changes in taxes that you made, that were excluding from this year's earnings, how should we think about tax rate going into 2017 and Sherwin-Williams as a standalone entity without thinking about Valspar yet? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes, I think the core tax rate's excluding that, accounting adjustment, it will be in the low 30%s. If you look at our year-to-date effective tax rate, it's 31.7% versus 31.6% last year. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. So basically, just continuation of the tax rate that we've seen? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. All right, thank you very much. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Dmitry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question? Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Yes, good morning. I recognize Europe is not an enormous region for you, but to the extent that you are exposed there, I was wondering if you could comment on trends that you're seeing by product line and also on an individual country basis if you're seeing anything material there. It sounds like it hit Consumer a bit. And I'm wondering you know if you think that it's macro or broad based in nature or more idiosyncratic. Thanks. Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think when you look at the business we have in Europe, I think we're not broad based at all. I think that we don't have any architectural business in Europe. So, we're not probably a good barometer of what's happening there. On the industrial side, we're probably heavy in industrial wood, but that's in the Global Finishes Group and that's actually been strong \u2013 stable I'd say, I'll use the word stable. So, I think to try to get some type of barometer of Europe, we're not a very good indicator event. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Clear enough. And then second question if I may, possibly for Bob, I think you mentioned your commercial business was up. I was wondering if you could speak to non-res more broadly on your third quarter experience and your term outlook. Thanks. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes, Kevin. As a reminder, there is a pretty long lag between a non-residential start on average and when that project is painted. So, we are benefiting from fairly strong start activity 18 months ago to two years ago. And as a result, the commercial business is holding up quite well. It's not as strong as the residential segments. John indicated the residential businesses are up in the high single digits. It's not that strong, but it's really solid year-over-year growth. The dark lining around that silver cloud is that starts this year are actually down year-over-year. So, we're seeing some weakness in new projects started that if that persist, was going to impact our commercial business a couple of years out. Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Okay. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: But for the time being, it's good. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Good morning, Mike. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Latin America. It was nice to see it get back above breakeven, and you've added about 25 stores this year. So can you talk a little bit about the strategy going forward, and what the outlook might be, should we expect it to remain above breakeven or could some of those investments start to weigh on the performance on the bottom line? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. So, our approach in Latin America is really market specific, not even country specific. We understand that there are locations in the market throughout the Latin American region where the direct store model might be best, and there might be others that are best utilized through home centers or through dealers and our team down there is working very hard to upgrade our position in the marketplace, and by doing what we believe to be the heavy lifting now while the market is maybe choppy, might be an understatement, but while taking those steps now that we'll be better able to participate at a greater rate once the market does improve. We do feel as though that it's hit a trough. It's too early to tell if it's improvement in the market is sustainable there, the choppiness in sales and profit likely to continue over the next few quarters, but we really do believe that the steps that we're taking right now are going to better position us by allowing for a better employee base that we have down there, better product line, more consistent products, and a much more efficient path to the customer than what we've had in the past. So, our expectations of what we're doing down there are clearly to outperform the market as we move forward. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And I would add that going forward of course, you'd expect them to be closer to breakeven. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. And you've also talked about some of the SG&A expense control. I was wondering if you could talk at all about your marketing and advertising expenses, and how those have trended during the year. At this point, are we running meaningfully above or below what we might think of as normal advertising expenses? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No. I don't think we're meaningfully above or below. I think we're right around the same paces we've been in the past. We're trying to be as smart and efficient with what we're doing with media. But I wouldn't say that we've jumped or cut to anything in a meaningful way. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. Thanks very much. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Hey, good morning. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hey, Scott. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Quick question, I mean, your feedback that you're relaying from the field despite slower sales growth than you expected, is pretty positive on this call. But, I think in your prepared remarks, John, you noted that you're not sure if the housing cycle might be slowing or we might be in the later innings. So, being a good bridge is there's two comments, because it sounds a lot more bullish on the Q&A than what you may have said on the prepared remarks? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, my point was that we certainly saw a slowdown in the third quarter, Scott. And our feeling continues to be that the fundamentals still support the market in a very positive way. And, I know, you've heard Bob talk about those in a number of occasions. But, if you just look at household formations, new home sales, single family start permits, re-sales, the underserved entry into the new residential by builders, the fundamentals continue to be there. And, we expect that the contractor is going to be the benefactor of many of these opportunities and our position with that contractor is something that we're continuing to improve them. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And, by the way, Scott, maybe it wasn't worded as well as it could have been, but John's opening remarks basically said, if it's a slowdown in the housing cycle contrary to all \u2013 with all the data would suggest. So, he was kind of qualifying it by saying, we're not seeing it in the data; but if it is, we're still going to invest in the thing that drive our growth. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Okay. I appreciate this, clarifying that. And just to kind of reiterate, is this I guess more uncertainty to the cadence of how the business is growing, have any impact on to how you are thinking about incremental investment back into the business and/or on the synergy guidance for Valspar? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I believe that our investments will continue as you've seen. This is a year that's going to have record sales, record profit, record operating margin. We're going to continue to invest in those drivers that we believe will allow us to drive that operating margin further and that's going to be in new stores, new reps, new products and we believe that the contractors positioned as I said, very well in the market and our positions, we're going to be working very hard to improve that. And we've got confidence in that model and we've got confidence in our ability to execute it. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks. I just have a couple of quick ones. In terms of your sales growth for the fourth quarter for the year not really changing out that much, is that just more of a function \u2013 is that more of a function of the reclassification, so reclassification in the fourth quarter is going to be 2% impact, I guess sales would be flat to down excluding that? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No, I think that just low-single digit is on the core, it's just movement within the core \u2013 within that range. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, in terms of Valspar, is there any sort of change here, expectations that's going to close in the first quarter or expectation if one will here, it's something about a ruling? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No, at this time we still believe this is going to be in the first quarter. We're down to just a few countries and we're feeling positive about the momentum that we have. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then last, does the currency in Latin America, does that turn into a tailwind starting in the fourth quarter? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No. I think it'll still be a headwind, I guess on somewhat to what we saw in the third quarter. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Ivan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Two questions for you. First of all, Bob or Sean or Allen, if you could review what we should be thinking about in terms of price, understand that increase becomes effective December 1, which I think is a little different language than you had in the past. Curious, what we should be assuming in terms of the time to implement and the amount of that, that should be expected to be realized? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. I think that we've in the past have said that we've been 75% effective when you take a look at the increase. So, 4.5% to 5%, you're talking, use it 4.5 times, 75%, you're talking just over 3%. I think that we've constantly said that we're working to trying to get that quicker. I think you'll see some effect in December, but it will be muted. And I think that the first quarter, you'll see hopefully somewhere in that 50% effectiveness, and then, from then on I think you'll see it at 75%. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, secondly, we'd just love a little perspective, I think the statement was made that the store comp would be 5% x-Protective & Marine, and I'm curious within that or if you want to speak to the expectation of the architectural business, how that compares to the prior couple of quarters and what the expectation should be of that moving forward? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. I think that the architectural and if you look at the quarters there's no doubt the first quarter was the strongest quarter. Architecturally, second was the second strongest and then the third. But I do believe, when you take a look at it, some of these, the third quarter was probably way down because of that DIY component that we talked about. So I think again, I think the John's comments about the strength of the market of why we could continue to invest and feel good about the \u2013 what kind of results we can produce in this Paint Stores Group are still driven by those spots on the architectural side. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Excluding DIY, are you capable of looking through the numbers or sharing with us excluding DIY, it sounds like the resi-repaint was up high single-digits versus perhaps low double-digits. What's other than DIY, it seems like the other pieces of architectural slowed a bit in 3Q relative to its 2Q growth, is that accurate? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: And any thoughts on the driver to that? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I will tell you this is, yeah, I think that labor you know \u2013 we're seeing things such as labor constrain some of these results that we're having in some of these quarters. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, Eric, it's not uncommon at all to hear contractors talk about their ability to do more work, if they had more qualified labor. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks and a lot of questions have been asked. I appreciate you let me sneak one in here. So, I was just wondering from your perspective, obviously we have this dichotomy between the pro market, the contractor market and do-it-yourself. As you guys think back over the years the company, I mean you've ever seen this kind of divergence in the two, and in your opinion, what do you think's causing it, I mean it seems like consumer for some reason is a little weaker, I mean we're seeing that across a lot of different sectors and I'm just trying to understand, from your perspective, what you think is kind of going on. Have you ever seen this before, so anything you can shed, any light... Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, Scott. This is Bob. We've talked for a long time about this long-term secular trend away from DIY toward the contractor. And we saw that kind of step back in the direction of DIY during the 2008, 2009 cycle. And since that time, we think that there has been a pretty strong migration back toward the pro. What we've observed in past cycles is that when we see a period of rapid home value appreciation, in many cases, it will accelerate the move back to the pro. People are more incline to hire a professional when they're feeling more positive about the equities that they have in their home. So, the last three years, pretty rapid home value appreciation that we've seen may have accelerated this migration away from DIY and toward the pro. That's the best we've got; there is no empirical data as to why that's happening. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Could I do a follow-up quick, Bob, is that all right? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. You bet. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. So, there's obviously been a lot of thoughts regarding millennials, younger households are probably more do-it-yourself versus do-it-for-me. Still want a buzz that millennials are finally kicking it into gear, but what you're saying to me maybe argues against that, I wonder if you have any thoughts on that piece as well? And then, thanks. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, we certainly agree that millennials will be a stronger driver in the housing market going forward. I mean there's forecast of between 13.5 million and 17 million new first-time home buyers, coming into the market in the next five years, which is really exciting to us, and all due respect for the younger generations, we disagree with the notion that millennials are strong DIY'ers. They have not shown to be at nearly the levels that their parents were. Baby boomers were far more DIY involved than their offspring, and you know, it certainly has a lot to do with schedules nowadays being very tight and lack of free time. But, we don't necessarily see the millennials coming into the home buying market as driving DIY the way the baby boomers did a generation ago. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : That's perfect. It of course argues to your business model too, so that's good news for the long-term. Anyway, thanks, guys. Really appreciate it. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You noted that keeping strong control on your SG&A cost just going to help your operating income line going forward, and of course that was represented in most of the segments. But you also did note some of the headwind in the Paint Stores Group. So, I'm curious, where will the incremental discipline come on the SG&A is it going to be in the Paint Stores Group? And if so, how that affects your investment there? And if it's not in the Paint Stores Group, where would it be, because it seems you're pretty disciplined across the board? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. So, it's going to be across the board. And I think as you look at our opportunities going forward, the ability to leverage SG&A in every organization exist, I mentioned earlier about the Global Finishes Group taking a look at a number of the areas in the back office to become more efficient. We have those opportunities throughout the organization. What we're committed to though are those areas that are customer-facing and continuing to invest in this model. We just talked with the previous questioner about the long-term model and why it fits and why we believe in it. So, you're going to continue to see us invest in new stores, territories, new products, the things that allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competition and you should expect us to continue to be animals on expenses. We had a discussion last week about our budgeting process and I mentioned Al coming on board and same discipline that we've had with Sean in the past. We're going into our operating plan process, we're starting at ground zero and we're ripping every expense out that we can that doesn't affect sales. And so, we want to be that disciplined about what it is we're doing. We don't want to point to past success and justify future expense. We want to be invested in those things that are going to drive our business and we're committed to doing that in the models that will drive the operating margin that we've talked about. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Fair enough. And just as a follow-up. You note the weakness in oil and gas on the Protective & Marine, but there are a certain number of chemical projects coming out in the Gulf Coast. So, is it just that the size of oil and gas is so heighted, offset whatever is going on in chemical in that part of your business or do you just not have the type of mix that you want or exposure to the chemical industry for your Protective business? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, it's a little bit of both, we've had success in oil and gas in areas that are not investing right now and we're still growing market share in some of those areas. Even with the decline, we're still fighting and growing we believe share in a very challenging market, but to your point and it's the point that I try to make earlier, there are still areas for us \u2013 there are opportunities in the space, you mentioned the chemical areas where there are our assets coming online. We're fighting for everyone of those projects. We know that the infrastructure is an area that eventually is going to have to be an area of focus for our country, and countries around the world, and we're furthering our penetration in those areas. So what I don't want to give is the impression that we're just sitting here waiting for the oil and gas market to fix itself, we're up there fighting in existing markets, in adjacent markets, and in new markets, and we believe that there is considerable amount of opportunity for us there, and we're determined to capture. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. Thanks for your help. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you, Nils. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg. Please proceed with your question. Chris Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research): Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the call. The antitrust regulatory environment you have been doing deals for a while now, have you noticed the change this year as you've gone through the Valspar deal? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No. I think they are doing their job, they are asking questions that are appropriate, and we're trying to be as responsive as we can. I think going into this, we knew the deal and the facts and feel confident that the facts will carry the day, but we've got a government agency that is empowered to look at these things, and challenge, and they're doing just that, and we're trying to be as responsive as we can. Chris Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research): All right. And then a quick question, inventory was up, are you carrying more volume of inventory due to the slowdown here, and on the back of that, you typically won promotions in through October at your Paint Stores? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I'll address the inventory and our working capital was up slightly in the \u2013 through September. The way we look at it as a reminder, we target a 10% of sales, our working capital last year came in at 8.6%, we expect this year to come in around 10%. So, I don't believe we're carrying more inventory than we should be. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And we do occasionally run promotion in October. Chris Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research): All right. Thank you, guys. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Wang with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was pretty late in the call. So, one on same-store sales in resi-repaint for professional. So, just in the home sales, it looks like they were basically flat or down year-on-year compared to the third quarter of 2015, but you guys saw a high-single digits in the professional segment there. Do you think that \u2013 I guess, would you attribute this to as a stronger business model? I know that we obviously saw weakness in DIY, but I'm trying to get a sense of why the professional segment was so strong? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, we've had a team that's been focused on that segment for many years, and it goes back to the comment that I made earlier about our commitment to providing the products, then services, locations, the people that will help us differentiate us from our competition. And we're blessed with good competition out there. So, we're not satisfied, we're not complacent. We're not sitting here feeling as though we've got it all figured out, we're trying to get better every day. And with our direct model, which is unique and the ability to really partner with our customers in understanding what their needs are and sometimes satisfying needs that they don't even know exist, has allowed us we believe to grow a little faster than the market. And we're committed to doing the things that can help differentiate us from our competition by allowing our customers to be more successful and what they're trying to do. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And, David, while you're right that existing home turnover does drive residential retain activity, remodeling activity in total year-to-date is up pretty substantially, it's up more than \u2013 it's up almost 6% in spending year-on-year. So, in the absence of a lot of growth in existing home turnover, we've seen growth in remodeling activity. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And one last thing I would add is the point that Bob made earlier, which is the shift to more and more contractor base, I think \u2013 we have to acknowledge that there is a shift going on to the contractor and we happen to be positioned very well for that contractor, but I also believe that's helping us as well. David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Fine, great. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good afternoon, everyone and congratulations to both, Sean and Al. Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hey. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you. Thank you, Chuck. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : We've talked of the contractors, you've mentioned this labor shortage, John, and I think it's even of impact as how aggressive they want to be on bidding at this point, does that board well for projects going into next year once the paint season gets underway, we're coming into some tougher weather now seasonally. So, what are your thoughts on that? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think it does, Chuck. I think it's \u2013 and that's the point that I made, I know I keep beating the same drum, but it's what gives us confidence about the model in 2017 and our ability to continue to drive operating margins going forward. You're exactly right. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay. And looking at the Consumer Group, and Sean or Al you might want to address this one, the margins were up on lower sales. Does some of that reflect what went on last year with the load into Lowe's and introductory promotional spending? Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No, I think the spending has been pretty consistent in it. It's like we talked about in the second quarter, it was may be different programs, but with the \u2013 around the other hedges of SG&A that they did a nice job of controlling their costs and we talked about the mix in that business that helped, so I think that's what's driving the margin. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Thank you. Oh! You know, and obviously at the end of the call, I got cut off somehow for a bit. And I think, I joined just as you were explaining that reclassification, if now is a good time to just quickly explain that it would be great, otherwise I'll catch you offline? Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Chuck, we use third-party contractors and they do a variety of things for our customers, these previously immaterial amounts (79:37) SG&A, we determine that the billings to the customers should've been grossed up in sales with the payments for the contractors included in cost of goods sold in it, for net immaterial impact on gross profit. It does reduce our gross margin, and it does decrease our operating margin. And what we've talked about is, we did it prospectively in the third quarter, so we only booked it for the third quarter, we'll do that in the fourth quarter that I'll have a similar small impact, and then in the first quarter and second quarters of 2017. So 2017 full-year won't have any impact. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: You're welcome. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Thank you. It appears, we have no further questions at this time. So, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you, Jesse. As always, I'll be available over the next few days to handle any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. As call volume is already very heavy, I appreciate your patience, I will make every effort to get back to you on a timely basis. I'd like to thank you again for joining us today, and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

Good morning, everyone. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, www.sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, January 26 Press Release. Beginning with our fourth quarter, consolidated sales increased $178 million or 6.8% to $2.78 billion due primarily to higher paint sales volumes through our paint stores and the impact of a change in revenue classification related to third-party service revenue and related costs. For the full year, consolidated sales increased $516.3 million or 4.6% to $11.86 billion. The change in revenue classification increased sales 2.2% in the fourth quarter and 1.1% for full year 2016. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 0.9% in the quarter, and 1.4% for the full year. Consolidated gross profit in the fourth quarter increased $66.2 million or 5% to $1.38 billion. Gross profit for the year increased $363 million or 6.5% to $5.92 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter was 49.9% compared to 50.8% in the same period last year. Adjusting for the change in revenue classification, comparable gross margin in the fourth quarter would be approximately 51%. For the year, consolidated gross margin increased to 50% from 49% last year. Again, adjusting for the revenue reclassification, full year gross margin would be 50.4%. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $53.5 million or 5.4% to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 37.6% from 38.1% in the same period last year. For the full year SG&A expense increased $246 million or 6.3% to $4.16 billion, an increase as a percent of sales to 35.1% from 34.5% in 2015. Without the change in revenue classification, SG&A as a percent of sales was 38.2% in the quarter and 35.4% for the year. SG&A in both the quarter and full year included acquisition-related expenses totaling $9.2 million and $58.4 million, respectively. Interest expense for the quarter increased $23.8 million to $43.3 million. For the year, interest expense increased $92.3 million to $154.1 million. The majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before tax in the quarter increased $6.8 million or 2.3% to $304 million, which included approximately $34.5 million in acquisition-related expenses. For the full year, consolidated profit before tax increased $46.3 million or 3% to $1.6 billion, including approximately $133.6 million in acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax $4.1 million in the quarter and $21.3 million for full year compared to 2015. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter decreased to 33.2% from 33.4% last year and decreased to 29% for the full year compared to 32% in 2015. Comparable effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the reduction in the income tax provision, would be 34.8% in the quarter and 32.3% for full year. Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter increased 1.9% to $2.15 per share from $2.11 per share last year. The $2.15 included $0.03 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.22 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Diluted net income per common share for 2016 increased 7.5% to $11.99 per share from $11.15 per share in 2015. The $11.99 includes $0.40 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.86 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation decreased earnings per share by $0.03 per share in the quarter and $0.14 for the full year. Our results in the quarter and full year includes individually-significant non-operating items consisting of environmental expense, a gain on the sale of assets and goodwill and trademark impairment charges. The net after-tax impact of these items increased diluted earnings per share approximately $0.03 in the quarter and had no effect on earnings per share for the full year. Let me take a few minutes now to break down our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter increased $163.5 million, or 9.8%, to $1.84 billion. For the year, net sales increased 8.1% to $7.79 billion. Comparable store sales, sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months increased 5.5% in the quarter and 5.3% in the year. Paint Stores Group sales increase was due primarily to higher architectural paint sales volume across all customer segments, plus the impact of the change in revenue classification. The change in revenue classification is not reflected in comparable store sales. Regionally in the fourth quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Canada, Southwest division, Midwestern division and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. Fourth quarter segment profit increased $25.7 million, or 8.1%, to $341.9 million due primarily to higher year-over-year paint sales volumes. For the full year, profit increased $189.1 million, or 13.2%, to $1.62 billion. The increase in segment profit for the year resulted from higher paint sales volumes that were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. Excluding the change in revenue classification, segment operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 30 basis points to 19.2% from 18.9% last year. Paint Stores Group operating margin for full year 2016 excluding the revenue reclassification increased 130 basis points to 21.2% from 19.9% last year. Turning now to the Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased $1.3 million or 0.4% to $315.9 million. For the year, Consumer Group sales increased $6.4 million, also 0.4% to $1.58 billion. In both the quarter and full year, higher volume sales to most of our Consumer Group's retail accounts was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation that decreased net sales 1.3% in the quarter and 1.1% in the year. Segment profit for our Consumer Group in the fourth quarter increased $4 million or 8% to $54.9 million. For the year, segment profit increased $10.4 million or 3.3% to $319.2 million. Segment profit as a percent of net sales for the quarter increased to 17.4% from 16.2% last year. For the year, segment operating margin increased to 20.1% from 19.6% last year. Most of the improvement in both fourth quarter and full-year segment profit margin was from volume-driven operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control. For our Global Finishes Group, fourth quarter net sales in US dollars were flat to last year, at $455 million. Full year sales decreased 1.4% to $1.89 billion. Unfavorable currency translation decreased sales in US dollars by 1.7% in the quarter and 2.6% in the year. Stated in US dollars, Global Finishes Group segment profit in the fourth quarter increased $11.4 million or 22.6% to $62 million from $50.6 million last year. For the full-year, segment profit increased $37.1 million or 18.4% to $239 million, due primarily to good expense control and lower raw material costs that were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Unfavorable currency reduced segment profit $800,000 in the quarter and $5.8 million in the year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit improved to 13.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 11.1% in the fourth quarter last year. Operating margin for the year increased to 12.7% compared to 10.5% in 2015. For our Latin America Coatings Group, net sales in the quarter increased $13.1 million or 8.3% to $171.8 million. Full-year net sales decreased $44.1 million or 7% to $586.9 million, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices. Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 6.7% in the quarter and 13.5% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group recorded a loss of $7.8 million in the quarter compared to a profit of $2.8 million last year. For the year, Latin America Coatings Group reported a loss of $17.4 million compared to a profit of $18.5 million in 2015. Segment profit in both the quarter and year was adversely affected by goodwill and trademark impairment charge of $10.7 million, increasing raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation that were all partially offset by selling price increases. Unfavorable currency decreased segment profit $3.2 million in the quarter and $14.2 million in the full year. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was negative 4.5% in the quarter compared to a profit of 1.8% last year and negative 3% for the full year compared to a profit of 2.9% in 2015. That concludes our review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. So, let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2017. John? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 2016 was a momentous year for Sherwin-Williams. Against the backdrop of our 150th year in business, we transitioned the role of Chief Executive Officer at the beginning of the year and put plans in place to transition our Chief Financial Officer role at year end. In March, we announced our intent to acquire Valspar, the largest, most transformational acquisition in our company's history. And throughout the year, we worked to secure regulatory approval for the deal and to define what this new combined organization would like post integration. With change comes uncertainty and in financial markets, uncertainty often leads to volatility. 2016 was a volatile year for Sherwin-Williams' stock. We opened the year at $257 a share, saw a mid-year high of $312, and an inter-year low of $239. Some of the share price volatility was understandably caused by quarter-to-quarter volatility in our results, while some appeared to be driven by market speculation. Through all of the change, uncertainty, volatility and speculation, our confidence in our business model, our strategy and the ability of our people to execute at a high-level and generate high returns never wavered. Our full-year results for 2016 include expenses related to the Valspar acquisition, and two accounting changes adopted during the year that affected our revenues and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our core results for the year met or exceeded every expectation we set back in January. Consolidated sales increased 3.5% to $11.72 billion. Consolidated gross margin was 50.5%, an increase of 150 basis points over full-year 2015. Operating profit improved 10.8% to $1.82 billion. Profit before tax grew 11.6% to $1.73 billion, an increase of more than 100 basis points as a percent of sales. EBITDA eclipsed $2 billion for the first time in our history. Net income increased 11% to $1.17 billion. And earnings per share increased 11.7% to $12.45 per share; noteworthy, considering our full-year EPS last year included $0.53 in favorable LIFO inventory adjustments, while LIFO was slightly unfavorable in 2016. Each of these results represent a new record high for the company. Architectural paint sales to our paint stores picked up momentum in the fourth quarter with every customer segment generating positive volumes. Not surprisingly, the tightness in the labor market appears to be less acute in the seasonally smaller quarters. As a result, architectural paint sales to contractors accelerated to a high-single-digit growth rate in the quarter, aided by a backlog of projects from earlier in the year. Sales to residential repaint contractors rebounded to a double-digit growth rate, marking the 11th quarter of double-digit growth in the past 13 quarters. Sales of protective and marine coatings were negative in the quarter, but the impact on Paint Stores Group sales were muted due to seasonality. In the fourth quarter, Paint Stores Group's operating margin on incremental sales was greater than 24%, a strong performance in light of the roughly $30 million LIFO benefit they received in fourth quarter last year compared to a LIFO expense of $2 million in fourth quarter this year. During the quarter, we opened 39 net new stores, bringing our full year store opening total to 94 net new locations and our total store count at year-end to 4,180 stores in the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean. We remain confident that our next milestone of 5,000 locations in North America is realistic, and we intend to add another 90 to 100 stores this year. We anticipated a stronger sales performance from Consumer Group coming into the fourth quarter. The weakness we experienced in the third quarter in our European business, due, in part, to currency devaluation, carried over into the fourth quarter. Despite the weaker than expected sales results, Consumer Group continued to manage operating expenses well and showed good progress on margins in the quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, Latin America Coatings Group reported positive revenue growth, as stronger volumes and positive pricing overcame a currency headwind of nearly 7% in the quarter. Segment profit also showed improvement, overcoming rising raw material costs and the effect of currency devaluation. Without the $10.7 million goodwill impairment in the quarter, the segment earned $2.9 million in profit for the quarter. Our Global Finishes Group once again did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A in the quarter, resulting in a cycle-high 13.6% operating margin, a 250 basis point improvement compared to fourth quarter last year. We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses in Europe and Asia. 2016 was another strong year in terms of cash generation. Net operating cash for the year was $1.31 billion, well ahead of our target of 10% of net sales, with fourth quarter accounting for about $344 million of the total. Net working capital was a use of cash, finishing the year at 10.7% of sales compared to 8.6% at year-end 2015. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $757.5 million compared to $953.5 million (22:11) last year. Our capital expenditures for the year totaled $239 million. Depreciation was $172.1 million, and amortization was $25.6 million. In 2017, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $231 million, depreciation of $175 million to $185 million, and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will continue to run higher than normal in 2017 as we continue to invest in capacity, systems and new stores. Our cash balance at the close of 2016 was $889.8 million compared to $205.7 million at year-end 2015. As we indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to continue to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the coming year to reduce total borrowings required to finance the deal. Therefore, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury during the quarter and year, and we'll suspend share repurchase activity again in 2017. On December 31, we had remaining authorization to acquire $11.65 million shares. We're also temporarily modifying our practice of paying 30% of prior year EPS in cash dividend. This year at our February meeting of the Board of Directors, we will recommend approval of an annual dividend of $3.40 per share, an increase of $0.04 over 2016. Before I close with our outlook for 2017, let me briefly comment on our Valspar acquisition progress. Based on our ongoing discussions with the FTC, we now expect a divestiture will be required to gain approval to complete the acquisition, and we are actively working toward that objective. The expected divestiture falls well below the $650 million revenue threshold and we expect to negotiate the divesture and complete the Valspar transaction within 90 days at a price of $113 per share. Looking ahead to 2017, the demands for paint and coatings in most domestic markets continues to look positive. Growth in residential starts and existing home turnover was sufficient to drive 2% to 3% growth in US architectural industry volume throughout 2016, and the outlook for 2017 is comparable. Although contracts for new, non-residential projects slowed somewhat in 2016. It was still a solid year in absolute square footage, which bodes well for the paint demand in the segment. Outside the US, we are increasingly optimistic on demand conditions across many regions, but we remain cautious in our outlook on many currencies. Our raw material basket has many moving parts, but, in total, we believe, we are likely to see higher year-over-year input costs in 2017. The recent uptick in the price of crude oil could result in upward pressure on the petrochemical side of the raw material basket, but these commodities will not necessarily move in a linear relationship with crude. Most of the raw material basket inflation will come from TiO2. Stronger, global demand for high-grade chloride TiO2, and relatively tight inventory level has prompted most producers to announce additional price increases effective in the first and second quarters of 2017. It remains to be seen how much, if any, of these increases will actually take effect. Based on all of these factors, we expect average year-over-year raw material cost for the paint and coatings industry to be up in the low-single digits range in 2017. Our outlook for the first quarter 2017 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit percentage range compared to last year's first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share compared to a restated $1.75 per share earned in the first quarter of 2016. First quarter 2017 earnings guidance includes approximately $0.69 per share in Valspar acquisition cost, and an $0.11 increase in EPS related to the decrease in the income tax provision. As a reminder, first quarter 2016 earnings per share included $0.24 expense related to the Valspar acquisition. For the full year 2017, we expect net sales will increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared to full year 2016. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2017 will be in the range of $13 to $13.20 per share compared to $11.99 in 2016. Full year 2017 earning guidance includes approximately $0.80 in Valspar acquisition cost and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.20 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Full year 2016 earnings per share included $0.86 per share in acquisition-related expense, partially offset by a $0.40 EPS increase from the reduction in income tax provision. Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And, now, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. Thank you. I guess I just wanted to understand some of the guidance commentary for 2017. Maybe you can help me understand the mid-single-digit sales commentary, how that breaks out between maybe your volume expectations and your price given that you do have a price initiative that you announced on the last call and potentially new stores and the revenue recognition as well. Thank you. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hi, Arun. This is Allen Mistysyn. When you look at our full year sales guidance, the price we have in there, as you know, Paint Stores Group announced the 3% to 5% price increase effective December 1. We expect that to be effective similar to previous price increases, maybe even a little bit better considering the last price increase we had was first quarter 2014. So, you can expect around a 75% effectiveness there. When you look at volume, Paint Stores Group continues to take share, we believe, and we expect \u2013 you can expect our sales to roll out similar to how our 2016 sales rolled out. And what I mean by that is when we say mid-single digit, typically our Paint Stores Group is in the high end of that or maybe even a little above that. New stores, as John mentioned in his comment, being 90 to 100. You can consider that similar impact as 2016, which is roughly 1% on Paint Stores. And then one other thing I would say, on revenue reclass, because we had a half year revenue reclass in 2016 and the impact was around 1%, full year 2017 we'd have a similar impact. And then the final thing I would mention on our sales guidance is we do still believe FX will be a headwind but just not to the effect it was in 2016. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, Al. And just as a follow up, you've also given a range for Q1. I think there's some concerns out there just given that you are facing a pretty large comp year-over-year, given that you did 9.4% in same-store sales in Q1 of 2016. Can you just describe kind of the market environment and what's embedded in your sales guidance? Do you expect a positive comp in Q1, and if so, what gives you the confidence that you could achieve that? Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. Arun, I'd say what gives us the confidence is the continued discussions that we have with our customers and we've talked about over the last couple of quarters the impact of the labor constraints on our contractors, and I've referenced a few times the comments that we have continuously heard about their ability to do more work if they had more labor. And I think it's clear now to see that that's most prevalent in the second and third quarter which are their busiest quarters. So, they were running at capacity. So, coming into the fourth quarter with less labor constraint and a heavy backlog of work, they clearly had a better performance and we expect that to continue as we go into the first quarter. And we're working very hard as always to continue to position ourselves to be the supplier of choice when they're making their decision on which supplier. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Also, as a reminder, the revenue reclassification hits stores the greatest and they will have that in the first and second quarter. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Right. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Arun. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing today? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hey, Matt. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Great. How are you? Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good. Good. Can you provide the same-store sales breakdown for 4Q 2016 in terms of volumes for architectural paint, volumes for non-paint end markets and then any contribution from the price increase? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. Yes, Matt. So, when you look at the sales increase in the fourth quarter, it's really minimally impacted by the price increase as December is our smallest month in that quarter. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. I would say that if you look at the effective day, the first of December roll in the smallest month, and as Al mentioned, we're rolling this in. So, we expect to have good effectiveness in the rollout of the price increase, but it would certainly have been negligible in the fourth quarter. Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. And then any breakdown between volumes for the non-paint end markets versus volumes for the architectural paint? Any turn in oil and gas related markets, things like that? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: John, I'll take the non-paint sales. We feel they performed fairly well throughout the year. We saw \u2013 we did see an uptick in the fourth quarter similar to what we saw in our volumes. But I think overall, we're pretty happy with the performance of the non-paint sales, which includes, by the way, spray equipment. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Right. And on the P&M, Protective & Marine side, it continues to be a drag. Obviously, much less of a drag as we go into more seasonal period. But that's largely driven by our strong position in our petrochem. We're continuing to focus on that business. There's still a lot of opportunity for us to grow, but we're also working, I think, quite well given the efforts on the team pivoting to other segments. So, we're not waiting for that segment, the petrochem, to recover as a means of driving our performance. We're working very hard in these adjacent markets, other segments, and we're really starting to see some good penetration there. It takes some time before we can over that petrochem number though. Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then switching over to the acquisition front. How should we think about the divested Valspar assets as it relates to impacting the synergy numbers that you previously outlined when the transaction was announced? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, we're obviously very limited in what we can comment on regarding this. We're very pleased with the progress we're making. The business that to be divested has been identified and we're working through the FTC with that, to that process. But we're really not going to expand to much greater than that right now. We mentioned that it's well below the $650 million. But right, now we're working closely and, I think, quite well with the FTC, and we want to make sure that we respect the boundaries there. Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. As we hit further into 2017 and in the context of recent housing and mortgage apps data, can you just give us a sense on the general composition and parse out the various buckets of R&R activity, and how you think this should flow into the architectural volumes of both PSG and consumer and, I guess, consequently guidance? And then also, do you have any kind of updated assumptions on labor availability as we head throughout the year? Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes, Chris, this is Bob. I'll take the first half of that, and that is our outlook for the repaint market, on both the residential and commercial side, is very positive for 2017. On the residential side, obviously, existing home turnover drives repaint activity but only about 15% to 20% of the market is driven by actual turnover, and a significant share of the market is driven by home values which, obviously, have been very positive. I just read this morning, 58 consecutive months of rising home prices. So, that is certainly driving the repaint and remodeling side of the market. We expect mid-single digit to high-single digit growth in the repaint/remodel side of the market in the coming year. And as a reminder, that's 80% of residential industry gallon volume. So, it's a significant piece of the market, and we expect very good momentum in that piece. On the non-residential side, we are seeing some pickup in property management, property maintenance activity. It's very likely, as we see more churn in office space and apartment, that we'll see that pickup but you've got to see more churn. Churn has been slow in 2015 and 2016. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Regarding labor, I would say that this has not been the second consecutive year where our contractors has faced a challenging, if you will, Q2 and Q3 as it relates to labor. And we've been talking to them, and I do actually believe their confidence in the market is pushing them to be more aggressive in hiring additional labor. And I think there have been some questions as the business has unfolded about the stability or the firmness of the market and I think there's obviously a very growing level of confidence. And I think we'll see our customers be far more active and trying to bring more labor on as we go into the painting season this year. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. And just a quick follow-up on PSG as it pertains to the price increases. I think most people's understanding that obviously we'll start off in the DIY crowd and some shorter term contractors. Can you just give a little more guidance on kind of the cadence of how you think they will flow through PSG results based on the breakdown of sales? Thank you. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Chris, if you think about past price increases, what you'll typically see and we'll see that again is a slight downtick in our gross margin. And then, as the effectiveness becomes \u2013 as we come more effective through our customers in 90 days, 180 days, you'll start seeing that turnaround and that's what I would expect in this price increase as well. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: But I'd also add that the effectiveness is going to be a little bit stronger. Given the rate of growth in our residential repaint business, there are some opportunities with mix to offset some of that as well. So, we actually have very good confidence in the fact and, again, over repeating it here, but we've not had a price increase since the first quarter of 2014. The phase-in will be mixed based on customer, type of customer, types of projects, but we're out there working hard. You don't do a price increase on December 1. It's actually we work with our customers around the year providing those solutions to them that help them be more productive in their business. And so, if we're more successful in helping them, then it's a better discussion, and that's what we've been working on for many years here. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great substance. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. John, you mentioned there's backlog of projects kind of came forward in the fourth quarter. Would you say that that drove a mix shift towards the pro market versus DIY and did you gain share from the other channels, would you say, in the PSG Group? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, I think it's early to comment on gaining shares from other channels. I'd say, given information that's out available in the market right now, we're feeling good about the momentum we have. It's certainly not complacent. I mean, we're driven to get better every day. But I would say that there's clearly been some shift from DIY to the contractor-based business, if that was your question. But I'd also say that, as I mentioned, there's clearly been more demand than there was labor to be able to satisfy that, and that clearly shifted into the fourth quarter. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just on that last point, are your pro-contractor customers telling you that they just needed to be more aggressive in hiring or is it actually difficulty in finding that labor pool? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think it's a little bit of both. I think it's a little bit of both. There was a level of confidence that, I think, the teams that we're getting \u2013 we've gotten over the hill on, but there clearly is a demand or desire to hire more than what they've been successful in hiring thus far. Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, everybody. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hi, Chris. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just, regarding the DIY consumer, just kind of curious if the weaker results are sort of across the industry and the third quarter continued in the fourth and whether that was reflected in Paint Stores Group and Consumer? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: We actually had a nice rebound in the fourth quarter DIY. So, our sales were up in the fourth quarter, not quite as high as our \u2013 some of our contractor segments. We had really, really strong double-digit gains in res repaint. The other segments in the wholesale were strong and DIY would have been amongst them. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. And then I guess in regards to your guidance for 2017, you talk about some of the pros, some of the positive that you're going to be impacted by the pricing and kind of the market share gains. What are the offsets that might be impacting you in 2017 that you guys will be concerned about? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I wouldn't say we're concerned. I think when you look at the last two years on how our comp store sales have trended, our biggest quarters are still on second and third quarter. Although we're working hard on programs and plans with our customers to get on top of that in the second and third quarters, it still remains to be seen how effective that is and if there's other changes that occur, whether it's immigration policy or whatever that might impact us. So, that would be the only thing that would give us any pause. Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, fellows. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hi, Duffy. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hi, Duffy. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: A question around with the deal feeling imminent, have you guys been able to narrow what you think the range will be between kind of a GAAP accretion and a cash accretion with the deal, so basically what's the step up going to be in that increased amortization? And then, along those same lines, are you planning to talk about a cash EPS or will you talk about a GAAP EPS once the deal closes and goes forward? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: We have not gotten to a narrowed-down range on the impact of the valuation. And I think, Duffy, we would make sure that it's clear. We'd give you enough information and the investors enough information to get to a cash EPS, so what the incremental impact on amortization/depreciation of the step-up accounting is, and we want to be as transparent as we can of that. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, one of the arguments for architectural being so good is the argument around the footprint and it's very hard to come in without an existing base. But we did see an Asian competitor, kind of a non-incumbent in North America, buy a North American competitor here recently. Wondering if you could just comment on why that might be that they were able to do that? And with deeper pockets, would that North American base now provide the ability for them to grow more into the architectural space? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, I'd say that Dunn-Edwards is a terrific company and one that we have long admired. And the reason we've admired them for such a long time is they've got quality products, quality people and a terrific, as you mentioned, footprint. They've been very good competitors. And I don't expect that any of our people on the ground there ever took Dunn-Edwards as a light competitor or someone that you didn't have to be very careful of and work hard to try to grow our business and maintain the business that we had. So, yeah, we respect that there's another competitor in the market. But we've got great confidence in our model. We've got great confidence in our strategy. And we have found that the greatest success we have is when we focus on our execution. And they've always been a good competitor out there. We expect they'll continue to be a good competitor. But while we'll watch what they do, we're going to be really focused on outstanding execution of our strategy. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And let me add to that, Duffy, that your point about the store base or the store concentration is well taken. But as you know from our business, it doesn't require a lot of capital to expand a store base. So, we don't view a competitor like Dunn-Edwards as ever having been capital constrained in their ability to grow their store count, so we don't necessarily see this new owner as being a tougher competitor from that regard. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Terrific. Thanks, fellas. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Duffy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes. Thank you. John, as you've had time to meet with your Valspar counterparts, to the extent you can and you've gone over synergy targets, how are you feeling about that $280 million in synergies because, again, it struck me that particularly on logistics and manufacturing, that you were somewhat conservative on your outlook for synergies. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, we feel great about them. We're not going to raise them here. I mean, we're still working through a number of blueprinting and kind of our approach to the combined business. We feel very good about them. We're excited about it, wonderful people, wonderful products, great customers. There's great complement to our business. We're very excited. But right now, that's our target. And as we get in it, to Al's point, transparency is important. We understand that. But right now, that's our goal, that's where we're focused on. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I had a follow-up on PSG. You've got one price increase on the table. If you do see some of the second round, if you had two price increases, if oil continues to go up, what are the conditions that would cause you to put through a second price increase later on in the year? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think you should take great confidence in our previous actions when \u2013 we don't think that we're in a similar environment, but in the not too distant past here when raws were really, I'll call it, out of control, they were growing very aggressively, and we demonstrated the discipline we have to go out and put price increases in the market, not by choice, but given the ability that we have to continue to bring value to our customers and help them, we were successful in doing that. And we don't think it's anywhere near that situation here in the current environment, but if we found ourselves in that environment, I think we've demonstrated the determination to do that and, at the same time, our ability to demonstrate the value to our customers to maintain those customers through that difficult time. Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Don. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. This is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. I'm just curious how you think about the quarterly cadence of the expected low-single-digit increase in 2017 raw material costs. And specifically, will the headwind be any more announced in the first quarter than the balance of the year given the comp against the trough TiO2 environment? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. Good question, Matt. Because \u2013 I think it depends on what happens to the price increases in TiO2 nominated for the first and second quarter. If you look back at 2016, first quarter was the trough. So, we started seeing TiO2 inflate beginning in the second quarter, which means that the history is going to start to rise as we go through 2017. It remains to be seen whether TiO2 inflation rises at the same pace as the comp or stronger or less. At this point, we think that most of the low-single-digit inflation for 2017 year-over-year is going to be driven by TiO2. We suspect given inventory levels right now and the fact that fourth quarter was actually a pretty busy quarter for them, that they're going to get likely a little traction on the price increases that they've nominated. But again, that remains to be seen. And I think you can model raw material costs at a low-single-digit rate pretty much across all four quarters. Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then on SG&A, what are your expectations there in terms of the promotional environment perhaps moderating on a year-over-year basis, 2017 versus 2016? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think if you look at our guidance and think about with the raw material price increases in that \u2013 let me frame it this way. Our improvement in operating margin is not going to come from as big a gross margin improvement as we've seen over the last few years. So when you look at SG&A, we're going to get SG&A leverage to hit that EPS guidance. And we set ourselves up, I think, fairly well. We did some things in the fourth quarter to get us in a position to do that. You saw that in our leverage we got in our SG&A on the fourth quarter. And I don't think the environment, promotional activity or that will be any different... John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No. That won't be affected. I mean, we're going to continue to do the right things to reach out to our customers. But to Al's point, we clearly try to remain disciplined in our approach to SG&A. So, we'll be managing the SG&A and continuing to reach out to our customers. Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks, guys. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Hello, everyone. It's Matt DeYoe on for Kevin. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hi, Matt. Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Just wanted to ask, Paint Store contribution margins look to have moved higher sequentially, but we're kind of still below that mid-30% range that I've kind of think is more normal. I know part of that's probably due to revenue reclassifications, but can you kind of discuss what's needed to turn that back around and when do you anticipate getting back to those prior mid-30% levels. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Matt, what I would point you to is we felt very good about Paint Stores Group year and they had a strong year. When you look at their incremental margin ex the rev reclass, it was 42% for the year, and that came through primarily gross margin expansion. In the quarter, it was a little bit over 24%. And as John commented in his opening remarks, that did include a LIFO benefit in our fourth quarter last year as a comparison. We didn't have that same benefit this year. So, I think the 42% is probably higher than we would expect going forward but certainly in line with where we would expect. Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Okay. And then you touched briefly on this, but just one more on the Protective & Marine business. When do you kind of expect that business should flatten out first, I guess, and then return to growth just given the rebound we're seeing in activity? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. We are starting to see some rebound, you're right, and that combined with the pivoting into other areas that I'd mentioned, we have high expectations of that team. And so when do we expect to see it, it can't come soon enough. We're pushing hard and we're counting on that team to deliver. So, we're working on that very hard right now. Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Okay. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Yes. Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. First of all is on TiO2 but little differently. Have you thought over the next two years about your sourcing requirements and how you might change those if there was a border tax adjustment and it raised the cost of imported TiO2? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, Nils. I think and I'm not sure how much high-grade chloride TiO2 that is sold in the United States is produced in the United States. I do believe the vast majority of our sources are domestic. I think that may not be the same in the case of sulfate TiO2. I think a lot of that is imported. But chloride, we see sufficient capacity in the U.S. market to supply U.S. demand at the current growth rate. And growth rates in 2016 in the domestic market were probably mid-single digits, and we think that supply can grow in line with that rate of demand growth. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Understood. And just on the Consumer Group, I think the commentary was that you saw a volume growth in all the different distribution channels, but that seems, particularly in the big box, seems to be a little bit dissident with what you've seen reported out of the big boxes. So, was the volume growth relatively the same across those distribution channels or how would you characterize the different channels in terms of that growth rate in consumer? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I'd say that they were very similar. We, as mentioned, had a good fourth quarter in paint. The pressure that we felt was outside of the U.S., mainly the UK stain and sealer business. So, across most of our channels here in the U.S., I'd say we had a pretty good performance on paint on the consumer side. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. I'll pass it along. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Nils. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Hi. Good morning. Question on the Global Finishes. I think 12% to 13% or maybe 11% to 12% was kind of the prior goal that, John, you guys have communicated at an Analyst Day fairly recently. You guys are there and it hasn't come with a lot of volume growth. So, how should we think about that business going forward now that it's not really that small piece of the portfolio anymore? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, you're right, and for the past two years, the group had benefited from the successful integration of those two acquisitions that we made in Europe, the Becker and Sayerlack, as well as the acquisition that we made in Asia, Inchem. And both of those acquisitions brought along scale, technology, and talent outside of the U.S. There's a team has really been working hard at driving the synergies in those acquisitions. And by the way, it will be the same teams that are actively involved in the Valspar integration. So, they've been doing a very good job from an integration standpoint. And to your point, the focus is on driving sales and growing market share. And I actually felt very good about the momentum that we have in some markets. In Europe, we're doing quite well and in some of the segments in Asia. The scale effect that we've experienced will continue. This will also benefit greatly from Valspar as those businesses come together. We'll have additional technology and a customer base to pursue. So, while we're pleased, obviously, with the improvement on the bottom line, we also know that it's absolutely critical that we drive the top line. So, the scale has helped. There's a lot of focus on growing market share going forward, and we've got confidence in that team and the ability to do that. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: And then maybe switching transitions to the domestic contractors business. Is there anything you guys can do to help alleviate shortage of contractors, whether that's from the trade school or \u2013 I know you guys are probably developing products that we don't hear about, but is there anything bigger picture, John, that you guys can help with and probably with all the other manufacturers itself what's viewed to be a broad base shortage? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes, there are and we're working on it, but we don't want to talk about that. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Okay. And then maybe just lastly, I'll defer. Al, can you just give us a sense of what the tax rate will look like in 2017, maybe in 1Q in 2017, I guess, with the income tax benefit? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. I think when you look at our fourth quarter, we had some things in it, just the timing of discrete items and our full-year at 33% is consistent with prior. I think, our first quarter, the stock comp adjustment is our largest quarter. So, our core tax rate will be around the 32%, and you got to think about how that flowed this year and there'll be a few percentage points on that. Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates: Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Good morning, Chuck. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Nice finish to the year. Looking at this acquisition, you mentioned with the cash you had at the end of the year that you're going to apply to funding it. What can you tell us at this point perhaps what the initial debt load-in might be and might that be offset by some short-term investments that aren't included in your cash balance at the end of the year? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: So, on the debt, certainly our cash ended a little bit better than we thought it would. We had a strong cash quarter. The debt that we'll issue similar to what we've been talking about, Chuck, we would \u2013 any proceeds we get from the divestiture would go towards the reduction of that debt. And, I think, as you know, we had the treasury lock rates in place. We'll issue the debt as we get closer to closing of the acquisition. And I think, like I said, I think we'll be around that same number we've been talking about. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then if we look at the -- how should we think about the tax rate going forward? You're backing out the benefit of the accounting change. What would you offer as the underlying run rate for Sherwin's taxes? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: On the core tax rate, it'll be around the 32% that we've been running the last few years with... Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : 32%? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes, sir. 32%. Looking forward, Valspar has a much bigger presence outside the U.S. and as you would expect, that should be lower on the weighted of the two. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Well, thank you. Good morning, guys. John, you all sound pretty skeptical on the TiO2 additional pricing going through. Just wondered what your thoughts were on why at least sound that way that it probably won't. And then, if we could talk on the consumer DIY, what's the promotional environment you're seeing there that the fourth quarter picked up? And would your pricing through the Paint Stores have any halo effect at all through the retail channel? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes, Stephen. This is Bob. On the TiO2 issue, they kind of had a perfect storm at the end of the year. They were running mid-single-digit growth kind of throughout the year. And then at yearend, you saw our volumes in the fourth quarter, they had kind of a spike in demand that did not allow them to build inventory at the rate they normally would coming into 2017. So, there are strained inventory levels and that will keep utilization rates high and inventory levels fairly low going through the first two quarters, because those are the strong-demand quarters. And those are actually favorable market conditions for them. However, we think there's ample capacity in the market. So, the offset to that and to that kind of good environment for them, is that they're going to raise their operating rates. And if demand coming out of the gates is not robust in 2017, it's very likely that the pricing that they've announced for the first two quarters is going to, at least, break to some degree, if not entirely. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And, Stephen, could you clarify for me, I want to make sure I understood your question on consumer fourth quarter and the halo effect. Can you help me understand your question? Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Sorry, John. Just combining those a little bit. You had a better consumer segment DIY channel in the fourth quarter. I was wanting to know, one, what was the promotional environment like. And then, as you all push through your price hikes in your Paint Stores, would you see any halo effect to allow any pricing on the retail side, on the DIY home centers, et cetera? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I don't see the halo effect on the store to the retail side. And on the consumer side \u2013 I'm sorry, on the promotional side, I don't think there was any significant shift at all on the consumer side. That team has been working very hard and we've been open about some of the traction that we've been gaining, kind of starting a little slower than what was expected and then over the last two years working to be able to more effective. And I think we're starting to see some of that traction pay off. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then, Latin America, just quickly, what was the trademark related to? And as you look at 2017, some of those of economies have started to recover. Are you all expecting volume gallonage growth in your forecast there? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: For the impairment, if you think about our Latin America Coatings Group, the high watermark in operating margin was about 10% in 2012. And over the past few years, they've been dealing with the economies that you talked about, the currency headwinds .An quite honestly, the sales and profit haven't been up to our expectations. With that, including 2016 and building off of that base, your sales and profit projections and the cash that it generates just didn't support the goodwill we had on the balance sheet. So, that's why we took the impairment. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. And to your question about going forward, I'd say we clearly see that the investments are starting to pay off that we've been making with improved volume, and even the pricing actions that we've been able to experience. While we expect economic conditions to improve there, we also expect that they'll be choppy from quarter to quarter. Our teams are really working hard down there to position themselves favorably in the market. And we've been really doing, I think, some heavy lifting down there. But all these comes back together to the point that I take away, not only just in Latin America, but across the entire company, where we're continuing to grow sales and market share across many of our businesses, Latin America included. I think we're demonstrating the ability to improve the mix by providing that superior solution to those customers and the discipline to offset the input cost inflation with pricing that's needed. And so when you are converting sales to profit like we are, we're improving our return on sales and focusing on cash, not only in Latin America but around the company. It gives us confidence, in Latin America, here in the U.S. and around the world. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Steve.. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just got a couple of quick ones. First, what's the change in gross profit for your consumer \u2013 for your Paint Stores Group and for Consumer Group? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: The change in gross profit for Paint Stores Group was $62 million and the gross profit change for Consumer was $2 million. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I was going to say, Ivan, the Latin America was $2.5 million and Global Finishes Group was $1.1 million. (01:07:39). Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And then \u2013 thanks for that. If you were to, I guess, gauge the percentage of your volume that goes in infrastructure, they'd be all in the Protective & Marine or would there be other channels to think about in terms of if we see an increase of infrastructure going forward, how that would impact you? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: It would largely be in our Protective & Marine. You'd see some in our Product Finishes as well. We would have maybe fabricators that might be tucked in onto that business. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And then Protective & Marine, that's roughly 15% of sales in terms of your Paint Stores Group? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Of Paint Stores Group, yes. But there's also a component in Latin America and a component in Global Finishes. But the domestic piece here, to your question, is Paint Stores Group. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then my last question. In terms of the tax, if this \u2013 if we start to see the, I guess, tax rate being reduced at least in the U.S., I know the vast majority of your earnings come out of the U.S., would you appreciate a 10% reduction in the tax rate? Would that be \u2013 would we see a similar type of reduction in your overall tax rate or how should we think about the moving parts? And are your book taxes similar to your cash taxes? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think with the stock comp change, our book and cash taxes are more similar. I would say on our current book of business that might be the case. To your point, about a 10% reduction in tax rates, does that correlate to a 10% reduction in ours, that may be the case today. But if you look forward with Valspar, we will get a bigger chunk of our profits from outside the U.S. and that's going to change things a little bit. So, we'll model that as we go forward but that's kind of where we're at. Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Ivan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. I wanted to come back to the foreign acquisition on the West Coast. I think it's true that there are no other foreign-owned significant architectural competitors in North America and maybe the only significant last two were Glidden and the Comex businesses that you ended up acquiring. So, I think, the history here is that we probably shouldn't worry about that all that much, but I wanted to just check if I had the facts right there. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I believe you're right on the past two owners. But I'd say we live a healthy life of concern, right? So, we don't want to take anything for granted. And so while there's a lot of competitors in the market right now, Dunn-Edwards has been a very good one in the past, we're not taking anything for granted. And they've done a terrific in the past. We expect that they'll continue to do a terrific job. And our job is to get better every day. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hello. This is Jacob on for Mike. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hey, Jacob. Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC : I was just wondering, can we get an update on the Paint Shield product, where are you guys on the launch process and maybe how it's been tracking relative to expectations? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. I'd say that we continue to see this product in more and more test applications which is exciting for us. We've had a number of hospitals that are using the product and others that are testing it. What we're finding is that they \u2013 they, meaning our customers \u2013 want to put these through a validation process which we expected and that's what we're working through right now. So, we always want to sell more. So, while there's clearly momentum in the gallons that are going out, we want to continue to drive that at a faster rate. And that's what our teams are working on. Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Perfect. Thank you for answering my question. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Benedict Shim - Wolfe Research LLC : Good morning. This is Ben Shim on for Scott. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hi, Ben. Benedict Shim - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Recently, you've been talking about, previously talked about what maybe a new seasonality in the third quarter, given the pent-up demand going to the fourth quarter and the strong volumes you guys had. Is there anything new that you've learned or seen from customers so far that could continue or alter that trend for 2017? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, there's a few things. As I mentioned, I believe that our customers have gotten a little more comfortable in growing what might be perceived initially as their fixed cost by adding incremental labor, number one. Number two, I believe the idea of product selection has become more important. And that actually benefits us. So, when we're introducing products of higher quality to our customers, they're able to be more productive on the job and we're benefiting from that. We're seeing a positive mix shift in the choice of gallons used by many of these customers because they recognize higher-quality product. Might cost them a bit more in a gallon of paint, but helps them tremendously, not only in their cost of labor, but speed of labor. And the last thing I would add is that we're working closely with many customer groups in continuing to innovate new products that will help them. In fact, this year, 2017, we're launching 17 new architectural products into our Stores Group on top of, I think, it was 23 last year, and I believe it was 25 the year before. And so it's been a tremendous driver in our pipeline of innovation as well to try to help our customers. Benedict Shim - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. Any thoughts on recent change in FTC leadership and how that might affect the timing of the Valspar acquisition? I'm assuming it doesn't change, but just wanted to see if you guys had any thoughts. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No, I think you're right. I don't think it changes. I think we're proceeding quite well, we believe. And we're very respectful of whoever we're speaking to on the FTC side. Benedict Shim - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks so much. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. Thanks. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Ben. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research): Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the call \u2013 questions. In Latin America, is there additional restructuring to be had? Have you right-sized that business in light of the impairment charges? And then overseas, in preparation for the Valspar acquisition, are there any steps you're taking before the deal closes to right-size locations? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: So, for Latin America, what I talked about with where we were at, at the high watermark and where we're at today, I think the team has taken all the steps as far as right-sizing the organization. We're continuously looking for opportunities to improve our SG&A and to extend our margins, whether that's through our factories, distribution or whatnot. But from just a reorganizational standpoint, I think we're where we want to be. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. We talk an awful lot about, Chris, the mindset of continuous improvement in our organization. There's not a finish line in that space. I mean, we're going to constantly be looking for those opportunities. And to your point about right-sizing in other parts of the world, as you heard when we were talking about our Global Finishes Group attacking the synergies between the two acquisitions that we've made, those have been many years in the progress, and we're still working very hard at that, and it's going to continue. So, I think you should expect us to continue to look for those but be very smart. At the same time, we're investing in other levers that can help us grow our business. Christopher Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research): All right. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then on the petrochem end of the raw material basket, is there any lift that you have built into your guidance, maybe in the back half of the year, cost pressure there or is it just evenly flat across the board? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No, we are expecting mild inflation in the petrochemical side of the basket. You may have noticed that polypropylene pricing for January settled up quite a bit. We anticipated some upward pressure in propylene \u2013 I said polypropylene \u2013 it's actually propylene settled up quite a bit. That move came a little earlier than expected, but we believe it was primarily a function of higher propane demand for heating and propylene restocking, primarily amongst polypropylene customers. In our view, both of these factors are short term, and we are not convinced that the move in January is going to result in more petrochemical inflation than we anticipated in our initial forecast, which is relatively mild. Christopher Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research): All right. And now, for housekeeping purpose, it takes about 90 days to work its way down the chain to you? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Give or take, yes, 90. Yes. Christopher Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research): All right, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Thank you for your patience and actually getting to my question, guys. Congratulations on a great finish of the year. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Dmitry. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Couple of questions leftover from all the ones that have been asked. First of all, just following up on the last question around Latin America, you put up about 15% growth, excluding FX. I understand it was mostly pricing. Is that correct? Your volume was still weaker year-over-year? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No. That's incorrect. We had a volume increase in a number of our countries down there, the strongest being Mexico, and we had some good performance. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. So, I guess my next question on the pricing, was that actual sort of price increases to offset foreign exchange translations or was it sort of a price increase above and beyond to handle either raw materials or just mispricing in the market? Can you talk about some of the high pricing component of those revenues? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. But it was primarily related to the continued devaluation. If you think about some of the devaluations that have taken place, it is the reais that really has turned around in this year, but it's still well devalued from where it was just a few years ago. So, the pricing actions we're taking are catching us up to that devaluation, as an example. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Got you. Okay. Thanks. And then final question on the Paint Stores Group, the bounce back that you saw in the same-store growth to about 5.5% from what I think was about 2% last quarter. How much of that was sort of oil and gas either being less onerous or just seasonally less impactful? How much of that was, if you could, parcel it in those two buckets? And how much of that was sort of the loosening up of labor restrictions on the contractor segment? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, I'd first point out that it really points to the strength of what we've seen in the market and our continued drive to get better position in the market. As we've talked about the residential repaint, this is the 11th of 13 quarters with a double-digit gain. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Right. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And so, the other segments, the contractor segments that we focus on were also very, very strong. You're right, to some degree, in that the Protective & Marine drag has been weighing on our results, and it was muted because of the seasonality of it. But it still speaks to the strength of those segments, our confidence in our position there and our determination to get even better. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : No, I understand that. But, I mean, 90 days doesn't change your orientation or your strategy that much. You talked about labor constraints as being one of the drivers along with the oil and gas issue the third quarter. (80:43) John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. Right. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : So, I'm just trying to see how those two played out in the fourth, that's all. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, I think it's a smaller quarter, so the absolute numbers improve. And our focus on the Protective & Marine during this fourth quarter is much less because of the seasonality. So, I'm not quite sure if I'm answering your question. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And Protective & Marine was still a drag in the quarter, just less than it has been over the last couple quarters. The majority of the rebound in the comp was from the fact that contractors do not face the same labor constraints in the fourth quarter that they do in the third. We saw a significant pickup in activity amongst new residential, residential repaint, and most of the architectural segments picked up pretty solidly. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Perfect, Bob. That's what I was looking for. Thank you very much. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Dmitry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Two questions. First of all, the revenue guidance for the fourth quarter I think was low-single-digit and the reported revenues were up 7%. Just curious, the difference between those two numbers, what grew notably faster in 4Q relative to what you guided? That's the first question. The second question relates to what you would tell us to expect for gross margin growth in 2017? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I would say that in the quarter, our Paint Stores Group had a much stronger finish to the year than we had in the guidance. And also, Latin America Coatings Group in the investments that John talked about that the team has been making started paying off and that also was a benefit relative to our guidance. As far as the gross margin, I think we don't give out the specific of each of them. But as I mentioned before, the margin improvement, we do expect to have a margin expansion in 2017. It will not be, as you can imagine, similar to previous few years. But with continuous improvement mindset in that, we expect to have some. And the volume gains that Paint Stores Group is getting and putting through our North American supply chain, we do expect to get some margin expansion. The key will be on the SG&A leverage that we get. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: And then just a follow-up on the Paint Stores better than expected. What component of Paint Stores grew better than expected? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Again, just the residential portion of our business was very, very strong. Well, I say that but many of the commercial segments were stronger than we expected as well. We have a very good momentum there. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. In the prepared remarks, Eric, we mentioned that contractor business grew high-single digit. So, that's across all end market, the sales \u2013 architectural paint sales to contractors grew high-single digits. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: And that's an acceleration from third quarter then? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of David Wang with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I have one on your growth versus industry. So, it looks like existing home sales grew a little bit slower than what your Paint Stores Group posted, and I wonder if you could talk about what should be the difference, is it partly the shifts from DIY to pro or is it something else? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. First, Dave, I mentioned early on in the call that only about 15%, 20% of residential repaint activity is driven by existing home turnover and what's driving the other part, the 80% to 85%, we believe is rapid appreciation in home values. People are just more comfortable investing in remodeling and repainting activity when they're investing in an appreciating asset. So we think we've gotten a tailwind from appreciating home values that would make actual residential repaint activity in the market outpace what existing home turnover would imply the pace should be. We also think that we're gaining share in residential repaint. And that is in part due to your point that the shift from DIY to do it for me, we think that also tends to pick up pace when home values are appreciating. So, the market conditions we're seeing here and particularly driven by rapidly appreciating home values is a net benefit for repaint and remodeling activity. David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Great. And then, just a follow-up question. I know we didn't have a particularly good year for housing starts and existing home sales, but I think we grew mid-single digits. If we continue to see rebounding in the housing market, how much operating leverage would you guys be able to see especially flowing through to the Paint Stores Group profit margins? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: We would expect to absolutely leverage the incremental volume through our stores' organization and you're starting to see some of that in the fourth quarter. It's an area of focus for us. This is an important part of our business and one where from an expense standpoint, would not require incremental expense for us to be able to pursue the incremental volume. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And you mentioned that housing starts are only up mid single-digits. Mid single-digits volume growth to our North America supply chain would generate a pretty substantial amount of leverage. David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): All right. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, David. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates. Please proceed with your question. Richard O'Reilly, CFA - Revere Associates : Okay. Thank you. And good morning, gentlemen. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hi, Richard. Richard O'Reilly, CFA - Revere Associates : Hi. I have a short-term question. Weather-wise, I'm in New Jersey, and we've had a mild winter, and yet when I listen to the national news there's tornadoes and blizzards somewhere else in the country. Is weather so far in January, \"normal\" or is it worse than usual, less than usual, is it affecting your store days to any extent than \"normal\"? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: So, Richard, we've sworn oath not to ever talk about weather again. There's always good weathering areas and bad weathering areas, and we don't like to point to that. We know that our shareholders are counting on us to make things better every day, and so, yeah, there's areas that have had some tough weather and if it's the ice or tornadoes, whatever, and there are other areas that are nice. And so we quite frankly insist that our people focus on how they improve their results, not report the weather, so. It's not anything I want to really comment on. Richard O'Reilly, CFA - Revere Associates : Okay. Fine. Thank you for your attempt. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you, Richard. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So, I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks again, Jessie. And first, thanks to all of you for hanging with us this long. I'll wrap up quickly by asking you all to save the date of Thursday, May 25, on your calendars. That's the day we'll host our annual Financial Community Presentation this year in New York at the Marriott Marquis.

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells. Bob Wells : Thanks, Jessie. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations, April 20 Press Release. You will also notice as we go through our results for comparison purposes, our first quarter 2016 results have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2016-09. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for first quarter 2017 compared to first quarter 2016. Then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased $187.4 million or 7.3% to a record $2.76 billion driven primarily by higher paint sales volume in our paint stores group. The change in revenue reclassification adopted last year increased consolidated sales 2.2% in the quarter. Currency translation rate changes did not have a significant impact on sales in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $81.4 million or 6.5% to $1.34 billion. Our consolidated gross margin decreased 40 basis points in the quarter to 48.6% of sales from 49% last year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $13.8 million or 1.4% to $1.02 billion in the first quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 36.8% from 38.9% in the same period last year. Interest expense in the quarter was roughly flat to last year at $25.7 million. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $90.2 million or 41.7% to $306.6 million due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group and Global Finishes Group. Our effective tax rate decreased to 22% from 23.8% in the first quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017 we expect our effective tax rate will be in the mid to high 20s. Consolidated net income increased $74.3 million or 45% to $239.2 million. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 8.7% compared to 6.4% in the first quarter last year. Currency translation rate changes did not have a significant impact on net income in the quarter. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 44.6% to $2.53 per share from $1.75 per share in 2016. The $2.53 includes $0.08 dilution from the acquisition-related expenses and $0.34 accretion from the reduction in income tax provision. Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2017 increased 12.1% to $1.81 billion from $1.62 billion last year. Paint Stores Group sales increase was due primarily to higher organic paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets and the impact of the change in revenue classification. Comparable store sales that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months increased 7.5%. The change in revenue classification is not reflected in comparable store sales. Implementation of the December price increase has also been successful thus far. Regionally, in the first quarter our Southeastern division led all division followed by the Canadian division, Southwestern division, Midwest, and Eastern Division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. Segment profit for the Group increased $50.5 million or 20% to $304 million. Segment operating margin increased to16.8% of sales from 15.7% in the first quarter last year. Turning to our Consumer Group first quarter sales decreased $40.6 million or 10.7% to $337.5 million due primarily to lower volume sales to most of the Group's retail and commercial customers. Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $3.4 million or 5.3% to $60.6 million in the quarter from $64 million in the first quarter last year. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 18% from16.9% in the same period last year. Most of the improvement in the first quarter segment profit margin was from improved operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control. For our Global Finishes Group sales in U.S. dollars increased $16.2 million or 3.6% to $470.3 million in the quarter. Currency translation rate changes did not have a significant impact on sales in the quarter. First quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars increased $3.9 million or 8% to $52.4 million due primarily to higher paint sales volume and selling price increases that were partially offset by higher raw material costs. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to11.1% from 10.7% in the same period last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars increased $16.2 million or 12.9% to $141.4 million primarily due to selling price increases and favorable currency translation. Currency translation increased sales in U.S. dollars by 5.7% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased to $1.2 million in the quarter from a loss of $900,000 last year. Segment profit was aided by selling price increases which were partially offset by higher raw material costs. Currency translation had a minimal effect on our Latin America Coatings Group segment profit in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit increased to 80 basis points in the quarter compared to a loss of 70 basis points in the first quarter 2016. That concludes our review of our operating results for the quarter. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. First quarter 2017 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams from both a revenue and profit perspective. But there was one obvious exception and as our nature, I'm going to address it first. Our Consumer segment had a bad quarter. There are two reasons I feel it's important to address this upfront. One because I don't want you to think that our strong consolidated results diminishes the urgency we feel to address the challenges this group faced in the quarter. And two, because you need to know that nobody is more disappointed in how this quarter unfolded than the women and men responsible for driving this business. Consumer sales in the quarter were weak in most product categories across most market segments in most geographic regions all three months of the quarter. This was not the result of soft sales to one customer or one product line. We were comping against the first quarter 2016 load-in of the INFINITY product line at Lowe's and I wish the explanation for the weakness this year was that simple. I believe Consumer Group saw the flip side of the obvious strength in the professional paint market reflected in soft DIY demand in the first quarter, but they will remain focused on expanding our retail presence and driving sell through. You also need to know that I have the utmost confidence in this group. I know they will rise to the challenge. You should expect better results from our consumer segment over the balance of the year. The positive momentum we saw in our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter last year accelerated in the first quarter. Sales to residential repaint contractors continued its double-digit growth trajectory followed closely by sales to new residential painters, property management contractors, and commercial contractors. Equally encouraging our pro customers continue to report large project backlogs. Protective and marine coating sales and volume turned positive in the quarter, but lagged the pace of growth in architectural paint. During the quarter, paint stores group added 10 net new stores while this pace is slower than first quarter 2016, the difference is entirely attributable to timing issues. Our plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations compared to 94 opened in 2016. Today our total store count in the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean stands at 4,190 compared to 4,099 a year ago. Latin America Coatings Group delivered high-single-digit revenue growth in local currencies in the quarter, although down volumes were still recovering in most countries in the region. As market demand fully recovers, our management teams will continue to make progress on managing operating expenses and mitigating raw material cost inflation. Global Finishes Group delivered solid top-line growth in the first quarter with revenues up across all businesses and volumes up in most. Once again, the group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A resulting in a cycle high 11.1% first quarter operating margin, 30 basis points better than first quarter last year. We continue to see positive demand momentum in many of our industrial coatings businesses in North America, Latin America, and Europe and this team is well-positioned to flow through revenue growth to profit improvement. To get a more accurate picture of our profit performance in the quarter, you need to back up the effect of the two accounting changes we adopted last year plus the acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, consolidated gross margins increased 50 basis points to 49.6% of sales. SG&A improved to 37.2% of sales compared to 37.7% last year and PPG margin was 11.8% this year compared to 9.8% last year. Our reported tax rate in the first quarter of this year was 22%. If you back out the tax benefit from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 our effective tax rate would have been approximately 33%. Net income would have been $214.1 million, an increase of approximately 25% and earnings per share would have been $2.27 per share, up 25.4%. Net working capital increased slightly year-over-year as a percent of sales to 11.5% compared to 11.2% first quarter last year as accounts receivable and inventory both increased to support the strong sales momentum early in the year. In dollar terms, the increase in working capital was $97 million in the quarter compared to an increase of about $80 million in the first quarter last year. Despite the higher March 31 year-over-year working capital, we generated $231.8 million in net operating cash, an improvement of more than $290 million compared to the first quarter 2016 due primarily to the increase in net income and reduction of cash used during the quarter to service accounts payable compared to first quarter 2016. Our capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $41.5 million. Depreciation was $44.6 million and amortization was $6.2 million and in 2017, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $230 million, depreciation of $175 million to $185 million, and the amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will continue to run higher than normal in 2017 as we complete investments and IT infrastructure, capacity, and new stores. Our cash balance on March 31 was just over $1 billion compared to $890 million at the end of 2016. We will continue to build cash on our balance sheet over the coming months to reduce total borrowings required to finance the completion of the Valspar acquisition. Therefore we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury during the quarter and we'll suspend share repurchase activity throughout 2017. On March 31, we have remaining authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share compared to $0.84 per share last year. North American architectural paint demand should remain strong throughout the year, driven by steady increasing level of residential remodeling activity and to a lesser degree new residential construction. As we move into the prime painting season, we are also encouraged by growing signs of more robust non-residential activity and improving demand for many of our industrial products. While growth in the U.S. Do-It-Yourself market will likely continue to lag the professional painter market, we expect positive sales growth in our consumer segment in the quarters ahead. On our year-end 2016 earnings call, I said our expectations for average year-over-year raw material inflation was in the low-single-digits. Given the recent uptick in crude oil, relatively high propylene pricing in the first quarter, tight market conditions in certain key monomers used in the production of latex, and low TiO2 inventories, we now expect raw materials inflation to be in the mid-single-digit range. The price increases we have announced to the market thus far in the year appear to be gaining traction and we have not made any additional announcements. We will however continue to monitor changes in the raw material environment and will respond appropriately to changes as we go through the year. Our outlook for second quarter 2017 is for consolidated net sales to increase mid-to-high-single-digits percent compared to last year's second quarter driven in part by the revenue reclassification. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share compared to last year's record $3.99 per share. Our guidance range for second quarter includes acquisition-related expense totaling $0.25 per share. As a reminder, second quarter 2016 earnings included $0.16 per share in acquisition-related expenses. For the full-year 2017, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2016 by mid-single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our full-year guidance to be in range of $13.65 to $13.85 per share compared to $11.99 per share in 2016. Our updated full-year 2017 earnings guidance includes $0.40 per share charge for acquisition-related expenses which is $0.40 less than the charge included in our initial full-year guidance. And an increase in the income tax provision benefit of $0.25 per share more than forecasted in our original 2017 EPS guidance. These two items account for all of the change in our full-year 2017 EPS guidance. As a reminder, full-year 2016 earnings per share included $0.86 per share related to the Valspar acquisition and $0.40 accretion from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Chris Parkinson : Thank you. Can you just talk a little bit more about the implementation of your PSG price increases and just a rough breakdown of how you think it's going between both short and long-term contractors, I'm assuming most short-term contractors have immediately accepted it. And then also is your expectation for the resin solvents and latex baskets sort of moderate in the second half and if not, it sounds like another price increase would be under consideration? Are we thinking about that correctly? Al Mistysyn : Hi, Chris this is Al Mistysyn and I'm going to take the first part of your question related to the price increase in our Paint Stores Group. As a reminder you know the last price increase we went out was the first quarter of 2014. We announced the price increase in December 1, 2016 about 3% to 5% and while none of our customers like seeing their prices go up, they understood the cost environment, we are operating in and they're accepting that price increase and I would say that the rate of realization or effectiveness of that increase is slightly ahead of where we expected it to be. Bob Wells : And Chris, this is Bob. Let me handle the question on raw materials, we often talk about the many moving parts of the raw material basket and as John indicated, we've seen a fair amount of movement in a number of areas since our year-end call. While our outlook for TiO2 in fact hasn't changed much. We still expect mid-to-upper-single-digit inflation for the year in TiO2. We are seeing more pressure in some of the petrochemical based materials. This is a result of a number of factors, most importantly; higher propylene cost in the first quarter higher than we expected in fact and tight market conditions, which we think are transitory tight market conditions in certain monomers in particular MMA and VAM. And while the effect of these petrochemical factors may be somewhat transitory and aren't likely to result in a runaway raw material basket, they have pushed our expectations up from low-single-digit to mid-single-digit. In the first quarter, we think we were probably at the top end of that low-single-digit range may be in the 3% to 3.5% range. We do expect to see some incremental inflation in the second quarter. And we think that the year-over-year inflation is likely to peak in the second quarter. Then we start rolling through the price increases taken in TiO2 last year which the year-over-year inflation should ease somewhat in the second half. Chris Parkinson : That's great color. And just a quick follow-up, can you give a little more color on your expectations for the Consumer Group on a go-forward basis, including any incremental growth spend you see key trends you're seeing in the big boxes and/or any benefits potentially from a full year INFINITY we should be considering. Thank you. John Morikis : Yes, so we don't talk about any specific customers so I'm not address the INFINITY directly. I will say that, as I mentioned earlier that the overall performance for the quarter fell short of our expectations and while we found ourselves in a situation where we felt there was weakness across the board. And it was a very challenging market. We just, we don't accept that. And so the answer your question, our expectations moving forward to be the best partner possible to our customers. And that means helping them get product off the shelf it's not our desire to fill their shelves is to help them get product off the shelves. I don't -- I don't want to get into a lot of specifics on our strategy to be able to do that. I will say that our teams. We have great confidence in our teams. We've got and I think the terrific strategy. We are looking forward to the combined business once we close on Valspar we think added to assets together or the people, the brands everything will make us better and we're focused on every one of our customers and helping them to be more successful. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning. First, I guess I just wanted to ask if you could elaborate on some of the comments you made on volume. You said that you are starting the see some improvements and in some of your markets. So maybe you can break that out on resi repayment and new construction and non-res and so on. Thanks. John Morikis : Yes, I would say that we're very pleased in the stores segment's performance while we don't give specific numbers. I will tell you that the residential repaying once again had a double-digit gain. This will be the 12th of 14 quarters that we've had double-digit gains and we feel as though there is a terrific momentum. I've got that's great respect for that team and what they're executing on right now is just been terrific. I would like to take you back to the second and third quarter of last year when we started talking about the challenges that some of our customers were talking about at that time which was their view of the world included a great confidence in the projects that they were working on and the bidding that they were doing, and if there was any concern in their comments, it was typically that they had more work than labor. And so while our residential repaying business has been growing for 12 to 14 quarters I have more confidence right now probably than ever because our team is really responded. We're not exactly sure what the second and third quarter has in store for us as it relates to labor and any constraints that they, our customers might experience but we're not waiting and our teams have been working very aggressively and filling the pipeline with new accounts to try to offset any slowdown that our customers might have in growing their business. It's a matter of are they at capacity or not. The residential repaying we're very excited about and momentum. The others commercial, new residential, I mean it is, is really a very strong quarter of stores organization, in fact even protective and marine we had a couple years of softness in protective and marine through our stores. We had a positive quarter in sales of protective and marine and that some of the bottoming out of the oil and gas, but we've been talking about pivoting into different segments and trying to accelerate in those segments. We'd like it to be faster without exception but we're starting to see some momentum there. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks. And just as a quick follow-up given the strong volume I would have expected a slightly higher margin but I understand that the odds were definitely a pressure. So maybe you can just discuss how you're thinking about gross margin relative to your typical ranges and how that should progress through the year. Thanks. John Morikis : The gross margin, I think in our first quarter, we were pretty happy with that result on the core we saw a 60 basis point improvement. As the year unfolds as Bob mentioned, the second quarter, we expect year-over-year, raw material inflation to be -- to peak we're confident that we can recoup the inflation in the market. It just doesn't happen in real time and as we see that the rest of the year unfolds on the effectiveness of our price increase, where raw materials trend out at the end of the second quarter, we'll have a better line of sight to our gross margins and update accordingly. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi thanks very much. In the Paint Stores business, did your price increases offset your raw material inflation? John Morikis : Yes I believe in the first quarter our effectiveness was better than we thought and more than offset the raw material increase. Jeff Zekauskas : And are your raw material increases in the United States greater on a percentage basis than your raw material increases in the offshore markets? John Morikis : Latin America will be higher, higher but across the rest of the globe, I'd say the U.S. the impact of titanium dioxide that has on our U.S. business is probably a little higher in the U.S. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And could you provide the gross profit changes in your division? John Morikis : Yes. So Paint Stores Group increased $82.5 million, Latin America Coatings Group increased $4.9 million, Global Finishes Group increased $6.6 million, and Consumer decreased $10.2 million. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : John, just going back to -- good morning Bob. Just going back to the protective and marine sales turning positive is that just a function of easier comparisons after several tough quarters or do you actually sense some more activity and optimism at the end market level? How should we think about that? John Morikis : No, it's certainly some easier numbers, but I would definitely say that it has an equal if not more result of the efforts that our teams are putting forward. I think that we are seeing some benefit in the market, we're seeing some easier comparison and we're certainly witnessing some benefit of the pivoting into some of the other segments I spoke of. Ghansham Panjabi : So that being said and going back to the first quarter an upside on earnings relative to your initial guidance what actually drove the bulk of that upside was it just P&M sort of a little bit better than you thought, pricing realization being a little bit better, or was it just the volumes in Paint Stores Group? John Morikis : Volumes in Paint Stores Group were very strong and as I mentioned I could go on every segment just as much passion as I started with resi paint but each one of our segments have really shown terrific growth and we're feeling really good about it and protective marine wasn't the headwind that it had been in the past. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. How would you rank these potential drivers of the strength that you saw in volume in your Paint Stores Group potentially better than expected whether the backlog that your contract customers have a shift towards more of the pro contractor versus DIY versus just kind of backlog in resi repaint demand. Bob Wells : Yes Steve this is Bob. I think if I would rank those items, the number one would be, as we've discussed on a number of quarters our customers, our professional customers are labor constrained in the high season quarters second and third much less so in the first and fourth. So we saw a rebound of comps in the fourth quarter that rebound actually accelerated in the first quarter, it tends to be their smallest volume quarter. So I think the fact that we're seeing a flattening out of volume in the industry from the traditional bell shaped curve to more volume in the out quarters that that would be number one. I think number two is the shift from DIY to contractor. I think we are with rising home values, rising equity markets, increasing consumer confidence, a stronger employment backdrop all those things, the homeowners are really getting confident in hiring contractors as opposed to doing project themselves. One of the things that is driving incremental volume for us is by our own doing. It's not a market force, it's more our focus on new account activation on growing share of wallet amongst our small share customers is certainly driving volume growth in that segment and leading to what we believe to be a probably 2X plus rate of growth -- volume growth in paint stores of the 2X plus the market rate of growth. We don't think weather had an impact on the first quarter. Steve Byrne : And then on the retail and commercial customer side of the business, would you say your volumes lagged overall volume growth in those channels and if so why? John Morikis : Are you talking about in our stores organization, Steve? Steve Byrne : No, through the retail and independents. John Morikis : Through the consumers, yes consumer did lag and that's the comments that I made earlier, as far as we found some challenging markets and customers there is not one that I would point you to say that there was one customer, one geography, as I mentioned earlier, there was -- there were some challenges that we faced throughout nearly every market with many customers facing some tougher sales and our focus remains on helping them to be more successful. Steve Byrne : I guess my point on that one John is, were you in line with the overall market or not? John Morikis : It's hard to say, I don't. I will say that we didn't experience any shelf loss, we've not found ourselves in situations where we feel as though we've lost shelf to our competitors we're just really trying to focus on helping our customers sell more product off the shelf. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Matt Gingrich : Thanks, this is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. I was just wondering if you -- how the Do-It-Yourself sales in the Paint Stores Group trended in the quarter? Bob Wells : A little softer than our pro business positive. Matt Gingrich : Okay. And then in terms of the monthly cadence of the Paint Stores Group performance? Bob Wells : In Do-It-Yourself as well or? Matt Gingrich : No, just broadly. John Morikis : I don't think there was a significant difference throughout the quarter. Bob Wells : If you adjust for days. John Morikis : If you adjust for days. Bob Wells : Right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Koort : John can you help us scale the non-architectural book of business through PSG and maybe the big components of that, so we can sort of think about those markets bottoming and what they might contribute as you come out of that down cycle if you will? John Morikis : I would say the non-paint categories remain strong. And I'd say the growth rates are in line with paint demand; we're seeing good momentum in those -- in those categories. Robert Koort : I guess in the industrial coatings that you sell through your Paint Stores? John Morikis : P&M you talk Protective & Marine? Robert Koort : Yes whatever else you would consider non-architectural paint? John Morikis : I'm sorry; I thought you meant non-paint sorry. No, I think that as I mentioned Protective & Marine sales were up but not in the same range as our architectural category, so it's certainly in our expectation that they wouldn't go from a direct headwind to a strong tailwind. And so we feel as though, as I mentioned, it's bottoming out in the industrial businesses inside our stores and through a lot of effort and some of the markets improving, we feel as though it's going to help us. It won't turn into a terrific tailwind for us immediately though. Bob Wells : And Bob that the Protective & Marine is really the only material non-architectural business in Paint Stores Group, the rest of that would fall in the Global Finishes. Robert Koort : And then you mentioned just timing on the store count, but obviously if you're going to get up to 90 or 100, you got to start adding quickly in the prime paint season in front of you. So should we expect 30 or 40 units added in the second quarter? John Morikis : Yes it's funny we had this discussion every quarter and we like to see those numbers little smoother. But as you would expect with just different construction regulations and ordinances it's just a little bit of challenge to smooth those up. Bob, yes, we're going to load up, we're confident in the year. And no one should read anything into the number little softer in the quarter than what we would have liked but it was truly just a matter of in some cases getting permits, occupancy permits we're on, we're on the same point, we should be Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson : Thank you. John, I want to go back to the Consumer Group with are you seeing any destocking or inventory reduction at the big boxes, given that they're seeing lower overall levels of demand. And have you been able to get any price increases this year in from, from your Consumer Group customers. John Morikis : On the inventory piece that's always something that we're trying to work with, with our customers. We want to as part of being their best supplier; we want to be the ones that can offer them the best service, so that they don't have working capital tied up in that. And so there is always in those discussions and I wouldn't say that to any greater extent, then we would expect or quite frankly that we would want. We want to help our customers in those terms. In regards to pricing, we don't comment on the pricing on that side of the business. We've spoken to our stores and we've spoken to the raw material basket but we, because of the competitive nature of those customers, we don't speak to any specific customers outside of our stores. Don Carson : Okay. And a follow-up on the overall market, you talked about how not only is architectural demand strong but you're seeing strong non-residential and industrial demand. I think last year you said the market grew 2.5% would you, it sounds like you're expecting higher growth in the overall market this year is that an accurate reflection. Bob Wells : Hey Don are you talking about the U.S architectural market of the overall paid incumbent? Don Carson : U.S. architectural market because it sounds like you're seeing some positive things on the commercial side of that as well. Bob Wells : Yes and we've learned over the last couple years that the tale of the tape for market growth is going to be -- is going to be determined in the second and third quarter. It really depends on the labor supply in the professional painter market. We know that labor supply is growing, is it growing at the rate of demand growth doubtful. So to what extent market wise, labor is a constraint to volume growth this year time will tell. We think that the demand in the market is sufficient to drive industry growth well ahead of low-single-digits, well into the mid-single-digits. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Mike Leithead : Hey guys it's actually Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning. Bob Wells : Hey Mike. Mike Leithead : Hey Bob. Just want to come back to the commentary you made on strong paint stores volumes in the quarter. Is it fair to say you're seeing somewhat of a shift? I guess in your customer behavior to kind of compensate for the tight labor market in 2Q, 3Q. So may be the seasonal fall off in paint stores during 1Q and 4Q should maybe a little bit less so as contract just try to get projects on that are either pushed out or pulled earlier. Bob Wells : I think you're right, Mike, I think you'll see some flattening of the bell curve certainly not an all exterior projects but where possible there is certainly going to be some products or projects that can get pushed out into the fourth quarter they may have been completed in the third. Mike Leithead : Got it. And then a bit of a technical one here for my follow-up, so I apologize that, on the income tax provision accounting change you realized $0.34 benefit this quarter and now the new full-year guide assumes $0.45 benefit for the full-year. Where should we think about that remaining $0.11 being I'm assuming there is none in 2Q because you guys have been called out of your guide is that correct? John Morikis : Well, Mike, what we've done in it typical practice in the past as we've annualized, these types of changes we start including them in our core and that's why we didn't call it out on our second quarter. I think what you see is if you look at how the adjustments rolled out in the quarters last year they maybe a little bit muted from a timing standpoint, but they're smaller and probably typical of what you'll see going forward. I would say our first quarter was, was higher than what we are certainly expecting higher than last year and it was just a pure function of the amount of options that were exercised and the run-up in our stock price after the first -- our year-end call. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes good morning Thank you. You indicated that your SG&A ratio to sales was down about 210 basis points year-over-year. I was wondering if you could address what you're doing broadly to control costs and achieve that and specifically the extent to which you can address costs in anticipation of the Valspar deal and whether or not that is -- that is part of the tailwind there so to speak. Al Mistysyn : Sure, Kevin if you go back and look at the sales out of our coming out of our third quarter last year, rightfully so the teams took action on SG&A with a reduced sales with an eye towards the risk of that and the de-levering we saw and we're seeing the benefit of -- benefits of those actions in our first quarter. And the expectation is that we'll manage our SG&A type until we get through the second quarter, we see the initiatives that John had talked about, about the new account activation, and how those are progressing and with an eye towards making sure that if labor constraints occur again in our third quarter like they had in the past two years we will be positioned well to overcome those. As far as an eye to Valspar that is absolutely a consideration. But I think we have a responsibility to manage our core and the operating margins related to our core and we'll manage the Valspar integration as soon as it closes and we're well prepared for that. Bob Wells : And Kevin, a quick point of clarification the SG&A as a percent of sales improvement was -- was magnified by the change in revenue classification the revenue reclassification apples-to-apples comparison it was actually down 50 basis points. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you for the clarification, Bob. And then second question I had was on pricing. You mentioned that your pace of realization exceeded your prior expectation. I guess two facets number one was all of the December 1 increase implemented by March 31 or is there a residual to come. And then second, given your expectation of higher raw's, again relative to last quarter. Are there increases recently announced or on the table outside of architectural in the balance of your portfolio. Thank you. John Morikis : So, on the first piece, no, I wouldn't say that it's been fully executed. We're working with customers across all businesses on stepping those price increases in. On the second question -- Bob Wells : On the second question that we, we have gone out in with price in our other businesses. We don't typically talk about those on magnitude in that, but we have where we're certainly seeing pressure from a raw material standpoint. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Mushkin : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I had two. Want to dig into a little bit more on the consumer groups issues where you sort of backorder, obviously you're going to fix it. I guess I'm trying to understand. I think also says across geographies, across retailers that it was kind of across the board. I think you referenced some softness in DIY but looking at it a little bit deeper I was wondering you can give us a little bit more color on what you think you exactly led to such broad based conditions in that segment and how you fix it. John Morikis : Yes, I mean little hesitant to do that, and only because from a strategic standpoint, I want to play my cards a little close to our best. I do feel though that it's fair to say that the teams that we have around the world, but particularly here in the U.S. because of the size of this business. Our focus on those areas as I mentioned earlier, I'm trying to help our customers to be more successful by selling more products rather than getting products in the shelf lane out the specifics on how we plan on doing that's something I'd rather show you the results and explain to you as we're working on these what we're doing. Scott Mushkin : But how about what went wrong I mean do you think with specific to you guys or do you think it's just the weakness in the market. I mean where maybe some light there on what went wrong? John Morikis : I mentioned that we have not experienced any shelf loss. I wouldn't say that we're -- we're feeling as though we're on the backend of any deals that went the other way but at the same time we're far from complacent, assuming everything is okay. We have -- we have very high expectations of our team and I do think that they found themselves as I mentioned in a challenging market. That said, we have higher expectations for ourselves and our investors should have higher expectations of us. Scott Mushkin : Right. And just switching gears and goes to my next question is in the Paint Stores Group as we've seen -- saw last summer things slow down, some of that was labor but also there was this idea I think it came up in the third quarter that Do-It-Yourself is really just not all that robust and of course we're just having other discussion whether it's DIY market mostly. I mean how confident are you as we get to the second and third quarters you are particularly at third quarter which even the Paint Stores Group has more of a DIY component to it that we won't see the same slowdown, we have seen we saw last year? John Morikis : Well as I mentioned and as Bob mentioned as well and we're now waiting to see last year's second quarter when we started to hear from our customers that they were concerned with their ability to grow their business. We started right then mobilizing our sales organization to effectively increase the number of accounts that we have an account activation program. So the good news that we see is that the fundamentals of the market are very, very strong, it's a matter of how much our customers can apply product and so many of them as we've said found themselves at capacity. Well when you find your customers at capacity and you want to grow your business, you got to find new customers and so we've been working very, very hard at both the share of wallet customers that are currently in our store that offer more opportunity as well as customers that are in other locations buying product and we've had some success there. So we're not waiting for the second and third quarter to play out. We're taking steps right now to control our future and we'll see how effectively we're compared to what the constraints in the markets are. But we're not just waiting for things, good things to happen to us. Scott Mushkin : That's great news. And then just one technical how big is DIY and Paint Stores Group in the third quarter is it proportionately a lot bigger and then on yield? Bob Wells : Scott we've described DIY has been between 10% and 15% of the segment. It would be less than that; it would be smaller in the first and fourth quarters. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Scott Rednor : John and Bob whoever wants take it. Just a question on that, given that you posted growth at DIY at the stores and that's a pretty big gap relative to what you're calling from mark in the consumer, how would you explain that differential? John Morikis : Well few things, Scott first the DIY number that Bob just quoted as far as our percent of sales was a total year it's a first quarter is a relatively small quarter for us in DIY. There is a shift clearly there is a shift from do-it-for-me to do-it-yourself to do-it-for-me. But there is still an awful lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow our business. Inside our stores we talked to DIY consumer because it's an important component not only in trying to grow our business but the DIY is a relatively small piece, we want that homeowner accepting our product coming in the door with the painting contractor. So in the first quarter, while it was up slightly, I'd say it's a relatively small percentage of our business it is the first quarter. Scott Rednor : And then I just wanted to ask about the approach to guidance, I mean even with that headwind on consumer and you think it's getting better stores came in better than you saw in the first quarter and you guys beat by $0.20 on a kind of a core basis. So recognizing you have ROTH coming up, can you may be just explain the approach so holding the full year stable even though you're coming out of 1Q better than you thought? John Morikis : Yes, you're right, we are pleased with our results in Q1 and again pointing to stores and even our Global Finishes Group momentum, we feel good about that. We've got great confidence in our strategy and great confidence in our team, so that as I feel like I have repeated a few times here, it's important part of our culture here and Sherwin, there is no complacency despite the fact that we had a good first quarter. But that said, and if you'll pardon a sports analogy I know you're a Yankees fan, but I'll use our beloved Cleveland Indians which we're very proud of. First inning of the game they may put a lot of runs on, on the scoreboard, but they don't start packing our bats after the first inning and so Scott, I'd say we're not packing our bat after the first quarter, we typically earn about I'd say between 15% and 20% of our full-year EPS in the first quarter and I'd say probably what else 65% to 70% in the middle two quarters. Bob Wells : Yes. John Morikis : And so in other words we make our year in those middle quarters so not to overuse it but after the first quarter we're not ready to pack up our bags and go home. We've often said here at Sherwin that here is a strong weak in July can make up for a weak month in the first quarter. So while we're confident in our outlook and we have plans in place to sustain our momentum throughout the year we prefer to wait until we get this second quarter under our belt before making any adjustments in either direction to our full-year guidance, lot of confidence but we just think it's prudent to, to see this through. Scott Rednor : I appreciate that John. I hope the hot start for the Yankees continued to but and then just lastly, maybe just on the cash flow obviously is very strong and 1Q atypical that you generate any cash is there anything we should be aware of as we think about the full-year timing or some normalization. Bob Wells : Yes, if you look at our cash benefit in the first quarter net income obviously grew very nicely. We did get the benefit of the cash flow hedge settlement in our first quarter that was about $88 million. And then if you remember, coming out of our year-end 2015 our working capital as a percent of sales was really low was 8.6% and then when you look at the impact of working capital on cash flow the change first quarter versus year-end so we saw a much bigger change in our first quarter 2016 than we saw in our first quarter 2017 due to the timing of payments. And so you won't have, you'll have that rollout, but it will be much more muted as the year goes on. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hey guys, nice quarter. In terms of your outlook for industrial demand, it sounds like it's incrementally gotten better as the quarter unfolded. What are your thoughts there as you head into 2Q and Valspar closed here any general thoughts you feel even more excited on what Valspar could given they've got more industrial exposure. John Morikis : Yes but we better, right we've sort of lot of money to get those yes, we're very excited about what they bring very complementary in nature. We have gotten those, some of the people inside Valspar deeper into the organization and we're just absolutely thrilled with the team their approach, their attitude. We're anxious to be able to exchange more information and, but we know that's right around the corner. You're right, our feeling about how our team in the industrial side of our business has been doing has us feeling more bullish than we have in the past and that comes from a number of different areas. One is they have there was a question earlier, I think Greg asked about SG&A and our management of SG&A on the Global Finishes Group side, they've been managing that business very well. So, they're positioned quite frankly to be able to flow a lot of -- a lot of profit through our incremental sales. And the pipeline of customers that they've been working on line trials and the confidence that they have going forward has definitely improved. So we're feeling pretty good about that team and what they're trying to accomplish and likelihood that they'll get there. Mike Sison : Great and then one quick follow-up for the Consumer Group if your team and plans are successful for -- would you expect sales to turn positive this year at some point in the given quarter -- earlier than expectation? Bob Wells : No, Mike, I think if you look at our sales guidance again in our second quarter, mid-to-high-single-digits in that guidance, you have to expect that our Consumer Group will perform better than it did, certainly in our first quarter. John Morikis : Yes, we've not lowered our expectations of that team. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Good morning. I guess I got one last minute to say that. Bob Wells : Good morning, John. John Roberts : On the Valspar purchase price premium I assume that you'd like to assign as much as possible to writing up finished inventory to market. Should we expect that you and Valspar are producing and holding as much inventory, inventories you can prior to closing so you can expense more of the premium in the first year. Bob Wells : No, John, I would that is not the case. I think what you probably saw in our results we carry more inventory in our first quarter and the reason we did that as with the strong sales of our Paint Storage Group coming out of the fourth quarter and the momentum they carried into our first quarter. We wanted to make sure we continue to service our customers that a high level. So we ended up carrying more inventory on the Sherwin side and that\u2019s why you saw the working capital up a little bit year-over-year, but I would not say that's a driver of the inventory. John Morikis : And John I know from our past discussions that you know this, but we couldn\u2019t coordinate anything like that with Valspar anyway. I mean that's on the other side of the wall. So we're not allowed to have those types of discussions. John Roberts : Do you have any update to the amortization expense for 2018 or first 12 months? Bob Wells : I do not we're still, we're still working through that valuation and again on that side it's really Valspar's working on that. And we'll see that as soon as the detail related to the valuation as soon as we close. But we're not in able to see all the detail related to step up and assets and the like as soon as we know, John, we will be out and giving you that information. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn : Well, I guess mine is the first good afternoon question. Bob Wells : Good afternoon, Dmitry. Dmitry Silversteyn : Couple of questions, first of all just, trying to understand your margin performance by divisions, you've had very strong growth obviously in volumes in the store group and that seems to -- with the offset price increase in the raw materials, it drove the margin up year-over-year, which I guess. What I'm struggling to understand a little bit is your Consumer Group where your revenues were down, your volumes were down. I don't think you've got price increases in there. Your raw materials were up and your margin were still up better than the point year-over-year. So can you talk about sort of what you're doing on the cost side or the mix side to allow you to get that margin lift. Bob Wells : Sure. Dmitry first off, I think the team has done a nice job at reducing their SG&A in this environment. But the other thing you have to remember is our global supply chain runs through that segment and we're seeing nice operating efficiency improvements with the gallon that Paint Stores Group is producing in flowing through that group. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay so that so volume impacts from the paint stores. Okay. Bob Wells : Right. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. And then my second question is that you really have spent a lot of time talking about your Global division, which is more industrial and more global as name implies. So can you provide a little bit more of sort of a granular color on perhaps some of the regions or some of the business lines or industries that have done well for you. I mean the mid-single-digit growth you delivered is a little bit higher than your averaged the last two, three years in that division. John Morikis : Yes, you're exactly right now Dmitry and across the board, and all three of those areas. We saw an improved run rate. And I'd say we're feeling good as I mentioned just a moment ago about the pipeline of tests and trial runs that we've had continues to move in the right direction. We've been aggressive in the SG&A side on that business. And at the same time, we've been investing in new products and people that we feel can help drive our business forward. And so I'd say that across the Group through the three different businesses we saw sales gains across all three. We're feeling good about the momentum that they're gaining as they as they go forward. And as I mentioned the number of qualified trial runs that we've been on, has improved. So we're feeling better going forward. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay, thanks. And then one last question, you mentioned the foreign exchange didn't have much of an impact on revenue growth in the first quarter. But I'm imagining it wasn't zero impact. So what was the foreign exchange contribution or the headwind in the first quarter on the revenues? Bob Wells : I mean it was less than 0.1% Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Wondering if you can address your marketing spend in the first quarter. Obviously, we've already talked a little bit about the SG&A declining as a percent of sales, and I'm wondering if there were any changes related to timing or spending on the marketing front? Bob Wells : No, there were really no significant changes in the spending or timing, Mike. I'd say there were; as we look at SG&A, I think we've we have looked at those types of efficiencies where we might have had two different business units buying different products from -- from different suppliers or partners. I mean just the basics that you would have expected. But given some of the size of some of our spend it can be fair savings so and then we're looking at trying to be as smart as we can with our spend without impacting the face to the customer. Mike Harrison : I was also hoping you could talk a little bit about the as you're moving towards closing on the Valspar acquisition, how do you plan to handle the Valspar brand at Lowe's obviously that's one that Lowe's and Valspar spent a lot of money on and that was a big marketing push but probably less efficient for both you and Lowe's to support both of those brands going forward Any thoughts on that? Bob Wells : Well, sure we have a lot of thoughts about the value of that brand I mean that's tremendous asset and one we want to get behind. We help -- we think it helps us with all our customers certainly not just Lowe's but it helps us with current Valspar customers as well as customers that are currently buying Sherwin-Williams branded products as the technology that we have -- we purchased can be moved into other different brands or other different customers. But all of those -- all of those decisions always come back to what I mentioned earlier, which is working with our customers on helping them to develop the best plan to help them grow more -- grow more product going out of their stores. So you asked specifically about Lowe's that but it could be with every customer that we're going to have combined we'll sit down with each one of them and develop a plan and how to best utilize all the assets that we have. Mike Harrison : All right. And then last one I have is on the Latin America business you opened 23 new stores in Q4 then you only opened three in Q1 can you provide any sense on where you expect the store count to be at year-end 2017 relative to the 342 that you had at the end of Q1? John Morikis : I think what you'll see is we opened 47 new stores last year. I think -- I think you'll see a slightly lower number than that and it's based on timing in the markets and similar type of issues we run into in the U.S. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk about the potential impact from big infrastructure bill coming up potentially. John Morikis : We love big infrastructure bills. Our Protective & Marine team has a good position in many aspects of the structural steel, the bridge and highway, water-wastewater, pretty much across the board. So we have -- we believe a terrific product line an outstanding distribution model, which we can utilize various stores that are properly equipped to take care of our customers that terrific technical people and a wonderful sales organization. So we've got a good position there and we'd love nothing better to see spending in this area. Rosemarie Morbelli : Have you included any potential gains in your current expectations for the year or it will be a bonus on top of whatever you're expecting now. John Morikis : We have not included any specifics to any kind of an infrastructure bill. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay, thanks. And then if I may, you have given the June 21 as the date to close the Valspar transaction could the timing of that closer trends can it be sooner than the June 21? John Morikis : It certainly can. Our expectation would be that it is most likely to close before the June 21 date, it doesn't, we have not given that as the date of close. So the agreement that we that that we had signed originally with Valspar provided for to a provision a three-month extension, it happened to land on June 21 that was the three-month extension. So our hope and expectation as we move through that process is that we'll be able to close before then. Rosemarie Morbelli : And do you have the total CapEx number for the combined companies? Bob Wells : Not quite at this point, Rosemarie. I think I mean we are both running around to a little bit over 2% in short-term. I would say that's probably going to hold but mid-to-long-term, we see that come down as a percent of sales. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. John Morikis : Chuck? Operator : Chuck your line is live; you may proceed with your question. We will move onto our next question which is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Could you -- I think you said price, volume, mix were all positive. But could you give us a little more insight as to how much of that the Paint Stores Group comp was volume versus price mix? Bob Wells : Yes, Chuck, we talked about getting good traction on pricing. I'm sorry Greg, we have talked about getting good traction on pricing so far in Paint Stores Group but the vast majority of Paint Stores Comp was volume. Greg Melich : Okay. So I could assume that's like better than 5%. Bob Wells : Yes. Greg Melich : Will be the vast majority, great. And then a follow-up and maybe it's certainly around you touched on a little bit in Latin America and we were finally I think I heard in the prepared comments that we got top-line growth but the volume is now improving but less negative, did I get that right? And if that's so are there any markets where actually is up or maybe okay. Bob Wells : I'm sorry, go ahead please. Greg Melich : So just if you could talk a little bit about that, like volume in Latin America was still down but down less and just sort of highlight some of the markets that were outliers will be great? John Morikis : Yes, so we have had a couple of markets there that have moved in the right direction from what both a sales and volume standpoint. We've had mix that we've had couple that have not broken to that line yet. I would say that even in those areas that we're a little under pressure, we still saw improvement in specific segments. And so we're -- we're feeling better about Latin America as a whole. We're now to the point after release screwing down the expenses there, we have invested a little bit of money in some of the things that we think will continue to drive business clearly will keep that on a short leash. But we don't break out by country or business unit down there Greg, but I would say that it's safe to say that we've had positive momentum in all of them, some of them are in fact, positive volumes. Greg Melich : Great. But the volumes overall are still down, but just down less than they have been in a while. John Morikis : They're just slightly negative, just slightly. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Stephen East : Thank you. John, I'll apologize to you before I ask another consumer question. But as you looked at the monthly progression through the quarter, what it looked like and following on that, how much as you look in the forward quarters, how much of this is market recovery versus what you all are doing with specific actions? John Morikis : I would say from a quarter-to-quarter, I'm sorry month-to-month within the quarter is there was choppiness; there was no trend that I could speak to that. And quite frankly that's a little why we were able to manage the SG&A as we did because we didn't see any traction earlier on in the quarter and so since the November, October time last year we've been really trying to manage the expenses on this business. Going forward, I'd say that the expectations that we have would have to include catching up on some of the business that we had expected to see already and it's going to be hard to say how much of that is market improvement and how much of that is some of the product that we had hoped would have been shipped prior to this moment actually getting shipped. So it's going to be a little difficult for us to have that clean line of sight. Again I'd reiterate that and we're feeling good about the relationships that we have with our customers and not having experienced a specific loss of any space. We truly believe that working with our customers and this is what we have been working on to make them better is going to be the answer. Stephen East : Okay, thanks. And then in the spirit of the first 100 days of the administration, your first 100 days with Valspar where do you all sort of rank order your focus areas very early on in the combination of the two companies? John Morikis : Customer is number one always number one. We want to get in front of as many customers as we can. We've got a very detailed plan on how we approach this and we're anxious to get in front of those customers as quickly as possible. Number two employees. We've got because of the line of sight of our customers is somewhat muted, we don't have specific customers to see we can't exchange that information. We have plans to be in certain business units to visit with those key customers but we do know where the employees are and so getting in front of those customers, employees, and working with them to really put them at ease on the exciting future that they're going to have with Sherwin-Williams would be second. From there, there is a great deal of effort that has gone into the blueprinting of the businesses, how we're going to move forward in areas such as removing complexity, value capture, exchange of information, exchange of technology, and each business unit has mapped those out in great detail. Again there are limits in what we can exchange but there's a lot of things that we can and so we've had the right people engaged in the room in talking about what those priorities are and we've got that down business to business, line by line and we're very excited, if there's been any positive at all to this business taking a little longer to be combined than what we would have liked, it's been our ability to work in greater detail on some of the things that we may not have gotten to until month two or three. But with the additional time, we've been able to get deeper, where legally allowed. Stephen East : All right. I appreciate the in depth on that. Thanks. Bob Wells : Thank you, Stephen. Operator : Thank you. It appears there are no additional questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Bob Wells : Thanks, Jessie. Back on April 3rd, we announced that we are rescheduling our financial community presentation from our original May 25 to October 3. Our intent all along this year was to focus the meeting on the details of the Valspar transaction and integration progress and needless to say with the delay in closing the acquisition, these details aren't going to be available on May 25. We think postponing the event to fulfill our original intent will be more valuable to you and the presentation will still be held at the Marriott Marquis in New York, we hope you can join us. Registration details will be emailed late summer and we look forward to hosting a great meeting and we thank you for your flexibility. As always, I will be available over the next few days to handle any follow-up questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. I'd like to thank you again for joining us today and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information, including a slide deck describing our new reportable segment on our website sherwin.com, under Investor Relations July 20 press release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2017 compared to second quarter 2016 then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 16% or $516.3 million to $3.74 billion due primarily to the Valspar sales in June and higher paint sales volume in the Americas Group and Performance Coatings Group. The change in revenue classification increased consolidated sales 2.2% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $101.2 million or 6.2% to $1.74 billion in the quarter. Our consolidated gross margin decreased 430 basis points in the quarter to 46.5% of sales from 50.8% in the second quarter last year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 9.3% or $97 million over the second quarter last year to $1.15 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased 190 basis points to 30.7% in the second quarter this year from 32.6% last year. Amortization increased to $28.9 million from $5.6 million last year due entirely to the increase in intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition. Interest expense increased $15.8 million compared to second quarter last year to $56.7 million. The vast majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $30.2 million or 5.6% to $509 million. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter on income from continuing operations was 29.1%. For the full year 2017, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the high 20% range. Consolidated net income decreased $59 million or 15.6% to $319.1 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 8.5% compared to 11.7% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased 15.8% to $3.36 per share from $3.99 per share in 2016. The $3.36 includes a $0.44 charge related to the Valspar industrial wood finishes divestiture and a $0.92 dilution from acquisition-related expenses, including a step-up in inventory and depreciation and amortization. We have summarized the year-over-year earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our second quarter 2017 press release. Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for the Americas Group in the second quarter 2017 increased $196 million or 8.7% to $2.43 billion from $2.24 billion last year. The sales increase was primarily due to higher organic paint sales volumes across most end markets, the impact of the revenue reclassification and selling price increases. Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 4.9%. The change in the revenue classification is not reflected in comparable store sales. Regionally, in the second quarter, our Southwest division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division, Eastern division and Canada division. Sales and volumes were positive in every operating division. Segment profit for the group increased $33.3 million or 6.7% to $532.7 million in the quarter as higher architectural paint sales volumes and selling price increases were partially offset by higher raw material costs and continued challenges in the Latin America region. Segment operating margin decreased to 21.8% of sales from 22.2% in the second quarter last year. If you exclude the change in the revenue classification, segment profit margin in the second quarter increased to 22.6%. Turning to the Consumer Brands Group. Second quarter sales increased $74 million or 16% to $536.5 million due primarily to Valspar sales in June, partially offset by lower volume sales to most of the group's retail and commercial customers. Segment profit per consumer brand decreased $27.1 million or 26.3% to $76.1 million in the quarter due primarily to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization cost totaling $20.5 million and lower sales volumes, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies, good expense control, and selling price increases. Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 14.2% from 22.3% in the same period last year. Most of the impact in segment profit margin was from acquisition-related expenses and higher raw material costs. For our Performance Coatings Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased $246.9 million or 48% to $761.1 million in the quarter due to Valspar sales for the month of June, higher coatings sales volume and selling price increases. Stated in U.S. dollars, second quarter segment profit decreased $8 million or 11.4% to $62.3 million due primarily to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization cost totaling $38.3 million. As a percent of sales, segment profit decreased to 8.2% from 13.7% in the same period last year. I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. In the Santa Clara County case involving public nuisance claims brought by 10 California cities and counties, we filed a Notice of Appeal in March of 2014, which was fully briefed by February 2015. Last week, the Sixth District Court of Appeals for California scheduled the date for oral argument on the appeal for August 24th of this year. We believe a decision could be rendered by the Appellate Court within 90 days following oral argument. That concludes our review of second quarter results for 2017. So, I will turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full year. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. I know the purpose of this call is to review the past three months. However, I think it's only fitting to open my comments this morning with some perspective on our future. Sherwin-Williams and Valspar are now one company. As we said before, the combination of these two businesses will clearly differentiate us in the global paints and coatings market. It significantly expands our brand portfolio and customer relationships in North America; creates a stronger, more global industrial coatings platform than either companies stand-alone; and extends our capabilities into new applications and geographies, including a scale platform to grow in Asia-Pacific. Customers will benefit from our increased product range, enhanced technology and innovation capabilities, streamlined cost structure, and improved productivity. We have tremendous respect for the skill and dedication of the Valspar team and we're excited about the opportunities that this combination will provide to all employees of the new company. The integration work is off to a very good start and although there are some obvious challenges to work through, we're genuinely excited about our future. Some of the challenges I'm referring to are apparent in our results for the second quarter and they affected both sales and profitability. If you look at our results without Valspar, consolidated sales increased 4.2% over second quarter 2016, with a significant portion of the increase coming from the change in revenue classification. Core gross margin declined 140 basis points year-over-year and SG&A as a percent of sales declined 110 basis points. If you adjust for the revenue classification, gross margin declined about 50 basis points and SG&A was down about 60. Adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points and adjusted profit before tax as a percent of sales improved to a record 17.8% from a comparable 17.5% last year. Revenue and volume momentum in our North American paint stores slowed somewhat from the pace said in the first quarter. We often say that a strong week in June can make up for a weak first quarter. The opposite also tends to hold true. While sales across all segments showed positive growth in the quarter, the sequential slowdown was almost entirely due to softer DIY sales both in the quarter and flat year-over-year exterior paint volumes in the month of June, primarily due to the volume declines in the last two weeks of the month. As a result, exterior paint volumes in the quarter grew at roughly half the rate of interior paint, which is highly abnormal. The combination of weak DIY sales and weak exterior paint volumes negatively affected both revenue growth and mix. DIY is the highest gross margin segment in our stores business and the average selling price of exterior paint is significantly higher than interior. On a positive note, sales to residential repaint contractors once again grew at a double-digit pace in the second quarter. Despite the softness in exterior paint, sales to all residential contractors combined, both new and repaint, grew nearly double-digits. Exterior paint sales momentum appears to be rebounding in July, and we anticipate normal exterior painting activity over the balance of the season, which should support stronger comp stores volume growth in the months ahead. The outlook for continued growth in both residential and commercial markets over the balance of the year remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor customers and healthy spray equipment sales in the quarter. Protective & Marine coatings sales also improved compared to second quarter last year, but grew less than our overall comp store growth rate. Our business in Latin America was a significant drag on the results of the Americas Group segment. While sales and profitability in the Indian region and Southern Cone countries are showing steady improvement, our largest market in the region, Brazil, continues to struggle. Sales through our company-operated stores in Brazil increased mid-single digits in the quarter, while sales through external retailers and distributors averaged double-digit declines. Our efforts to mitigate rapidly rising raw material costs, particularly TiO2, with price increases has gained some traction, which should stem some of the erosion in operating margin. During the first six months, we opened 27 net new stores and added 50 new sales territories in the U.S. and Canada and added six net new stores in Latin America. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,207 compared to 4,117 a year ago. In Latin America, we currently operate 345 stores compared to 302 a year ago. Our plan for the full year still calls for the store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean compared to the 94 last year. Consumer Brands Group, ex-Valspar, also posted another very disappointing quarter with declining sales across most product categories and market segments in most geographic regions. This weakness was particularly acute in Europe and in smaller retailer comps in the U.S. and Canada, but sales to all customer segments declined compared to second quarter last year. In the U.S. and Canada, many retail customers report slow sales of architectural paint so far this season and many have scaled back inventories as a result. From a margin perspective, most of the operating margin decline was from lower gross margin, which was partly the result of raw material inflation and partly due to absorption loss from lower volumes. Performance Coatings Group, excluding the Valspar results, was relatively flat year-over-year on both sales and margins. If you break down sales by geography, the strongest region by a wide margin was Latin America with strong volume growth in automotive finishes, wood coatings, general industrial and Protective & Marine. Sales in the U.S. and Canada were relatively flat, and Europe and Asia were down year-over-year. This group has done a commendable job of managing SG&A spending and implementing price increases where necessary to offset raw material inflation. As a result, the group is geared to earn high incremental margins when we get volume growth on a stronger track. So, the common theme running through all of our core businesses in the second quarter : not enough volume. Each of these businesses is well managed. Our expenses are in line. We have great pricing discipline and the most productive supply chain operation in the industry. Most of our shortfall in the quarter was related to weak volumes. Valspar sales in the month of June were approximately $380 million, an increase of about 12% over June last year. A large portion of the increase resulted from a favorable calendar comparison, which added two shipping days to the month. Operating margins for the Valspar paints business, which consists of architectural paint and related products sold in the U.S., Canada, Australia, China and the U.K., held up pretty well early in the year, but faltered in June. The coatings business, which includes packaging coatings, coil coatings, industrial wood coatings, general industrial, automotive and protective and marine, saw significant operating margin compression year-over-year. Margin declines in both of these businesses were due primarily to the lag in implementing price increases to offset raw material inflation. Given the spike in petrochemical raw materials early in the year, the large customer concentration of this business and the uniqueness of the situation over the past year, this lag is not entirely surprising. This issue is receiving a lot of attention and will take some time to address. But historically, these businesses have been successful at recovering raw material inflation due to the strong customer value propositions. In the first six months of 2017, we generated $539 million in net operating cash, an increase of $29 million compared to the first half of 2016, driven by higher six-month net income and lower working capital requirements. Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $84 million and we anticipate approximately $240 million in capital expenditures for the full year. Depreciation was $95 million and amortization was $35.1 million. Total company borrowings on June 30 were $11.5 billion and our 12-month interest expense is projected to be approximately $400 million. Incremental depreciation and amortization step-up related to the Valspar acquisition is projected to be $275 million on an annual basis. Purchase accounting inventory adjustments of approximately $110 million are being amortized over three months of June through August 2017. During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. At the close of the second quarter, our cash balance was $210 million compared to $403 million on June 30th, 2016. This cash will be used to reduce debt. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share, up from $0.84 last year. On the first quarter 2017 earnings call, I said our expectations for average year-over-year raw material inflation was in the mid-single-digit and that outlook hasn't changed. As expected, the price volatility in resins, latex, solvents and packaging, caused by an uptick in propylene and tight supply of key monomers early in the year has moderated. Low TiO2 inventories will continue to drive modest inflation in pigments, but not likely to be on the range anticipated in our overall raw material outlook. The price increases announced in our core Sherwin-Williams businesses continued to gain traction and we have not made any additional announcements. We will, however, continue to monitor changes in the raw material environment and will respond appropriately to changes as we go through the year. There's also little change in our outlook for paint and coatings demand. Domestic architectural paint demand should remain strong throughout the year and worldwide demand for many of our industrial products, including protective and marine coatings, should continue to strengthen. These market factors create a positive backdrop, but our success will rely on accelerating volume growth through market share growth. For the third quarter, we anticipate Sherwin-Williams' core net sales to increase in the low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to last year's third quarter. In addition, we expect incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition to be approximately $1 billion in the quarter. At that anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the third quarter to be in the range of $3.70 to $4.10 per share. This includes a charge of $1.10 per share for costs associated with the Valspar acquisition. It also includes $0.40 to $0.60 per share accretion from Valspar operations, net of acquisition financing expense of $0.40 per share in the third quarter. As a reminder, third quarter 2016 earnings were $4.08 per share and included $0.24 per share charge for acquisition related costs. For the full year 2017, we expect Sherwin-Williams' core net sales to increase by mid-single-digit percentage compared to full year 2016. In addition, we expect incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2017. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2017 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $12.30 to $12.70 per share. Full year 2017 diluted net income per common share guidance includes a $2.50 per share charge from costs associated with the acquisition of Valspar and an increase of $0.75 to $0.95 per share from Valspar operations. The increase from Valspar operations is net of acquisition finance expense of $0.95 per share for the full year. Full year 2016 earnings per share was $11.99 and included $0.86 per share related to the Valspar acquisition. Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi good morning. John Morikis : Good morning. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi. In your Consumer Brands business, did the Valspar piece perform differently than the Sherwin piece? And is it reasonable to look at that segment as being down about 12% organically in sales in the quarter? John Morikis : Well, let me take a stab at this Jeff and say that the weakness that we saw first in the quarter -- first quarter to second quarter was pretty broad based. And when you ask about how the performance is performing, there's obviously two components to it; our sales out our door and then to the retail customer themselves. So I would say that -- to your question about how they're performing, I'd say out the door, our expectations are they're running in a similar pace from the PoS data that we can see from our customers, although, admittedly, that's limited. But in the door, I would say that our gallons are running shorter or smaller than Valspar's. Allen Mistysyn : And Jeff this is Al. I would add. And part of the reason that is, just the tight inventory control that we're seeing across the channel due to what we believe to be general softness in the DIY market. John Morikis : Yes, I'd say many of our customers in this segment are struggling to grow, and some are going backwards. And as a result they're managing their inventory. Jeff Zekauskas : Are average prices in the Consumer Brands Group going up or down or staying flat? John Morikis : Are you talking about our prices, Jeff? Jeff Zekauskas : Well, both your prices and then how you look at it with Valspar when you look at it pro forma year-over-year. Allen Mistysyn : Jeff, I -- we -- I don't think we've historically talked about pricing specific to the Consumer segment. We generally stick to our Paint Stores Group when we talk about, as an example, price increases. So, I just -- with the mix of products in that, I don't think it's appropriate to talk about specific pricing in consumers -- in our consumer segment. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Bob Wells : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Chris Parkinson : Thank you. While you've been working on Valspar over a year, can you just comment on any initial surprises, either positive or negative, now that you've had almost two months full of the books and just in terms of product marketing, raw material procurement, culture and anything else you may find as an opportunity on a go-forward basis? Thank you. John Morikis : Yes. I would say that we're very pleased. In fact, I'm probably more bullish about Valspar right now than I ever have been. I'll start with the quality of people. We've had the opportunity to spend more time from leadership all the way down to those customers that are closest to our customers. And I have to say that I have a lot of respect going into it. I'm really impressed and very pleased with the quality of people that we see. We've not seen anything -- and you mentioned about synergies. We've not seen any in the first 45 days here that had me anything but excited and confident in our ability to deliver on the synergies that we've talked about. And I would say that as we've dialed in more and more into product quality and technology, it just feels like we're finding more upside as we go through that. Now the one side I -- one point I will say that, to be completely transparent on the downside, is that I wish they would have been a bit more proactive in their pricing. If you look at the historical performance of Valspar and their ability to demonstrate the value to their customers and move with inflation, they had been very successful. And this is the same team that will be executing these price increases now. I wish they would have been a bit more proactive. I can also understand after a year and a half of going through an FTC process that a lot of things get maybe pushed aside. But I'd say that we've got great confidence in the team, the value proposition. These are not commodities, these are terrific value to our customers and I wish they would have been a bit more proactive in that activity. Chris Parkinson : And just a very quick follow-up. You just said on some key trends on pro versus DIY. But just within the pro market, can you just hit on any just broader comments in the performance of your customers across anything from resi and repaint, property management or even commercial? Thank you. John Morikis : Sure, I'd say let's start with residential repaint. As we mentioned, we had a nice quarter. Again, that will be 13 to 15 quarters that we've had double-digit gains in our residential repaint. And as I mentioned, that's with -- what was going to be a terrific quarter. Last couple of weeks in June just crushed our exterior sales. And as I mentioned, those come along with a higher average sale price. So, we're really pleased with the momentum of our stores organization and the momentum that they have in that residential repaint team. We've got phenomenal leaders, great products, great service and, most importantly, the right people close to the customers. So, we've got a lot of momentum and a lot of confidence there. On the new residential side, we're really pleased with our momentum there as well. We have -- I don't know if I've ever -- we've ever shared this with anyone publicly here, but we've got exclusive agreements with 15 of the top 20 national builders here in the U.S. And yes, and I know the follow-up question, we are working on the additional five. We have that discussion on about a monthly basis. But we've got really good progress there and the value proposition and introducing new products and services to the new residential customers is going well. And our commercial base is one where we've just got really good work course systems and our sales organization works very closely with that customer base. So, we're feeling very bullish about the momentum in the architectural business and really thrilled about our position, but not complacent. We're always challenging our team on how we're going to be better and more aligned with our customers in a differentiating way. Bob Wells : Hey, Chris, this is Bob. And just because we're on the subject of painting contractors, let me break in. And because there's been a lot of debate on whether the labor supply issue is improving or staying the same. From our perspective, while it may be approving -- improving marginally in some regions of the country, I think in most of the country, we're still seeing pretty chronic labor supply shortages. In the Southeast, Southwest and West in particular, those are the tightest regions and certainly, the impact on project count is pretty significant. Our contractor surveys in every region tell us that contractors would bid more work if they had more help. And most say they'd be willing to pay more to get more qualified labor. So the labor shortages that we've talked about for the last year and a half to two years don't appear to be behind us. John Morikis : And I'd say the fact that they've got labor issues in some of these markets, they lean more on our people and our stores. So, it really fits well to our model. Chris Parkinson : It's great color. Thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Good morning. John Morikis : Good morning Arun. Arun Viswanathan : So, I just had a question on the guidance. So, I guess, just trying to understand the mid-single-digit comment for Q3 and the full year. So, does that kind of -- maybe you can parse that out on your expectations for Paint Stores Group and Consumer where historically, my understanding is that Paint Stores will be at the upper end of that and then Consumer potentially lower. Are you still expecting consumer to lag through the rest of the year and potentially show negative growth for the year? John Morikis : I'd like Al to answer that, but I'd like to just begin with a question, your point about the consumer side. I think it's important to understand, we're working on these solutions that we think can help our customer and we're going to do that customer-by-customer. And as unsatisfying as this answer is to both you and us, and there's really no quick fix here. The short-term solution of throwing promotional money at this problem is not a solution that we're pursuing. So, the long-term solution is to help our customers drive traffic and convert these footsteps into their -- in their stores into sales and help them to drive footsteps into their stores. Allen Mistysyn : So, Arun, this is Al. The low to mid-single-digits in the guidance in the third quarter certainly has the impact of our tempered view of both the Consumer Brands Group, core business and the Latin America region. And when you look at the full year at mid-single-digits that would tell you that the stores group does have to perform up in that range. And we didn't come off the year on EPS on our core at $0.14, $0.15 and that's really driven by the flow-through we saw in stores. So, if you look at our first half with our U.S. and Canada stores business, 7% same-store sales growth and -- I'm sorry, yes, 6% same-store sales growth and over a 30% flow-through. That would tell you that their second half has to be at a similar pace to achieve the $0.14, $0.15 with the tempered view of Consumer and Latin America. Arun Viswanathan : Got it, that's very helpful. And then I guess, as a follow-up. Just curious with some of the other lag you've had over the last couple of years, protective and marine. You talked about the labor shortage and then price costs. Do you -- so your expectation as far as the question improves as the year unfolds. Do you still expect to achieve about 75% of the 5% price increase for the year? John Morikis : Yes, we do and our practice of working with our customers through that process is continuing. And we often speak about the fact that we're not out there trying to jam a price increase in immediately. We work with our customers, and those phase in over in the Sherwin-Williams side in the six to seven-month period. It might be a little bit longer on the OE side for Valspar. It might be a six to nine-month with some of the agreements that they have. But it is clearly our intention that these products, services and the total value proposition are going to allow us to continue to push those two. But we'll do it at the right place to retain our customers. Bob Wells : Hey, Arun, a quick point of clarification. The range of price increases that we took in our stores was 3% to 5%. The average was about 4%, not 5%. So, 75% of 4%. Arun Viswanathan : Got it. Thanks. And any thoughts on Protective & Marine, the outlook there? John Morikis : Yes. We're actually feeling pretty good about our Protective & Marine, and we had a nice turn here in the quarter for our -- and particularly, our North America petrochem had some nice swing. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, slightly below our core business, but clearly moving in the right direction. And we're -- we've been talking in the last couple of quarters about the shift or pivot, as we call it, into some of these additional segments. We're getting very good traction there. There were a couple of segments that we see projects. We see them on the Board, but they've not been released primarily in the infrastructure. If you look at bridge and highway and water/wastewater, there has been some projects that are in discussion, I'd call it, but have not been released. The pressure -- and I also mentioned in Latin America, we saw a nice turn in our P&M business in Latin America. The two areas that we continue to see pressure in Protective & Marine, and albeit they're smaller businesses in relationship to our stores business, would be in Asia and in Europe. We continue to see pressure on our P&M business there. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Bob Wells : Thanks Arun. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys good morning. First off, going back to the weakness in exterior paint the last two weeks of June. Was that weighed upon by any particular region? There were parts of the country that were extremely hotter than the month of June. I guess, what are customers telling you in terms of the weakness there looking back? John Morikis : Yes, the largest division that was impacted was our Southeastern division. These divisions take a lot of pride in competing with each other. And Southeast is -- has been one that has been leading the pack here for quite some time. And I would say, going into the final lap here, if you will, of the third quarter, they were in a pretty good position, but they clearly felt the impact in the last couple of weeks. And our Southwestern division did a wonderful job in capitalizing on that opportunity and leading the pack for our stores organization. Bob Wells : And because it was Southeast has been consistently one of the strongest demand regions in the country, we do not believe that the slowdown in exterior sales had anything to do with lack of demand. There is high demand for exterior projects in the market right now. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. And then even with the weakness in the consumer channel, you're still going to have to deal with higher raw material costs, I would imagine, going into 2018. Can you first give us a sense as to when the U.S. do-it-yourself paint channel realized a price increase? And then second, how do you plan on offsetting this -- the inflation that we're starting to see? Thanks. John Morikis : Well, we're going to offset that by working with our customers on the need for our pricing and the timing. Al just spoke to the fact that we're bringing a little more clarity to our stores' pricing given that they are, in fact, our own stores. We prefer not to talk about pricing as it relates to our consumer business. But suffice it to say that the basket of raw materials are moving and we're talking with our customers about the needed price increases to offset that raw material basket shift. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. Thanks so much. Bob Wells : Thanks Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Hi. Bob, your recent comments about pricing increases and so forth, is it fair to say out of that 5% same-store sales growth, 3% was price, 2% volume? Bob Wells : About 200 basis points, price; the balance, volume, Steve. Steve Byrne : And is there some drag on that from just a year-over-year mix shift having less exterior paint? John Morikis : Well, the exterior and DIY, we had a soft DIY performance in our stores and, we believe, in the entire market. Steve Byrne : And are you still lagging the raw material cost push? And do you expect that you'll be in a position to keep pushing price into 2018? Allen Mistysyn : Just talking to the Paint Stores Group, I think the effectiveness that we've talked about in our price increase has been very good. I think as you talk about looking out, we're monitoring the raw material basket. And as we get a better line of sight to that, we would certainly talk to our customers first, like we have in the past. We'd also absolutely try to push back on our vendors or find our cost offsets in our own organization before we go talk to our customers. But then absent of those offsets, then we will talk to our customers first and then let you all know. Steve Byrne : And then lastly, your 3% volume growth, how would you compare that to the overall architectural volume growth in the states? Bob Wells : It's difficult to tell at this point, Steve, because we haven't heard enough public reports from the second quarter. It feels to us like DIY has been very slow. And the other comment I'd make is that while our exterior business was soft, we doubt we're the only one that felt the impact of slow exterior sales in the latter half of June. John Morikis : I'd also say that the exterior business is oftentimes a contractor-applied product. There are certainly many DIY customers that apply their own exterior coatings. Let's say that many customers, when it comes to tackling a DIY project, would prefer that to be an interior versus exterior. So, we may feel a little bit -- and again, this is on the shorter term, we may feel a bit more of a pinch on the exterior gallons, given our mix heavily towards the contractor. But we've got -- as Bob mentioned, we have a lot of confidence in the trend here and we don't feel this is a demand issue. Steve Byrne : Okay. Thank you. Bob Wells : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Koort : Thanks very much. Good morning. John Morikis : Good morning Bob. Robert Koort : John, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the synergy opportunity in front of you. You mentioned you've probably had a little longer than you like to look things over and potentially have less divestitures maybe than you could have feared from the regulators. So, can you talk a little bit about what you're finding now on the synergies and what the pace of that synergy capture will be? John Morikis : Yes, I'd say, Bob, here in the first 45 days -- and to your point, while we had more time than we would have preferred, there were certainly limitations to what we were able to dial into out of respect to the proper process to the FTC. And so truly, we've had about 45 days to dial in. And we're very confident in the numbers that we've posted on -- prior to the close about our ability, from a synergy standpoint, to drive those synergies through the organization and, importantly, as we believe, position the company for growth. And so we feel as though we're trending well. We feel as though there's good engagement by both Valspar leadership and Sherwin leadership and making good decisions that allow us to extract out the -- what we call value capture and, at the same time and more importantly, position ourselves for growth. Bob Wells : And I would say, Bob, we have about $50 million of synergies in our forecast for Valspar core. And when you look at that compared to what we talked about when we announced the acquisition, we had about $140 million in number in our first full year, so that's an annual number. You talk about $50 million -- around $50 million at a run rate. That's probably $100 million. And as we get more clarity and are able to get more discussions across the selling organizations and looking at formulations in that, we'll have a better picture that we'll update guidance accordingly. And we'll give you a clear picture at the FCP conference in October. Robert Koort : Okay. And then if I might ask, on the architectural side, Valspar had different strategies, whether it was the embryonic business in Europe or what they're doing and China or even in Australia or maybe it was the combo of big-box and paint stores. You see any opportunity to harmonize the go-to-market in architectural businesses outside the U.S.? Or what can they do differently under your ownership than they've been doing? John Morikis : Yes, so we want to look at that, Bob. That's a great point. We want to start with a customer and work back, though, not just what we could bring to that. We do believe that there are terrific opportunities, if it's technology and from a supply chain standpoint, combined with what we think will be a far more efficient. But the most important element here is the customer and so we're going through the process right now of working with our new team members from Valspar on the needs from the consumer and working back to what it is that we bring. And so we're excited about this. We think there are some opportunities. We're anxious to explore them. We've often referenced, you mentioned -- what might be the smallest market, but just because you mentioned it the Australian businesses we've -- they operate, I believe, 64 stores in Australia and we like -- we're anxious to bring some of the expertise that we have in running stores to that business. But we're the first to admit that we're not experts in Australia. So, we're connecting dots here to make sure that what's needed in the market and the opportunity in the markets that the resources, the assets and skill sets that we have in our company. Robert Koort : Great. Thanks very much. Bob Wells : Thank you, Bob. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thanks and good morning everyone. A couple of questions on the Valspar business. As we were watching the company report during that sort of purgatory period of the transaction, the results were coming in weaker than everybody forecasted, particularly on the consumer side of things. So, as you went back and once you were able to look under the hood, what was going on there? Was there destocking taking place? Or were they losing more shelf space, or what's the postmortem there? John Morikis : I'd say that the thought of their losing shelf space, I mean, first of all, you mentioned the paints business, we were competing obviously with Valspar and one very large customer. And so there was -- there may have been some shift in there. I think as we've got -- been able to pull back the curtain, if you will, I'd say that the opportunities for growth are clearly there. I don't know that the -- as I mentioned earlier, from a pricing activity standpoint, that they were as active as we would like to have seen. But from a volume standpoint, I wouldn't point to market share losses. I might say that they were experiencing, like we were, some softness in the market. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Just as a follow-up to that, as you look forward with that Valspar paints business, I mean, do you think you'll keep the Valspar brand? Or do you think you'll try to tie that volume into what you've been doing with Sherwin, with HGTV and with Infinity or maybe another application? But what would be the pros and cons of maintaining two brands -- a dual-brand strategy? John Morikis : Well, it's a terrific asset. I mean, we wanted to build on that. We think there are customers of the Valspar brand that are eager to grow, and we want to help them, and we think that the Valspar brand is a terrific asset to help them do exactly that. I mean, our goal would be to bring the technology and the combined services to each and every one of our customers to help them execute their strategy. And every customer is a little different. They've got different expectations and targets. And we think that combined the Sherwin-Valspar portfolio of resources, people, skills and technologies will allow us to separate from the competition. And so I would expect that we're going to build on those. But I'd also say that we don't make decisions for our customers. We're going to work with them and help them to make the right decision to help them reach their goals. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thank you very much. Bob Wells : Thanks Vincent. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson : Thank you. John, I want to go back to your Valspar synergy comment. You said your confidence in your original $280 million assessment. But what were some of the main areas you couldn't look at until you close the company? As I look at manufacturing and distribution, that's only 8%. And looking at previous transactions you've done like Comex, logistics and consolidation and manufacturing plants tended to be a much bigger part of your synergies. John Morikis : Yes. So, two. I mean, the first and largest would be the raw material costs. We're unable to look at raw material costs formulations. We're not able to look at formulations. And so when you talk about, are there possibilities for consolidation? You can't just look at a map and say, there's two facilities nearby. One is a candidate to be closed. We try to understand the specific needs of every customer, which we were not -- unable to talk about, the specific technology that's manufactured in a plant, which we're not able to talk about, the raw material costs, the suppliers that they're using in those raw materials. There's quite a bit that we were able to do and we're moving aggressively because they were within bounds and there were many areas that were out -- clearly out of bounds that we didn't get near. Don Carson : And then a follow-up on capital deployment. There's still a lot of consolidation going on, on smaller industrial properties. Are you out of that market for now as you integrate Valspar? Or are you telling the Valspar people that if they see appropriate opportunities that they should continue to pursue them? John Morikis : We're telling them that if they see opportunities we want to know them. We want to have those discussions. We've been very clear about -- in the short-term our focus is on paying down our debt. But often times -- it's not like we're going to the grocery store and buying something off the shelf. I mean, these are discussions that we have for -- often times, we've had deals that I've worked on for five years. So, we want to know from each business leader, on a regular basis, those opportunities that they feel will help them by enhancing their value proposition to their customers and we want to engage in those discussions now. Don Carson : Okay. Thank you. Bob Wells : Thanks Don. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. Eventually, we'll kind of subsume Valspar in the reporting, but over the next year, we've got kind of work off their public numbers. If we just look at their last 12 months of revenue and going forward over the next 12, how fast do you see topline growing from them? And then maybe kind of help get faster in one of the segments versus the other. John Morikis : Yes, it's -- it really does vary, Duffy, by region, by segment. We're excited about that. I don't want to give the false impression that it's going to happen overnight. I mean, we've got opportunities to -- in many parts of the world, we have a broader assortment of products and technologies. But we're going to have to have a supply chain to be able to transfer some of those products. We're going to have to get our sales organization up to speed and aware of the technology. And so there's a whole lot of work going on right now and trying to accelerate that as quickly as possible. And then those were some of the things that we talked about before the close of how we were going to go about that. So we're executing on those plans right now, but it really does vary very much by segment and by customer. Bob Wells : And Duffy, I would say if you look at our guidance, the $2.5 billion for the June through December. You got to remember, they're on a 4-4-5. So, we tried to make their last year comparable to ours, and with that, we think we'd be flat to up slightly, which I think is right in the range of what they've been running. Duffy Fischer : Okay, great. And then just rolling LatAm into the Paint Stores Group, is that doing anything structurally to how you're running LatAm? Bob Wells : No, I think what we talked about a few years ago was that Latin America, we moved under the Paint Stores Group management team and created the Americas Group back then. We just didn't report it that way. So, with a larger company, Latin America gets to be about less than 5% of our sales and profit, much less than that even, unfortunately. But it didn't make sense leave them as a separate segment. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thanks guys. Bob Wells : Hey Duffy. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. PJ Juvekar : Good morning John. John Morikis : Hi PJ. PJ Juvekar : So, your Consumer Group continues to underperform, sales are down 11%, and I think you said it was broad based. So, I guess, my question is, what is all of this weakness in DIY? Is it that consumers are spending less on paint? Maybe they're spending more on Amazon or something like that? John Morikis : No, I would say that there's certainly a shift from do-it-yourself to do-it-for-me that's likely accelerated. It's -- often times, when you talk about a consumer, little difficult to put your fingers right on what it is that's driving the slowdown in do-it-yourself. What we're focused on here, PJ, is ensuring that our customers are at the best position to be able to capitalize on the business that does exist out there. There's terrific market share, as we said in review with each of our customers, their goals and providing the lineup of products, brands and services to help them is what we're focused on to be able to do that. Bob Wells : At the risk of belaboring the obvious, PJ, we -- while we don't like to see our DIY business in our stores slowing down, we are the beneficiaries of this shift from DIY to do-it-for-me. John mentioned in his opening comments that we've seen 13 in the last 15 quarters of double-digit growth in our Pro residential repaint business. We think that's a reflection of more people hiring professionals as opposed to doing it themselves. PJ Juvekar : Okay. So, you don't think there's an issue about dollars being spent on paints or painting in general? Bob Wells : No. Actually, we think that painting activity is pretty strong right now. As strong as it can be, given the labor shortages in the contractor market. PJ Juvekar : Okay. And then on your synergies -- just on your synergies, are there any true revenue synergies between the two companies? And what I mean by that is are there any Valspar products like cabinet stains that you are beginning to sell through your stores? John Morikis : Well, we wouldn't want to comment on that specifically. I don't think that's happening. But the point here is that we do see opportunities on the synergy side for us to capitalize. And while we're excited about them, PJ, those are not issues that we're going to lay out right now. But I will tell you that by business unit, as we're bringing these teams together, we went in with some idea and some mindset of where those opportunities are. And I would say, right now, we are very excited about as these teams have come together, the opportunities that they've identified that we haven't even thought of yet. So, we're feeling very good about those opportunities and the momentum. It's going to take us a little time to capture those, but we feel good about what we're finding. PJ Juvekar : Okay. And lastly, can you give an update on how did HGTV paint do in the second quarter? John Morikis : Well, we reported our consumer numbers. The HGTV paints specifically, we don't speak to, out of respect to our customer. We allow our customers to report their results. But we did report our consumer results and have clearly indicated that while we feel as though the market is a tough market, we want to see better performance from our team. And they're working very hard, and we have high expectations for them to outperform the market. PJ Juvekar : Okay. Thank you. Bob Wells : Thanks PJ. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hey guys. Thanks. John, you kind of opened up talking about the long-term potential for the combination. When you think about the drivers for 2018 and which is generally, a little bit long away. But when you think about those drivers to generate earnings growth, can you maybe talk about what you're excited about? And what type of growth we could see? John Morikis : Yes, I'm excited about every business that these Valspar and Sherwin-Williams teams have come together and touch. I mean, if you look at the complementary nature of these businesses, they offer technology and resources. In many cases, they may be strong where we're not and vice versa. There's areas of strength that we have that they lack, either scale or facility. The combination of the product lines, the relationship with customers. We're excited to be a more meaningful part of the relationship with many customers, where they may have had an OE direct relationship and our focus has been on the tier suppliers into, ultimately, the OE customer. And so we think the combination of people, technologies, the resources, the assets, the facilities that we have, I mean, every single business, when we sit and talk in these meetings and Allen and I are working with them on a regular basis. And we walk away really, really excited about where we're headed here. And we're pushing hard to get it as fast, but we have a common theme that we're constantly repeating, which is we want to push hard to get it right, not just fast. And so we don't want to making commitments to our customers or to the financial community, but more importantly, to the customers that we can't keep. And I'll add 1 thing to you that is if you look historically at the performance of Sherwin-Williams and our ability to integrate in these facilities and technologies, I don't want to give the impression that it's just out there somewhere. I mean, we move quickly. We're moving aggressively. We just want to make sure we get it right. So, I don't give you the wrong impression there. Mike Sison : Right. And just a quick, quick question on Valspar. You gave a sales for 2017, $2.4 billion. And I think you mentioned that would be kind of flattish up year-over-year. Is -- will earnings, ex synergy, for Valspar be up, flattish or down? Allen Mistysyn : No, Mike. I would say that the earnings would be a continuation of what you saw in the first half on that trend that was reported. Just to be clear on what we reported for Valspar operations is their operations, less their legacy, their legacy debt would be included in that and then less the new debt acquisition financing. But ex the synergies and the financing, I think it'd be down. And primarily because you saw that in the gross margin in that the pressure they saw in the raw material costs. And there was typically a lag in their business in getting price and we're seeing that lag and then some. So, certainly, we're challenging our groups to get out and develop what that pricing action has to be with the customers. Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. Bob Wells : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott your line is live, you may proceed with your question. Scott Mushkin : Can you guys hear me? John Morikis : Hey, Scott. Yes. Scott Mushkin : Great. Can you guys hear me now? Yes, okay. So, I just wanted to -- and I know the call has gone a long time, but I guess you didn't, maybe I missed to catch why you guys thought we had to slowdown in exterior in the Southeast for two weeks? And why you're so -- it seems like you're pretty confident it's just going to go away, and maybe it already has in July. But I'm just wondering the why. Bob Wells : It -- as we said, it was in the Southeast and a little bit in the East. And the why, all we've said is the why was not lack of demand. And we have a practice of not talking about things like weather on conference calls, but you can't paint outside in the rain. And I think I'll leave it at that. John Morikis : Yes, I'd say we were going in the last two weeks of June and came out in July very strong. We had two very difficult weeks and primarily our Southeastern division that really -- and as we mentioned this sell price and volume and everything, the contractor purchases of exterior, it really had a significant impact on our business. Scott Mushkin : Okay, great. That's good color. So, then my next question, and maybe I'm traveling today, so maybe I'm missing it, seems like you guys have a lot of confidence in your back half with your core Sherwin business, is that true? And I guess, the thought process I have, I -- we -- DY -- do-it-yourself has, I think, a big impact on the summer quarter even for you guys. I think it's where you sell the most. So, I was just wondering if you can kind of talk us through why it seems like there's a decent amount of confidence going into the back half? And am I right about that? And what's driving that? John Morikis : Yes, I would say it's safe to say that you should sense a level of confidence. And you talked about our stores organization, again, not to be too repetitive, but we're finishing 13 of 15 quarters in this residential space with a double-digit gain and we feel as though we're really growing share there. And we're really trying to put our foot on the pedal and go even faster. And our teams are really executing there and I think the alignment that we have in developing products and services and working with our customers is really allowing us to grow share. And I'm not -- we're not talking about is that going to slow down? We're talking internally that how we accelerate. We want to go harder and faster and further separate ourselves from our competition. I mentioned the penetration that we have in new residential. And so if you're like us and have confidence in the need for housing and starts and you reflect back on the fact that we've got these exclusive agreements with 15 of the top 20 builders. Yes, we're feeling good, and we're trying to grow that number, the number of builders on both the national and regional level. That we've got the right products that work for the national builders and we're trying to further leverage that for the regional builders. So, I mean, I can go segment-by-segment, but yes, we're feeling really good. But as I said, great people in the field, taking care of customers and we want people feeling as though our people and our stores and our reps are an extension of their business, and our people are doing a terrific job at that. We're very grateful for their efforts. Bob Wells : I would add to that, though, because you specifically point out DIY. On the DIY side of the market, which would include a component of our Paint Stores business and our Consumer Brands Group, probably less confident. We think we're seeing softness in the DIY market. So, that growth is going to be a little more challenging there. Scott Mushkin : Okay. May I let it go and have another question. I'll just take it offline. Thanks guys. Bob Wells : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Scott Rednor : Hi good morning. Bob Wells : Good morning Scott. Scott Rednor : Good afternoon at this point. Just had a curiosity relative to -- I know you guys haven't explicitly disclosed, but relative to any headcount synergies between the two companies. Can you maybe just give us a framework for what percentage of the way through or completed you are? And maybe, John, can you just kind of give us a sense for what the morale is now that the two organizations are officially brought together? John Morikis : I'd say that the morale is very good. We're very transparent and open with our employees and our teams about the process that we're going through. We're not going to -- and I hope you respect, Scott, we're not going to speculate about percentages of where we are or where we are not in the process, respect to our teams and our people. Those are discussions that we have directly with them. We're anxious to get this behind us. We have good momentum, but those aren't discussions that we're going to have. Allen Mistysyn : Scott, I would say if you look at the $50 million that we have in our guidance and the run rate that implies that $100 million you'd say on a three -- 120 gross run rate in year three, we're a third of the way there. So, we feel pretty good about that progress. Scott Rednor : And when you think about the strategy, particularly at Lowe's, now that you have two of the power brands there, can you maybe just talk broadly about any changes in kind of the go-to-market strategy? John Morikis : Our strategy for Lowe's? Scott Rednor : Correct. John Morikis : No, -- yes, we're not going to talk about that, Scott. I mean, again, that's a very important customer of ours and I hope you'll, again, respect that those discussions between us and Lowe's and their strategy, I mean, that's -- it's important to that each and every one of our customers respect that those are confidential discussions and our job is to help them execute on their strategy. Scott Rednor : Okay. I guess, just lastly then, John. I think you made a point about pricing and in the Industrial Coatings business is an area that has kind of trailed expectation, but reasonably so, just given that the deal has taken some time to close. I think previously, when you guys have gotten into businesses that were a little bit different than Paint Stores you've been very slow to implement price increases if I go back to, Sayerlack or Becker. And over time, you created a lot of value, but that took some time to come through the P&L as maybe the financial community saw it. Is this a different situation? Is that the right blueprint? I'm just kind of curious if this means you could do something more immediate than what we saw as that kind of blueprint. John Morikis : Well, I'd say that you're exactly right, Scott and very observant. You know our company well. And historically, we've always taken that approach, which is we're going to work with our customers through that process. And the acquisitions that you described were, in fact OEM suppliers mainly. And so we worked with those customers. Our goal is to always come through the tunnel with our customer and the price. And so we work appropriately with our customers to ensure that the value proposition is there for them and their ability to enhance the value of their products through that process. So, you're right, it's going to take a little bit of time. As I mentioned earlier, we've typically looked at a Sherwin cycle of maybe taking six to seven months to implement a price increase. And on the Valspar side, it might take six to nine months. But the value proposition is strong. The same teams are the ones executing, the same products and technologies. And so we've got confidence in our ability to do that, but we're not going to lose our heads and go out there and try to do it overnight. We want to keep our customers. Scott Rednor : Great. Thanks for time. Bob Wells : Thanks Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Stephen Eastwood with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Stephen East : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. John there's been -- you've had a lot of questions asked about price and trying to reaccelerate your back half of 2017. Before the merger actually occurred, a lot of talk about raw material purchasing benefits, et cetera. Haven't really heard any conversation on that. So as you look at the second half of 2017, how big a part -- how would you sort of rank order where that raw material purchasing synergy would be in improving your volumes or your up margin as you go forward? John Morikis : Yes, Steve, it's a good question. I might answer a little differently and that is referencing back to the previous question. We have confidence and we've not seen anything that keeps us from being anything but confident in our ability to reach the synergy targets that we have. They're going to lay in -- Al mentioned that run rate that we're at. I don't think it's in our best interest to parse out where we are on each of those individual synergy buckets as we're pursuing them, but you should expect raw materials was a big one. You should expect that we're being very aggressive in pursuing those and our goal is to try to capture those as quickly as possible. Stephen East : Great. Okay. Fair enough. And then I know we've beat consumer like a dead horse here, but I'll ask you one more. The segments didn't hunt down as much as you all have been the first half of the year. What do you think is going on? You've talked about not just using promo dollars to try to recapture but to drive. So, what do you think was going on in your business that maybe wasn't happening in some of your peers that you got to correct? John Morikis : Well, we're always interested in improving our performance. I do have to -- I think it's important to make a statement here that I believe that, again, with limited PoS data, we don't see all the data from our customers. I would tell you that our sell-through at retail is in line with what we believe to be the rate of the DIY market. I do think that the inventory connection -- correction may have been a little stronger on some of the products as we've walked into some of these programs. And at the same time, while we're learning about the program, our customers are experiencing a little softer market than what we would like to see. And so I think there's been some adjustment accordingly. But as far as the market goes, I think our out-the-doors are performing similar to what we expect the market is performing. Bob Wells : The other point I'd point out, Steve, is that segment includes a business unit in Europe. So, it may not be an apples-to-apples comparison looking at our volumes versus our peers. Europe, the second consecutive quarter, was the weakest performing part of the Consumer segment. So, we're getting a drag from overseas. Stephen East : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. John Morikis : Thank you. Bob Wells : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Matt on for Kevin. I just have two one's for you. Your management teams across the space have indicated kind of 2Q is probably the peak for raw material pressure on the year. As we look into 3Q and 4Q, just given the lags, kind of how much of an actual decline do you expect to see of this Q2 peak? Bob Wells : Matt, this is Bob. The change in raw material cost year-over-year probably peaked in the second quarter. That's only because we're starting to annualized price increases from last year. We did see chemical-grade propylene settle back after a pretty significant spike in the first quarter and we don't expect any major swings over the balance of the year. So that's probably good news. But MMA remains very tight. TiO2, we're probably going to see more traction on pricing in the TiO2 market. So, I don't expect raw material -- the basket to decline. In fact, the basket, we're going to see a little incremental inflation going forward. It's just that the compare gets easier as we go forward. So, our outlook for the full year is still mid-single digits, but we don't see a lot of goodness in the back half in the way of deflation. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And Valspar had another business, which housed corporate costs and adhesives businesses. Kind of where the earnings from that adhesives business is going now? And can you quantify how much earnings that business generates versus what the prior corporate cost was on an absolute level? Allen Mistysyn : Matt, the -- their -- with their resin and colorants business that was in that Admin [ph] segment is now in our Performance Coating segment. But no, we won't be breaking the specifics of the segment profit out for that business. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, and corporate costs just got tallied into your own? It's that what I'm guessing. Bob Wells : That's correct. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander : Two very quick ones. Just on the regional same-store sales comments you made in the beginning, can you talk just a little bit, can you characterize the dispersion between your best regions and your worst regions? And is that dispersion, any wider than normal? And secondly, with respect to share gains that you're going after in the back half of the year and going forward, are there any areas where you are reversing a trend rather than building on momentum you already had? John Morikis : Let me answer that last one. I'd say the area that we started to see some positive that would still may be characterized as reversing, I would say, would be the Protective & Marine. That has been under pressure for a couple of years now. And this -- we clearly saw a shift in the petrochem, and there's still more opportunity there. And I'd say that there's -- I'd characterize that in that manner. Regarding the -- I'm sorry, the division question you had was. Allen Mistysyn : Geographic dispersion of results from -- in the five regions. John Morikis : Yes. So, you talked about the gap between them? Bob Wells : Yes. John Morikis : I don't -- Bob Wells : Well, high single-digits in the strongest region to low single-digits in the weakest, all being positive on revenue and volume. Laurence Alexander : I guess, where I was getting at is, is that any different than what you normally see? John Morikis : It's -- that's -- there's always a little bit of a gap, I'd say. Allen Mistysyn : Might be a little bit wider-- John Morikis : A little wider maybe. Allen Mistysyn : Than usual. Laurence Alexander : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thanks guys. Were any synergies in wood coatings in the original $280 million? Or were you assuming you're divesting that all along? Allen Mistysyn : There -- in the original, there probably was some, John, but not significant enough on a $225 million business on a $4.2 billion company to matter. John Roberts : Okay. And then the inventory write-up sounds like you'll completely flushed by the August period. Is the fourth quarter going to be -- as you see it right now, there's no unusuals in the fourth quarter, at least in your full year guidance. It's there. Maybe something might change by then, but at least in your guidance right now, is there any year end significant accruals for compensation or something that might affect comparability in the fourth quarter? John Morikis : No, not right now. John Roberts : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Perrella : Hi, good afternoon. Quick follow-up, housekeeping. When will we see more pro forma data? What's the timing on that? Allen Mistysyn : I think, Chris, what we're prepared to do is at the FCP Conference, we'll give you more color and more guidance on the performance of Valspar and the combined entity and the synergies that are occurring. I think after 45 days, it's a little tough to have a lot of confidence in some of the things that we just thought. So, we're shooting for the FCP Meeting. Christopher Perrella : Okay. Thank you very much. Allen Mistysyn : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn : Good afternoon guys. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I'd just like to follow-up a little bit. I know it's a small segment for you, but Latin America saw negative -- or negative operating profit in three of the last six quarters and a pretty big step-down in the profitability this quarter. Is it all sort of timing of raw materials? Are there other some issues with volume growth or declines? Can you talk about sort of why that business performed as poorly as it did on the margin line in the second quarter? And what should we look forward to in the second half of the year? Allen Mistysyn : Dmitry, the -- when you look at our Latin America region, Brazil is the largest portion of that business. And as you well know, that it's just been in turmoil. So, you see a lot of short-term choppiness. We expect that to continue over the short-term. Over the long-term, that market, it's the ninth largest economy. As they work their way through the turmoil and regain their footing, we expect that to be a good market for us and expect to see growth and a return to the profitability of that region. John Morikis : Yes, I'd say Latin America, outside of Brazil, we see a good trend. We're growing our share and financials are pointing in the right direction. And to Al's point, Brazil is such a big percentage of -- the weight of Brazil on our overall South American operations is pretty heavy. Dmitry Silversteyn : And can I follow-up? I think you mentioned that in your Coatings segment in your Industrial Coatings business, you identified Latin America as sort of a good guy in terms of delivering strong growth. So, kind of why the discrepancy between the Industrial segment and the Consumer segment in that economy? I would imagine that both would be impacted by the political turmoil. John Morikis : Yes, you're exactly right. And let me add one more. Our store performance, our own store performance in Brazil is actually positive performance as well. Such a big part of that business, Dmitry, is third-party through home centers and distributors, and they're calling on consumers. And the consumers' confidence in that market is clearly shaken. But you're exactly right. If you look at our automotive, our wood business, our general industrial and Protective & Marine businesses in Latin America, they were all positive. It's the architectural consumer business that's under pressure. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay, that's helpful, John. And then just as a quick follow-up on Industrial Coatings business, particularly the Valspar piece of it, which has been decelerating pretty meaningfully in terms of margin in the last couple of quarters and through the last reportable segment that they had or the reportable period that they had. You mentioned sort of lack of productivity on price increases. Was that the main driver of lower margins? Or was there some mix impact there? And how do you feel about that in the second half of the year? Can you at least stem the declines and kind of stabilize them at these levels before price increases kick in what sounds like in 2018? John Morikis : Yes, I'd say we're going to continue to feel pressure through the end of the year. I'd like to say they we're going to be able to turn this around quickly here, Dmitry. But I think, this is a process when you're involved in these acquisitions. First of all, it was a very long FTC process, and sometimes people get a little distracted, and I respect that. And quite frankly, you have competitors that are in there trying to create opportunities. And so we always see this as well. The competition kicks up for a short -- for a little bit and they're aggressive and so we feel some pressure. And they've done the right thing. They've hung on to the business. The volume is actually hanging in there. It's the gross margin that's under pressure. And so as I mentioned earlier, and again, I don't want to be repetitive, but we've got great confidence in these leadership teams that are now part of our team. And these are the same leaders and same product services, as I mentioned earlier. And it's up to us to continue to demonstrate the value proposition to our customers and to earn that incremental margin to offset the raw material costs and we've got confidence in our ability to do that. Historically, they've been able to do that. Everything's consistent and we're going to continue to work towards that. We're going to do it at the right pace. Dmitry Silversteyn : Got it. Okay John thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Hi good afternoon. John Morikis : Hey Mike. Mike Harrison : John, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on how you and the regulators arrived at the Valspar wood coatings business is the piece that would need to be sold. And can you maybe talk about the approach to the industrial wood coatings market going forward? Is that something that you can attack in North America with just the legacy Sherwin position? John Morikis : Well, your first question about how did that we arrive with the regulators, I mean, that's a normal process review, which we're very respectful for the process that the government goes through, and we responded to all their requests. The did their due diligence, including not only our information, but Valspar's, but also customer information and they made a decision. And while we may have had a different opinion in many areas, and that is part of the process, you're able to express your thoughts, ultimately, they made a decision and we had to respect that. And so we find ourselves now exactly where the FTC would want us, which is in a competitive situation with the new entrant. And yes, you're exactly right, we're going to compete for that business and I don't think the FTC or any other government agency would have it any other way. The competition is good for the consumer and we're going to be out there looking for that -- those customer relationships. We have a good industrial wood business or they would not have required us to divest the one that they required. So, our teams are going to be working hard to try to grow their business. And some of those customers will certainly be legacy Valspar customers. But I'll say this tongue-in-cheek, we don't discriminate. We'll take customers anywhere we can get. So, we'll be working hard with all customers' opportunities. Mike Harrison : All right. And then was just curious, in the consumer brand's business, have you received any clarity from some of the retailers that you sell through about how they're going to address multiple brands potentially in the same product category now being under the same ownership? Is that the situation where you could expect to potentially lose some incremental shelf space? John Morikis : Or gain -- or gain share. We're having those discussions every day. And again, it goes back to the same value proposition. It's upon us to help our customers be successful. That's our goal. That's how we measure our success. Our success is making our customers successful. So, we're making those discussions every day. And we've talked openly about the need for volume. And so while we talk about value capture, raw material costs, all those things, the day starts and ends with discussions about growing volume and growing sales and we do that by aligning ourselves with our customers. Mike Harrison : Thank you. John Morikis : Yes, thank you. Bob Wells : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So, I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Bob Wells : Thanks Jesse. I'll wrap-up quickly by remind you all that our annual Financial Community Presentation is scheduled for October 3rd, in New York at the Marriott Marquis. The program will consist of a brief business review by our segment leadership teams, followed by a more detailed update on our Valspar integration plans and progress. We'll host our customary Q&A session followed by a reception and lunch. Again, that date is Tuesday, October 3rd. Please look out for registration information sent via e-mail in mid-August. As always, I will be available over the next few days to handle any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. If you'd like to be placed in the queue for a follow-up call, please call Kristy Johnson at 216-566-3001 and she will add you to the callback schedule. Again that number is 216-566-3001. I'd like to thank you again for joining us today and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we have provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information, including a slide deck with a breakdown of results by our new reportable segment on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, October 24th press release. I\u2019ll begin by highlighting overall Company performance for the third quarter 2017 compared to third quarter 2016, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 37.4% or $1.23 billion to $4.51 billion due primarily to Valspar sales and higher paint sales volume in the Americas Group and Performance Coatings Group, partially offset by the impact of the hurricanes in Texas, Florida and the Caribbean. Excluding Valspar results, core consolidated sales increased 4.6% over the third quarter last year, with a significant portion of the increase coming from sales to our North American paint stores. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $265.7 million or 16.2% to $1.9 billion in the quarter. Our consolidated gross margin decreased 770 basis points in the quarter to 42.2% of sales from 49.9% in the third quarter last year. Excluding the impact from Valspar, core gross margins declined 140 basis points in the quarter to 48.5% of sales. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 24.4% or $256 million over the third quarter last year to $1.31 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased 300 basis points to 29.0% in the third quarter this year from 32.0% last year. Excluding the impact from Valspar, core SG&A increased $50.2 million in the quarter or 10 basis points as a percent of sales. Interest expense increased $47.5 million compared to third quarter last year to $91.6 million. This increase was entirely due to acquisition-related interest expense. Amortization increased to $83.7 million from $8.2 million last year due to the increase in intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $107.9 million or 20.1% to $427.7 million. Excluding the impact from Valspar, PBT declined $19 million or 3.3% to $553.4 million, which includes a $42 million negative impact from the natural disasters in the quarter. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 26.0%. For the full year 2017, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in that mid to high 20% range. Consolidated net income decreased $70.1 million or 18.1% to $316.6 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 7.0% compared to 11.8% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased 18.4% to $3.36 per share from $4.08 per share in 2016. The $3.33 per share includes a $1.42 per share in acquisition-related expenses including inventory step-up and purchase accounting amortization and income of $0.49 per share from Valspar operations. We have summarized the year-over-year earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our third quarter 2017 press release. Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for the Americas Group in the third quarter 2017 increased $154.7 million or 6.5% to $2.540 billion from $2.38 billion last year. This increase was primarily due to higher architectural paint sales volumes across most end markets, and selling price increases partially of set by the impact of the hurricanes primarily in our Southeastern and Southwestern divisions. Sales in the Latin America region stated in U.S. dollars, increased 4.9% in the quarter. Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2%. Regionally, in the third quarter, our Canada division led all divisions, followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, Eastern and Southeastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. Segment profit for the group increased $6.3 million or 1.2% to $525.6 million in the quarter as higher architectural paint sales volumes and selling price increases were partially offset by higher raw material costs and the negative impact of the storms in the quarter. Segment operating margin decreased to 20.7% of sales from 21.8% in the third quarter last year. Turning to the Consumer Brands Group. Third quarter sales increased $325.1 million or 81.6% to $723.3 million due primarily to the inclusion of Valspar sales, partially offset by lower volume sales to most of consumer group\u2019s retail customers. Excluding sales from Valspar, core sales for the group decreased 2.7% in the quarter. Segment profit per Consumer Brands decreased $16.8 million or 19.2% to $70.4 million in the quarter due to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization costs, totaling $54.6 million and higher raw material costs that were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies, good expense control and selling price increases. Excluding the balance Valspar impact, core segment profit was essentially flat year-over-year. Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 9.7% from 21.9% in the same period last year. Most of the impact in segment profit margin was from acquisition-related expenses, negative margin mix from the addition of Valspar businesses and higher raw material costs. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group increased 50 basis points to 22.4%. For our Performance Coatings group, sales in U.S. dollars increased $746.9 million or 150.8% to $1.24 billion in the quarter due to the addition of Valspar sales, higher core paint sales volume, and selling price increases. Excluding Valspar, core sales for the group increased 2.1% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, third quarter segment profit decreased $8.4 million or 12.4% to $59.6 million due primarily to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization costs totaling a $102 million. Excluding Valspar, core segment profit declined 15.9% in the quarter. As a percent of external sales, segment profit decreased to 4.8% from 13.7% in the same period last year. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group decreased 240 basis points to 11.3% of sales. That concludes our review of the third quarter results for 2017. So, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Morikis who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Third quarter 2017 was a challenging quarter, particularly for those living in the path of the violent hurricanes and earthquakes we all witnessed. I think it\u2019s fitting that I begin my remarks this morning by acknowledging and thanking all the Sherwin-Williams associates in Texas, Florida, Georgia, the Caribbean and Mexico who served countless hours of volunteer work in the disaster relief and cleanup efforts, went above and beyond the call of duty in helping our customers get back on their feet, and got our stores and facilities up and running in record time. These communities are home to Sherwin-Williams and that point is very evident in the ongoing efforts of our people. Our results in the third quarter were slightly better than the revised expectations we communicated back on September 27th. Although the storms and earthquakes disrupted the operations of as many as 650 paint stores, the impact in terms of lost sales in the quarter was at the low end of our expected range of $50 million to $70 million. This good news, if you can call it that, was offset by moderately higher than expected raw material inflation as a result of storm-related supply interruptions, primarily in the Houston petrochemical complex. The combined effect of lost sales, higher raw material rates and LIFO charges taken in the quarter, decreased our third quarter consolidated gross margin by about 30 basis points. The hurricane disruptions also pushed our full-year estimate of industry average raw material cost inflation to the high end of our mid single digit range. The spike in some raw materials is likely temporary and should diminish as propylene and ethylene production returns to normal. Others may have a longer term impact. In either case, higher year-over-year raw material costs and LIFO will be a stronger headwind to earnings in fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter. The October 1st price increase in our North American paint stores should help to mitigate the impact of higher raw materials. Similar actions are underway as needed in our other lines of business. Natural disasters of this nature have a disproportionate effect on profitability because lost sales and gross profit cannot be offset in the short-term by reduced operating expenses. In total, these events decreased our earnings per share in the quarter about $0.27 compared to the $0.35 impact we anticipated at the end of September. The sales momentum we saw across most of our North American businesses prior to the storms, was encouraging. Comparable store sales growth in our North American paint stores was running in the high single digits, and that momentum appears to be resuming as the effects of the storms diminish. Even with the storm impact, sales to residential repaint contractors grew double digits in the third quarter, and DIY sales to our stores grew high single digits. Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group, both show sequential revenue improvement in the third quarter, and we expect that progress to continue as well. The natural disasters last quarter did not derail our plans for new store openings. In the first nine months, the Americas Group opened 50 net new stores and added 104 new sales territories in the U.S. Canada and the Caribbean, bringing our total store count in the region to 4,230 compared to 4,141 a year ago. Our plan for the full year still calls for store openings in the range of 90 net new locations in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean compared to 94 last year. In Latin America, we added 11 net new stores and added 44 new dedicated dealer locations in the first nine months. We currently operate 350 company stores and sell our products to 682 dedicated dealer locations compared to 316 and 619, respectively a year ago. Valspar integration plans and synergy progress continue to track with the expectations we communicated as recently as October 3rd at our financial community presentation. We remain focused on strengthening the performance of both our core businesses and our newly acquired businesses. This focus includes implementing appropriate pricing initiatives to offset increasing raw material costs, and continuing to focus on volume improvements in all businesses and all regions. In the first nine months of 2017, we generated $1.26 billion in net operating cash, an increase of almost $300 million compared to the first nine months of 2016 and greater than 11% of net sales. On September 30th, the Company had $208 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to reduce debt and fund operations. The Company made no open market purchases of common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $143 million and we anticipate approximately $200 million in capital expenditures for the full year. Depreciation through nine months was $162 million, and total amortization including purchasing accounting and inventory step up was $233 million. Incremental depreciation and amortization related to Valspar acquisition purchase accounting has been revised to approximately $300 million on an annual basis. Purchase accounting inventory adjustments of $140 million were amortized over June, July and August 2017. The Regulation G reconciliation table near the back of this morning\u2019s press release includes $1.04 per share of full year transaction and integration costs, which is up from our second quarter guidance of $0.60 for full year. This increase reflects the cost of facility consolidations that had not been announced as of our second quarter release. The balance sheet reflects preliminary purchase accounting balances and incremental debt of approximately $9.5 billion used to fund the acquisition. Net payments of long-term debt totaling approximately $700 million were made in the nine months at the -- ended September 30, 2017. Last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share, up from $0.84 last year. As I mentioned a moment ago, we\u2019re encouraged by the continued momentum in our business. While fourth quarter is a lower demand quarter from a seasonal prospective, we believe a strong fourth quarter can help us make up some of the lost revenue and profit from the third quarter. As such, we\u2019re maintaining our outlook for full year consolidated earnings per share excluding Valspar-related costs of $15 per share at the midpoint of the range. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate Sherwin-Williams core net sales will increase a mid to high single digit percentage compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. In addition, we expect incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition to be approximately $1 billion. At that anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter of 2017 to be in the range of $1.97 to $2.27 per share, including a $0.98 per share charge from costs associated with the Valspar acquisition and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.25 per share from Valspar operations. The increase in Valspar operations includes an acquisition financing expense charge of $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings were $2.15 per share and included a $0.22 per share charge for acquisition-related costs. For the full year 2017, we expect Sherwin-Williams core net sales to increase by mid single digit percentage compared to full year 2016. In addition, we expect incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition to be approximately $2.5 billion in 2017. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2017 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.20 to $11.50 per share compared to the $11.99 per share earned in 2016. Full year 2017 diluted net income per common share guidance includes a $3.21 per share charge from costs associated with the acquisition of Valspar and includes an EPS increase of $0.75 to $0.85 per share from Valspar operations. The increase from Valspar operations includes an acquisition financing expense charge of $0.96 per share for the full year. Full year 2016 earnings per share included an $0.86 per share charge related to the Valspar acquisition. Again, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : It\u2019s difficult to look at the Valspar numbers year-over-year because months of their quarter are different than months your months. Did the Valspar numbers -- did the Valspar volumes and price shrink in the quarter and is that what you expect for the fourth quarter? Can you frame what\u2019s happening in the year-over-year operations of Valspar? Al Mistysyn : Hey, Jeff. This is Al Mistysyn. I would say, the Valspar performance in the quarter is really right where we expected it to be. We had a EPS guidance of $0.50, we came in about $0.49. So, the trend that you saw and the volumes which are holding up fairly well specifically on the Performance Coatings side, continued; and margin pressure that we\u2019ve been under also continued. So, both expected in the quarter and we saw that. In the fourth quarter, certainly, we will see some pickup in our pricing activities as our price actions roll in. We\u2019ll see some of that in our fourth quarter but we\u2019ll see more of that in our first quarter. And with sales being a little bit lower in our fourth quarter, that\u2019s why you see the impact of EPS in our fourth quarter, which we guided to $0.20 versus the $0.49 we saw in the third quarter. Jeff Zekauskas : So, is Valspar growing? Al Mistysyn : They are growing. Volume is growing and what we should expect to see and we\u2019ll guide this in our 2018 guidance is what the impact of the pricing will be in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Couple of accounting questions, if I may. First, you indicated in your press release that the purchase accounting inventory adjustment was a $115 million across June, July and August. Would I be correct in taking two thirds of that figure or 76 to $77 million for the impact in the third quarter? And if so, how would that be allocated among your segments, please? Jane Cronin : Kevin, yes, that would be correct. You could take two thirds of that amount for the third quarter, allocated across the segments would be about $41 million in Performance Coatings in the quarter and about $34 million in Consumer Brands in the quarter. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you for that. And then second, I noticed that you are now expecting incremental D&A related to purchase accounting of $300 million whereas, I think at your investor day, you were closer to $270 million, if my memory is correct. I was wondering if you could comment on what changed in recent weeks? Al Mistysyn : Kevin, really, as we go through the process of the valuation, we are reviewing that really month-to-month to finalize what values are on trademarks, customer lists and that. And what we see in that increase is a little bit of a switch from goodwill to more finite life intangibles. And that\u2019s why you saw the increase. I don\u2019t expect it to change materially going forward, but if it does, we certainly would give you an update. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Could you guys discuss a little bit more on the volume performance in the quarter in your outlook? I was just curious, in paint stores, you have a pretty decent showing versus the last couple of years on Q3. So, do you think that kind of mid single digit growth is sustainable? John Morikis : Yes. We are pretty pleased with the performance of our stores. And if you look at that progress that we have made, we have mentioned this before, our pro business, we\u2019ll grow the pro business in our stores by 0.5 billion in the year. If you back out DIY and Protective & Marine. So, we are feeling pretty good about the momentum that we have in our stores organization. And that does, Arun, take into account also the storm. So, we talked about the momentum that we had going into the storm, we did take a short pause in the period of the storm. And then, as we mentioned, we feel as those pick right back up where we were running. Al Mistysyn : And Arun, what I would add to that, in the fourth quarter, we guided sales mid to high single digits. And as you know, historically, what it tells you is our paint stores group will be in the high end of that range. We will have some price in there from October and November, but you certainly are seeing volume in that forecast as well. Arun Viswanathan : And then, on coating, on Performance Coatings, what\u2019s your expectation on the cadence of margin recovery there? Do you expect these price increases to gain momentum next year? And ultimately, when do you think you can get that segment back to where it should be? John Morikis : Yes. I don\u2019t think we are going to have to wait till the end of the year. Although the largest majority of it will likely come towards the end of the year. We are as we\u2019ve talked before, very determined in our efforts here in. And we are going to start seeing -- we will start to see some of that benefits here in the fourth quarter, largely after the first quarter. There will be some due to some agreements that may lag even into the beginning of the second quarter but the largest part we should see the recovery back in the first quarter of next year. But, we will see some here in the fourth quarter. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Chris Evans : This is Chris Evans on for Bob. I was wondering if you could tell us how pricing shaped up in the third quarter for paint stores group. And then, also in the third quarter, was pricing positive across much of Valspar portfolio? John Morikis : Yes. So, in the price increase for stores, our paint stores realized about a 2.5% effective price increase in the third quarter this past year from the 3.5% -- 3, I\u2019m sorry, 3% to 3.5% price increase effective December 1, 2016. And Chris, we existed the quarter at a slightly higher run rate than that. So, implementation of our October 1st price increase here that we just announced is in progress. And we expect the timing and effectiveness to be similar to the December increase, roughly about nine months with 75% realization. It\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019re obviously experiencing some margin compression across most of our lines in our businesses, which really isn\u2019t unusual in an inflationary cycle, like we\u2019re experiencing, but our pricing philosophy in the other segments is basically the same. When we see raw materials inflate, we pass the increases to the market in the form of these price increases. And the difference in some cases in timing between the businesses, we\u2019re going to work with our customers to pass the raw material costs through in a manner that is least disruptive to their businesses. But, we\u2019re out there working every day, very hard to ensure that our customers are successful, and these discussions are going very well. We\u2019re working with our customers in a way that allows them to absorb that but we also are very firm in our need to get the price increase. Al Mistysyn : Chris, I would just add, on Valspar, as we talked about on our second quarter call, Valspar had knocked out with price in the first half of the year. We talked about the six to nine-month lag that typically occurs in those businesses. And we\u2019re -- as John mentioned, we\u2019re out with price but we saw minimal impact on price in our third quarter as it relates to Valspar. Chris Evans : Great. And maybe just touching on the Consumer Brands a little bit. You mentioned in your paint stores group, DIY volumes were up high single digits. How did they fair out in the Consumer Brands division, maybe specifically in the big box retailer and then any other commentary you could give on how that division shaping up, would be helpful? John Morikis : So, first, to if you look at that business, let\u2019s say a business made up as you would expect of a number of different pieces and parts. And when sales were down, we mentioned that there were a number of elements or drivers behind this softness that we experienced, and so, as you would expect those number of drivers here there are leading the improved performance that we have here, most notably I would say would be our European business. In the past, we\u2019ve talked about that business was down in the high teens through the first half and that declined to mid single digits here in the third quarter. Some of this improvement would clearly be -- we have a more favorable currency comparison, but I\u2019d also say that our order volumes were better in the third quarter than the first half as well. Our national accounts business here, which is the largest customers segment that we have here, those would be the home centers, national hardware, other big box format, was essentially flat year-over-year in the quarter. That would suggest inventory adjustments by some of our larger customers were less prevalent here in this quarter that were just coming through. And while these signs are encouraging, as you would expect, we have higher expectations from our team. And while we are pleased with the momentum, we\u2019ve got confidence in this team, the leadership that we\u2019re going to continue to see momentum, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on, is making our customers more successful what they are trying to do. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess, sticking with the raw material theme, I know it\u2019s early, but can you give us a sense of how your raw material cost basket is tracking for 2018, based on what you know at current? Bob Wells : Ghansham, this is Bob. We normally give the 2018 raw material outlook at the end of the year, simply because our vantage point is better at year-end, and that\u2019s particularly true here and the reason being that as you all know, Hurricane Harvey disrupted a meaningful amount of the global chemical supply sector, and that caused some short-term shortages and tightness in a lot of the feed stocks. The fact of the matter is at this stage, we don\u2019t know what short-term means. And moreover, there are some things we do know. We know that the availability of a lot of the monomers are improving but MMA in particular continues to be tight and is likely to be tight through 2018. We know that the global TiO2 market remained tight and that has facilitated price increase announcements in late second quarter, early third quarter and against the fourth quarter they captured a fair amount of the 2Q, 3Q increase. We\u2019re somewhat skeptical of their ability to capture the fourth quarter, but whatever they capture in second quarter, third quarter, obviously is going to carry into 2018. But the big question is, how much of the impact -- the short-term impact of the storms on the petrochemical sector are going to carry over into 2018 and we just don\u2019t know that yet. We think the raw material basket at this point is tracking year-over-year in about the 6 to 6.5% range. And if you assumed that raw materials were stable from here through 2018, that would put you in the low to mid single digit inflation range. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Bob. And then, just as my second question, the $0.26 you called out for transaction and integration costs for the third quarter; where does that specifically flow through on a segment income basis? And also, at the analyst day, you called out $2.7 billion in EBITDA pro forma for fiscal year 2016, what does that number look like for fiscal year 2017 if you exclude the transaction and integration costs. Al Mistysyn : The impact on the acquisition costs are flowing through admin, which would be about $187 million of that and the rest, the amortization inventory step-up that Jane talked about would be in the Performance Coatings Group and the Consumer Brands Group. When you talk about the EBITDA and looking out, the 2.6, which was the combined entity, if I look at core Sherwin, you\u2019re looking at an EBITDA of over 2 billion, 2.1, 2.2 billion. Valspar, historically has run about a $630 million, so a 2 billion plus the 600 gets you to 2.6. And right now, obviously I think you understand, we\u2019re running little bit behind that for partially here seven years but in 2018 you\u2019d expect us to pick that back up as the price increases that John talked about take effect and as the synergies flow through. And like I said, we\u2019ll give you an update on 2018 synergies on our year-end call. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson : John, you mentioned that you\u2019ve maintained the midpoint of your guidance flat, it\u2019s $15, but obviously that\u2019s after $0.35 hit from the storms in Q3 and I assume some hit in Q4 as well. So, I guess versus where you were on your second quarter call, what\u2019s gone better than expected to offset or more than offset that storm impact? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Don, I think we\u2019d start with the sales momentum we saw in our U.S. and Canada paint stores. As we talked about in July and August -- coming out of July and August, we were running comp stores at 6.7%. As John talked about, coming out of the storms, we see that momentum continue along with the price increase that stores implemented and the effectiveness we are seeing that from October 1st; it\u2019s helping that. And obviously, Don, with the 22% increase on core; that tells you that we are expecting gross margins to improve sequentially third quarter to fourth quarter. So, it really -- that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving our guidance and why we feel strong about it. Don Carson : Okay. Then just to clarify on paint stores group. You said John that price was about 2.5% of that 5.2% same store sales growth. What is it on a year-to-date basis? And how should that price unfold with the second initiative that you had another 3% to 5% increase on October 1st? John Morikis : So, it\u2019s around that 2 to -- maybe speaking of 2.5, Don, but probably closer to 2, and we expect that rollout in this recently announced price increase to be very similar to what we have just experienced. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Couple of questions on Consumer Brands segment. Would you say you have more potential to push price in these legacy Valspar brands than in legacy Sherwin brands? And then, in Lowe\u2019s, what can you offer them to maintain that combined sales base of the Sherwin and Valspar brands? Does it need to be rationalized? And what would you do to avoid a shelf space shift to a competitor? John Morikis : Steve, what we look at constantly is our ability to help our customers meet their goals, as I mentioned earlier. And so, when you ask, what is it that we might do? It\u2019s helping our customers to be more successful. We are having discussions with them on a regular basis, not just Lowe\u2019s but every customer that we have. That\u2019s our path to success, is making our customers successful. Regarding price, we don\u2019t talk about price outside of our own stores. We have discussed the fact that we have clearly seen the raw material basket move and so that we\u2019re out talking with customers in all segments of our business about the need to push pricing in but we are not going to talk about any pricing and any specific customer. But I\u2019m going back to your point of what is that we do with our customers, as Lowe\u2019s or any other customer that we have on that side of the business is to help them be successful. Steve Byrne : And do you have aspirations to penetrate the other big box retailer out there? John Morikis : Well, again, we have discussions with our customers on a regular basis. We are not going to talk about any one customer. But our goal is to clearly understand what our customers\u2019 expectations are. We got terrific brands, products, people and services. And if we can help demonstrate to them an ability to help them reach their goal, then, we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re rewarded. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Chris Parkinson : Can you just talk a little more about the regional housing trends you saw in PSG, especially as it appears some other regions offset some of the September weakness in Texas and the Southeast? And then, you\u2019ve seen a few housing markets with lower short-term availability but some higher prices. Can you just reconcile your own views on home prices versus turn over trends? Thanks. Bob Wells : Yes. Chris, this is Bob. I would say that despite the fact that turnover has been slow due to lack of available inventory, remodeling has been very strong. I mentioned at our financial community presentation that as much as 20% of the residential repaint has historically been driven by existing home turnover. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at this point in this cycle. We think a higher share, the remodeling activity is being done by stay in place home owners and driven at least in part by rapidly rising home equity. While we would like to see more inventory available, we would like to see stronger turn over, it doesn\u2019t seem to be dampening the rate of residential remodel and repaint activity. On the new residential side, it\u2019s been a really pretty strong story, despite the fact that there are constraints to the market in labor and land availability. Single family starts are up about 9% year-to-date and completions are up a little more than that, new homes sales are up high single digits and home builder orders at least as of the second quarter were into the double digits. So, the new residential market of which we have substantial share is driving significant growth. Even in non-residential and I know you didn\u2019t ask about that but non-residential, we\u2019ve been seeing mid to upper single digit growth in starts, in square footage under construction and a little stronger than that in completions. So, all of the drivers of our paint stores group pro business appear to be, I wouldn\u2019t say firing on all cylinders but certainly strong enough to drive the kind of volume growth that we\u2019re seeing. Chris Parkinson : Great and just a quick follow-up. There has recently been a little more optimism within some, let\u2019s say, key general industrial parallels within the legacy Val portfolio. Have you actually seen some improvements or would you just characterize yourselves as still cautiously optimistic? Thank you. John Morikis : Are you talking about the Valspar general industrial? Chris Parkinson : Correct. John Morikis : Yes. I would say, we\u2019re very positive. Our team -- our leaders that lead that team have really been very bullish about, not only the core Valspar business but the sales synergies of those two business coming together are really exciting. So, yes, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re feeling bullish. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thanks. Maybe just following up on that and just looking at the Performance Coatings Group, your Sherwin profit was down a lot this quarter and your sales aren\u2019t growing as fast as they\u2019re obviously at Valspar. So, you talked about the synergies between the two business and some issue there, but what\u2019s it going to take to get the margins in better shape, assuming a lot of that\u2019s raw materials? John Morikis : Yes. It is raw material. And so, pricing is going to be an issue. If you look at our year-to-date margins, they are much more respectable. We had some pressure in the third quarter. And as we talked about, while we don\u2019t call out specifics with any specific customers, I would tell you that this is an area where our raw materials have moved and we\u2019re out talking to our customers to get the increase. But as Al mentioned earlier, I think it was Jeff Zekauskas\u2019 question regarding volume of the Valspar and our core business. Our volume in this business is very good, it\u2019d be a different story, if we had volumes stream in the other way, but we\u2019ve got volume. We just need to be able to get the price to offset the raw materials and we\u2019re feeling good about our ability to do that. As I mentioned, the discussions have largely taken place; it\u2019s a matter of timing before we start to receive it. Vincent Andrews : And then, maybe just on -- and it\u2019s small for both companies, but the auto refinish business there\u2019s been some noise out there amongst the competitive set, just challenges with distributors and pricing issues, is there anything unusual going on in your business, related [ph] to that business core? John Morikis : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t call that out in any negative way at all. We\u2019re out having pricing decisions there, we\u2019re working hard again to help our customers be successful. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I\u2019d call out that\u2019s unique about that business right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : In the paint stores group, if I take your 6.5% number for July and August, and then look at the overall performance for the quarter. It looks like September may have been 2 to 3% same store sales growth month overall. Is that about right and can you walk through what those same store sales numbers look like across the different U.S. regions or North American regions, in the month of September? John Morikis : I\u2019d say directionally, you\u2019re heading in the right direction. And I don\u2019t know that we give specific numbers by region, Mike. But, I\u2019d say that if you back out the storms, our Southeast, Southwest divisions have really been lighting it up and little bit of competition between the two of those to see who can lead the race, but all of our divisions including Canada, all of them are doing very well. Look at the progress that we\u2019re making. We talked about this last year when we were coming out of the second quarter that we were really focusing on new account activity and on share of wallet penetration. And I know we talked about this when we were together that that\u2019s really been a focus. And we are absolutely witnessing the benefit of this program. Our leadership teams there and our teams in the field are really executing, and we\u2019re feeling really good. So, I wouldn\u2019t call out any one division as lagging outside of the storm impact. Mike Harrison : All right. And then you mentioned the residential repaint business up double digits. Does this mean that contractors have been able to add some labor and expand their capacity during the high season? And then, what does that mean for the same store sales growth as get into the low season or the slower season where we have kind of seen better same store sales growth over the past couple of years in the Q4, Q1 quarters? Thank you. John Morikis : So, the momentum that you\u2019ve talked about, I believe this will be the 15th quarter of double digit gains in the residential repaint. And so, we are continuing to capture we believe a little more than our share. I lost the last part of your question though... Bob Wells : On the lower ends of our sales curve. So, Mike, I think what you\u2019re going to see is that you saw it in our first quarter, we had a 7.5% comp on top of a 9.4% comp in the first quarter of 2016. And as our guidance suggests, mid to high single digits will tell you that our U.S. paint stores have to be in the high end of that range on top of 5.5% comp last year. So, we definitely are seeing higher percentage increases in our off quarters, if you will. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : As we model the cash flow, the capital spending was only $60 million in the quarter that annualizes I think to a much lower rate than either pro forma or regular target is on an annual basis. Could you comment about why it was so low and maybe what the next couple of quarters look like or next year? Al Mistysyn : John, I think our CapEx for this year will be about $200 million to $210 million. What you see is, it is a little bit lower run rate. As we get to the facilities and understand more about what they are doing, their capacity utilizations, we have talked about having capacity utilization, architectural in the Valspar sites. So, you won\u2019t see us spending capital for capacity expansion that maybe we have over the last few quarters. I would say, we are really working on 2018\u2019s plan and we will give you an update at our year-end call. But, I still think we are going to be in the target of 1.6% to 2% is still a good target. And like I said, we are working on the 2018 plan and we will give you an update. John Roberts : And then, in the back in the reconciling slide, you got the operating segment comparison and Valspar coatings was up 8.5% year-over-year in there, something must have been up double digit, now was packaging coating or coil coatings in major areas, up double digit in that Valspar coating segment? Al Mistysyn : Yes. We saw some nice progress in general industrial, John talked about the bullish outlook we saw, also some nice movement in our industrial wood business, and that\u2019s specifically in Asia. So, yes, across the board, we saw increases but those would be the ones that kind of led the way. John Morikis : Yes. I\u2019d say, the wood business was certainly strong in Asia, but having just spent some time with our wood team at the market here, I would say we are starting to see some nice progress in number of parts of the world, not only Asia. We have some good momentum there. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Scott Rednor : I wanted to ask about DIY within the stores. I think you called out high single digits, John, and I think that\u2019s the strongest DIY number you turned in four or five quarters. So, is there anything unique there or just curious f you could elaborate? John Morikis : Scott, actually, if you look at the performance that we had in DIY throughout -- actually through 2016, we are in the mid single digits throughout the quarter. First quarter this year, we were up mid single digits. It was actually the second quarter of this year, we are actually flat, second quarter, and then as you mentioned here in the third quarter, high single digits. Some interesting parts there, we\u2019re always trying to keep our fingers on the pulse to know exactly how the consumers acting and why. And I wish I was smart enough to know exactly why they are but we do know that there are some economic factors that might drive home owners to hire a painting contractor. We talked about those. Those could be driving the same thought process and to driving consumers into a specialty paint store where they want a high quality finish, and they may not want to reach all the way down to painting contractor to do the work but they want to try to get as close to the finish as possible, and so they are turning to a specialty store like ours, where the quality of products and services will help them reach that. Bob Wells : And Scott I would just add to that that the real difference between the mid single digit growth that we saw all last year and the upper single digit growth we saw in the third quarter was price. Volume growth was pretty consistent. Scott Rednor : And Bob, just also on the P&M that flows through the paint stores, is that now trending positively? Bob Wells : Yes, it actually is. In fact, we commented that we\u2019ve seen that business go positive early in the year, in the first and second quarter. It continues to show -- to build momentum through the third quarter. Our third quarter was stronger than second quarter. We credit that to both our success in as we called it pivoting to key markets that are showing growth like bridge and highway, water and waste water and some of the others, and improving conditions in the end markets that have been in steep decline, particularly oil and gas. And I should point out that our Protective & Marine business was also positive in Latin America in the third quarter. Scott Rednor : And then, just quickly, Al what are you taxing the amortization and integration cost at? I assume it\u2019s a little bit higher than the tax rate across entity. Al Mistysyn : Yes. It\u2019s about 30%. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn : All my questions have been answered, but you guys have expanded your presence outside of the U.S. So, maybe it\u2019s worth revisiting, what the foreign exchange impact has been on the revenue, both in the Latin American Group as well as in the Consumer Brands and in the Performance Coatings. I\u2019m assuming there is not much change in the Canadian dollars, so this shouldn\u2019t be much of an impact in the paint store group. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Dmitry, you\u2019re correct. It\u2019s very -- it\u2019s minimal across tag. It\u2019s really basically flat or not -- no impact on Latin America and we had a 1.5% tailwind in Performance Coatings. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. So that\u2019s helpful. And in the consumer group it was also flattish? Al Mistysyn : Yes, really no impact. Dmitry Silversteyn : Because I know you picked up some Australian and Chinese and UK business with Valspar\u2026 Al Mistysyn : Yes. The impact on Consumer Brands was really related to the devaluation of the pound related to Brexit, and we\u2019ve annualized that. So, in the quarter, there has really been no impact on Consumer Brands. Dmitry Silversteyn : Got it. Okay. If you look at your Latin American profitability, it\u2019s kind of been all over the place. And I\u2019m just wondering in both in interest of understanding what\u2019s going on in the business and then sort of forward forecasting. How much of that profit variability has been a function of volatile foreign exchange where you just -- you price a product and then the currency moves on you or how much of it has been sort of either difficulty in growing the business or perhaps raw material inflation that was outsized for some period? There just doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of reason to the quarterly performance on the margin side of that business. John Morikis : Yes, Dmitry. It\u2019s largely to your point than impacted by the raw material costs. We\u2019ve had TiO2 coming in from Asia that has spiked up. So, when you would expect to have some benefit, maybe from FX standpoint, you get the impact of rising raw material costs coming into the market as all products coming in there for the most part have come in at a higher price this year. So that\u2019s largely been in the impact. Dmitry Silversteyn : So, if I\u2019m looking at sort of the profitability of that business quarter to quarter, you seem to put up kind of positive profit margin for most quarters but then we had a big 9% decline or so, or my math\u2019s -- a negative margin in the second quarter of this year, which correspond to about a 7% decline or 7% negative margin in the second quarter of last year. So, is that just a second quarter thing that you would put up a negative margin within a good year? Al Mistysyn : No, we don\u2019t\u2026 John Morikis : We don\u2019t allow negative things\u2026 Al Mistysyn : No, I think Dmitry, you definitely -- as specifically Brazil, which is over half of our business and the economic issues they\u2019ve had, as that continues to get better, we will see choppiness in our quarters. But, our expectation is that we will continue to improve over the midterm certainly and get the business back to profitability on a more consistent basis, so you don\u2019t see these quarter to quarter swings. Dmitry Silversteyn : Got it, got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, final question on the -- I know you guys can\u2019t talk about it explicitly, but PPG did say on their call that they\u2019re working with their big box partners to try to move pricing, given what\u2019s going on with raw materials now for the second year in a row. Is that something that you -- I\u2019m assuming you have the same initiative and we should start thinking about perhaps a little bit of a positive price in the DIY channel, not just Company-owned stores? John Morikis : Dmitry, I\u2019ve broadened it across the entire Company. I\u2019ve tried to be very clear with this that it\u2019s a very good question and one that we\u2019ve tried to be as open as possible. And that is that we try every day to bring value to our customers. And when the raw material basket has moved like it has, we\u2019re in front of our customers talking about the need to stay whole in that, and that\u2019s across all customers, all segments. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : In terms of 2017, you gave us core EPS with Valspar and on [indiscernible] $16.57, your guidance to midpoint 15, what does that imply for EPS with Valspar in a whole for 2017? Al Mistysyn : If I understood, Mike, you\u2019re talking about our full year guidance at $15 with Valspar. Valspar will contribute about $0.80 to that and the guidance, and then that tells you that our core or legacy Sherwin EPS at $14.20 would be up 10.5% compared to last year\u2019s $12.85, if I answered your question correctly. Mike Sison : Just relative to the $16.57, which you gave at the analyst day, which is annualizing Valspar for the full year, what does that number equate to for 2017, based on your $15 guidance? Al Mistysyn : It\u2019s very hard to give you that number based on guidance when you\u2019re talking about all the puts and takes and the impact that Valspar has on pricing and the raw material inflation. So, what I would tell you Mike is that we\u2019ll give you an update for the full year 2018 with Valspar and we can kind of give you an impact certainly, the interest expense on the new debt impact. So, it\u2019s hard to get a comparable 2017 versus 2016. Mike Sison : Okay. And then, just a quick question on October price increases. Does that cover potential inflation that you may see in 2018? John Morikis : Well, it\u2019s certainly based on what we believe to protect us through 2018 but we are as determined as we can get it right, but we don\u2019t necessarily always know the future. I would say that we don\u2019t feel as we\u2019re in a similar market to what we experienced in 2010 through 2012 where if you recall, we were out with six price increases in 22 months. So, we are going in with what we believe will cover us. But, I think we have demonstrated through our past practices convection and determination to protect our shareholders. Bob Wells : I do think it\u2019s also important to point out that we were out communicating about our October 1st price increase with our customers before Hurricane Harvey made landfall. So, the impact on the petrochemical sector of the hurricanes that hit at the end of August and early September were not contemplated in that price increase. But, as I indicated earlier, we think a lot of that -- the cost increases as a result will be short-term in nature and we will just have to see how 2018 unfolds. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Mushkin : A lot of my questions actually have been answered but I wanted to broaden out a little bit. At the analyst day, you guys were really pretty bullish about the outlook and I just wanted to [indiscernible] obviously took place a long ago. But I just want to see kind of gauge or temperature about a month later and still feeling it\u2019s bullish in general about your business and the outlook going forward. And I suspect maybe answer is yes. And then, as you look at it and again over the next year or two as you bring these two companies together, what\u2019s your biggest concern both, from a macro perspective and then also internally to the things we trip up. So, two-part question here. John Morikis : Scott, so, I would say, nothing has changed about our view of the world. Any bullishness that you felt continues and we feel -- I would say this way that we are more bullish than ever on this deal from both the strategic standpoint and from a synergy standpoint. This transaction is value-creating on many levels. And we are thrilled with where we are. We are thrilled with the people. We are thrilled with the products. And most importantly, we are thrilled with the customers. So, we are very excited about where we are and where we are going. The second part of your question was concerns and what might\u2026 Scott Mushkin : Not even specific to deal, the outlook looks really bullish on the deal. As you guys look out, what do you worry about though? Is it cost inflation that\u2019s your biggest worry? I guess, I\u2019m just trying to -- both Valspar in mind but also in general. John Morikis : Cost is something that we deal with. We don\u2019t like to deal with it. But, as I just mentioned on our last call that I think we have demonstrated an ability to put price in where we have to. I would say, the macro shock to the economy or some disruption of some sort that would really impact the economy on a larger scale. But right now, if you would speak to any leader inside our company, we have got a strong line of where we are going, what we are trying to do and a lot of determination to be able to do it. And that gives us confidence that we control our future and we are focused on executing to be able to win. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. PJ Juvekar : We know that the DIY market is weak. Are the big boxes trying to getting more contractors in the stores and are you seeing more competition from that side? And then, you talked about the shortage of contractors in the U.S. for last couple of years. Are you guys doing anything proactively to address that issue? John Morikis : So, I would say, first, your question about the home centers activity and to the pro business, I would say that that\u2019s always been an element of the market and one that we respect. I would say that with our customers and the focus that they have on sub-segment of that pro business where we can help them, we are determined to help them do that. In many cases, those are remodelers that are no typically in our stores and if we can help our customers to grow that business, we want to try to help them. Bob Wells : On the labor shortage. John Morikis : On the labor shortage, it\u2019s interesting, the largest percentage of the business that feels the labor restriction is in the new residential, commercial and industrial business. Some in the residential repaint but again given our 15 quarters of double-digit gains, I would say that many of our customers are finding a way to find the labor that they need. In those other areas, while we\u2019ve been working with a number of areas to try to generate more supply of labor, the reality is, is that if in fact we were successful and we could find painting contactors or labors that could help our painting contractors. In many cases, they would still be on the job waiting, waiting for the drywallers to finish, the roofers to finish, I mean electrical, it\u2019s a much more macro issue than just the painting contractors themselves, the much larger issue. And so, while we\u2019re trying to help in a meaningful way, it\u2019s a bigger issue than just the painting contractors. Bob Wells : I would add to that that for decades, we\u2019ve been helping contractors with labor issues by creating products that make them more productive. And it has been the focus of our R&D effort for a long time, is to get contractors on and off the job faster; that also helps in cycles where they are labor constrained. Using more productive products and formulas can help them do more jobs in less time. John Morikis : As well as less of a requirement to come back, touch up better or be more consistent in what they are trying to do to help them get off the job quicker as well. So efficiency and stay off the job. So, it\u2019s good point, Bob. PJ Juvekar : Thank you with that. And just lastly, how much benefit could you possibly see in 2018, from all the reconstruction that would take place in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, which are all your core markets? John Morikis : It\u2019s really hard to quantify that. Different types of storms and different areas were affected in different ways. In Florida, while we really took a substantial hit in the number of stores that were closed, there was some flooding. In some areas, we don\u2019t want to minimize this at all; our hearts go out to those that are affected by the storm. Fortunately, many of the areas were impacted with some water damage that could be fixed relatively quickly and then there were others that were significantly and more horrifically damaged. And those will be a longer term cycles to get back up. In Texas and in Puerto Rico, there was more damage. A smaller market, while those areas will build themselves back up and we want to help those communities, our employees and those that live in that area. It\u2019s not going to be significant enough to move the needle. And so, we\u2019re going to be there to help in any way we can but we don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to really drive our results. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard : Thank you. On the consumer segment, I appreciate the progress and growth results in 3Q relative to Q2. But thinking about the path forward for growth in that business and I heard the comment on some efforts on price but what are you doing and what should we be thinking about in regards to the growth out of that piece of the business? John Morikis : Yes. So, Eric, as you would expect, we\u2019re engaged with our customers; that\u2019s not something that we lay out typically in a call like this. What you should expect is that those discussions take place regularly. We\u2019ve got we believe terrific assortment of technologies, people and service to help our customers win but from a strategic standpoint, we don\u2019t want to lay those out here today. Eric Bosshard : In terms of the destination with growth, is there is a goal or\u2026 John Morikis : Eric, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t hear you. Eric Bosshard : Yes, sorry. In terms of the destination with growth in that business, can you give us a little bit more there? I understand the strategic piece of it, but in terms of like what growth out of that business are you looking to get back on a sustainable basis? John Morikis : Yes. I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve spoken that that business could be a low single digit growth run for us and we feel we can capture that. And quite frankly, talking to our teams our expectations are going to be higher than that. But we feel as though there\u2019s a lot that we can bring there. And we\u2019re really excited about the combined company and the assets, brands. There\u2019s a lot that we can accomplish we think. There\u2019s a lot of institutional knowledge on both sides of our company now coming together that we\u2019re going to try to leverage. Eric Bosshard : But then secondly and you talked about a bit but just that level of conviction on improving the Performance Coating margin through pricing. Again, I know you\u2019ve only had the Valspar piece of the business for a period of time, but the confidence level of being able to make that happen as we go into 2018, where do you stand on that? John Morikis : I\u2019m not sure how to convey the conviction or confidence any higher than -- we\u2019re going to get that Eric. We\u2019re out there having those discussions right now. We don\u2019t expect ever to just have something that we don\u2019t deserve. We\u2019re working hard. We\u2019re working hard to improve the quality, the availability, service, people, every element of our job there. And those discussions have taken place in many cases and it\u2019s the matter of timing. There are some that continue in dialogue and discussions but the largest part, those discussions have been resolved. And as I mentioned, you should start to see some of that in the fourth quarter. But, the lion\u2019s share of it come in as we turn the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : I was wondering if you could talk about the trend in architectural paint and other businesses you have in China following as a five-year big meeting by the heads of the country. John Morikis : So, we feel as though in China, we have a terrific platform to continue to grow and perhaps even better leverage. We do feel as though the technology, as I just mentioned and I think that discussion may have taken as a more North American focused discussion. But, when we\u2019re looking at this consumer business where we talk about all the markets that we participate in now, so when you look at that market and the brand that we believe can be better leveraged, we are excited about supplying not only the technology that exists in our combined company around the world but there is a lot of institutional knowledge that we want to bring to that market as well and to take advantage of the opportunity that exist in the market. Our market share there, I\u2019ll just say, there are plenty of opportunities for us. So, we are working with our team to identify those assets that exist inside the Company that can help them better perform in the market. Rosemarie Morbelli : And then looking at investor day, you increased the synergy level. And as you look at Valspar more closely, what is the likelihood that we will see one more bump in that particular projection? And will it take until the end of 2018 or do you think that you are getting your arms around all of the manufacturing facilities and what you can do or we could actually see it before year end? Al Mistysyn : For the full year, let me just start that -- we talked about seeing about $15 million going through our P&L and we haven\u2019t come off that forecast. However, what you saw is increase in our forecast for cost to achieve synergies in 2017, which as John talked about it in his comments was the result of some facility closings we announced in our third quarter. We really won\u2019t see the benefit of those until late next year or early to 2019. But I would tell you we are going to increase our expected annual run rate synergies at least for this year to $160 million versus 106 that we had talked at the end of our second quarter. Your are probably going to have to wait until our year-end call to get an update on the $280 million run rate synergy that we talked about at the financial community presentation. Rosemarie Morbelli : And then, lastly, if I may. Could you help me allocate the charges between cost of goods and SG&A as a [indiscernible] going into the different segments or an EPS basis? Al Mistysyn : So, if you look at the cost to achieve and the acquisition or purchase accounting cost, you would see in the third quarter about $87 million of that was in gross profit, primarily related to the inventory step-up. And then, you saw the rest of it or about $119 million, $120 million in SG&A related primarily to the amortization expense on the intangibles. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So, I would like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Bob Wells : Thank you, Jessie. As always, I will be available over the next few days to answer any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning\u2019s call. If you\u2019d like to be placed in the queue for a follow-up call, please call Kristy Johnson at 216-566-3001, and she will add you to the callback queue. Again that number is 216-566-3001. I\u2019d like to thank you again for joining us today and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells. Bob Wells : Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. In the interest of time, we\u2019ve provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information, including a slide deck with a breakdown of our results by our new reportable segments, on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, January 25 press release. Beginning with our fourth quarter. Consolidated sales increased $1.2 billion, or 43%, to $3.98 billion. Excluding Valspar revenues, core consolidated sales increased 6.9% in the quarter. For the full year, consolidated sales increased $3.13 billion, or 26.4%, to $14.98 billion. Excluding Valspar, core consolidated sales for the year increased 5.6%. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the fourth quarter increased $410.2 million, or 29.5%, to $1.8 billion. Gross profit for the year increased $858.5 million, or 14.5%, to $6.78 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter was 45.2% compared to 49.9% in the same period last year. For the year, consolidated gross margin decreased to 45.3% from 50% last year. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $284.4 million, or 27.4%, to $1.32 billion in the fourth quarter but decreased as a percent of sales to 33.3% from 37.3% in the same quarter last year. For the year, SG&A expense increased $650.9 million, or 15.7%, to $4.79 billion and decreased as a percent of sales to 31.9% from 34.9% in 2016. Interest expense for the quarter increased $46.1 million to $89.5 million. For the year, interest expense increased $109.4 million to $263.5 million. The increase was entirely due to acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before tax in the fourth quarter decreased $19.1 million, or 6.3%, to $284.9 million. For the full year, consolidated profit before tax decreased $67 million, or 4.2%, to $1.53 billion. Our effective income tax rate on core operations for the quarter and year, excluding a deferred tax liability adjustment, would have been 27.8% and 26.9%, respectively. We expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2018 to be in the low to mid-20s. Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter increased to $9.39 per share from $2.15 last year. The $9.39 EPS includes a onetime benefit of $7 per share from deferred income tax reductions; $0.77 per share in acquisition-related expenses, including inventory step-up and purchase accounting amortization; and income of $0.21 per share, net of incremental interest expense from Valspar operations. Diluted net income per common share for the full year increased 55.7% to $18.67 per share from $11.99 per share in 2016. The $18.67 includes the onetime tax benefit, $3 per share in acquisition-related expenses, including inventory step-up and purchase accounting amortization; and income of $0.80 per share, net of incremental interest expense from Valspar operations. We have summarized the fourth quarter and full year earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our fourth quarter 2017 press release. Let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment. Sales for The Americas Group in the fourth quarter increased $178.1 million, or 8.9%, to $2.19 billion. For the year, net sales increased $740.2 million, or 8.8%, to $9.12 billion. Sales in the Latin America region, stated in U.S. dollars, increased slightly in the quarter and 4.5% in the year. Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 8.2% in the quarter and 6.3% in the year. Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Canada division led all divisions, followed by Southwestern division, Southeastern division, Eastern division and Midwestern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. Fourth quarter segment profit increased $71.9 million, or 21.5%, to $406 million. For the full year, profit increased $164.1 million, or 10.2%, to $1.77 billion. Segment operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 190 basis points to 18.5% from 16.6% last year. The Americas Group operating margin for full year 2017 increased 30 basis points to 19.4% from 19.1% last year. Turning now to the Consumer Brands Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased $269.4 million, or 89.1%, to $571.6 million. For the year, Consumer Brands Group sales increased $627.2 million, or 41.1%, to $2.15 billion. Excluding sales from Valspar, core sales for the group decreased 6.8% in the quarter and decreased 8.4% in the year. Segment profit for the Consumer Brands Group in the fourth quarter decreased $27.2 million, or 53.6%, to $23.6 million. For the full year, segment profit decreased $75 million, or 25%, to $226 million. Excluding Valspar, core segment profit for the group decreased 29.4% in the quarter and decreased 13% in the year. Segment profit as a percent of net sales for the quarter decreased to 4.1% from 16.8% last year. For the year, segment operating margin decreased to 10.5% from 19.7% last year. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group decreased 410 basis points in the quarter and decreased 100 basis points in the year to 12.7% and 18.7%, respectively. For our Performance Coatings Group, fourth quarter net sales in U.S. dollars increased $749.5 million, or 159.9%, to $1.22 billion. Full year sales increased $1.76 billion, or 90.5%, to $3.71 billion. Excluding sales from Valspar, core sales for the group increased 7.6% in the quarter and increased 3% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Performance Coatings Group segment profit in the fourth quarter increased $53.3 million, or 80.6%, to $119.4 million from $66.1 million last year. For the year, segment profit increased $41.3 million, or 16.1%, to $298.5 million. Excluding Valspar, core segment profit increased 7% in the quarter and decreased 2.6% in the year. Currency translation rate changes increased segment profit $6.3 million in the quarter and $8.7 million in the year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 9.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 14.1% last year. Operating margin for the year decreased to 8.1% compared to 13.2% in 2016. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group was flat in the quarter and decreased 70 basis points for the year compared to 2016. That concludes our review of operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, so let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2018. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Fourth quarter was a solid finish to our year. Excluding Valspar results, our core consolidated sales grew nearly 7% in the quarter. Consolidated gross margin expanded 10 basis points. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 110 basis points, and core consolidated operating income improved 19.7%, all compared to fourth quarter 2016. As expected, the Valspar business added a little more than $1 billion to net sales in the quarter. And while we still have work to do to restore Valspar's profitability, we are making good progress on integration, value capture and pricing to offset raw material inflation. I'll come back to that in a moment. With all the acquisition-related noise in the full year consolidated results that Bob just walked through, it's difficult to see the underlying performance of the core business. If you back out the impacts from Valspar, consolidated sales for the year increased 5.6% to $12.5 billion. Consolidated gross margin on the core business was 49.2%, 80 basis points below our all-time high of 50% in 2016. Operating profit improved 6% to $1.92 billion. Profit before tax grew 6.5% to $1.84 billion. EBITDA increased 5.8% to $2.12 billion. And comparable earnings per share increased 11.1% to $14.27 per share. Sales to our U.S. and Canadian stores rebounded very quickly following hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with every customer segment generating positive volumes in the quarter. Contractor business in total accelerated to a high single-digit growth rate in the fourth quarter, aided by a backlog of projects from early i n the year and positive pricing. Sales to residential repaint contractors grew at a double-digit pace, marking the 15th quarter of double-digit growth in the past 17 quarters. Sales of protective and marine coatings in the U.S. and Canada also grew double digits in the quarter for the first time in many years. Paint's operating margin on incremental sales in the quarter exceeded 40%, with earnings leverage coming from both gross margin and SG&A. PBT margin for the group rose by more than 200 basis points compared to fourth quarter last year. The Americas Group opened 40 net new stores in the quarter, bringing our full year store opening total to 100 net new locations and our total store count at year-end to 4,620 stores in The Americas. We remain confident that our next milestone of 5,000 locations in North America alone is realistic, and we intend to add another 100 to 110 stores in The Americas this year. Our Consumer Brands Group's financial results for the quarter and year fell well short of our expectations, likely due in part to a segment domestic DIY market demand and inventory adjustments by several retail customers. But this team made impressive progress during the year on rightsizing and aligning sales and marketing teams, integrating two complex brand portfolios and initiating multiple supply chain optimization projects, all while maintaining strong customer relationships and managing operating expenses. All of these efforts have positioned this team well for the year ahead, and our expectations for this group remain high. Performance Coatings Group also made good progress throughout the year on a wide range of integration and value-capture projects. Sales volumes for the group accelerated in the fourth quarter across both the legacy Sherwin-Williams and Valspar product lines, and operating margins showed modest sequential improvement. Our efforts to implement price increases, sufficient to offset persistent raw material inflation, continue. And we expect to see noticeable progress on this front in the first half of 2018. 2017 was a strong year in terms of cash generation. Net operating cash for the year was $1.88 billion, an increase of more than $575 million compared to 2016 and greater than 12% of sales. Free cash flow, which we define as net operating cash, less CapEx and dividends, was $1.34 billion compared to $757.5 million last year. On December 31, the company had $204.2 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to reduce debt and fund operations. During the year, we paid $319 million in cash dividends and retired over $1 billion in debt. The balance sheet reflects preliminary purchase accounting balances and incremental debt of approximately $8.57 billion used to fund the acquisition. Our capital expenditures for the year totaled $223 million. Depreciation was $285 million, and amortization of intangibles and inventory step-up was $261.7 million. In 2018, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $330 million, which is about 1.9% of anticipated sales, as we continue to invest in productivity improvements, systems and new stores. Depreciation should be $280 million to $290 million, and amortization will be about $350 million. We made no open-market purchases of our common stock for Treasury during the quarter and year. However, we do intend to resume opportunistic purchases of company stock in 2018 at a level sufficient to offset dilution from options exercises. On December 31, we had remaining authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. Next month, at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend a quarterly dividend of $0.86 per share, up from $0.85 last year. Before I get to our outlook for 2018, I'd like to comment on our progress on the Valspar integration. When we announced the deal back in March of 2016, we estimated annual run rate synergies by the end of year one to be about $106 million. At the close of the third quarter 2017, we raised the target to $160 million. Our actual full year synergy run rate at the end of 2017 was approximately $230 million, and we are raising our 2018 year-end run rate target to $320 million, up from our prior target of $280 million. In short, we are moving faster on more projects than originally anticipated. To date, we've completed or approved 497 integration projects, and we've identified another 147 projects that are currently being verified. New opportunities are being added to the list with each passing week. On SG&A, we've made great progress in organizational design and optimization, including aligning compensation and benefits programs, IT systems and marketing and promotional programs, to name a few. In cost of goods, we've identified opportunities for raw material cost leveling, purchase optimization and reformulation. Our leveling initiatives are active at every region of the world, and we're off to a good start on many optimization and reformulation projects, including in-house development and production of an acrylic polymer for use in some high-value product line. In manufacturing and distribution, our focus has been on optimizing our North American architectural manufacturing footprint. Projects are underway in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and West Coast regions. Logistics is also an opportunity, and we're benefiting from reduced freight costs by synchronizing distribution routes between Sherwin and Valspar facilities. Revenue synergies are, perhaps, the greatest long-term opportunity. One example from Performance Coatings Group is the ability to leverage our legacy North American blending facilities to provide color matching on smallbatch production of some key Valspar industrial products, one example being coating for metal extrusion customers. The ability to run high volume and smallbatch jobs is helping us to expand our share of wallet with existing accounts and attract new ones. We expect to book most of the remaining costs to achieve these synergies in 2018, and we're increasingly confident in our long-term annual run rate range of $385 million to $450 million. With good sales and volume momentum coming out of the fourth quarter, we anticipate first quarter consolidated net sales will increase a mid to high single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2017. In addition, we expect incremental sales from Valspar to be approximately $1 billion in the first quarter. Due to the increased uncertainty in forecasting the exact timing of synergies and integration expenses, we've elected to suspend quarterly earnings per share guidance for the foreseeable future. For the full year 2018, we also expect core net sales to increase a mid to high single-digit percentage compared to full year 2017. In addition, we expect incremental sales from Valspar in the first five months of 2018 to add approximately $1.6 billion to consolidated revenues. But our earnings outlook is tempered somewhat by persistent industry-wide raw material cost inflation, likely to be up in the 4% to 6% range for the industry in 2018, possibly even higher in the first half. With these factors in mind, we anticipate diluted net income per common share for 2018 will be in the range of $15.35 to $15.85 per share compared to $18.67 per share earned in 2017. As a result of recently announced tax reform, we expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be in the low to mid 20% range. Full year 2018 earnings per share includes, costs related to the acquisition of Valspar totaling approximately $3.45 per share. Finally, last Monday after the market closed, we announced a leadership change in The Americas Group as Jay Davisson, after a very successful career with our company, including the past seven years serving as the President of The Americas Group, has made the decision to retire from Sherwin-Williams. I want to publicly thank Jay for his service and contribution and wish Jay and his family the very best. As you've come to expect from our company, we have a very thoughtful and robust succession planning process, and we're blessed with a strong pipeline of leadership talent. To that end, we're announcing Pete Ippolito as our new President of The Americas Group. Pete, who is a 30-year veteran of Sherwin-Williams, comes to this role well prepared, having successfully served in leadership roles in our industrial business, our architectural business and our global business. Since 2010, he has held the position of President and General Manager of the Midwestern division in The Americas Group. Pete brings vast experience and intimate knowledge of our business to this role as well as an outstanding track record of developing talent and delivering outstanding financial results. We're excited that Pete take the range of The Americas Group and expect a seamless transition. Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi, guys. Good morning. John Morikis : Good morning, Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi : Morning. First off, on the mid to high single-digit core sales growth for 2018, can you break that down across your operating segments? Clearly, it's led by Paint Stores Group, but what about volume expectations more broadly for consumer and Performance Coatings as well? Allen Mistysyn : Sure, Ghansham. This is Al Mistysyn. I would start by talking about U.S. and Canada stores continue to be the primary driver of our sales growth. And in the past, as we've talked about guidance, we've always talked about that group being in the high end of our guidance. So you expect them to be in the high end of that mid to high single-digits. As you know, we announced the 3% to 5% price increase effective October 1. And through the first four months of that, we're seeing effectiveness that's similar to what that we've seen in the price increase in December. From a volume standpoint, I think, across the company, we're going to see low single-digit volumes across each of the groups and, I would say even in consumer. I think we're optimistic about consumer coming off a pretty soft year. We have better comparables. We have some good momentum in different pieces of our business, and we do expect to turn around there. And then, I think, price should be approximately 2%. And then the last thing would be, FX really has no impact on sales planned. Ghansham, while we're talking about guidance, I'd like to talk about our EPS guidance also. So the midpoint of our core EPS guidance is an increase of 20% versus - excluding acquisition-related costs versus pro forma full year 2017 results. In 2018, we're seeing incremental raw material inflation. Our interest expense is increasing on the Valspar acquisition debt and on our core Sherwin debt as we've increased our liquidity sources. We're more than offsetting these headwinds with incremental synergies of $140 million to $160 million expected to come into our P&L, a reduction in the effective tax rate that we talked about on the prepared comments, but we're taking an opportunity here to take a portion of those savings and reinvest them back in our business for future growth. We'll take the same robust and prudent approach to investments that we do with - through our normal operations, but we do believe it's an opportunity to help accelerate our growth going into the future. And I believe this puts us on a path to achieving the 2020 financial target that we set at the investor community. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, that's helpful. And just a second question, can you just give us more granularity on raw material pricing? Which raw materials are you seeing the most incremental inflation within? I think, last quarter, you pointed towards low to mid single-digit raw material inflation. Now kind of 4 to 6. Just some more granularity on what's driving that? Thanks so much. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Ghansham. Last year, the story was a little simpler because most of the inflation was behind TiO2. This year, we expect pressure across multiple raw material categories. Crude oil is up 55% to 60% year-over-year. A January spike in propylene pricing due to supply constraints has been in the $0.05 to $0.08 per pound. We expect additional risk to propylene in February. This takes a little while to work its way through the acrylic chain, but it's already affecting product categories like solvents and packaging. We do also expect continued TiO2 supply constraint, and it's resulted in our first quarter 2018 price announcement or price nomination by all the global producers. Higher year-over-year - high-density poly propylene pricing is already affecting our packaging costs. And then in the first half, we commented that inflation could be higher in the first half. That's simply due to last year's raw material inflation trajectory. Comparisons were - pricing was lower in the first half, higher in the second. So comparisons get easier as we go through this year, but as we said, we expect average for the year to be in the 4% to 6% range, and it's across a lot of different categories. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Tom Narayan : Hi. Thanks guys. Good morning. It's actually Tom for Arun. Just following up on Ghansham's question on raws. Which segments should we see most impacted by the specific raws? And on a net basis for 2018, will raws be a net headwind with your pricing that you're going to put through? Just trying to understand the EPS guidance. It seems like raws is kind of the biggest new factor, perhaps, that maybe some of us weren't putting in our numbers. John Morikis : Yes, Tom. On the first part, and I'll pass it off to Al after the raw material question, but on the first part, the TiO2 increases that we saw last year affected mostly the architectural paint businesses, which are mostly in The Americas. This year, with more pressure behind the petrochemical side of the basket, it is going to affect the industrial coatings categories as well. And so I would look for raw material pressure across the entire business this year. Al Mistysyn : And Tom, I would say, as in past cycles of raw material inflation, our gross margin may contract a little on the short term as the price increase still pursue and the effectiveness improves. But in the long \u2013 over the long term, we expect our margins to recover. And the guidance that I talked about, the 45% to the 48% long-term gross margin range, I still feel pretty good about that. The one thing I will remind you, and we've talked about this on the last couple of calls, is Valspar is really one price increase behind. Although we're \u2013 we believe, or we should feel confident about the price that's going through right now, as raw material inflation continues, we're going to be chasing that price on the Valspar side. John Morikis : Yes. I'd add to that, that the \u2013 if you look at the core business, to Al's point about the Valspar business, if you look at our core, SW consolidated gross margins, we're only down 80 basis points for the year, and then we're up 10 basis points in the fourth quarter. We wouldn't have been able to do that if we weren't able to achieve the pricing. So to Al's point, the Valspar pricing initiatives that we've been talking about basically since we closed, we said that was going to take six to nine months. It's actually tracking exactly as we have expected. We're starting \u2013 in the fourth quarter, we started to see the pricing move in, and we expect now, as we've changed the calendar first of the year, that more and more of that is going to roll in. So it's actually going exactly as we projected. Tom Narayan : Great. And then my follow-up on Paint Store Group. Really strong performance. Just curious if we should expect any kind of tough comps in 2018 on same-store sales. And additionally, if there would be a cadence issue with the labor issues that typically happen in Q2, Q3. Or is this kind of like some new normal happening in U.S. housing in 2018? Bob Wells : Yes. I would start with, Tom, as you pointed out, there is a tough comp in our first quarter. We're up \u2013 same-store sales were up 7.5%. But with the momentum we have coming out of the fourth quarter, and the volumes that we\u2019re seeing and the ability that we\u2019re talking to our customers and have a fairly good outlook, we feel confident that we're going to go over the top of that in our first quarter. And that's why we're talking mid-to high single digits, and we fully expect stores to be in the high-end of that range. John Morikis : Yes, we've been talking about sometime about the initiatives that we've had as far as growing share of wallet with our existing customers as well as opening new accounts, not only to overcome the comps, but also the point that you made a little bit later in your question about labor, making sure that we are filling that pipeline with enough new business to offset that. For the most part, I would say, I think we commented on this in the last quarter, in some of the metro markets, it's diminished a bit, the restraint on labor. But for the most part, we continue to see the same labor issues continue throughout the market. In fact, I might say that on the residential side, we're starting to see a bit of a backup in projects as labor for that side of the business has also become a bit tighter. Tom Narayan : Understood. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you've been seeing any changes in wall-covering trends, either inside or outside of the home, that could affect architectural coating used for home versus historical levels, either positive or negative trends? John Morikis : No. Steve, not anything to speak of. The wallpaper industry is one that has always cycled. I don't think that right now, we're experiencing much change at all. In fact, I'd say, through the blessing of many of the TV programs and shelter magazines that are out there, we actually like the frequency in which people are repainting. So we sell wall-covering, if it moves in that direction, we'd benefit from that. But right now, it seems to be more on the paint side, and we enjoy that. Steve Byrne : And with respect to the legacy Valspar brands of architectural paint sold in China, are you seeing any potential upside from kind of benefiting from your own experience on selling paint through stores that you could leverage that experience in China? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, that's a great observation, and we are excited about kind of bringing what the call best practices to all of our businesses around the world. Our leader, Ed Lorber, was just in China last week, a terrific leader. We're working on the transfer of that knowledge from our company to that business. We have a lot of those dealers surprisingly as I've gotten to know them, many of them has actually traveled to the U.S. to visit our stores trying to get an understanding of what we do and how they might transfer. So they're very receptive to that. As I said, many of them spend their own money trying to get here to see it themselves. So we're excited about bringing some of that best practice. We know that what works in the U.S. doesn't necessarily work everywhere, but we also know that what works in the U.S. might work other places. So we're not limited by if it works here, it has to be there. We're going to do what's right for every market. Steve Byrne : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Steve. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you. Can you just break down any key trends within Performance Coatings, specifically whether or not you saw broad-based volume strength and your expectation for general industrial coil? And then also, I think Allen hit on this a little bit, but just any quick, broad comments on pricing strategy on the legacy Val assets within PC and then longer-term potential as it applies to your multi-year margin targets? Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you, Chris. I'll take the first piece. Allen then maybe you can talk about the pricing. Regarding your question, Chris, about trends and what we're seeing, we are really excited. I mentioned in my earlier remarks about the opportunity to leverage the resources that we have now as a combined business. So Valspar's business in coil it was very good, very strong, terrific relationships and wonderful technology. We're really, I think, finding the sweet spot as we're working with our customers in our ability to respond quickly with small batch quick turnaround utilizing our facilities that are spread out throughout the world, primarily in the U.S., but we have them around the world. That gives us an opportunity to take care of their immediate demands just in time as well as continuing to provide them with the technologies that they've gotten to know over the years. Very well received by the customers, and we're excited about the future, being able to leverage that. Allen Mistysyn : And Chris, on the pricing actions, yes, we will chase price in 2018, but we believe the effectiveness that seeing is going to be very good. And the reason part of why we believe that is although paint is a small portion of the cost of a customer's product, but it's an important part of it. Imagine looking at a Caterpillar tractor. The performance of that product is very important. So we believe we're going to get the price, but we're going to be chasing it throughout 2018. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you. And can you also just comment broadly on your expectation for any incremental industry M&A, your potential involvement in 2019 onwards? And any key strategic initiatives you see yourself undertaking in the intermediate to long term in terms of either enhancing or simply broadening out your end market exposure is? Just any broad color would be appreciated. Thank you. Allen Mistysyn : So I'll take the first part on our ability to participate. One, I do believe, or we do believe that the industry will continue to consolidate. And when you look at our debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of 2017, we're around 4.1. Our expectation for that leverage at the end of 2018 will be around 3. So I believe that gives us flexibility, particularly in the second half of 2018, to pursue a strategic acquisition and one that fits our portfolio very well. John Morikis : And as you would expect, we're not waiting for that point in time, Chris, to begin looking. Our teams are constantly revisiting what those opportunities might be. We look at geographic opportunities, we look at technology opportunities. And so to your question about, are we interested in enhancing or broadening our future opportunities through acquisition, the answer is definitely yes. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you for the color. John Morikis : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson : Thank you. Question on going back to Paint Stores Group. Are you anticipating another price increase? Or is that second 3% to 5% that you put through on October 1 sufficient in your mind to deal with raws going up? And then if you grow at 8.2% same-store sales growth, 2% was price, does that put you at still growing at twice the market? Or what do you think the overall market is doing and will do in 2018 on U.S. architectural? John Morikis : So on the first part of that question, Don, on the price increase that we have put in place as of October 1, we currently believe that it's sufficient to cover the raw material costs that we currently see. We monitor that on a monthly basis, and as we see movement, we evaluate whether another price increase is required, and we'll continue to do that throughout the first quarter and the rest of the year. Al Mistysyn : Yes. And in terms of growth pace relative to the market, Don, first, the tag effective pricing in the fourth quarter was a little north of the 2% that we said for consolidated. That still leaves us with volume growth in the range of what we believe is probably 1.5 times to 2 times the rate of the market. That's the range that we target. I don't think we have enough data yet to say exactly what the market grew in the fourth quarter, but we like the volume movement to our stores. John Morikis : And our expectations will continue to be that same rate of growth, 1.5 times to 2 times over the market. Don Carson : Just a follow-up on Consumer Group. Your segment comparison shows that, that was down 6.8% for the year on a year-over-year basis for the quarter. Were there any product line losses at any of your big-box customers that contributed to that? Or was it simply slowdown in DIY and de-stocking by those customers? John Morikis : No, Don. There wasn't any loss. And I'll remind you, you know from last year, or this past year, as we've been talking about consumer and the weakness in consumer's really coming for many, many points. There's not a one area that we would to. Clearly, a challenging year. I might add, clearly not happy with that performance. But we also know that the comparisons in the fourth quarter, we're going - and we knew it was going to be a little more difficult, and we had to load in some of the business that went last year. And you're right. We had a lot of customers that were adjusting inventory appropriately so. As we look forward, though, and Al let mentioned about the opportunity in gallons, we're really excited about the team that we have here and the discipline that they have. We think the combined assets and brands that we have are very strong, and we're having wonderful conversations right now with our customers who are eager to grow. And so we having, we think, meaningful discussions about how we can help them reach their goals. So as we enter into 2018, it's with a lot of determination. We think we've got some momentum here that will show up here hopefully as the year proceeds and into 2018. Don Carson : Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Grace Chen : Hi. This is Grace Chen on for Vincent. Following up on consumer. Are there any specific strategic initiatives then? You say you're targeting as we head into the spring painting season maybe increased market spend? John Morikis : Yes, there are a number of initiatives, none of which we really want to lay out. But when we talk about the fact that we've got a little confidence in fields that we have momentum, we are determined. And we don't think just doing the same thing over and over is going to change things. So yes, a lot of considerations that we have on the table, but as you would expect, we don't want to flush those out publicly here right now. Grace Chen : Okay, that's fair. And then with the U.S. tax reform, the savings you'll see from that, do you have any specific plans in mind for that? Or do you expect it to generally flow through to EPS? John Morikis : No, just like I opened with my comments on the first question, we absolutely are going to take the opportunity to reinvest a portion of those savings back into our businesses for future growth. And it's - we're looking at opportunities across all of our segments. And as I talked about, we'll go through the processing \u2013 robust process that we do with our other investments, but we view this as a real opportunity to accelerate our future growth. Grace Chen : Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Hi. It's Kevin on for Matt. Before I ask, I just want to kind of clarify something quickly. If I'm looking at the slide decks, are the synergy numbers included in the Valspar portion of the segment breakdowns? John Morikis : The way our synergies are flowing our \u2013 it's really in both our core and our core Sherwin and in our Valspar, but they would be embedded in any actual results that we report. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. I was just wondering how they're being attributing, whether on the legacy Sherwin or Valspar basis. But it sounds like it's kind of both. But... John Morikis : Yes, Kevin, you can imagine, as we consolidate the operations, as we consolidate departments, it's harder and harder to just separate the two between Valspar and the core Sherwin. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. So if I look at slide decks, EBIT year-over-year for legacy Valspar looks it's down about $20 million, or about 15%, inclusive of synergies that are there and backing out any deal-related amortization. Just given the breakout, looks like most of that\u2019s coming from Performance Coatings, and margins look like they\u2019re down about \u2013 to about 13% from 17% last year. So I guess, the question is, where do you expect those margins will be by year-end next year? And how long do you think it would take to kind of restore those mid-high \u2013 high teens EBITDA margins that business used to enjoy? John Morikis : Yes. We have talked about, we're not going to recover the raw material costs that we saw in 2018 and didn't get price for in a one-year window. So it is going to take us a little bit of time to recover those margins back to the way they were. That being said, we've talked about an increased run rate synergy number, both for the 230 at the end of 2017, and we increased our target run rate synergy for the end of 2018. We're going to recoup some of those that \u2013 recoup some of that margin in the increased synergies that we're going to see through the P&L. But if \u2013 absent synergies, we're going to be chasing the margin for a little bit of time here. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And then, I was wondering if you could provide a little context on the breakdown between pricing volume for same-store sales and PSG because if you had \u2013 would've been almost two price initiatives specifically on the quarter. I was thinking volumes maybe something like 2%. But you said Protective & Marine was up double digits, and resi repaint, I think, was up about double digits as well. So I'm just kind of wondering where the offsets were on that. Thank you. John Morikis : I think your volume is going to be a little bit more than half of that 2, and then the rest will be price. Kevin McCarthy : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood : Thank you. I wanted to ask about the kind of rebound from the storm-related disruptions of 3Q. Obviously, two components to that. One is just the sales that couldn't that happen during the disruption happening, And then the rebuild proportion of that as well. What \u2013 now that we have a little bit more visibility on how that's likely to shape out, what specifically \u2013 if you could give a little bit more specific, did you see in the fourth quarter? And what are, what are you expecting as we see the painting season beginning here? John Morikis : So if you look at Southwestern division, they were up double digits in the quarter, and Southeastern division was up high single-digits. Now what I'd also point out to is that those sales growth numbers in both of those divisions were strong prior to the storm. So it's very difficult for us to say how much of that was attributed to the storm. So we were running at a similar rate that we are running at now interrupted by the storm. So to attribute any one area of that to the storm would be very difficult. The other piece of this is as it came through, we had, I believe, it was nearly 100 stores in the southeast that at one point closed. More in the Southwest as those storms rolled in. While those stores are closed, it's not that we're not selling exterior paint. I mean, we are - our business is closed. So it was a significant drop. It seems as though it's rebounded back, and we are back to the levels that we were operating on prior to the storm. And as you mentioned, very strong performance. And this is the 15th consecutive quarter of resi repaint sales. And so we're feeling good about the momentum in all our stores. Bob Wells : And just to reiterate John's point, we have seen particular strength in the southern region of the U.S. throughout the year. Nishu Sood : Got it. Okay. Thank you. And in terms of your '18 outlook for mid- to high single-digit sales growth, what kind of growth assumption are you using for housing in '18? Are you assuming some acceleration, continuation of the momentum that we've seen in the second half of '17, and also how that would flow through to the repaint side of things? Bob Wells : Yes, Nishu, the - we're basically tracking new orders and backlogs from all the public builders, and we are interpreting them as more or less high single-digits on average. We think that most of the forecast we're seeing for new sales and starts for '18 would be in the mid- to high single-digit range. That seems about right to us. It feels like the builders, the residential builders might be starting to pick up the slack in inventory in the existing home market by building new homes at a little faster pace. So we are expecting a robust market. I would also point out that we've been commenting for a couple of years about how home value appreciation is driving remodeling activity. We expect 2018 to be a really strong year in North America remodeling as well. So our outlook is not based just on new construction. Let me add to that, I know you asked about residential, but on non-residential, we're seeing an improving picture, too. 2018 - or 2017 was a positive year in square footage starts following two years of declines, and we're expecting a moderate - a modest acceleration in 2018 in non-residential starts. Nishu Sood : Okay. Great, thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Jester : Hi, guys it's Dan Jester on for P.J. Just on Latin America, we haven't really talked about it much on the call today, but it's been tougher a couple of years now. Just wondering, if you go into 2018, is there any signs of optimism that, that business might turn around? John Morikis : Yes, Dan, we continue to work down there. Our Southern Cone and Indiana region were the strongest performers for us down there. Some of those businesses are up double digits. The area that we're continuing to experience pressure in is Brazil. It's a big part of our business. And while we saw an increase in sales in Brazil, our volumes were still down slightly. So we're continuing - we're not waiting. I've said this time and time again. We're not waiting for the market to get better. We're working hard down there. I think we're gaining progress that, again, some terrific leaders down there that are working really hard, and we're going to keep pushing the ball here. Daniel Jester : Okay. And then I just wanted to clarify something that you said on the new store openings. If I remember correctly, I think that you're planning on opening 90 new stores in The Americas this year, and it turned out to be closer to 100. So did you \u2013 I guess, first, is that number correct? And then did you pull forward any store openings? And if I look to the 2018 number that you talked about, that 100 to 110, if I go back just a few years ago, something like 140, so is there something specifically you're doing in terms of mix? Or just because of the focuses of the Valspar right now that not open quite as many stores? Thanks. Bob Wells : Hi, Dan, I'll let John comment on the peak openings versus our run rate now. But as clarification, on the guidance that we gave on store openings, the 90 pertained to our U.S., Canada and Caribbean store base. We actually ended up opening 87 in the U.S., Canada and Caribbean. The 101 is all of tag. It's throughout The Americas. So it included all the openings in Latin America. John Morikis : And regarding the run rate, I would say that we've kind of settled in at this 100 store opening rate. With that requires about 1,400 management trainees from \u2013 we recruit from college as we continue to add more districts, more areas. And it's an area that I've spoken with Pete Ippolito. He is an aggressive sales promoter, and he'll want to grow, and we want to support that. And so you could bet that when Al was talking earlier about our taking some of these funds that are going to be available for the tax program here going forward, that a big piece of this will go into our stores organization. But Pete's a smart investor and wants to grow our business, and we're going to support him. But I think you should see us continuing around that 100 base. Daniel Jester : Okay. Thanks guys. John Morikis : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Koort : Great. Thanks for sneaking me in there. Al, I was wondering, you mentioned a little quicker capture of synergies and the costs to achieve those. Can you tell me how you got to a faster run rate specifically? And then what is the 2018 cost to extract those synergies? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Rob. Bob. The speed that we get is by vetting out the project and really validating the fact that we're going to see those benefits to the P&L. So it is going through each group, Performance Coatings Group and Consumer Brands Group being the largest that are impacted by the acquisition. It's also through corporate. And one of the ways we see the improvements is through system implementations. And as we've been able to turn some systems on as of January 1, we've vetted those savings and gave us the confidence to put them into our run rate and into what we expect in the P&L for 2018. Robert Koort : That's helpful. And then curious, obviously, you guys have the ultimate mousetrap when it comes to contractor markets in the U.S. and how you serve those. As you started looking at the Valspar paint in Europe, in China, in Australia, have you come to any conclusions or confidence that you can sort of achieve the same sort of superior performance in those brands over time that you exhibit through your stores group in the U.S.? Allen Mistysyn : We are continuing to evaluate what aspects of our business would make sense in every market. I think it's important, as I said, not to just assume because it works here that, that it'll work everywhere, nor assume that it works here so it can't work somewhere else. We're really trying to be very diligent in our research to understand what elements, what products, what technologies. We want to bring everything we can to the market to really differentiate ourselves in that market. By the way, I'm going to steal that. I like that ultimate mousetrap approach, too. We're going to brand our team with that, Bob. Thank you. Robert Koort : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Mushkin : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple from, I guess, tag answers this call got a little bit. You guys talked about being back in the market maybe for acquisitions. And I'm just wondering if \u2013 as you look over the portfolio, kind of what areas do you see some weakness in? And kind of get our minds around kind of what you think strategically? Bob Wells : Yes. And so you'd really want to look at it business-my-business, and that's the way we talk with our general managers to understand. And I mentioned, we look at opportunities to differentiate ourselves in the market, and we think that part of that is having the product, service and availability in the right geographic areas. And we also look, from a technology standpoint, what opportunities there might be. I'd really rather not get into deeper than that, other than to say that this is an important part, we believe, in the very near future, we're going to spending a lot of cash off, and we want to put to work with our shareholders. We think this is an important element of our go-forward strategy. Scott Mushkin : Okay, it's actually a pretty good fair remarks, I appreciate it. And then I guess, and maybe I missed it, you guys talked a lot about the expectations for commodities continue to go up. Can you share anything? I didn't think about maybe you guys putting through further price increases. I just want to get comments on that. Is that something that we should be thinking about? Bob Wells : Scott, we did say that we believe the pricing that we have going into a sufficient for the current raw material inflationary environment, but we're monitoring that on a daily basis. And as you can imagine, it is an influx kind of a situation. So as a we see raw materials increasing more than what we think we've gotten in price, we'll talk to our customers, as our past practice has been, and then talk to The Street about what we're doing. John Morikis : And Scott, just as a reminder, if you \u2013 I don't think we're anywhere near this environment, but if you do rewind the clock here and take a look at the time period between 2010 and 2012, we did go out during that period with 6 price increases. And I think what that demonstrates is the discipline that we have. As Al mentioned earlier, during even that period, there's a little bit of compression in the short period while we're looking through that - of those price increases. Then we go out and get it. And if that should represent anything, as our commitment to making sure we stay firm here, the idea that we have is always adding value to our customers, helping them reach their goals. And we believe that the value proposition that we bring provides us the opportunity to make sure that we capture the price. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. And then supply issues on TiO2, is that something that you're worried about or not really? John Morikis : There's a number of reasons for TiO2 supply being tight. And we've got the major global producers of chloride kind of managing their capacity utilization to keep market conditions favorable. We have some shutdowns in production in China. So we don't necessarily believe its structural, meaning the industry is just chronically - it's structurally under capacity. But we do expect the market to be tight probably through the better part \u2013 certainly, the better part of the first half, if not the year. Scott Mushkin : All right. Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions. John Morikis : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Scott Rednor : Hi, good morning, everyone. John Morikis : Good morning, Scott. Scott Rednor : Question for Al. The $0.60 range in the core guidance, it's a little bit larger than in prior years, prior issuance. I was just curious, what's the biggest variable up or down there? Is it purely commodity? Or is there something else that we should consider? Al Mistysyn : It's more the commodities. And you're going to have some variability in the timing of our synergies. We put a range out on what we expect incremental synergies to be in our P&L, and that's not an exact science on timing. So those will be the two main factors. Scott Rednor : Okay, great. And then the cash flow, if we look at cash flow from operations to sales, it was right around 13%, which I think is one of the highest in company history. And it would seem to suggest that, that's ahead of your 2020 guidance, Al. Is anything unusual there? Or are you tracking ahead of that, that out year measure? Al Mistysyn : I would say, we had a very strong working capital year. Our core Sherwin working capital came in at 10% versus 10.7% last year. That's a bigger year-over-year change than I would expect going forward. So we got a little bit of wind, tailwind on that. So we're not going to change our 2020 outlook just yet, but certainly pleased with the cash generation. You look at it after CapEx, and we're over 11%. So strong performance, and we're going to keep pushing that as we get into 2018. Scott Rednor : Great. And then just one last one, was there any FX, and if there was by segment in the quarter on the sales side? Al Mistysyn : Yes. The overall FX in the quarter, and it's a little tough to look at because you've got Valspar in these numbers as well, but it was about 1% on the consolidated, and it was a tailwind. Nothing to speak of in TAG. Performance Coatings was a low single-digit impact, and then really nothing to speak of in Consumer. Scott Rednor : Okay, great. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Cerankosky : Good afternoon, everyone. Al, could you maybe talk a little bit about the changed economics of paying down debt versus buying back stock with the tax reform and what we should think about after maybe the midpoint of this year? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Chuck, I think, the \u2013 certainly, the paying down the debt still is our first priority in the sense that getting our debt-to-EBITDA leverage down so that we have the flexibility to go after the strategic acquisitions that we talked about earlier, I think that's very important to us. That being said, in 2018, we're going offset dilution from options with buying back shares of our stock. I think as you get towards the second half, and we see what the progression is on our cash flow on our ability to pay down debt and, quite honestly, how our operations are going, we may put us in a position to get debt down a little bit lower and look to acquisitions. So we'll keep driving that debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio down so we feel comfortable that we have that flexibility. Chuck Cerankosky : The third place is stock repo? Al Mistysyn : That's right. Chuck Cerankosky : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : Hi, good morning guys. John Morikis : Good morning Truman. Truman Patterson : Quick question. This all pertains to your legacy Sherwin business, kind of excluding Valspar. I'm really looking at Paint Stores Group and consumer. So Paint Stores Group out margin only fell about two percentage points quarter-over-quarter, which is much better than historical, while your consumer fell about 10 percentage points quarter-over-quarter, which is much worse than kind of the historical relationship. Typically, these move a bit more hand in hand due to consumer capturing your global supply chain initiatives, et cetera. Can you maybe walk us through the dichotomy between the two segments and what's occurring there? John Morikis : Sure. The first thing I would say is volume. As Paint Stores Group drives incremental volume, they get great leverage in that, and you saw that in our fourth quarter leverage on SG&A. As we get into the slower quarters, our SG&A headcount contracts a little bit. And so as we see that volume growth, we get great leverage on our SG&A. We did not see that same effect in our Consumer Group. The volumes were a little softer, and you're not seeing the leverage. Al Mistysyn : Yes, that's almost the opposite side that we saw in the consumer side. John Morikis : Declining line. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Truman Patterson : Okay. And then multi-part question, but it should be pretty short. For the fourth quarter, could you guys break out the charges and the synergies among your various segments as well as kind of gross margin versus SG&A? And then as we look into 2018, similar question is where is the $320 million in synergies broken out, at least on run rate, and then where are the $3.45 and EPS charges, where does that fall in 2018? Jane Cronin : Sure, Truman. There was a number of puts and takes in the quarter around our purchase accounting. So if I just speak to the full year total, there was about $91 million of charges for purchase accounting and Cost of goods sold, about $28 million in SG&A and $183 million in amortization. And if I break that down by the Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings that we included in our release, of the $107 million for Consumer Brands, $49 million was cost of goods, SG&A was $4 million, amortization was $54 million. And for Performance Coatings Group, of the $183 million we reported out, $39 million was cost of goods, $16 million SG&A and $127.8 million in amortization. Al Mistysyn : So if you look at 2018, the impacts by segment, Consumer Group will be, on the purchase accounting, $340 million purchase accounting group, Consumer Group will be about $102 million hit, small amount, gross profit, most of it being in amortization. And Performance Coatings Group will be about a $240 million hit. The vast majority again in that is the annualization of the amortization. We're really not going to talk about breaking down synergies by segment. And as you can imagine, it just gets all intermingled, and it's tough to do, and we really just don't want to talk about it by segment. Truman Patterson : Okay. And if you guys don't mind me sneaking in one more, following up on the prior question, looking at Valspar's legacy Performance Coatings margin falling about 400 bps year-over-year, could you maybe walk us through \u2013 now that we're seven months into the integration, I know, previously, you guys had said that pricing would take about nine months to flow through. Could you maybe give us where we are today and the pricing enrollment to your own environment compared to maybe where your expectations whenever you first closed on the deal in the Valspar Performance Coatings? John Morikis : Sure. As it relates to the Valspar performance, I'd say, we are \u2013 firstly, right where we expected to be. These are large customers, many of whom had agreements with the Valspar. And the last thing we wanted to do was go in day one and break previous agreement or almost the implied agreements that they've had in the past. Our goal is to get the price and retain the customer. And so we're working with our customers and, I think, preceding exactly as we expected. We had some of that rolling in the fourth quarter, and we talked about right from the start that it's going to be six to nine months. So as I said earlier, now as we go into the first quarter here, we expect even more of that to roll in. As Al mentioned, we're going to be chasing it here a little bit, but we're on it. Our teams are working hard and we are having terrific discussions. And I'd say, for the largest part it's about how the pricing is coming in, not if. And we're working hard to make sure that we're continuing to add value while we're having the discussions. But we're feeling good about our ability to get it. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you, guys. John Morikis : Thank you, Truman. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn : Thanks for sticking around to take my calls \u2013 my questions, I should say. Just a real quick question. You mentioned in your press release, actually, that you're getting pricing up in the Consumer segment of your business. Can you provide a little bit more detail when the price increase went in and how you look at the DIY market and your pricing ability there in 2018? John Morikis : Yes, Dmitry. I'd say, it's been rolling in \u2013 I really don't want to get into any specifics on that. I would say, as we stated, every one of our businesses is out there. I understand the question, but out of respect for our customers on this side of the business, I would just tell you that it's been rolling in, continues to roll in and will continue to roll in. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. Fair enough. Just a quick question on margins, I mean, I understand all the raw material and volume interactions, but if you just look at kind of how your margins of your businesses have done year-over-year, it's almost counterintuitive to what would with think you're maintaining margins your Paint Stores Group, in your Performance Coatings Group, which margins there will be most impacted by raw materials and slow price increases. But your Consumer Brands, which historically has been a little bit better than when it came to margins, and as a previous caller mentioned, benefits from the volume of the whole North American piece, saw the biggest year-over-year drop in margins and actually a pretty huge sequential drop in margins as well. So can you kind of talk about what's allowing you to maintain margins in the face of pretty stiff raw material inflation in your Paint Stores and in your Performance Coatings Groups and why your margins in the DIY segment have collapsed as much as they did? John Morikis : Yes. I'd say, it's mostly just a timing issue, Dmitry. The issues that when you put a paint program in with many of our customers, we're kind of buying into that program, and we're working with our customers through the paint season. And we start having discussions with them to let them know of what's happening so that we can adjust. And even on the painting contractor side, we work with our painters, but their projects are typically limited in scope. And so if we're going to work with them as prices increase through a project, that project completes. And then as we move to the next project, our prices are going to reflect the new raw materials. So it's really a timing issue. On the performance coating side, same thing. We work with many agreements here at - on the Sherwin side. We were ahead of the ball a little bit, so we got in a little bit quicker. On the Valspar side, historically, they've been able to do it. They're a little behind, and we're executing those right now. So I'd answer it really that it comes down to just timing. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Best of luck for the quarter. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Michael Sison : Hi, guys. Just a quick one on Valspar. I know you're a little bit behind on raw materials, but what about organic growth? Has the team been able to keep up pace? I mean, industrial markets are kind of humming right now. John Morikis : Yes, we are. Michael Sison : We are seeing new products and their ability to match growth there? John Morikis : Sorry if we're interrupting you there, Mike. Yes, we are. We are getting some nice growth on both the core or legacy Sherwin and the Valspar side. And that's - what's really nice is it's across all of our industrial businesses. So there's a nice momentum as we go into 2018. We're feeling really good about. When you think about what we're going through with the integration, the ability to retain the customers, growing our customer base, retaining our employees on both sides, I mean, we're feeling good about the momentum that we have here. Michael Sison : Okay. And quick follow-up. I love it seems that you've kept the shelf space on both ends there. And the next line you'll be coming up in six months. But what's sort of a strategy or what do you want to show those on the six months to nine months to maintain that share longer-term? John Morikis : I'm sorry you're asking us what we're going to show lows? Michael Sison : Yes, what sort of that strategy and keeping that shelf space? Al Mistysyn : Well, Yes, I'll answer it 50,000 feet here. It's to work with our customer to understand what it is that they want and make sure that we're providing that to help them reach our goals. I know you'll understand. We don't want to lay down our strategy here for any customer. But it all comes back to having a very good understanding and responding very well to our customers' needs and helping them reach their goals. Michael Sison : Got it. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Silke Kueck with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Silke Kueck : Hi. Good morning. How are you? John Morikis : Good morning, Silke. Silke Kueck : Just some small stuff. Your depreciation for next year is running something like $70 million a quarter, I think. And - but in the fourth quarter of this year, I think your depreciation was like $123 million. Was there like an asset write-down or something that was in that number? John Morikis : Yes, Silke. We had a number of moving parts in our fourth quarter. We did make a policy change, a threshold change on our capitalization. We took a hit for that in the quarter that will not repeat. And there was also some purchase accounting on the inventory depreciation step-up that we took in the quarter. So we believe that we've gotten \u2013 well, we believe we've gotten the bigger onetime adjustments behind us as we go into next year, into 2018. But we're still \u2013 the valuation is still open. We're still reviewing it, and we have till end of May to get that finalized. But I do believe we got most of the one-time adjustments behind us. Silke Kueck : Okay. And when you look at your outlook for the consumer business, like in the first quarter and for the year, do you think the consumer business is going to grow at the low end of your sales growth guidance or at the high end or below or above those ranges? Do you have a view? John Morikis : Well, I would tell you that our expectations are always it's going to be at the high end. Again, you come out of the fourth quarter, it's a smaller quarter. First quarter, virtually the same dynamics. So... Silke Kueck : But the bar is pretty \u2013 the bar is pretty low, right? John Morikis : It is, it is. You\u2019re exactly \u2013 I'm going to bring it to my next management meeting. So we do have high expectations of how this business performs in the first quarter. How about if I leave it at that? Silke Kueck : And secondly, I think you said your incremental synergies on an absolute basis that you expect year-over-year are like $140 million to $160 million. And that also looks conservative because if you ended the year at a run rate of $230 million, that means you're already getting, I don't know, $58 million a quarter. And like somewhere by the end of the fourth quarter, it's going to be like $80 million a quarter if you get to $320 million. So do you think that the incremental savings in 2018 should be bigger than $140 million or $160 million? It should be more like, I don't know, $180 million or $190 million. Why is the number so conservative? Or do you expect like very low savings in the very beginning of the year and then a lot at the back half or...? John Morikis : No, Silke. I think what you're seeing is in the run rate synergy, there are projects that were tracking \u2013 and I'll use the example, a manufacturing rationalization. So in September of 2017, we announced the rationalization of four manufacturing facilities in the U.S. We won't see the benefit in the P&L of those rationalizations until very late 2018 and more likely in 2019. But that would be in my run rate synergy number. So I want to \u2013 we got to be careful about including the run rate synergy in our P&L. So that's why, in the call, we just tried to break out the \u2013 what we think is going to hit our P&L in 2018 versus what we think \u2013 as we continue to enter projects throughout 2018, that will go into that $320 million run rate at the end of 2018. Many of those projects won't be realized until the following year. So that's why it's \u2013 where the number is. Silke Kueck : Okay. Thanks very much. John Morikis : Thank you, Silke. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Patrick Lambert with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Lambert : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. [Indiscernible] Two sets of questions. The first one, coming back to the synergies. Did you actually quantify the run rate in 2017? I think I had 106. But I'm not sure if you put that number out. And if you could also, and I know it's very difficult, the actual run rate exiting '17 in terms of savings, basically, Q4 savings run rate. Not the synergy but the savings actually achieved, that would be very useful to receive the progression? So that's one. And in terms of cost of synergies, I think you mentioned at the beginning it was about $200 million for overall. But I think if I look at full year '17, you only spent some $18 million. Is that the correct way of seeing it and we should put 220 for next year? So that's for synergy. The second set is on the tax, the cash tax rate. Maybe you want to answer the first part. Allen Mistysyn : On the synergies, the $106 million was a run rate synergy that we talked about that the beginning of the closing of the acquisition. We increased that to $160 million at the end of the third quarter, on our third quarter call. And now we're seeing that we actually have a run rate synergy number of $230 million coming out of 2017. As far as the run rate and the P&L, what we've realized in the seven months in the P&L is about $60 million. We've talked about $50 million. The actual number is about $60 million. It's hard to say - to give you, hi, we think we've got $8 million or $10 million a month. That'll change as new projects come online, as systems get implemented and the timing of those get to be hard to predict. That's why I probably - I want to be caution about getting you are run rate coming out of the year knowing that there is variability in the timing going forward. But you would expect, as the year goes on, our run rate in the month would increase as the year goes on. The other comment you talked about cost to achieve. The $200 million in cost of achieve was really what we're trying to get accomplished through the end of 2018. So from June 1 through the end of 2018, we're trying to get us much as much of the integration and the cost of achieve behind us. In 2017, the actual impact of cost to achieve were about $127 million. And we have in our forecast or our guidance for 2018 another $100 million. So that's where you get $227 million. Patrick Lambert : Okay. So let me switch to revenue tax rates and the impact of the U.S. reform. It's basically - is it fair to say that it's about four - between four and five percentage points of tax reduction? And if you could comment more on the cash taxes, how you see that? I calculate about $18 million extra free cash from that reform. Is that your assumptions, too? Allen Mistysyn : We're still analyzing the impacts as we go through the interpretations on the effective tax rate. That's why we talked about the '18 guidance, we have low to mid-20s on our effective tax rate. And along with that, there is a benefit that we'll get in our cash taxes, and we're just - we're still, like I said, walking through that. But we would expect to see a benefit our cash related to the lower rates. Patrick Lambert : Is that - is 80 a good start to them? Allen Mistysyn : 80 would be a good start. Patrick Lambert : Okay. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thank you. Back on consumer again, we've had this good, optimistic kind of sell-in in the start of the year for the past couple of years and then the inventory reductions by the customers at the back end of the years. Are you expecting that again simply because it's low risk for the sell-in to go well? And again, we will have a few slide at the end of the year whether or not the market was real sluggish again, and we'll pull back on the inventories at the back end? John Morikis : Well, I would tell you that we are going in with high expectations and, as I mentioned, determination. But your point is a good one, John. We wanted to have better results here as we entered into 2017. I would say the differences that we continue to refine what it is that we do that can help our customers separate themselves. As I mentioned earlier, it's not just doing the same things, hoping for different results. And that's why I made that point. We are working with our customers with a different approach and different ways that we can help them to grow their business. So I'd be disappointed if we find ourselves in the same situation at the end of the year. John Roberts : And then back on raw materials. One of your competitors specifically cited the environmentally driven production curtailment in China. Epoxies were singled out. I don't know if you're seeing particular pressure in our packaging coating business because of epoxy. And again, you have a Chinese architectural business. Now I don't know if their raw materials are being affected differently than the rest of the world. John Morikis : So John, Chinese TIO2 has been up pretty sharply in 2017, and that was as a result of supply curtailments. I don't know so much about epoxies. Bob Wells : There was a spike and then a drop in the pricing. But I'd say that it seems right now, I believe, to be back in line. John Roberts : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, John. Operator : It appears we have no further questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Bob Wells : Thanks again, Jessie. Let me wrap up today by asking you to save the date of Tuesday, May 22, on your calendars. That's the day we'll host our Annual Financial Community Presentation at the Langham Hotel in Boston. The program will consist of a brief business review by each of our segment leadership teams, followed by a detailed update on our Valspar integration progress. We'll host our customary Q&A session followed by a reception and lunch. Again, that date is Tuesday, May 22. We'll be sending out invitations and related information and a link to our registration site in late March, so please watch your e-mail. As always, I'll be available over the next few days to handle any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. If you like to be placed in the queue or for a follow-up call, you can call Kristy Johnson at 216-566-3001 and she will add you to the callback schedule. I'd like to thank you again for joining us today, and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

After the Company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells. Bob Wells : Thanks, Jessie. Good morning, everyone. In the interest of time, we\u2019ve provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information, including a slide deck with a breakdown of our results by the new reportable segments, on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, April 24 press release. Consolidated sales in the first quarter 2018, increased $1.2 billion, or 43.6%, to $3.97 billion. Excluding Valspar results, core consolidated sales increased 4.9% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the first quarter increased $343.8 million, or 25.6%, to $1.69 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the first quarter was 42.5% compared to reported first quarter 48.6% in the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $203.5 million, or 20.1%, to $1.21 billion in the first quarter but decreased as a percent of sales to 30.6% from 36.6% in the same quarter last year. The decreases in both gross margin and SG&A as a percent of sales is primarily the result of a mix effect from the inclusion of Valspar. Interest expense for the quarter increased $65.9 million to $91.5 million. The increase was entirely due to acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before tax in the first quarter decreased $3 million, or 98 basis points, to $303.6 million. These results include a year-over-year increase in acquisition and integration costs of approximately $106.8 million. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 17.6%. We expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2018 to be in the low to mid-20s. Diluted net income per common share increased to 3.6% to $2.62 per share from $2.53 last year. The $2.62 includes $0.95 per share in acquisition-related expenses including purchase accounting amortization; and income of $0.68 per share, net of incremental interest expense from Valspar operations. We have summarized the first quarter earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our first quarter 2018 press release. Let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment. Sales for The Americas Group in the first quarter increased $128.7 million, or 6.6%, to $2.08 billion. Comparable store sales for in the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2% in the quarter. Regionally, in the first quarter, our Canada division led all divisions, followed by Southwest division, Southeast division, Midwestern division and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. First quarter sales in Latin America region, stated in U. S. dollars, increased 9.5%. Currency translation reduced net sales in U.S. dollars by 2.8% in the quarter. First quarter segment profit increased $32.2 million, or 10.5%, to $337.4 million. First quarter segment operating margin increased 60 basis points to 16.2% from 15.6% last year. Turning, now to the Consumer Brands Group. First quarter external net sales increased $333 million, or 103%, to $656.4 million. Revenue reclassification related to the newly adopted ASC 606 reduced net sales by 2.1%. Excluding sales from Valspar, core sales for the group decreased 5.3% in the quarter including a 1.6% positive impact from currency translation. Segment profit for the Consumer Brands Group in the first quarter increased $18.3 million, or 32.8%, to $74.2 million. Segment profit for the quarter includes a $31.8 million charge for purchase accounting amortization. Excluding Valspar, core segment profit for the group decreased 11.8% in the quarter. Segment profit as a percent of net sales for the quarter decreased to 11.3% from 17.3% last year. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group decreased 118 basis points in the quarter to 16.1%. For our Performance Coatings Group, first quarter net sales in U.S. dollars increased $743.3 million, or 153.4%, to $1.23 billion. Excluding sales from Valspar, core sales for the group increased 5.3% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, Performance Coatings Group segment profit in the first quarter increased $33.7 million, or 58.9%, to $90.8 million from $57.1 last year. Segment profit for the quarter includes a $57.5 million charge for purchase accounting amortization. Excluding Valspar, core segment profit decreased 12.1% in the quarter. Currency, translation rate changes increased segment profit $4.6 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 7.4% in the first quarter compared to 11.8% last year including the purchase accounting amortization expense. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group decreased 195 basis points in the quarter. I\u2019ll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our Lead Pigment Litigation. In our Santa Clara County California lawsuit, the Sixth District Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the trial court. A new trial court judge has been assigned to the case, as the judge who presided over the trial retired. The trial court has two issues to resolve : first, calculation of liability based on the pre-1951 housing standard; and second, selection of a receiver. The new judge will determine the process for deciding these two issues. An initial hearing took place March 28, and initial briefs on the proposed size of the abatement fund were filed last week. The next hearing is scheduled for May 24. The defendants plan to seek certification in the U. S. Supreme Court. Petitions are likely to be filed in June or July. That concludes our review of our operating results for the first quarter. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of 2018. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Despite a slow start to the painting season in certain regions of North America, we delivered strong results in our first quarter. Sales, gross profit, net income and diluted earnings per share were all first quarter records for the company. We are seeing continued strong demand across most businesses, and we're making good progress on the Valspar integration, value capture and pricing initiatives to offset raw material inflation. If you back out the contribution from Valspar, our core consolidated sales grew by nearly 5% compared to first quarter 2017, with a little more than half coming from volume, consolidated gross profit dollars increased by nearly $40 million in the quarter. The core gross margin declined 93 basis points year-over-year to 47.8%. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 121 basis points, and core consolidated profit before tax increased 7.2% and expanded 25 basis points as a percent of sales. Core diluted earnings per share, again, excluding Valspar results and acquisition costs, increased 10.7% to $2.89 compared to the same quarter last year. The Valspar business had a little more than $1 billion in net sales and $0.68 to earnings per share in the quarter. Consolidated first quarter 2018 EPS, excluding acquisition expenses, increased 36.8% year-over-year to $3.57 per share. The Americas Group grew volumes and improved their operating performance compared to the first quarter last year, although growth was at the lower end of our expectations due to slow exterior paint sales in some regions for most of the quarter. Sales to residential repaint contractors in the U.S. and Canada grew at a double-digit pace for the 16th time in the last 18 quarters. Protective and marine coatings sales in the U.S. and Canada grew in the high single digits. And property management, new residential, commercial and DIY segments all contributed to TAG's growth in the quarter. Latin America sales in total increased 9.5%. It appears that the fundamental demand and trends remain strong across the business. TAG segment operating margins improved 60 basis points compared to the first quarter last year, reflecting our progress in implementing price increases to offset a challenging raw material cost environment and good expense control as SG&A decreased slightly as a percent of sales. The group opened seven net new stores in the quarter, bringing our total store count at the end of the quarter to 4,624 stores in the Americas. Our plan calls for this team to add approximately 100 net new stores in The Americas by the end of the year. The e-commerce platform launched by TAG last year is receiving positive reviews from both our customers and our field organization. And we expect adoption to increase over time, enhancing both our in-store and field service experience. Consumer Brands Group also showed good progress in the first quarter, but the improvement is not quite as obvious in the numbers. On a year-over-year basis compared to pro forma combined results from first quarter 2017, sales increased 3.8% and adjusted operating margin, excluding the purchase accounting impacts, improved by 260 basis points. If you look at it sequentially, first quarter sales increased nearly 15% compared to fourth quarter 2017, much of which is probably attributable to seasonality. And first quarter reported operating margins expanded 720 basis points to 11.3% compared to 4.1% in fourth quarter. Backing out purchase accounting amortization expenses from both quarters, segment operating margin in the first quarter was 16.2% compared to approximately 9.9% in the fourth quarter. The improvement in segment operating margin, both sequentially and year-over-year, is a result of successful expense control and cost synergies as well as our early progress in implementing price increases. On February 28, Lowe's announced a significantly expanded partnership with Sherwin-Williams, in which Lowe's will become the only nationwide home center to offer our top-selling wood care brands, including Minwax, Cabot, Thompson's WaterSeal, the top paintbrush brand in Purdy and industry-leading spray-paint in Krylon. Lowe's continues to be the only nationwide home center to offer our Valspar and HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams brands of interior and exterior paints. Both companies are supporting this effort with incremental investment in service, training and brand communications. And we're confident this combination of high quality products, category-leading brands and outstanding customer service will accelerate comp growth in Lowe's paint aisle. Lowe's will determine the timing and cadence of the department resets. While there is no impact from this announcement in first quarter 2018, we do expect this expanded partnership to result in increased volumes and revenues in full year 2018. Given our anticipated investment in marketing, displays, training and other support areas, we expect earnings dilution of approximately $0.40 this year. In the Performance Coatings Group, top line growth was just under 10% compared to pro forma combined revenues in the first quarter 2017. Sales were up in every product category, led by packaging coatings, general industrial and Industrial Wood Coatings. Reported segment operating margin was 7.4% compared to 11.8% reported last year. If you back out the impact of purchase accounting amortization in the quarter, which was a little over $57 million, adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 12.1%, which compares to 13.5% pro forma combined operating margin last year. The pressure on operating margins year-over-year as a result of continued escalation in raw material costs, most notably, petrochemicals and epoxy, which are a large portion of the Performance Coatings raw material basket. We continue to work with our customers to recover these cost increases through pricing actions. EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased 44% to $557.8 million in the first quarter, which includes $137.9 million from Valspar. EBITDA margin was flat year-over-year at 13.9% of sales. Core EBITDA without Valspar increased 6% to $413.9 million. Net operating cash in the quarter was $40.7 million compared to $231.8 million a year ago. Net operating cash in the first quarter last year included a benefit of approximately $137 million from settlements of the Treasury lock hedge. Changes in working capital come from most of the remainder of the difference. On March 31, the company had $158.6 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to reduce debt and fund operations. During the quarter, we raised our dividend to $0.86 per share, paying $81 million in cash dividends. The balance sheet reflects preliminary purchase accounting balances and total debt of approximately $10.8 billion. We intend to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to approximately 3 :1 by the end of 2018. Our capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $42.3 million. Depreciation was $71.6 million, and amortization of intangibles and inventory step-up was $85 million. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $330 million, which is about 1.9% of anticipated sales, as we continue to invest in productivity improvements, systems and new stores. Depreciation should be between $280 million to $290 million, and amortization will be about $340 million. On our year-end 2017 call, we said we would resume opportunistic open-market purchases of company stock in 2018 at a level sufficient to offset dilution from options exercises. In the first quarter, we purchased 600,000 shares at an average price of $401.91 per share. On March 31, we { 10-20 } { Spart-020 } On March 31, we had remaining authorization to acquire approximately 11 million shares. It's hard to believe that June 1 will mark one year since the close of the Valspar acquisition. I'm extremely proud of the progress we have made in the 10 months we've been together. Perhaps, most proud of the fact that we are increasingly functioning as a single unified global team. You should take comfort in the fact that as a team, we remain focused on execution and value capture in the areas of SG&A, raw materials, manufacturing, distribution, R&D and revenues. We have confidence in our 2018 year-end annual run rate synergy target of $320 million, which should benefit this year's P&L by about $140 million to $160 million. We expect to book most of the remaining costs to achieve these synergies in 2018, and we are increasingly confident in our long-term annual run rate range of $385 million to $415 million. Turning to our outlook for the balance of the year. With strong sales and volume momentum coming out of the first quarter, we anticipate second quarter consolidated core net sales will increase a mid-to-high single-digit percentage compared to the second quarter of 2017. In addition, we expect incremental sales from Valspar to be approximately $600 million, for the months of April and May, where June 1, making the one year anniversary of the close of the transaction. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect, core net sales will increase a mid-to-high single-digit percentage compared to full year 2017. In addition, we expect incremental sales from Valspar in the first five months of 2018 to add approximately $1.7 billion to consolidated revenues. With these factors in mind, we anticipate diluted net income per common share for 2018 will be in the range of $14.95 to $15.45 per share. This guidance has been revised to include approximately $0.40 per share dilution from our initial investment in the Lowe's partnership, which reduces the anticipated income contribution from Valspar to $2.30 to $2.50 per share.  Acquisition-related costs and purchase accounting impacts are expected to be $3.40 to $3.50 per share. Given the many moving parts in last year's results and this year's guidance, it can be challenging to understand our underlying earnings per share performance. We believe the most meaningful way to view guidance is to exclude Valspar acquisition costs and one-time items, which results in a full year EPS guidance midpoint of $18.65 compared to $15.07 adjusted EPS last year. On this basis, earnings per share would grow by nearly 24% year-over-year at the mid-point of our 2018 guidance. We have included Regulation G reconciliation table with this morning's press release to better illustrate all the moving parts. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning, thanks guys. I guess just a couple of questions. So first off, just wanted to understand the 5.2% same-store sales performance. I know that you guys increased the prices by 3% to 5% in October, so maybe you can just update us on the traction there. And then similarly, if you are in kind of a low single-digit increase on prices, that would imply kind of a similar rate for volume. How do you see the volume kind of progressing through the year? I mean, I know that Q1 is \u2013 sorry the paint season is off to a slow start here. But are you optimistic that things could improve with weather getting better and labor availability maybe loosening up? Or how do you see that playing out? Thanks. John Morikis : Sure. Let me start with the volume piece, and I'll have Al talk to the pricing. You're exactly right. We're feeling terrific about the volume and the momentum that we have in our stores organization. Had a number of opportunities to talk with not only our customers but our employees, and there's an overall feeling of confidence in the year, many, many customers talking about this being a record year for them. And I'd say the confidence is very strong.  So you're right, we got off to a little slower start in a smaller quarter. Not too concerned with that. Feeling good about the key drivers that we've been talking about for quite some time, the continued focus on new accounts and share of wallet of existing customers. So the team is executing extremely well. We have great confidence this is going to be a terrific year for our stores. Al Mistysyn : Hi, Arun this Al. When we talk about pricing in our Paint Stores Group, we realized a little more than 2% effective pricing. That was roughly sufficient to offset the raw material increases that we're seeing, and it's in line with the effectiveness that we were expecting in the quarter. John Morikis : One other thing I'd add to that, Arun, we also look at some of the purchases of our customers to give us even more confidence. If you look at spray equipment purchases, for example, those were up double digits. The whole basket, if you look at those things that we look at internally to try to get a sense of how confident our customers are, they're all pointing terrifically in the right direction. Arun Viswanathan : And just a quick follow-up as I can on the other two segments, margins appear to be improving. And I was pleased to see the consumer performance. So I don't know if you can just characterize the price cost situation you're seeing in those two segments. Are they also improving? Thanks. John Morikis : Yes. Why don't I take the same approach here? I'll talk about just the market here for just a moment, and then I'll have Al talk about the pricing. But you're exactly right. If you look at consumer, for example, and the way that we're running this business and the way that we look at the results, it's a combined business. The combined business for consumer was up 3.8%. And when I say it's combined, it's really one integrated organization now. We don't run separate businesses between the consumer, architectural and legacy SHW. There's one leadership team. There's one marketing team, one sales organization.  And quite frankly, they're the furthest along in the integration. So they're working hard trying to be as responsive as they can to our customers' needs without regard to what brand they're selling. And when you look at the performance that they're posting, we feel pretty good about their position and the momentum that they have. Al Mistysyn : I think on the on the price side, the we are seeing the positive effect of pricing initiative on Consumer Brands. Certainly, a work in process, and we have room to grow there. On the performance coatings side, as Bob or John talked about in the call, they did see the biggest impact on the increased raw material in the quarter. We had talked about our first half of the year having a tougher comparison from a raw material standpoint. And I would say that group is probably the furthest behind with the highest inflation and, again, making progress. And we'll continue to do so as we roll the quarters out. John Morikis : Yes. Let me just give you a couple of comments on performance coatings from a market side of it. If you look at the momentum that they have, Arun, if you look at just going back to Q3, their sales were up 5.8%; Q4, up 6.9%; and then this most recent quarter, up 9.8%. And they're showing improvement year-over-year in their operating profit.  So the profit, if you look at a pro forma basis for that same Q3 period, was down 15.9%; Q4, down 8.7%; in this most recent quarter, down 1.5%. None of us were happy with down 1.5% but it does illustrate the momentum that we're gaining here while growing our sales. And this is a team that's very determined in what they're doing, and we've got great confidence that they're going to continue to gain traction here. Arun Viswanathan : Great thank. John Morikis : Thanks Arun. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. If I can just follow-up on performance coatings numbers. It looks like sequentially, your revenues were up a little bit, and your operating profit was down, I don't know, $15 million. So it looks like what's happening is that your raw material squeeze is getting a little bit larger or your raw materials are rising faster than your pricing efforts. Is that true? And how do you expect that progression to go in the second quarter? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Jeff you are absolutely correct. We did see an acceleration of raw material cost increases in our first quarter, and it predominantly impacted our Performance Coatings Group. And as you can imagine, when they go up that quick, it's very hard for us to react and put another price increase into the market. That being said, we do have pricing implemented, and we'll monitor that situation as we always do on a month by-month basis. And if we see another increase that warrants a price adjustment, we'll do that. So pricing actions are in progress. John Morikis : I'll describe it as they are rowing in, there are continued pricing activities that continue but there are a number of agreements that have already been established that we are waiting for the timing to click in as well. So its a combination of those price agreements that we\u2019ve already hit on as well as those that are continuing to be implemented. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, for my follow-up, in Consumer Brands, you've picked up some business at Lowe's, and I guess, you've lost some business at Depot. Like, on an annualized basis, is the sales benefit something on the order of $200 million on a four quarter basis? And I guess, I'll leave it at that. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Jeff. So if you look at 2019, you would expect it to be around that amount, maybe slightly below, but around that amount is a good start. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay great, thank you so much. John Morikis : Thanks Jeff. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with our question. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. Just very quickly within The Americas Group. Can you comment on the actual end market trends across luxury paint, commercial and property management. Just getting away from some of the 1Q noise, just what are your intermediates to long-term thoughts? And then also a quick comment on Latin America would be very helpful. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Yes Chris. John walked through the current quarter's performance by segment. We had another double-digit performance from \u2013 in the residential repaint segment, high single-digit in Protective & Marine and mid-single-digit in most of the balance. I will tell you, the outlook for new residential looks pretty positive. Most \u2013 among most public builders, orders, new orders and backlogs are up in the low teens. We've seen a continued significant home value appreciation that should drive strong remodeling activity. Harvard's LIRA forecasts 7-plus percent growth in remodeling activity through the year. The nonresidential square footage started the year pretty soft, but we expect commercial starts to grow this year probably in the range of about 4%, 5%. That translates to probably an equivalent level of growth in square footage. So new commercial looks strong. Residential repaint will continue to drive outsized growth in that segment because we're seeing probably a shift from DIY to do-it-for and a lot of investment amongst stay-in-place homeowners in upgrading their homes. John Morikis : And Chris on Latin America, I'll take that. As a reminder, Latin America represents about 3.9% of our sales. From a sales and volume perspective, all countries were positive both in volume and sales. Pricing continues to improve with more pricing rolling in. So same activities there that we just talked about. We've achieved some pricing, but we're working hard to drive additional pricing as well as other margin initiatives internally that we can pursue. Additionally, we're focused on pursuing more profitable segments and price points and customers, as you would expect, while continuing to look for additional synergy opportunities. So we didn't expect to go from a standing start here to a full sprint. This is kind of the path that we expected to see as we saw improvements in Latin America. So I'd say, it's progressing not fast enough for us. We want to move faster, and we're continuing to work with our teams to gain traction at a faster rate. Christopher Parkinson : That is helpful. And just you did hit a little on this, but just to dig, I guess, one step deeper. Can you just talk about the end market performance in Performance Coatings, specifically those assets acquired from Val? And also I recently saw some price increases in packaging, but kind of what else can you do throughout 2018 to look at the setup for 2019 a little more favorably? So just any insights there would be very helpful. John Morikis : Sure there are, to begin with there are some incredible sale synergies that our teams are working on. We're very excited about not only the pipeline or funnel, if you will, of existing identified sale synergies, but we're adding to those projects and programs every day. And so the more we work at identifying sales synergies, I'd tell you that the more we're finding the teams are energized and accelerating that.  So I think, first and foremost, the combined businesses are going to be much stronger and more meaningful, we believe, in the marketplace. And our continued efforts there will be to identify more. Now that said, there's a lot of work that we can do to continue to improve our performance back. And by segment, each of those business units have identified those levers where we can pull and drive results. But I'd say, when you look at the Valspar business and the transaction, we've always said we had high expectations in our ability to achieve the value capture. We knew we could get the costs out, and we're working aggressively to that.  And more confidence now than ever that we're going to be able to achieve that. But I'd also say that we have more confidence than ever in the sales synergies that are out there. And so our teams are working to identify those segments, those customers and how to better leverage the combined assets to drive the complementary nature of this business. Al Mistysyn : And on the pricing side, we have talked consistently about specifically on Valspar Performance Coatings side that we're one price increase behind. So we're going to chase that throughout 2018. That being said, as John mentioned, prices rolling in, and we expect that to continue throughout the year. Christopher Parkinson : That is very helpful thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : John you mentioned a few of these commercial expense line items that you're accelerating as part of that agreement with Lowe's, the sales expense, the marketing and displays and so forth. Are these onetime upfront line items that will dissipate over time? Or is it a matter of the expenses are recurring and the sales is going to lag before that shelf space in Lowe's is filled up with your product? John Morikis : Let me take a piece of that, Steve, and then I'm going to have to turn it over to Al. I will say this that our expectations here are to help drive Lowe's business. And so to answer it, it's a little bit of both. There are certainly some expenses that we're investing in. So we're adding additional people, for example, to be a little closer to the sales associates, to ensure better execution on the sales floor, right? So doing more of what we've done and wanting to drive better results requires a little different behavior. We think helping to have the sales associates become more familiar and comfortable with a simplified product lineup and technology, helping them to sell better in the aisle, all those things, we think, are better off with the additional investments that we're making.  When you look at the earnings release that we've posted, where this $0.40 hits in here and hits our EPS, part of that comes from the fact that, to your point, some of it hits in the third and fourth quarter, with very little sales recognition hitting this year. Let me just ask Al to touch on that a little bit. Al Mistysyn : Yes. It is really just a timing issue. As you roll the program out, we're basically missing the summer selling season on the paint side. But you're having the costs of those roll in and, as John mentioned, primarily in our third and fourth quarter. That being said, we're excited about the program. And 2019 certainly will be accretive to sales, as we've talked before, but ain't profit. Steve Byrne : Okay, thank you that is helpful. I wondering if you have made any changes yet in the China paint model of that wall room brand, the legacy Valspar brand. Have you made any changes in that overall model to accelerate sales? John Morikis : Not so much in the model, Steve, but we are in other areas. We feel as though we've got quite a bit to bring to that business in technology and the approach to growing our business that we're transferring there. Steve Byrne : Okay, thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Steve. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with you question. Don Carson : Yes, thank you. Going back to Paint Stores Group. You have 5.2% same-store sales growth. You're talking about Q2 and full year 2018 core sales up in the mid-to-high single high digits. So I assume Paint Store Group would be at the high end of that. What will be the price volume breakout there? Is price going to continue to add about twp points? Or given some of the increase we continue to see in TiO2 and with rising oil prices, you need another price increase in Paint Stores Group to maintain gross margins? Al Mistysyn : Yes Don, I think you are right. Price would be around that 2%. And as you recall, we went out on October 1, as we continue to roll that in, we might see a little bit more going in our second quarter. So the difference is volume, and you're absolutely correct, we do expect our stores, U. S. and Canada stores, to be in the high end of the mid-high single digits for our second quarter and for our full year.  As far as price goes, we have a long-standing tradition that we'll continue to monitor the raw material basket. We'll push back on our vendors. We'll try to internalize from cost reductions as much as we can. And then absent those levers, we'll talk to our customers first and then talk to The Street about it any other increases. Don Carson : As a follow-up on the raw material can you differentiate between what you are seeing on the architectural side versus the industrial side, particularly with epoxies on the latter? What's sort of the difference in your outlook for raw material increase between those two different end markets? Al Mistysyn : Yes Don, on the architectural side, the primary driver is still TiO2. And we're seeing a somewhat similar trajectory in TiO2 to what we saw in 2017. All the global producers, as we expected, have announced second quarter price increases that are currently under negotiation. But that's really primarily what is driving inflation in the architectural side. On the industrial side of the raw material basket, you've got crude oil, propylene, which also affects architectural coatings, but it affects the industrial piece. Epoxies, zinc, all heading in the wrong direction.  So we're seeing inflation from more of the raw material components on the industrial side. There's certainly inflation in the basket on both sides, probably more on industrial. Don Carson : Thanks Al. Al Mistysyn : You bet. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi, guys good morning. Just to sort of back up. Given that you stopped giving quarterly EPS guidance, did first quarter, from an earnings standpoint, play out the way you thought it would relative to your initial expectations? I know there are several moving parts such as weather, et cetera, that weighed on the quarter. But did the timeline of synergies come in ahead of your initial view? And how much do you think the unfavorable weather in the U.S. impacted the quarter the best you can tell? John Morikis : So I would say the quarter did come in a little bit better than what we're planning. We did have a lower tax rate in the quarter due to some discretes \u2013 the timing of some of the discrete items. But you look at the strength in our Consumer Brands and our Performance Coatings businesses, both outperformed even what our expectations were. So that's really why the quarter came in better. As far as weather is concerned, it's hard to pinpoint an exact amount on what the impact is in the quarter. Ghansham Panjabi : And just sort of a follow-up. Just given, perhaps, the weather disruption this quarter as well, at least the beginning of the quarter, how do you feel about your customers catching up to their backlogs as the year progresses in context of trades generally being tight from a labor standpoint previously? John Morikis : Yes, we have had a lot of discussion about that, Ghansham. And overall, I'd say, at this point, we still feel pretty good about the contractors' ability to maintain what they are calling or what they're projected to be a record year. We're working hard to help them with that. We\u2019ve talked a lot about the products have been developed to help their productivity and the services that we provide in our stores to be able to help them be responsive.  So it's going to be a push as we have a lot of people working hard on weekends and long hours. But right now, I'd say we're still confident in our ability to turn this into an outstanding year Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, terrific, thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. As I think about the manufacturing synergies associated with Valspar, I was pretty focused on your ability to consolidate their facilities. But now with this incremental volume going into Lowe's, how does that change the calculus there? Is having more volume better than shutting down more facilities? Or What if anything has changed? John Morikis : Absolutely having more volume better than shutting down facilities. But I think the teams is still on pace to rationalize the four facilities that they had talked about late last year, and that'll roll in, in our third and fourth quarters. And I think that team does a great job of finding capacity within the four walls that allows us to take on incremental business without adding significant assets or requiring us to keep the fixed assets. Vincent Andrews : And just a follow-up. The 600,000 shares repurchased in the first quarter, is there a reason why it was so large in the first quarter? And how should we be thinking about repurchases for the balance of the year? Al Mistysyn : No, I think if you look at, we have talked about offsetting option dilution, and typically, our first quarter is our largest quarter on options exercised and with restricted stock that's issued in the first quarter. So I think we are a little bit ahead of it. I would say the options didn't come in as heavy as we thought. So we'll monitor that as a year goes on and make sure that we meet our commitments that \u2013 and make sure we're paying down our debt to get our debt-to-EBITDA leverage down to approximately 3 :1 that John talked about. Vincent Andrews : Thanks very much. John Morikis : Thanks Vincent. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Mushkin : Hey guys, a lot of my questions have actually been answered. But, I have one, I think in the press release you guys talked about the choppiness of kind of the international markets. I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on that a little bit, kind of what you're seeing from the macro perspective in the industrial side of your business. John Morikis : Yeah, so when you look at our businesses, naturally, they don't move consistently across each business in one direction. So we have seen, in any region, some businesses performing better than others. But overall, collectively, those businesses are performing quite well. We've got a lot of confidence in the team. And I referenced just the terrific talent that's come from Valspar and the relationships that they have with their customers are just outstanding.  So a little bit of choppiness, I think, is pretty normal. We've got a lot of confidence in the team. And as we combine these businesses, as I mentioned earlier, then we have a lot of synergies for growth. Scott Mushkin : Alright, perfect. John Morikis : Thanks Scott. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. First question is just as we start to anniversary Valspar, the growth rate within Valspar businesses starts to matter more as we do our year-over-year. So within Consumer and Performance, how fast on a pro forma basis has the Valspar part of the business been growing? Al Mistysyn : So if you look at the \u2013 certainly, in the quarter, both the Consumer business was up over 13%, and the Performance Coatings Valspar business was up a similar amount. I'd temper the consumer business a little bit. I don't think we're expecting double-digit gains. We'll take double-digit gains, but I don't think we're expecting that out of that team on a longer cycle. But you would expect low mid-single-digit growth across the group. I think that's where we're starting to look, Duffy, is we've integrated so much and made such great progress, specifically, as John mentioned, on Consumer. It's hard to look at Valspar versus Sherwin. So we look at the group, and we're expecting low to mid-single-digit growth in that group. On the Performance Coatings side, the momentum they have, we're expecting a little bit better than that. And again, they're well down the path of integration, and we're looking at a combined business, and our outlook is to say that mid-single-digit growth rate is \u2013 mid- to high single digit growth rate is probably what we're looking at. Duffy Fischer : And then relative to consensus, you guys beat the first quarter pretty handily. You just talked about you beat your own internal expectations, but yet you brought the year down the same $0.40 that the Lowe's stuff is going to hit you. With a bad first quarter weather-wise and some momentum there, theoretically, pickup feels like that means Q1 through Q4 is a little bit light relative to what your original expectations are. Can you just kind of help triangulate some of those numbers? Al Mistysyn : Yes, sure. I mean first to be clear, we reaffirmed our original full year EPS guidance at the midpoint, and that's a 26% increase year-over-year. So you need to deliver, and we needed to deliver strong first quarter and get off to a strong start. As I mentioned, the tax rate was a little bit lower that gave us a little bit of a tailwind. We fully expect the full year to be in the next \u2013 rest of the quarters to be in the low to mid-20% range. And you know it, Duffy, our first quarter is our smallest and generally most volatile quarter of the year. It's been a long-standing practice of ours to wait and see how the painting season unfolds before considering revisions to the outlook. And I think that's served us well on the path, and we fully want to continue with that practice. Duffy Fischer : Terrific, thank you guys. John Morikis : Thanks Duffy. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. John Lowe\u2019s has a professional paint focus going forward. How do you make sure the incremental professional paints at Lowe's, to the expense of Home Depot or something else like that rather than your own Paint Stores? John Morikis : Yeah, so there is a terrific opportunity there. When you thing about the painting contractor that's painting every day, they typically have gravitated towards a specialty paint store, and we work hard to make that easy for them. But there is an entire customer base when you think about the home centers. People that use paint in part of their projects or part of a remodel project that is a little more difficult for our teams to reach through a specialty store. So we think it's a terrific opportunity for us, along with our customer, Lowe's, to better penetrate that. And we don't think at all that it's cannibalizing our core business. It's typically customers that are in home centers that are purchasing other products, be it drywall or plumbing or whatever it might be and using paint as part of that project. And we're really excited about working with our customer to reach those customers in a new and increased rate. David Begleiter : Very good. John lastly, in Performance Coatings, how would you characterize level of competitors for price increases in these businesses? John Morikis : I\u2019d say, when you think about this, when you think about the cost of goods, the raw materials represent 85% of the cost of goods. When the basket moves, you really need to get it. And our view is clearly on adjusting to the basket as it moves. I'd say that because nearly everyone probably has similar dynamics, many would feel the same pressure and probably have to take the same type of activities they hold. But we're more focused internally then we are from a competitive standpoint, and we let them make their decisions. We know we have to make ours. David Begleiter : Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Our next question  { Epart-054 } { 54-End } Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi, good morning. You guys clearly delivered on sales synergies by winning this Lowe's business. So question on this incremental business that you just won. Do you expect that to be a lower-margin business because of increased branding and marketing costs? And secondly, did you have to offer a lower price to win that business? John Morikis : Well, we don't talk about specific pricing or customers. But I would tell you that the value here is in the branding and the opportunity to help our customer reach their goals. We clearly have a raw material basket that's moving. We think it's just good practice for us to have open discussions with our customers about our need to remain whole to be able to serve their business and help them grow. And so that's the nature of our business. We're not going to give any specifics, but I would say that it's going to help our profitability. P.J. Juvekar: And is that help our profitability for next 12 months or is the profitability going to improve after the 12 months? John Morikis : No. If I understand your question correctly, we're going to have a little bit of drag that Al talked about that. That's the $0.40 that we talked this year as the cost moves in. But moving forward, next year, we expect that's going to help us, and our goal is going to be to grow that in both sales and profitability going forward, not just the one year. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then your LatAm business was quite strong. Revenues up 9.5%, profits were up. What are you seeing? Are you seeing a turnaround in Lat Am? John Morikis : The market is definitely starting to show positive signs. I think our teams are executing well. But again, I want to be very clear. While we're pleased with the progress, there's a lot of work for us to continue to work on. And our teams are really honkered down trying to do the right things here. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, P.J. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort : Thanks very much. Al, you guys gave an earnings number that excluded some of the one-offs that I think 3.57 was what you posted. Can you tell me what the EBITDA would be on a same basis? Al Mistysyn : EBITDA was up 6% in the quarter for the core Sherwin. That would have been \u2013 give me one second. So we would have made the $414 million versus last year $391 million, so up 6%. As we talked about 5.51, 5.52 is the total. Bob Koort : 5.52 has the one-offs. I guess, I'm trying to extract it to make it a like-for-like to the EPS number. Al Mistysyn : So you think about \u2013 it's about $30 million adjustment for the one-off. So I guess it would be at 30. Bob Koort : And then on TiO2, do you guys have any desire to enter into these long-term contracts that the producers are seeking? Or do you think this is just typical hard-core commodity so why lock in anything now if it might loosen up down the line? John Morikis : Bob, we have a terrific procurement team, as you know, and our goal is to do what's right. If they feel though \u2013 as though there's some benefit to lock up a piece or part of that, they have the ability to do that. We're not convinced that it has to be a one or zero here. We're looking at what's best for our shareholders long-term, and we'll take the appropriate action as they see fit. Bob Koort : Got it. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could comment just on the consumer business overall. The sales growth there was pretty good. Wondering, did you already see some additional load-in at Lowe's in the first quarter? Can you maybe walk through what you saw in sort of the different segments in consumer, including in Europe and in Asia? John Morikis : Yes. So Mike, we did not begin to see the benefit of the new agreement at this point. The growth primarily came through North America through a cross-section of customers, but primarily in the national retail category. And I'll remind you the Consumer Group pursues four segments. There's national retail, MRO in commercial; other retail; and as you mentioned, Europe and a small business in Asia there. The other thing \u2013 other point before talking about those other areas, I'd say, we did face a softer comp in the first quarter. So we did have a benefit of that as well. But when you look at the numbers, if we're going to move the needle, it's going to be in North America. The European business and Asia offer opportunities, but there's much smaller businesses. So there's a lot of effort going on there as the synergy opportunities are explored for technology and transfer just institutional knowledge, going both ways. But the reality is if we're going to be successful here, we've go to move the North American needle, and that's what we're working on the most. Mike Harrison : All right. And then you guided to $600 million of incremental sales for the two months of Valspar in the second quarter. It looks like that's maybe a little slower pace than I have. And you did about 10/60, $1.06 billion in the first quarter. Is that reflecting some of the changes with the big-box retailers? Or kind of how should we think about that contribution maybe being in the lower run rate than you were in the first quarter? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, I wouldn't read anything into that. It\u2019s approximately 600 for April and May, and then it rolls into our comp going forward. But nothing of concern in that run rate. Mike Harrison : All right. Thanks very much. Al Mistysyn : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning guys. In terms of gross margin, when you think about the 42.5, where does that go for the rest of the year? And what's kind of the embedded gross margin for the full year embedded in your guidance? John Morikis : Yes, we don't break out gross margin specifically in the guidance. But what I would just say is, as we talked about, our first half would be our toughest comparison on a raw material basis year-over-year. If raw materials trend like we believe they will, we should see sequential improvement. And I'll go back also, the original EPS guidance at $19.05, it's a 26% improvement. And embedded \u2013 implied in that is gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. That's the only way you can \u2013 we can get to those numbers. Mike Sison : And your raw material outlook is still low single digits? Al Mistysyn : Mike, its still 4% to 6% range, based on the first quarter running a little higher in terms of year-over-year inflation than we anticipated, we're likely going to push toward the higher end of that range for full year. Now as a reminder, that is our outlook for the industry on a basket similar to what we buy. That does not include raw material synergies. Mike Sison : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on the $0.40, as you head into 2019, will you overcome that $0.40, meaning that once you get the sales in from Lowe's and you you've got the costs embedded, is it a plus 40 plus next year? Al Mistysyn : Yes. It will be a plus 40. We're not going to probably talk about how much of it more than that. Mike Sison : Got it. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning, thank you. In response to an earlier question, I think you indicated potential for sales to Lowe's in the amount of nearly $200 million in 2019. My question is how would you characterize the amount of forgone sales at Home Depot relative to that number? And is there a timing difference between the load-in Lowe's versus the phase-out at Home Depot? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin, that was \u2013 the number I was quoting is the net number for 2019. As far as timing goes, Lowe's will dictate the cadence of the roll-ins, and Home Depot and that will happen this year as well. But much past that, we're not going to get into them a lot of the detail related to\u2026 John Morikis : I think out of respect to our customers, both Home Depot and Lowe's, we're going to allow them to announce when the different brands will be or will not be available. Kevin McCarthy : Fair enough. I appreciate that clarification. That was a net number. And then second for Al, given the change in tax regime and the lower rate in the first quarter of 2018, do you see any downward tension in your rate? I know you're affirming low to mid-20% range. But was the 1Q level strictly discrete items? Or is there any residual effect that you foresee? Al Mistysyn : Yes. The 1Q was the timing of the discrete items. And I would highlight, if you look at our core business, Valspar, Lowe's together, our effective tax rate was 19.4% versus last year of 22.7%. The impact of the acquisition-related costs drives the consolidated rate down. But really, nothing more than just timing of discrete items in that first quarter, a small quarter so has a bigger effect. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood : Thank you. Wanted to ask about the synergies, in your commentary, John, you mentioned synergies contributing to margins in the Consumer Group, but didn't mention it in the margin commentary for Performance Coatings. And that may just been the different trends, I just wanted to dig into that a little bit. And should we expect here on 2018 kind of sequential basis different cadence of synergy realizations? So I just wanted to check into that, see if there was something behind that. John Morikis : Yes, so if I didn't speak to the synergies, then the work that the team is doing on the Performance Coatings side, then that was an error on my part. A lot of good work and really terrific effort on the part of the Performance Coatings team as well. So yes, there are going to be synergies there. I will say that there are energies going to hit in 2018. And then as you look ahead, from a manufacturing standpoint, there'll be additional opportunities from an asset rationalization standpoint in the future that'll take a little bit longer as we get systems and processes in place to look at those outside of the U.S. that will benefit the Performance Coatings business the most. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Nishu, let me add that just if you look at the cadence of midpoint that we talked about, $150 million by quarter, it's really more front-end loaded than back-end loaded. That related to the projects that have been validated as we went through last year that we see going through the P&L and feel confident about and then the back half is really getting impacted by new projects, system implementations that John talked about and then factory closures that I talked about earlier. Nishu Sood : Got you. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And in terms of the Consumer Group, I know this will go away next quarter, but maybe the quarter after that, but in terms of the breakdown between the old legacy Valspar and the legacy Sherwin-Williams, quite a strong performance from the Valspar side of things, kind of continuation of trends on the Sherwin-Williams side of things. Wonder if you could just speak to that, and particularly, the acceleration on the legacy Valspar side. John Morikis : Yes. So I mentioned this briefly earlier that the way this business is managed and run now, it's very difficult to account for a sale or synergy on one side or the other. So as we brought the businesses together, for example, the sales organization is a combined sales organization. There were some sales reps that \u2013 there are some sales reps that were previously from Valspar, some from Sherwin-Williams, same with products. And so this is an area, as I mentioned, that we made the most progress in integration. So it's very, very difficult to account one side or the other. Our focus here is purely on doing what's right for the customer. And so if selling a gallon of Sherwin or a gallon of Valspar is what's right for the customer, we're pursuing that. We're adding that up and giving you that information as a legacy Valspar, legacy Sherwin. But it's not the way we are running the business, and it really doesn't account for the overall synergies and efforts that are taking place. It's probably the most area that's \u2013 the area that's most gray amongst all of them. Nishu Sood : Got you, makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Scott Rednor : Hey, Al, could you just clarify relative to the 1.40 to 1.60 of synergies this year, how much exactly was realized in 1Q? Al Mistysyn : If you split it, the 1.50 by four quarters, we saw a little bit more than that in our first quarter. That's the way I would characterize it. Scott Rednor : Okay, thank you. And then could you just talk to, on the paint store side within North America, the delta between interior, exterior, kind of what was the gap? And are you seeing that at all reverse here in April? John Morikis : Naturally, the interior was much stronger in the first quarter so there were high single-digit gains in interior and we were positive in the low or mid-single exterior. This time of year, we would expect to see more exterior gallons going out in the Southeast and Southwest than what we did and Eastern\u2019s impact was probably significant as well. Not so much that they saw the impact on exterior, but just on completion of projects certainly has an impact on business there. Scott Rednor : And then just \u2013 John, I mean, a few years ago, you guys put up a significant amount of SG&A spend into the Lowe's program. And safe to say that trailed some of the more robust expectations you have for that program back in 2014, 2015. How do you get confident that a higher level of spend right now you could get a return on that spend when you look to the next couple of years? John Morikis : Well, it's every element of the business, Scott. If you start with the fact that we've got a partner here, who is committed to us and us to them in this area of their business, so the opportunity to work collectively on a brand assortment, the training of their people, the simplified branding if you just look at it from that standpoint, instead of having two or three different brands in there, with sales reps all calling on the sales associate giving their feelings on which is the right product to sell and what's situation, the ability to better train and have them more knowledgeable about the product technology, I mean, every aspect of the business, we think, is terrific and meaningful. And when you look at the alignment that we have there, we think it's going to be a big win. Now that said, we talk a lot about their performance in North America. Their partners outside of that specific customer had a terrific first quarter as well. We've got great relationships with other customers that we're continuing to work, if it's Ace or Menard's or a whole host of other customers doing extremely well. So we're very pleased, and we're very focused on doing what's right for each one of these customers, and we think we've got some good momentum. Scott Rednor : Great. Thanks. Thanks so much, John. John Morikis : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I just want to confirm something. In your Wood Coatings business, your competitor was talking about seeing some weakness there because of the way Chinese are coating at the plant rather than coating in the field. Are you seeing that in your wood business? Or is your wood business primarily sort of plant-applied coatings? John Morikis : Well, there are two different areas there, Dmitry, right? There is the architectural type customers that apply wood in homes as well as the manufacturing. And there is a trend to having more of that product manufactured in a factory as opposed to staying and finished on projects. Dmitry Silversteyn : And then how does it affect your business? And is it positive for you either on top line or margin or neutral or negative? John Morikis : I'd say it's probably neutral. I mean, maybe \u2013 yes, it's an opportunity for us. When you look at our market share there, Dmitry, there's tremendous upside, and that's what we are focused on. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay, got it. And then just a bookkeeping question. Was there a foreign exchange benefit to your Performance Coatings revenue number? You provided for consumer and the Latin American piece, but I don't \u2013 maybe I missed it but not for performance. Al Mistysyn : On Performance Coatings, the FX impact on our PBT was about $4.6 million. Dmitry Silversteyn : $4.6 million, that's on profit, right? Al Mistysyn : That's on profit. Dmitry Silversteyn : So what was impact on revenue? Al Mistysyn : So the 3.9% is the tailwind. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay, thank you very much. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Dmitry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. I want to direct the question to Al, a technical question, Al. Looking at the purchase accounting impacts for the first quarter, there were $0.71, and the guidance was $2.65 for the full year, so not quite four times as much. Does that simply reflect the lower tax rate in the quarter? Are there some \u2013 or were there some one-time non-amortization items in the first quarter? Al Mistysyn : There's about $30 million of non-amortization type items in the first quarter. And Chuck, we called out $100 million for the year on one-time integration costs. And the way that would roll out would be, second quarter would probably be similar to our first quarter, and then it'll drop down from there. Chuck Cerankosky : All right, thank you on that. And then, John, when we're looking at pricing actions, Sherwin-Williams take, it seems that it's relatively easy, and I say that with much respect to get them through to the contractors. How do you look at same situation when you're talking to retailers and talking to OEMs? John Morikis : Well, I wouldn't say that any pricing is easy, Chuck. What we're trying to do is, I think we have done historically and Valspar has done historically as well, and that is continue to provide products and services that allow our customers to be successful. We're in the solutions business, right? So we're bringing products and services that help them reach their goal. And when our raw material basket moves, we have open discussions with them to help them understand what's happening from our cost standpoint. But I'd say this. It's not so much the discussion or that meeting that determines our success, Chuck. It's what we do all year. When we're working for our customers on a regular basis, helping them reach their goals, then as our cost goal, we are much more likely to be successful and having those cost discussions than having to come down to one discussion if you failed all years. So we're working hard every year to provide the great products and services that allow us to be successful when our raw material basket moves. Chuck Cerankosky : Understood. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thank you, Chuck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Hi, good afternoon. You operate your own truck fleet in the U.S. Is the tightness in the trucking market allowing your control distribution to laid again any share or provide any extra advantage right now? And are your costs inflating like they are in the third-party trucking market? John Morikis : The answer to your first question, I'd say that it is an important part of our service model. So the idea of being able to serve our customers with our fleet is one component, John, of what I just mentioned, having good service all year. We have about 700 drivers that operate 550 tractors, and they're an important part of our team. And so the ability to serve customers as a result of having our own drivers allows our drivers to make nighttime deliveries, for example, in our stores so that our store people could be more focused on our customers. To your point about the flexibility, we can be responsive as opportunities arise to be there when our customers need us. As far as the costs, we have terrific retention of our employees, including our drivers because we pay a very competitive wage, and we'll continue to do that. There's not been significant price or cost increases here, but we're also very sensitive to what's happening in the market to make sure that we're paying our drivers appropriately. John Roberts : Great. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Thanks. I had a quick one for Al and then a follow-up on price and volume. Al, the 3x debt-to-EBITDA leverage where does that go once we make the lease accounting adjustment? Does that change it by a turn? Or how do we think about that? Al Mistysyn : Yes, it won't change it. I think it'll change it by roughly a third to a half when we get the full impact of the leases on our balance sheet. Greg Melich : Got it. That's how much it will go up so when you go to that target to stay under three that will \u2013 it will bump up that sort of the headwind that you have until next year? Al Mistysyn : That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Greg Melich : Okay. And then on the business, I want to make sure I got the comp right and the price and volume mix. So the comp was 5.3. And let's say, price was 2, and volume was 3. Given that the rest of the year looks like the comp will need to be a couple of hundred bps higher, is that improvement in comp that you're expecting more from price increases rolling through or more from volume pickup? Al Mistysyn : It's going to be from volume. Greg Melich : So we should assume the price still stays around that 2 level? Al Mistysyn : Yes, I mean, certainly, you get a little bit improvement as we continue to work with our customers, but it won't be significantly more than that. Greg Melich : Okay, thanks a lot. Good luck, guys. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Patrick Lambert with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Lambert : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for picking. A few questions, this is mostly about the timing, timing of the $0.40 cost for developing Lowe's solution. If you could tell us that $0.20 in Q2 and Q3 and then almost breakeven in Q4, that's question number one. But the same question for synergies I think you've breaking the chance it would be above the same for each quarter, but just if you could confirm the impact of the synergies per quarter. And finally, raw materials, I try to get the absolute dollars headwinds in Q1. Is that still or is that a bit above $110 million of headwinds from raw materials? Thank you. John Morikis : So on the timing of the Lowe's program, I would say it's going to be more heavily weighted to our third and fourth quarters. As far as the synergy, Patrick, like I said, it's pretty, pretty even throughout the quarters but a little more heavily weighted to our first and second quarters. And on the raw \u2013 just the pure raw material dollars, the $110 million, I think, you said, sounds a little bit heavier than what I would say but not really materially off. Patrick Lambert : Its about $100 million. John Morikis : Sure. Patrick Lambert : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. John Morikis : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander : Good afternoon. Just two quick clarifications, you have some comments, sorry, about how your customers have improved their productivity. Does that \u2013 in the architectural segment, does that imply that the summer volumes could be higher than your historical growth rates? Or do you see the soft start to the year as more just pushing out into creating pent-up demand that will be satisfied in Q4? And secondly, I don't think there's any ambiguous in this, but apparently, there might be. Which of the earnings ranges is the benchmarks that you will be using to build your bridge to 2019? Al Mistysyn : So on what we're building, as our benchmark would be the consolidated, excluding the Valspar acquisition, 18.35 to 18.95. That's what I would have you focus on as our base going into 2019. Bob Wells : And in terms of the comments on customer productivity, I think the comment was we are going to do everything power to help our customers improve their productivity, both through product performance and service model, in an effort to, frankly, help them catch up. They fell a little behind in the first quarter. They've got a lot of work to do. They're going to be, we're sure, working longer hours, more weekends, but we're going to participate in that. Laurence Alexander : Perfect. Thank you. Bob Wells : Thanks, Larry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for taking my question so late. I was wondering if you could give us some details on the packaging side. One of your competitor is making progress and said that they are gaining share on the non-BPA coatings. Could you help us understand what is happening there, first of all, in terms of what your growth is in that category and then whether the industry, at least in Europe, has already caught up and everyone is more or less non-BPA? John Morikis : Yes. So the packaging business is our fastest-growing business in our Performance Coatings business. So we're thrilled with the momentum that we have there. The team is executing, and quite frankly, the technology that we have, we think we have a very unique technology that has really been very well accepted by our customers. And it's growing in acceptance here. And we're thrilled with it. It's performing very well. And from a market share standpoint, we think we're doing quite well. Rosemarie Morbelli : All right. And if we look at the general industrial side, could you give us a feel for the trends and the categories which are showing more improvement year-over-year and continuing in that particular vein? John Morikis : In general industrial, what you're talking about? Rosemarie Morbelli : Yes. John Morikis : Well, again, another strong performing area for our Performance Coatings business. They are having very good progress or they're making very good progress in various segments and different geographies around the world. So earlier there was a question about choppiness, and I made the comment about that it's not every business in every segment moving straight line. So here in the GI business, there are segments in, for example, North America that are doing very well, that may not be as performing strongly in other parts of the world. But collectively, that business is performing very well. Again, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, it's in the top two or three of the Performance Coatings segment. Rosemarie Morbelli : Could you share with us which areas are not doing as well in North America, for example? John Morikis : We don't \u2013 Rosemarie, we don't break into that business in great detail. But I'd say, overall, we're very pleased with the performance there. And this is another area, from a price standpoint, that they've got some very large customers. They've been working through pricing. And we're expecting to see price recovery in this space. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay, thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Rosemarie. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Bob Wells : Thank you, Jessie. As a reminder, our annual Financial Community Presentation is scheduled for Tuesday, May 22. It will be held in Boston. The program will consist of a brief business review by our segment leadership teams, including an update on our Valspar integration plan and progress. And presentations will be followed by a Q&A session and lunch with management. If you have not signed up and would like to attend, registration is still open. Send me an e-mail at rjwells@sherwin.com, and I will reply with a link to our registration site. Jim Jaye, our VP of Investor Relations and I will be available over the coming days to help you with any follow-up questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. I'd like to thank you again for joining us today, and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the Company\u2019s earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the Company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells. Bob Wells : Thanks, Jessie. Good morning, everyone. We\u2019ve provided a supplemental slide deck with a breakdown of our results by reportable segment on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations July 24th press release. Consolidated sales in the second quarter 2018 increased $1.04 billion or 27.8%, to $4.77 billion. Compared to pro forma combined results from second quarter 2017, consolidated sales for the quarter increased 7.5%. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the second quarter increased $304 million or 17.5% to $2.04 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the second quarter was 42.7% compared to 46.4% in the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $154.1 million or 13.4% to $1.31 billion in the second quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 27.4% from 30.9% last year. The decreases in both gross margin and SG&A as a percent of sales is primarily the result of a mix effect from the inclusion of Valspar. As a reminder, second quarter 2017 included only one month of Valspar results. Interest expense for the quarter increased $36.8 million to $93.5 million. The increase was entirely due to the acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before tax in the second quarter increased $29.1 million or 5.7% to $538.1 million. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 25%. We expect our core effective tax rate for the full year 2018 to be in the low-20s. Second quarter diluted net income per common share increased 26.5% to $4.25 per share from $3.36 in the same period last year. The $4.25 includes $1.23 per share in acquisition-related expenses, including purchase accounting and amortization, and a $0.25 per share charge from environmental expense provisions. Valspar operations contributed income of $0.91 per share in the quarter net of incremental interest expense. We\u2019ve summarized the second quarter earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our second quarter 2018 press release. Let me take a few moments to break down our performance by segment. Sales for The Americas Group in the second quarter increased $187.4 million or 7.7% to $2.63 billion. Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean increased 6.8% in the quarter. Regionally, in the second quarter, our Canada Division led all divisions, followed by Southwest Division, Southeast Division, Eastern Division and Mid Western Division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. Currency translation reduced net sales in U.S. dollars by 50 basis points in the quarter. Second quarter segment profit increased $37.2 million or 7% to $569.9 million. Second quarter segment operating margin increased 20 basis points to 21.7% from 21.5% last year, but we realized an $8 million unfavorable swing in other income for The Americas Group compared to second quarter last year. Turning now to Consumer Brands Group. Second quarter external net sales increased $241.3 million or 45% to $777.7 million. Incremental Valspar sales from April and May 2018 increased group net sales 42.7% in the quarter. Revenue reclassification related to the newly adopted ASC 606 reduced net sales by 5.1%. Segment profit for the Consumer Brands Group in the second quarter increased $14.8 million or 19.5% to $90.9 million. Segment profit for the quarter includes a $28.5 million charge for purchase accounting-related items. Segment profit as a percent of sales for the quarter decreased to 11.7% from 14.2% last year. For our Performance Coatings Group, second quarter net sales increased $608.2 million or 79.9% to $1.37 billion. Incremental Valspar sales from April and May 2018, increased group net sales 72.9% in the quarter. Currency translation rate changes increased segment sales $5.1 million or 67 basis points in the quarter. Segment profit for the Performance Coatings Group in the second quarter increased $81.8 million or 131.3% to $144.2 million. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit $2.5 million in the quarter. Segment profit for the quarter includes a $47.6 million charge for purchase accounting-related items. And segment profit margin increased to 10.5% from 8.2% last year. I\u2019ll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our Lead Pigment Litigation. In our Santa Clara County, California lawsuit, we expect the trial court judge to issue a preliminary decision in August regarding the amount of the abatement funds. This preliminary decision will be in advance of a hearing on this topic currently scheduled for August 17. We have the right to appeal if we disagree with the judge\u2019s ruling on the abatement fund amount. In addition, on July 16, we filed a petition for cert with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking discretionary review. We expect to hear whether the Supreme Court accepts the case during the fourth quarter of 2018. In the interim, we have filed a motion to stay the Santa Clara County, California proceeding while the Supreme Court petition is pending. We continue to believe that the judgment of the California court conflicts with established principals of law and is unsupported by the evidence. That concludes our review of our operating results for the second quarter. So, let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will \u2013 to make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of 2018. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll offer my comments on our second quarter results in just a few minutes. but I\u2019d like to begin by focusing on our outlook for the full year. As you read in our press release this morning, we\u2019re raising our full-year outlook for diluted net income per common share. This increase in our guidance is based on several factors that give us confidence in the second half of the year and beyond. First, our teams delivered a solid performance in the first half, and we exited the quarter with strong sales momentum, which is usually a reliable leading indicator. Second, the positive demand trends we see are broad-based across most businesses and geographies, which should support our growth expectations over the balance of the year. Third, we have great confidence in the ability of our operating teams to execute on growth initiatives, manage expenses and implement sufficient pricing to offset lingering raw material inflation. And finally, we feel good about our progress on the integration plans and synergy targets we laid out at the beginning of the year. As for our specific guidance, we expect third quarter consolidated sales to increase at a mid-to high single-digit percentage rate compared to the third quarter of 2017. Keep in mind; June 1st marked the one-year anniversary of the Valspar acquisition, which makes third quarter 2018 the first quarter in which our results will be fully comparable to last year. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect core net sales to increase mid-to high single-digit percentage compared to full-year 2017. In addition, the incremental sales from Valspar in the first five months of 2018 added approximately $1.85 billion to consolidated revenues. As we\u2019ve described on previous calls, the many moving parts in last year\u2019s results and this year\u2019s guidance can make it challenging to understand our underlying earnings per share performance. We believe the most meaningful way to view guidance is to back out the Valspar acquisition-related costs and other one-time items. On this basis, we are updating our expectation for our full-year 2018 adjusted diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $19.05 to $19.35 per share, a 27% increase at the midpoint compared to the $15.07 we reported last year on a comparable basis. This adjusted EPS range excludes $3.80 to $3.90 per share in transaction, integration and purchase accounting expenses, and the $0.25 per share charge we took in the second quarter for environmental provisions. Compared to the full year earnings guidance we provided three months ago, this revised range reflects our confidence that we will more than offset the earnings dilution from the rollout of the Lowe\u2019s partnership we discussed on our first quarter call. We\u2019ve included a Regulation G reconciliation table with this morning\u2019s press release to better illustrate all the moving parts. Our adjusted results in the second quarter were records for any quarter in our history in terms of net sales, gross profit and profit before taxes. Underlying demand remained solid across most of our end markets, and the Valspar business continued to add to our momentum. At the same time, year-over-year raw material inflation was slightly higher than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. This was primarily the result of higher-than-expected propylene pricing in May and June, which affected the cost of many petrochemical components in our raw material basket and resulted in a LIFO charge in the quarter. The LIFO charge, combined with a modest increase in raw material costs versus plan, pressured operating margins in all three reportable segments. At this point, it\u2019s unclear whether these factors will significantly alter our full year outlook for average raw material inflation. What is clear is that we will continue to work to offset these escalating costs by controlling spending and implementing price increases where necessary. Given that we now passed the one-year anniversary of Valspar, this will be the last quarter that we break out core Sherwin-Williams results versus Valspar results. Today, we are operating as a single integrated company. And from an accounting perspective, the divisions between the legacy businesses are becoming more blurred and less instructive. At this point, measuring operating profit across the legacy Sherwin-Williams and Valspar businesses is both difficult and somewhat arbitrary. All three of our reportable segments made progress in the second quarter in driving revenue growth and profit improvement. The Americas Group continued to focus on growing share of wallet among existing customers, opening new accounts and driving higher trial across our premium product lines and our e-commerce platform. Same-store sales in the quarter were fairly robust despite continuing market constraints in some regions, which slightly pushed some projects into the back half of the year. Sales to residential repaint contractors in the U.S. and Canada grew at a double-digit pace for the 17th time in the last 19 quarters. Protective & Marine coatings in the U.S. and Canada also grew by double digits. And property management, new residential, commercial, DIY and health care segments all contributed to TAG\u2019s growth in the quarter. Latin America sales increased 4.4%. It appears that the fundamental demand trends remains strong across the business. The group opened 18 net new stores in the quarter, bringing our total store count to 4,642 at the end of the quarter. Our full-year plan calls for this team to add between 90 to 100 net new stores in The Americas by year-end. TAG segment operating margin increased 20 basis points compared to the second quarter last year, despite the impact of slightly higher-than-expected raw material costs and the LIFO expense taken in the quarter. Operating margin on incremental sales in the quarter was in the mid-20% range. Our Latin America business operating margin was negative low single digits, which was a which was a drag on segment profit in the quarter. Gross margin for this segment was down modestly compared to 2017, but SG&A improved as a percent of sales compared to last year. Bob provided results for the Consumer Brand and Performance Coatings Groups compared to last year\u2019s second quarter as reported. I\u2019d like to look at our results for this quarter compared to pro forma combined results from second quarter 2017 to give you a clearer picture of the underlying performance of these segments. Consumer Brands Group sales increased 1.5% on a year-over-year basis compared to pro forma sales from second quarter last year. As Bob mentioned, the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard reduced revenues by a little over 5% in the second quarter this year. So it\u2019s a pretty solid sales quarter on a comparable basis. From a margin perspective, if you back out the impact of purchase accounting items in both years, adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 15.4% this year versus 16.2% on a comparable basis a year ago. The year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily a result of increased costs associated with the inventory build and load-in to support the expanded Lowe\u2019s partnership, higher year-over-year raw material costs and a LIFO charge. The Lowe\u2019s program is proceeding as planned and gaining momentum. Selected product category resets have been completed nationally, with the remainder expected to be completed this summer. We remain confident in achieving our shared goal of accelerating top growth in the Lowe\u2019s paint aisle. Performance Coatings Group revenues increased 11% compared to pro forma combined sales in the second quarter of 2017. Sales were up in every product category, most by double digits, led by packaging coatings, general industrial, coil and Industrial Wood Coatings. If you add back the purchase accounting items, adjusted operating margin in the quarter was flat to last year at 40% on a comparable basis and well above the 12.1% recorded last quarter. This sequential improvement in operating margin is a function of sales volume leverage, successful pricing initiatives, spending control and integration progress, all of which more than offset higher year-over-year raw material costs and a LIFO charge taken in the quarter. EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased, 29% to $1.33 billion in the first six months, compared to the same period last year. EBITDA margin for the first six months was 15.2% versus 15.8% in the same period a year ago. Six-month adjusted EBITDA, which excludes one-time transaction and integration expenses, was $1.40 billion or 16% of sales. Net operating cash year-to-date was $579 million compared to $586 million a year ago. As a reminder, net operating cash in the first six months last year included a benefit of approximately $88 million from settlement of a treasury lock hedge. On June 30, the company had $135 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to reduce debt and fund operations. During the quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.86 per share, paying $81 million in cash dividends. The balance sheet reflects total debt of approximately $10.4 billion. We intend to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to approximately 3 :1 by the end of 2018. We remain committed to reducing debt by $1 billion by the end of this year. Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $101.8 million. Depreciation was $144.1 million, and amortization of intangibles was $158.9 million. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $330 million, which is about 1.9% of anticipated sales. As we continue to invest in productivity improvements, systems and new stores, depreciation should be between $280 million to $290 million, and amortization will be about $325 million, including purchase accounting depreciation of $44 million and amortization of $300 million. We continued opportunistic open-market purchases of company stock in 2018 at a level sufficient to offset dilution from option exercises. In the first six months, we purchased 850,000 shares at an average price of $393.12 per share. On June 30, we had remaining authorization to acquire approximately 10.8 million shares. Finally, we continue to make good progress towards integrating Sherwin-Williams and Valspar into one streamlined, high-performance company. And I believe this progress is beginning to show in our results. Much of the heavy lifting involved in creating a fully integrated North American supply chain is behind us, and a wide range of opportunities to improve our productivity and operating efficiency outside of the Americas has been identified and are in process. We are on track to achieve our 2018 synergy targets and had booked a little more than half of the anticipated annual benefit to our P&L in the first half. Most importantly, our associates across all disciplines, sales and marketing, technical and operations, are embracing the vision and promise of this new organization. I\u2019d like to close by thanking all of our employees, who have worked so hard since we completed the Valspar acquisition on June 1st of last year. I\u2019m extremely proud of the progress we\u2019ve made, and my enthusiasm for the prospects of our combined organization has only increased over the past year. I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll continue to deliver superior value to our customers and reward our shareholders over the long-term. With that, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. John Morikis : Good morning, Arun. Arun Viswanathan : Yeah. Thanks John. So yeah, just a question on the raw material outlook. So I guess, just trying to understand what\u2019s embedded in your guidance raise of about $0.55 at the midpoint. Does that assume raw materials are stable from here or declining modestly or increase a little bit as well? John Morikis : Yeah. This is Bob. As we indicated in our prepared remarks, the raw material inflation for the industry in second quarter was slightly above our expectation, and that puts it just above the high end of our 5% to 6% inflation range for the full year. We originally said we expected raw material inflation to peak in the second quarter and moderate in the back half. And based on the recent move in propylene and some of the crude oil derivatives, we now believe that year-over-year raw material inflation will be higher than we originally expected in the third quarter. And we expect to see pricing stabilizing in the fourth quarter probably as opposed to declining meaningfully. So, our raw material outlook has changed somewhat, and that\u2019s embedded in the full-year guidance. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks, Bob. And then, Bob, on the tax rate, you\u2019re now guiding to low-20s. I mean, when we look at that, you\u2019ve previously guided at 20% to 25%. So is that, you\u2019re basically saying that you expect 1% to 2% average lower tax rate for the year? And I mean, if so, does that equate to about $0.20 to $0.30 of EPS? Maybe, you can just talk about that. John Morikis : Yeah, Arun. I do believe we\u2019re going to be in that low-20% mark. I think the \u2013 based on lower first quarter and where the year estimate was, I think that equates \u2013 I think it\u2019s closer to your $0.20 to $0.25 a share. But we did have goodness in our second quarter. We are consistently looking at lowering our tax rate. One way to do that is by consolidating foreign entities, and we have a large number of foreign entities today with Valspar. It's just hard to predict timing and, sometimes, magnitude of those changes. But we did have a consolidation in our second quarter that lowered the tax rate to that 20.5% core that helped drive that full year tax rate to the low 20s. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. And just lastly on the comp store sales. You noticed an acceleration for 5.2% to 6.8% in the quarter. Does that break out at, say, 4% volume, 3% price or 2.8% price? So both of those accelerated sequentially? Or was it a slightly different makeup? And then maybe you can just talk about your outlook for the rest of the year on comp stores. Thanks. John Morikis : Yes. The price/mix effect, Arun, in the quarter was approximately 2.5%. And I would say our outlook for the comp stores going forward is very strong. We're feeling \u2013 the momentum that we have here is terrific. I mentioned the res repaint business, the Protective & Marine all growing very strong. Every segment's moving in the right direction. So we're feeling quite positive about our stores, and we think that's only going to continue. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks guys. John Morikis : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys, good morning. Just to the follow-up to the last question on the 6.8% same-store sales growth. Do you think that it was weighed upon in any material way from weather early in the quarter that seems to have tripped up a lot of your peer group as well? John Morikis : Well, I'd say that what it did do is create some pressure in the sense that, that first quarter was tough. So the construction industry got off to a slow start, not just painting. And so it's pushed some volume, we believe, into the third quarter. The momentum that we have here, we think, is terrific. We think we're growing share. We're growing momentum. We think 6.8% comp is a good number, and we believe we're going to continue to grow. Al Mistysyn : What I would add to that, Ghansham, this is Al, is that as we even talked about on our first quarter call, we started up with a wet April. So as we progressed through the quarter, sales strength improved, which gives us that confidence going forward in the third quarter and the rest of the year. John Morikis : Yes, coming out of the quarter, it was \u2013 we're gaining speed coming out of the quarter. Ghansham Panjabi : Can you share with us exactly what that was coming out of the quarter? John Morikis : No. Al Mistysyn : We don't want to get that granular by month, but we did see an improvement as the quarter went on. Ghansham Panjabi : I had to try. And just my follow-up question on the organic volume growth by segment. Performance in consumer, there's a lot of moving pieces with FX and pricing, et cetera. Can you just kind of break out the volume aspect? Thank you so much. Al Mistysyn : So in the second quarter, you look at \u2013 really, we had price across all the segments, and we don't comment about each of the segments in price. But you can \u2013 but that it's close in that 2% \u2013 a little over 2% range. FX was fairly mild in the quarter. For the consolidated, it was only up plus 1/10 [ph] and even within the segments, they're all below 1%. And then, so if you just look at the sales of those segments, the rest has to be volume and mix. And Performance Coatings was very strong, with the double-digit gains on the pro forma. Consumer Group had a nice quarter when you \u2013 if you back out the revenue recognition adjustment that we took, which was almost 5% in the quarter. So I would say volumes are up across the board, and we're getting price. Ghansham Panjabi : Thanks so much. John Morikis : Thanks Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed. Emily Wagner : Good morning. Emily Wagner on for Don. Just going back to raw materials, given your higher outlook for the year, at what point would you expect your year-over-year gross margin to recover as well as segment margin recovery? Al Mistysyn : Our guidance at the midpoint of 19, 20, we do expect our gross margins to improve sequentially through the rest of the year. When we'll be able to get over the top of that, we're looking at early next year, assuming raw materials moderate some, as Bob talked about, in the back half. So sequential improvement in gross margin through the rest of this year, and we'll be looking to get on top of the year-over-year margin going into next year. Emily Wagner : Great. And as the follow-up in terms of the volume growth. So it seems like same- store sales, about 4% of it was volume growth. Does that imply that the U.S. market is growing at around 2% for the full year? What's your outlook for underlying U.S. demand growth? Bob Wells : Emily, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the DIY business has been a lot slower than the contractor side of the business. That's been true certainly in our own stores. We measure DIY sales to our stores. It was the slowest-performing market segment in the quarter. So while, clearly, the contractor business is growing well above that 2% range, it's \u2013 I think it's safe to assume that the market's probably grown between 2% and 3%. Our stores volume was a little ahead of 4%. Emily Wagner : Great. Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Mushkin : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. So I guess, I had two things I wanted to ask you about. Number one is, I mean, obviously, everything is going really well for the company. Even I think Performance Coating had a great quarter. As we look out with the fed raising interest rates, how do you guys think about, as we look beyond this year, just a general part of the business, and the fact that it's probably a little bit more exposed to the industrial economy. Bob Wells : Good question Scott. And obviously, rising interest rates would potentially have an impact on both the architectural side of the business and the industrial. If you look at the manufacturing sector in June, the PMI increased for the 22nd consecutive month. And the market's expanding in all regions, and production in inventories are growing at a faster pace than they did last year. So it's hard to point to any effect that the fed raising had had on the industrial economy thus far. On the construction and residential side of the economy, we believe the slower residential starts and resales are more indicative of supply constraints than they are weakening demand. So there may be constraints out there in the market, but they don't seem to be interest rate related at this stage. Scott Mushkin : Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, my second question. I think on the last conference call, you guys talked about maybe jumping back into the M&A market. And I did want to think about that in context of where we are from a macro perspective and maybe just get an update on your thoughts, how much \u2013 are assets getting more expensive? Kind of just give us an update on that, that would be great. And then I'll yield. John Morikis : It\u2019s hard to generalize on the question of are they getting more \u2013 increasing in value, perceived value of the owners or not. I think that varies. I will say this. We continue to monitor the industry for what we believe to be a good fit for Sherwin-Williams. And most likely, these deals in the shorter term will be smaller bolt-on that will help us expand technology and maybe add or enhance geographic \u2013 our footprint geographically. But we're out there. We're having good discussions. And we're engaged, looking for the right opportunities. We're not just out looking for anything to put us anywhere. We're very disciplined in our approach, and we're excited about some of the discussions we're having. Scott Mushkin : Hey, perfect guys. Thanks for taking my questions. John Morikis : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. John Morikis : Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer : Just around the big box business right now. Obviously, with DIY struggling, big shifts in the DIY aisle. Are you guys seeing any difference in behavior, either marketing programs or discounts, from a normal year? John Morikis : Duffy, if anything, we're seeing a more rational pricing environment than a year ago. So we're feeling pretty good about the environment as it exists. Duffy Fischer : Okay. Fair enough. And then could you give us some help with the mix shift on the SG&A line? That 27%, is that what we should kind of use to run forward? Or how will that line look over kind of the rest of this year and going into next year? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Duffy, if you \u2013 the way I look at it, the first half \u2013 the second half \u2013 let me say it this way. Our SG&A as a percent of sales should be down in the second half versus the first half. Duffy Fischer : Terrific. Okay, thank you, guys. John Morikis : Thanks, Duff. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi, good morning. John Morikis : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: A couple of questions on your Lowe's business. First, at Lowe's, you wanted to reduce number of combined SKUs and simplify the offering. Can you talk about that? And then you also mentioned the initial fill and loading at Lowe's. Was there any benefit in the quarter from initial fill? John Morikis : Let me take the simplified product offering, and I'll ask Al to comment on your second part of your question, P.J. We're not going to give any of the specifics, but I will share with you the overall direction we are taking with Lowe's is to, in fact, simplify the offering. And part of that comes with less suppliers. Another portion of that comes with the recognition that by simplifying the offering, we can make it easier for both sales associates and the consumer to understand. So we feel we have a terrific lineup that's going to be rolling out. And we're really excited about our relationship with Lowe's in the future here, and we think it's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to add shareholder value. Al Mistysyn : So on the rollout, P.J., the \u2013 we're ahead of schedule with aerosols, interior and exteriors paints set nationally, and paint rolling out as we speak. The adjusted sales, over 6% on the pro forma basis, excluding rev rec, was solid. However, the costs were higher in the quarter for the Lowe's expenses than we had planned. And as the \u2013 including the raw material, higher than we thought, our margin declined. So we're not going to break out how much is related to Lowe's going forward. We just want to be sensitive to our customer, and we also want to be sensitive to \u2013 they're driving the rollout, and we feel good about where we're at there. That all being said, if you look at our year-to-date margins, along with price and good cost control and the volumes we're seeing, our operating margin's up, and I think the team has turned in a solid performance. P.J. Juvekar: Great. Al, a question for you on LatAm. Sales were up 4.4%, but just in the last few months, currencies have come down significantly. They're down double digits year-over-year. Economy has slowed down, particularly in Brazil. I'm just wondering if you have any comments, given your negative margins in second quarter. Do you see that getting worse before it gets better? Al Mistysyn : Yes, because as you know, P.J., majority of the raw material costs are dollar-denominated. And as we see the devaluations, our costs go up. Raw materials are a similar percent to sale. Percent of cost of goods sold as in the U.S. So we're going to be chasing price with the significant devaluations we saw in Argentina, Brazil and even a little bit in Mexico. So \u2013 and that is built into our full year guidance. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Bob Koort : Thank you very much. I wanted to ask you in the Performance Coatings area. You guys acknowledged there was some lag in pricing there, but obviously, you've made up some pretty significant margin improvement. Can you talk a little bit about how much that came from synergies, how much came from price? And then what there may be still on the horizon from latent price hikes that are still working their way through? John Morikis : Bob, we have pricing that has taken effect. We have more pricing that is rolling in. And we're really proud of the team's ability to retain these customers, grow our business while getting the price in. It's a challenging market when you think about what's happening from a raw standpoint. But we think we're really teaming up with the right customers. We have great relationships with customers that are trying to grow their business, and we're finding opportunities for new business as well. So we have good pricing in, more is rolling in, and good momentum. So the team's doing a terrific job. Al Mistysyn : What I'd comment, Bob, on the raw material synergies is we haven't broke out synergies by segment. But what I would say is we are still on track for the $140 million to $160 million in synergies for the year. We've booked a little bit more than half of those in the quarter, and those are really broken out between \u2013 I'm sorry, in the first half. And those are really broken out primarily Consumer Performance Coatings, and then you get some in corporate. Bob Koort : Got it. And then one of your bigger buys is TiO2, and it looks like there may be some conclusion and some consolidation in that industry. I'm wondering, how could that affect you at all? And is there any more desire in your part to engage in some of these longer-term fixed price contracts there? Bob Wells : Yes. The TiO2 market is kind of in flux right now. You've probably read a lot about the supply-demand balance evolving in Europe. We don't think that, that is going to materially affect the market in North America this year. We commented in the past that we are going to negotiate raw materials in a way that will benefit our shareholders if that means locking in longer-term agreements to ensure supply and to achieve stable pricing. And that's a benefit to our shareholders. We would do that. But we're cautious about the timing of these longer-term contracts relative to market pricing when the suppliers are [indiscernible]. John Morikis : Our teams are very well aware of where we are in the cycle and are adjusting accordingly. So we're going in with our eyes wide open, Bob. Bob Koort : Got it. Thank you. Bob Wells : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thank you. In the supplemental slides, since this is the last quarter we're going to get the breakout between Valspar and legacy Sherwin, could you just comment on the consumer performance segment on the different growth rates we see between Valspar and Sherwin contributions there? Is that just the easier comps in the Valspar numbers? Al Mistysyn : John, I think that we saw 5% growth on the Valspar on a pro forma basis down. But on the core Sherwin, if you back out the impact of the rev rec, we're still up low single digits. And I'd say that's kind of where we expected to be. Yes, we're going against a softer quarter, but I think the team is going well. And as we looked at the different segments, of national accounts other than Lowe's, commercial, Europe, all positive. And like we've talked about in the past, we do have headwinds in that retail segment. John Morikis : But John, to be clear, the teams aren't as concerned with are we selling Thompson's or Cabots. We're just trying to sell. So the line's quickly blurred when we consolidated those teams together and gave them one sales goal. So we're reporting a number that we're not \u2013 truly, we're not managing the business that way. We're reporting a comp number, but we're focused on growing sales. And we're not concerned with which brand the team sells. John Roberts : Okay. And as a follow-up, now that we're in the third quarter, when we seasonally go into the fourth quarter later this year, should we expect a similar seasonal sales drop to the second half last year? You had Valspar in both third and fourth quarter last year. But maybe, seasonally, the EBITDA might decline a little bit more sequentially fourth versus third because you're further along in the cost savings, and you had more sequential progress going on last year? Al Mistysyn : Yes. I think that\u2019s a typical \u2013 I agree with what your first statement John is. That's our typical flow. And I would say, even though with Valspar and the bigger industrial business were less seasonal than we used to be, we still do have a seasonal impact in that third going to fourth quarter. Bob Wells : And also John to add to that, we are going to achieve more year-over-year synergy benefits in the first half than we're going in the second half. John Roberts : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Vincent Andrews : Thank you very much guys. Could you just quantify the LIFO charges by segment? And should we be anticipating any further LIFO charges in the third quarter or obviously in the fourth quarter? Al Mistysyn : Vincent, we\u2019re not going to call out the individual LIFO charge by segment. It's a function of increasing raw materials. And with the raw costs being up more than what we had thought coming into the quarter, we had to true that up in our second quarter. So you estimate what the full year LIFO is, you have to take half of it through your first half, and that's what we did. But I don't want to be quantifying what those are by segment. It's all part of the raw material increase, in my mind. John Morikis : to that point, Vincent, Al's point about the raw material cost increases, that's what drives our thinking about our price to our customers. And as we've talked on numerous occasions, we stay very close to what's happening with the total basket of raw materials. When we see that basket move, we've historically demonstrated the ability and our effective pricing through our stores and other businesses here to put that pricing in. And no one should question our conviction or our determination to continue to manage those margins. When we see pricing move, we're going to \u2013 we move. And as we have historically approached this, the practice is to communicate the price increase to our customers first and then to the investment community. So we'll be talking to you about our activities likely in the near future. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Just as a follow-up, at Lowe's, now that you're the sole paint supplier, has anything changed about the mechanism by which you can sort of adjust prices versus raws in that line of your business? John Morikis : Yes. We have a good agreement with Lowe's. We're not going to get into the details of any mechanisms, but suffice it to say, we've got a program that's going to keep us both focused on growing sales and not arguing about price. Vincent Andrews : Excellent. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. John Morikis : Thanks, Vincent. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. David Begleiter : Thank you. John, on Valspar, looked like you did better than you expected in the quarter. I think you were expecting $600 million worth of sales. You did closer to $800 million. When did that really pick up? And what drove that better-than-expected performance? John Morikis : Well, you have to look at our Performance Coatings business up 11%. And as we talked about in the prepared comments, nearly every one of those segments up double digits. So this is a wonderful team that we've inherited with great products, great relationships with customers. And combined, we're finding that it's an even stronger value proposition to our customers. So the Performance Coatings business is, as I mentioned before, growing well, and we're implementing the price that we need. So we're feeling really good about that and the future. I mean, there's \u2013 I think there's really a sustainable growth pattern here. And then on the consumer architectural side, again, a wonderful leadership team with great products and great relationships with customers that we're trying to really leverage to the fullest. So we're really happy. I've often said how thrilled we are with the Valspar acquisition. And I know it sounds a bit repetitive, but I'm happier right now with Valspar than ever. And the future is only stronger for us. So we're feeling this has been a terrific move for us. David Begleiter : And John, in that business, amongst packaging, GI, coil and wood, had Valspar lost some share that you are now gaining back? Is it helping to drive some of the heightened sales growth here? John Morikis : No, I don't think so. I think we've been open about that they've not been outlook pricing. But I don't think that they've lost share. In fact, I think we'd be hard-pressed to point to any single customer that we've lost. I mean, we've been very successful in retaining customers and the employees. So it's going very well. David Begleiter : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Given the raw material backdrop as it stands, at least one of your competitors has pointed to opportunities to reformulate. Do you see any opportunity at Sherwin to reformulate in terms of pigment contents, resin systems or other inputs? John Morikis : Yes, Kevin, we\u2019re formulating for TiO2 efficiency truly has been something that we've been doing for many years. And there are a number of products that are commercially available to help formulators with that. We also have our own proprietary technology that we've developed internally. Our approach to this is very unique. You have to keep in mind that our customers have very, very high expectations for consistency. When you have the mix of business that we have with a professional painter, close isn't close enough for our customers. So we go through an extensive commercialization process. We've got a number of checks and balances. So it's in our repertoire of tools that we use, but we're also very cautious in how we approach this to ensure that it, in most cases, ends up with an increased or improved attribute for our customers. Kevin McCarthy : Second question, if I may, on capital deployment. I think you articulated some specific goals for leverage. Just wondering if you could comment on repurchase activity in that context. Looks like you \u2013 if my math is correct, you would have purchased 0.25 million shares in the second quarter, down a bit from 1 Q. What sort of pace might we anticipate the back half? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin, you are correct. We did purchase 0.25 million shares, bringing our full year year-to-date total to 850,000 shares at $334 million. I think if you look over the last three years, our option dilution has been approximately one million shares. We're running a little above high net so far year-to-date, but we'll watch that. We'll continue to look at buying shares opportunistically. But we'll look at the options and adjust from there in the second half. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you so much. John Morikis : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Hi, good morning. John Morikis : Good morning, Mike. Mike Harrison : Just looking at the Just looking at the consumer business and the differences in the performance between Valspar and Sherwin, did both pieces have the revenue reclassification? Or was it just Sherwin that had that headwind? Al Mistysyn : Both had the headwind, and it was split 50-50 roughly. Mike Harrison : Okay. And then was wondering if, within that consumer business, you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the Valspar China architectural business. How did that do in the quarter? And are you seeing any reason for caution going forward in China? John Morikis : I would say for both Europe and China, the architectural businesses were positive. And we see continued opportunity for profit improvement in both of those regions. We're staying close. We're learning a lot as we go, and we'll be making appropriate investments as we see the opportunity for disciplined growth. Mike Harrison : All right. Then last one if I could, is regarding the environmental item this quarter. I feel like in the past, you guys haven't backed those out, but this one seemed a little bigger and maybe more significant. Can you give us some detail on what that entailed? Al Mistysyn : Sure, Mike. Historically, we have backed out significant adjustments to the environmental provision. This is one \u2013 as you can expect, the timing and magnitude of some of these adjustments are harder to predict. So this one in particular relates to one of the large sites that we've been investigating and remediating on an ongoing basis and quite honestly, there's more to come related to that site. It's just \u2013 again, it's hard to predict timing and amounts. But as soon as we know it, we adjust the provision, and then we call it out. Mike Harrison : All right. Thanks very much. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Thanks. I have a follow-up on sort of looking at the back half and the guidance and how SG&A flows through. So if gross margins are going to be under some pressure just given raws, to get there, it looks like SG&A will still be under some pretty good control. You keep it around where it is, maybe growing 2% year-over-year. Does that fit with where your guidance and what you're thinking? Al Mistysyn : I think, we don\u2019t walk down the P&L in detail. But I think you're going to see leverage on our SG&A. As our volumes continue to grow, you would expect to see our leverage there. We still have more synergies rolling in, in the second half. So yes, you should expect to see a sequential \u2013 like I said, a second half being lower than our first half as a percent. John Morikis : And Greg, to your point, price rolling in as well. Greg Melich : And the price that we have right now, price/mix coming in at like 2.5%, it sounds like that's still rolling in. So that might move up to sort of like 3% and then plateau into the fourth quarter. Is that a fair way to think about it? Al Mistysyn : Yes, I think we have prices rolling in. It's across the different segments. It doesn't roll in as uniformly as our stores group. So yes, there is still pricing going in. Greg Melich : Got it. And then I had a follow-up, as far as we haven't gotten there yet. I know it's probably not big for you guys, yet the \u2013 with all the tariff talk around the world and different things, particularly China, is there anything that you're bringing in that's material that we should be aware of in terms of what's sourced overseas that could be subject? Bob Wells : And specifically, we look at the tariff impact on our raw material basket first and foremost. And frankly, at this point, we don't believe the impact of at least the proposed tariffs at this point will impact our raw material basket substantially. Right now, steel and tin plate is where we're seeing most of the effect, and it's not material to the raw material basket certainly relative to the petrochemical proportion of the basket and TiO2. But as you know, it's an evolving story, and future impacts are not entirely clear. So we're keeping an eye on it. Greg Melich : Great, thanks guys. Good luck. John Morikis : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thank you. I understand it's relatively new, but can you give any broader updates on your Americas e-commerce efforts and how you feel this will evolve over time? It seems like you're in the process of building on some sort of foundations to boost pro growth and reduce some costs. But just how should we think about this across your relative customer groups? And what inning would you characterize this in? Thank you. John Morikis : So, Chris, I\u2019d say we\u2019re in a very, very early innings of what we consider to be a very exciting opportunity. And the opportunity here to build on existing relationships and leverage the distribution points that we have in our store are really exciting. And so when you look at the opportunity to capture additional share of wallet and grow customer \u2013 or grow our customer base through these platforms of distribution, it \u2013 this e-commerce initiative is just a natural, the ability for customers to do business with us 24 hours with the ability to understand their projects. And we've got a lot of features that we're building into this to increase the loyalty of our customers to our brand and to our stores. And we're in the process of developing more and more features. We're rolling out in different areas, different \u2013 testing different areas geographically. And when it all comes together, we're really believing this can help us in quite a dramatic way. So it's an exciting initiative for us. Christopher Parkinson : And just a quick follow-up. Can you just talk a little bit more about the recent reductions in some regional housing inventories? Just how should we think about this and \u2013 or interpret this on a relative basis versus the home appreciation that we're seeing? Just how \u2013 what do you think about these two various drivers and how it should drive revenues in Americas? And then just any quick comment on residential versus commercial labor constraints would also be appreciated. Thank you. Bob Wells : Yeah, Chris. This is Bob. Let me handle the inventory effect on resales, and then I'll ask John to talk about commercial labor constraints and the like. I mentioned earlier that the slower residential starts and resales are more indicative of supply constraint than weakening demand. That's true both in the new home market and the resale market. If you saw the June print, inventory was at 4.3-month supply. It is \u2013 that's very tight. It's up a little bit from the May print, but it's still really tight relative to what's normal. Home prices jumped 5.2% year-over-year, which is a pretty big move. And we kind of consider it to be a trade-off. While existing home turnover, which has been relatively weak, drives repaint activity, these \u2013 the rising home values and rising equity values among stay-in-place homeowners seems to be driving kind of a historic rate of remodeling activity by stay-in-place homeowners. We think baby boomers are kind of leading that parade. If you watch the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, leading indicators were remodeling activity for second quarter 2018, reaching an all-time peak at $324.1 billion, which is up more than 7% year-over-year. And they expect that rate to remain above 7% for the foreseeable future even in just -- like into 2019. So it's certainly a mixed bag. We'd like to see more existing home turnover, but it doesn't appear to be harming the repaint and remodel market. And as John mentioned earlier, 17 of the last 19 quarters, we've seen double-digit growth in residential repaint. So we're not \u2013 could that be stronger probably? but we're not complaining. John Morikis : Yeah. To Bob's point and just in traveling with our team, I do hear from residential repaint customers but more so from new residential, commercial and industrial customers as it relates to labor, making the comment that's pretty commonly heard, which is that they could do more work if they had more labor. The net effect of that, if there's a positive, is that they are able to get more pricing into the market, and it's likely prolonging the cycle here. But we continue to hear from our customers the issue of labor. Christopher Parkinson : That\u2019s very helpful detail. Thank you. Bob Wells : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning, everyone. Related to the last question with regard to the strength in housing values and interest in remodel activity, how about \u2013 how does that affect commercial architectural markets that support increasing household formation? Bob Wells : I'm not sure I get the question, Chuck. Do you mean how does that support, like, multifamily development? Chuck Cerankosky : Well, that as well because there's homes for sale but also commercial establishments that might be benefiting from increased household formation in particular areas. Bob Wells : Got you. One of the constraints in addition to labor that we're seeing in the market that's becoming more and more of an issue is the scarcity of buildable land. It's extremely expensive to develop raw land into buildable land today, which means, to your point; we\u2019re not seeing these communities push out into undeveloped regions of the suburban markets. And hence, there's not as much of the commercial development that springs up around these new communities. Everything from grocery stores to gas stations, movie theaters, schools, hospitals, et cetera, new land development drives development in those projects. What we are seeing, though, that's kind of an offset is more urban core development. Downtown high-rise development is really strong. And in fact, our people tell us that the published data around non-residential starts, non-residential square footage is probably understating what they are seeing in the market. John Morikis : There\u2019s a number of small and medium-size projects that may not be hitting the radar that our people are tracking. Chuck Cerankosky : All right. Thank you. Good luck for the rest of the year. John Morikis : Thank you, Chuck. Bob Wells : Thank you, Chuck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hi guys. Nice quarter. I think you mentioned adjusted EBITDA for the first half is $1.4 billion, so to think about that on a margin basis, about 16%. Do you think that EBITDA margin improves in the second half of the year versus the first half? Al Mistysyn : The EBITDA margins should be \u2013 yes, the answer is yes. I believe we should see a slightly better EBITDA margin in the second half versus the first half. Mike Sison : Great. And then if you think about getting to your 2020 goal of like 19% to 21%, you've still got a way to go there, right? So can you maybe remind us of how you ramp that up in 2019 and into 2020 from this year? Al Mistysyn : I mean first, you got to start with the demand and the continued above-market demand and sales that we're generating. The price increases that are going in, we'll continue to pursue price increases, working with our customers until we can see some relief in the raw material basket. We're going to still have incremental synergies next year that you talked about. We earned $60 million in 2017 at the midpoint of $150 million, $210 million, and we have a $320 million run rate synergy number coming out of 2018 that we reaffirmed in May at the investor community presentation, I'm reaffirming today. So now you look at the \u2013 and I would add the Lowe's business that we talked about being accretive going forward from a top-line and bottom-line standpoint. So those are the levers that we're going to continue to push to get to that 2020 goal. Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. What fraction of your sales in your Paint Stores Group, would you characterize as being from customers that are very loyal, buy a large percentage of their paint from Sherwin stores versus another bucket that spread their purchases around and aren't terribly loyal? How would you characterize that split? And of that doubling of the market growth and over 4% volume in the quarter, how would you allocate that between those two buckets? John Morikis : Yeah, Steve. I would say that maybe half, slightly maybe below half would be what we would call those primary or true loyal customers. So we have a terrific opportunity, we think, to grow share of wallet here. We've got quite a bit of runway there and the other pieces through the opportunities with new accounts. So we're working every one of those angles. Allen Al Mistysyn : Yeah, Steve. And I would just add and I think you can see those initiatives paying off in our comp store results in our second quarter being up 6.8%. Steve Byrne : And so what do you do for those \u2013 that just over a half of your sales are from customers that aren't very loyal, how do you change that and change their purchasing behavior? Al Mistysyn : Well, there is a very detailed program that we probably don\u2019t want to share on a public call of activities that we do see. But rest assured of this : we don't open our stores and hope people come in. We're very aggressive in the pursuit of customers, in trial and having discussions about increasing the value proposition and helping our customers to be more successful in achieving their goals. And we align our people, our products and our services to help our customers reach their goals. That's how we do it. Steve Byrne : Okay. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn : Thanks for keeping the conference here going, so I can ask the question. Just a quick sort of clarification on the Paint Store Group \u2013 or I'm sorry, the \u2013 not the Paint Store Group, the performance group. It looked like you've closed some branches. I'm assuming that's part of your kind of a longer-term program to streamline your operations, but I just want to make sure that there's nothing more to it than just the rationalization of sites. John Morikis : No, there's no structural changes. Well, in fact, we're looking at making investments in areas that allow us to serve our customers better. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay, that\u2019s great. And then on the store additions for The Americas Group, were there any store reductions in Latin America? Or is it just net additions in the U.S.-Canada portion of the business? Al Mistysyn : Dmitry, we did have some reductions early in the year, but we're -- we should be on pace for additions. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. I\u2019m talking about this particular quarter. So last quarter, you reduced sales \u2013 or reduced the store network by 7, looks like, in Latin America and then increased a little bit in Americas. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. One store came out of Latin America in the quarter. Dmitry Silversteyn : So you opened up 19 in the U.S. Okay, that's what I needed to know. And then finally, you've talked about pricing obviously. I don't want to beat a dead horse here. But given that your raw material inflation is a little bit higher, maybe at the higher end of your original expectations, is there a need to get another round of price increases in your company-owned stores? I understand that the DIY channel is its own animal, but just maybe your company-owned stores or the price increases you got at the end of last year, beginning of this year, even with a little bit higher material inflation, you're thinking you're okay on margin until you get to 2019. Al Mistysyn : Dmitry, and I made this comment earlier. It's a terrific question, and I'm going to just repeat a portion of this, and then I'll expand on it, which is that our historic practice has always been to talk with our customers first and then the investment community. And I do really want to be very clear about the comment I made about our conviction and determination to protect our margins. We just do not want to get in front of the conversations with our customers by having a conversation here today first. So, I\u2019ll just leave it as we are going to protect our margins, and we're going to talk to our customers first. And you can connect the dots from there. Dmitry Silversteyn : Got you. And then just final question on bookkeeping. The Latin American business, a foreign exchange hit in terms of revenue. Can you \u2013 I mean, you talked about the Americas overall, but in terms of Latin America, how much was foreign exchange a headwind for you in terms of revenue numbers? Al Mistysyn : It was almost 12% headwind in the quarter, which was a significant change from the first quarter. Dmitry Silversteyn : Yeah. Okay, yeah, because last quarter, it wasn\u2019t that a bit, okay, almost 12%. Okay, that\u2019s all I had. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Dmitry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Justin Speer : Thank you. Just wanted to go back to the discussion on the intermediate-term revenue growth and the EBITDA margin goals that you guys laid out, the roughly 19% to 21%. I just want some \u2013 maybe some help putting context around the midpoint upside of that band and your confidence \u2013 I guess the confidence in achieving the midpoint or the high end of that band at this point. Did any of the current price cost or currency dynamics change or alter your view of achieving the midpoint or the high end of your intermediate-term objectives as we look out? Al Mistysyn : No. I think we\u2019re not ready to say we\u2019re not going to be able to hit that midpoint. I think the pricing actions that we have in and rolling in across some of the other businesses and looking forward, historically, we've been able to catch up on raw material costs, and we take a short-term hit in our margins. As pricing rolls in and raws roll over along with the other good cost controls and things we do, we're able to expand our operating margins. And we still feel like we are going to be at the midpoint of that range. John Morikis : Yeah. I think Al's comment in the last call was of reconfirming our position here. We've got work to do, but we clearly see the path, and we're working our plan and expect to be able to reach our goal. Justin Speer : And the Valspar numbers were the big thing or at least relative to our model with regards to the upside on the revenue profile. Was that like, I guess, a mapping of the synergies coming in maybe sooner than expected? Or is it seasonality? What led to that? And is it going to change potentially the revenue synergy portion of the Valspar synergy targets that you've laid out? John Morikis : Are you talking \u2013 I just want to make sure we understand the question. Are you talking about the mapping of the value \u2013 or the synergies? Justin Speer : Well, like for the first two months of the nonorganic piece, the first two months that's not organic was much better. It's like roughly 30-plus better than what you were anticipating. And I know that the underlying core business sounded really good, but at your Analyst Day, you talked of the potential for revenue synergies in this business. And I'm just curious if it's changing your view of the potential of the combined business as you look out over the intermediate term now you've had it for a year in the portfolio. Al Mistysyn : I think the revenue synergies that David outlined on PCG at the Investor Day were right on. And every month, we have a management meeting, and we \u2013 and every quarter, we review their progress and making those revenue synergies. And as the teams continue to get together, I think more ideas are coming out. And it's just now prioritizing those to make sure we're putting the resources behind the ones we think will have the most impact. And I'd say we're making good progress there. Justin Speer : Okay. Last question from me, The incremental drag from the accounting change, I don't know if you walked through the impact to all of the segments. I know it was in Consumer Brands. But what were the impacts to the other segments from the accounting change? And relative to the full year guide that you put out, what kind of drag are you looking for, for the year incrementally from the accounting change? Al Mistysyn : It\u2019s predominantly the Consumer Brands Group. There is no material impact to the other groups. And the year-to-date impact that we called out, it most likely will be close to that number. Justin Speer : So, about a point hit to the full year, kind of all else equal, from the accounting change? Al Mistysyn : Maybe, a little less than that, but that's in the ballpark. Justin Speer : Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate it. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood : Thank you. Wanted to ask first about the increase in the guidance for the acquisition-related costs, $3.40 to $3.50 to the $3.80 to $3.90 range. I think you laid out in the amortization discussion that it's not there. So just wanted to get a sense of what was driving that. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Nishu. We finalized the acquisition valuation in this quarter, and it resulted in our reversal of tax benefit that impacted EPS $0.29 a share, that was previously recorded in our fourth quarter. This increased our income taxes, and it was included in transaction and integration costs, as you mentioned, because we wanted to keep the purchase accounting items to incremental D&A only. So to put that in perspective, the transaction and integration costs impacting PBT for the quarter were $39 million, $0.33 a share, then with the deferred tax adjustment, an additional $0.29. That's how we got to the $0.62 that we reported in the quarter. That $0.29 is what's driving that year-to-date or that full year guidance number up. Our core integration costs are about the same. So for the year, just to close the loop on that, our transaction and integration costs impacting PBT were approximately $70 million year-to-date or $0.57 a share, plus the $0.29 per share deferred tax adjustment, you get to $0.86 a share. So we do not expect that $0.29 to repeat, but it does raise the full-year guidance. Nishu Sood : Got it. Thanks for that. And going back to strong sales performance in Performance Coatings, I think about 60, 70 bps of that was currency related. Very strong performance there. Wanted to understand that a little bit better. I know the average pricing gains you mentioned were in that 2.5% range. Was it a bit stronger as there was the catch-up in Performance Coatings? Or if not, the volume mix, like what was particularly strong? Or what led to the acceleration of what was already a difficult comp for last year? Al Mistysyn : Well, we touched on this briefly that we're seeing strong volume demand across virtually every product category and nearly every geography. We mentioned that it's led by our packaging business, which is really performing very well, and our general industrial business right behind that. And I think it's partly a function of the fact that we're maintaining really strong supply relationships, as I said, with the right customers. And they're growing their business, and we're growing our business with them. So we're really focused, as I mentioned, on bringing value to our customers, and we're experiencing the reward as a result of that. The teams, as I mentioned earlier, from Valspar were very strong. The teams at Sherwin-Williams are, we believe, very strong. And combined, we're even stronger. We're really excited about the momentum that we have here. Nishu Sood : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Pat Rizzuto with Bloomberg. Please proceed with your question. Pat Rizzuto : Good day. It\u2019s Pat Rizzuto with Bloomberg environment. Had a question about what of Valspar's product lines that you've acquired. Is it the Valspar valPure can coatings line? And I'm wondering how it's performing, and I'm also wondering how much of the potential can lining market it has acquired. John Morikis : Well, we\u2019re not going to get into any of the specific shares of any product line, but I will tell you that the packaging business, as we referenced, is the leading performer in a very strong business. So that business is growing. In total, we grew 11%. Packaging is exceeding that growth. And it's \u2013 the performance that we have right now, we expect it only to continue. Pat Rizzuto : Great. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thank you, Pat. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. John Morikis : Good morning. Eric Bosshard : Good afternoon. Two things \u2013 the low \u2013 you commented that the expenses were ahead of what you thought in the quarter. Is that timing or a change in the amount that's going to be spent to invest in that program? John Morikis : It\u2019s just purely timing. The full-year amount has not changed. Eric Bosshard : Okay. And then secondly, that upside performance drove performance in the second quarter. I know you don't guide by segment, but is it unreasonable to assume you can sustain similar growth as we work through the back half of the year and into 2019? How should we frame our expectations? Al Mistysyn : Yeah, Eric. I would say we would expect that to continue. And what we even talked about on our Performance Coatings Group is that we \u2013 at the end of the first quarter call, we thought we'd see sequential margin improvement as the year went on. Clearly, we're ahead of that with our operating margin flat year-over-year now. So doing \u2013 we're ahead of plan, but we do still expect to see sequential improvement in that group. Eric Bosshard : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Patrick Lambert with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Lambert : Hi, congratulations for this quarter. Just one remaining, and I think it's basically also answered. It's just the $0.40 of Lowe's dilution in 2018 is still valid, if I understand correctly? Al Mistysyn : Yeah, the $0.40 is still the same. Patrick Lambert : And could you comment a bit more on 2019 as you see the accretion developing into 2019? Al Mistysyn : We\u2019re really not going to comment on the Lowe's program going forward, both from a top line or a bottom line, just in respect for our customer. Patrick Lambert : Understood. Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. There were two charges in the quarter, the $0.62 in transition and integration costs and the $0.25 in environmental charges. What was the pretax amount of those two charges combined? Al Mistysyn : The environmental was around $32 million. The $0.52, Jeff, is $39 million PBT impact in the quarter, which is $0.33, and then the reversal of the deferred tax adjustment of $0.29, that gets you to the $0.52 in the quarter. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And how would you allocate those costs to cost of goods sold or SG&A? Al Mistysyn : We would have in cost of \u2013 our gross cost of goods sold would have been $17 million. SG&A would have been $22 million. That makes up the $39 million I mentioned. And then the $0.29 is all in the income taxes. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you very much for moving way beyond the 12 o\u2019clock and congratulations on the great quarter. Just looking, going back to the Performance Coatings for a second. Valspar initially had substantially higher margins than Sherwin-Williams. So is this more or less the benefit from the improvement in margin? Or did you see some improvement on the Sherwin piece as well? Al Mistysyn : Yeah, Rosemarie. It\u2019s hard to break them out, because again, they have gone down the path pretty far of integration. But I would say it's the combined business showing the improvement, which tells you both have to be going forward. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. And then lastly, on the tariff impact on Valspar, and I am referring to wood coatings, which is applied on, let's say, kitchen cabinets, which then come back into the U.S., what are you seeing in that particular area? John Morikis : Well, we're staying close to the situation and our customers. It's going to be interesting to see exactly how this plays out. As you know, we've got customers and assets on both sides of the water. And we're working with our customers closely to be responsive to whatever happens from a demand standpoint on their side. So we're staying close, and we're going to be adjusting accordingly. I think it's a play that's not been called or completely played out yet, and we'll respond accordingly. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay, thanks. And if I may, actually, I do have one more regarding the amount of work that you may have already done on the Valspar stores in Australia. John Morikis : Well, we are bringing some of our best practice or we're using our stores as a platform to share information. There's a number of attributes that we think are successful, that help us our \u2013 help us in our success here in North America that we're transferring down there as well as some products. And we're learning a few things from them as well. So the teams are collaborating very well, and we hope that that'll allow us to continue to drive that business forward as well. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. Thank you very much and good luck. John Morikis : Thanks, Rosemarie. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Bob Wells : Thank you, again, Jessie. As always, I, along with Jim Jaye, our Vice President of IR, will be available over the next few days to handle any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. If you'd like to be placed in the queue for a follow-up call, please call Kristy Johnson at 216-566-3001 and she will add you to the callback schedule. I also want to point out that since our original posting online this morning, we've added a slide to include adjusted EBITDA by quarter. So you might want to visit our website again and pull down that revised slide or that new slide. I'd like to thank you all again for joining us today, and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Jessie. All comparisons in my remarks are to the third quarter of 2017, unless otherwise stated. Consolidated sales in the third quarter 2018 increased $224 million or 5% to $4.73 billion. Currency translation rate changes decreased net sales in U.S. dollars by 1.1% in the quarter and revenue reclassification related to the newly adopted ASC 606, which reclassifies certain advertising expenditures previously in SG&A as a reduction of revenue, decreased consolidated net sales approximately 0.8% in the quarter and nine months. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the third quarter increased $109 million or 5.7% to $2.01 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the third quarter was 42.5% compared to 42.2% in the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $34.3 million or 2.6% to $1.27 billion in the third quarter and also decreased as a percent of sales to 26.9% from 29%. The revenue reclassification standard decreased consolidated SG&A by approximately $34 million in the quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $92.3 million. We also incurred a pre-tax charge related to the California public nuisance litigation of $136.3 million or one-third of the amount of the abatement fund as recalculated by the trial court. I will provide an update on our lead pigment litigation in a moment. Including the litigation charge, consolidated profit before tax in the third quarter decreased $11.8 million or 2.8% to $416 million. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 14.9%, well below our anticipated rate due to the impact of share-based payments accounting standard, the litigation reserve and purchase accounting expense. Third quarter effective tax rate on adjusted income was 18.5% and we now expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate on a comparable basis to be in the range of 19% to 20%. Diluted net income per common share in the third quarter increased 11.7% to $3.72 per share from $3.33 per share. The current quarter includes charges for the California public nuisance litigation and acquisition-related costs of $1.09 and $0.87 per share respectively. The prior year third quarter includes acquisition-related costs of $1.42 per share. Excluding these charges, adjusted diluted net income per common share increased 19.6% to $5.68 from $4.75. We have summarized the third quarter earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our third quarter 2018 press release. Let me take a few moments to break down our performance by segment. Sales for The Americas Group in the third quarter increased $126.4 million or 5% to $2.67 billion. Currency translation decreased net sales in U.S. dollars by 1.4 percentage points in the quarter. Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months increased 5.2% in the quarter. Sales growth was positive in all divisions in the quarter led by Southeastern division and followed in order by Southwest, Canada, Midwestern and Eastern divisions. Third quarter segment profit increased $52.2 million or 9.9% to $577.7 million. Currency translation decreased segment profit $7.5 million in the quarter. Third quarter segment operating margin was 21.7%, an improvement of 100 basis points over last year's level of 20.7%. Turning now to the Consumer Brands Group, third quarter external net sales increased $47.2 million or 6.5% to $770.5 million. The revenue reclassification standard reduced net sales by 4.7%. Segment profit for the Consumer Brands Group in the third quarter increased $13.5 million or 19.2% to $83.9 million. Segment profit for the quarter includes a $26 million charge for purchase accounting expense compared to $54.6 million last year, and approximately $20 million in unanticipated supply chain costs required to keep pace with load-in of a new retail program while also supporting what is traditionally the peak architectural paint sales volume quarter in North America. Reported segment operating margin for the quarter increased to 10.9% from 9.7% last year. For our Performance Coatings Group, third quarter net sales increased $52.2 million or 4.2% to $1.29 billion. Currency translation rate changes decreased net sales in U.S. dollars by 1.1 percentage points in the quarter. Segment profit for the Performance Coatings Group in the third quarter increased $45.3 million or 75.9% to $104.9 million. Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.3 million in the quarter. Segment profit for the quarter includes a $55.5 million charge for purchase accounting compared to $102 million last year. Reported segment operating margin for the quarter increased to 8.1% from 4.8% last year. I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. On Monday, October 15, we were informed that the U.S. Supreme Court declined our petition for review. It is important to understand that this decision was not based on the merits of the case and we will continue to press our federal constitutional rights in other lawsuits as we continue to believe the California decision is an aberration. The next steps in the California case will be for the trial court to appoint a receiver and enter a final judgment for the abatement fund. The court has set the amount of the abatement fund at $409 million. ConAgra and NL are also jointly and severally liable to pay that amount along with Sherwin-Williams. There was a hearing on Monday. We believe the judge will appoint a receiver shortly. Recently we learned that Lehigh and Montgomery counties in Pennsylvania have filed public nuisance lawsuits against the company and four other defendants. As we understand it, these counties were recruited by contingency fee attorneys, who are actively recruiting other counties. Based upon what we have seen these counties are not receiving complete or accurate information concerning the facts or the law. On Monday, Sherwin-Williams filed a federal declaratory judgment action in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This action specifically seeks to declare that the counties' contingency fee agreements with outside lawyers violate the due process clause and that the counties' claims violate the First Amendment and due process clause. We are seeking an injunction to stop Pennsylvania counties from bringing cases in violation of our constitutional rights. That concludes our review of the operating results for the third quarter. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of 2018. John? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before I comment on our third quarter results, let me briefly address the elephant in the room. You've seen it in the business press over the past month or two, an increasing number of stories suggesting that the peak of this economic expansion may be behind us. And it's not hard to find evidence in the form of economic data to support this thesis. We pay particularly close attention to the U.S. construction and remodeling markets, which have also shown signs of weakening. But whether or not an economic downturn actually materializes, we'll continue to focus our time and effort on moving with speed to improve aspects of our business that we control rather than worrying about things we don't. Integrating Sherwin-Williams and Valspar into a leaner, faster-growing, more profitable enterprise, while maintaining our momentum in The Americas Group remain our top priorities and we continue to make solid progress. Our synergy targets for both 2018 and longer term remain on track. And while we still have work to do, each business in our portfolio is growing at or above the rate of their respective markets and implementing the steps necessary to improve profitability. Despite this progress, third quarter results fell somewhat short of our expectations. Consolidated revenue growth of 6.9%, adjusted for the negative FX impact and revenue reclassification slowed from the pace set in the second quarter, which appears to be symptomatic of the industry. Excluding all acquisition-related costs and purchase accounting, third quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 30 basis points sequentially and 130 basis points from the third quarter a year ago, which illustrates the fact that pricing continues to lag raw material inflation in some parts of the business. We incurred significant incremental supply chain costs in the quarter to support the load-in of a new customer program while also supporting what is traditionally our peak volume quarter. These unfavorable impacts reduced consolidated gross margin by 40 basis points, but were offset by a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate in the quarter. Adjusted diluted net income per share improved 20% in the quarter compared to last year, a respectable result in this environment. That said, our entire organization understands, we still have work to do. In The Americas Group, a slower pace of sales growth in some end markets, most notably DIY and a stiffer currency headwind resulted in total segment revenue growth at the lower end of our expected range for the quarter. Once again sales to residential repaint contractors in the U.S. and Canada grew at a double-digit pace. That's 18 of 20 quarters for those keeping track. Sales to property maintenance customers grew at a slightly faster rate in the third quarter compared to the second. In protective and marine coatings, sales in the U.S. and Canada grew at a high single-digit pace, but this was slower than the double-digit growth we generated in the second quarter. From a product line perspective, exterior paint and stain sales slowed meaningfully compared to second quarter, while interior paint and primer sales grew at a similar pace to last quarter. Sales in Latin America were down low-double digits due entirely to unfavorable currency translation. TAG segment operating margin expanded 100 basis points compared to the third quarter last year, reflecting our progress in implementing price increases to offset persistent and challenging raw material cost inflation and managing SG&A expense. Both gross margin and SG&A contributed to the improvement in segment operating margin. During the third quarter we announced an additional price increase in the range of 4% to 6% to our U.S. and Canada customers, which took effect on October 1. The Group opened 21 net new stores in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date net store openings to 43 and our total store count at the end of the quarter to 4,663 in The Americas. We expect to open approximately 80 to 100 net new stores during the quarter. Sales by our Consumer Brands Group grew 6.5% in the quarter or 11.2% if you adjust for the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. As Bob mentioned, our global supply chain, which is reported as part of the Consumer Brands segment incurred approximately $20 million in incremental operating costs to support the strong load-in demand during what is typically our peak architectural paint sales quarter. These incremental costs were not included in our earnings outlook for the full year. Excluding the $20 million in incremental supply chain costs and $26 million in purchase accounting expense, Consumer Brands Group adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 16.9%. On a comparable basis, operating margin for this segment was 15.4% in the second quarter of this year and 17.3% in the third quarter a year ago. Before moving on, I want to take a moment and express my deep personal thanks to the many members of our global supply chain team, who supported our effort throughout the summer, often sacrificing evenings, weekends and vacation times with their families. Your dedication is inspiring and a great source of pride to all of us. In the Performance Coatings Group, third quarter sales, reported operating profit and reporting operating margin all improved compared to the same period a year ago. The pace of sales growth slowed compared to recent quarters as continued strength in our general industrial, packaging and coil divisions were partially offset by softer sales in our automotive refinished businesses, primarily in Latin America and industrial wood business in China and Europe. Excluding $55.4 million in purchase accounting expense, adjusted operating margin for the Performance Coatings Group was 12.4% in the quarter. On a comparable basis, adjusted segment operating margin was 14% in the second quarter of 2018 and 13% in the third quarter a year ago. We were disappointed by the lack of sequential and year-over-year margin improvement in the quarter. While we have been aggressive in implementing price increases over the past year, raw material inflation has been unrelenting and accelerating. Over time however, we remain confident in our ability to capture sufficient price to offset inflation. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes transaction and integration costs and the litigation accrual increased 25% to $2.2 billion in the first nine months compared to the same period last year. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 16.5% versus 16.1% last year. Net operating cash year-to-date was $1.43 billion compared to $1.26 billion a year ago. Net operating cash in the first nine months last year included a benefit of approximately $88 million from settlement of the Treasury lock hedge. On September 30, the company had $182 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to reduce debt and fund operations. During the quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.86 per share or $81 million in cash. The balance sheet reflects total debt of approximately $9.7 billion. We intend to reduce our net debt to EBITDA ratio to approximately 3 :1 by the end of 2018. Through nine months, we've reduced debt by $850 million and remain committed to a total of $1 billion in debt repayment by the end of this year. Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $166.2 million, depreciation was $211.5 million and amortization of intangibles was $239 million. For the full year, we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $265 million, which is about 1.5% of anticipated sales. As we continue to invest in productivity improvements, systems and new stores, depreciation should be between $280 million to $290 million and amortization will be about $320 million. In January, we committed to open-market purchases of company stock during the year at a level sufficient to offset dilution from options exercises. In the first nine months, we purchased 925,000 shares at an average price of $398.20 per share. On September 30, we had remaining authorization to acquire approximately 10.7 million shares. Let me turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase a mid-single-digit percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2018, we expect our consolidated net sales will increase by a high-teens percentage, including incremental Valspar sales of $1.85 billion for the first five months of 2018 compared to the full year of 2017. Incremental supply chain costs incurred in the third quarter make it unlikely we will reach the higher end of the full year adjusted diluted net income per share range we provided last quarter. We are therefore narrowing our full year 2018 adjusted diluted net income per share which excludes acquisition, litigation and environmental expense provisions to be in the range of $19.05 to $19.20 per share, a 27% increase at the midpoint compared to the $15.07 on a comparable basis last year. We've included a Regulation G table with this morning's press release to reconcile adjusted diluted net income per share to GAAP amounts. With that I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. I see your SG&A expense was lower year-over-year. Is that a new trend for you? And how do you see that going forward? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No, Jeff. I think, the SG&A expense being down year-over-year is a function of tight management and control of SG&A across all the segments trying to offset the inflationary raw material environment. Also you see the impact of synergies hitting that number, and I would expect the fourth quarter to be down year-over-year as well. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then for my follow-up after you made all of the adjustments to the Consumer Brands Group year-over-year, the extra costs that you bore, the margins were still lower even though the sales were higher. Can you talk about what the dynamic is behind that? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, there's a couple of things. First, as we've talked about as raw material costs had accelerated in the quarter both in the third and in the second, we're chasing it with price. And we'll be out with price again in the coming quarters and in fourth quarter, first quarter to offset those. We also have the impact of the Lowe's program as a reminder that is depressing our margin year-over-year. And if you adjust for the $20 million that we called out in the service costs, the 16.9% operating margin is compared to 17.3%. I think, if you back \u2013 if you neutralized the impact of Lowe's program, we'd probably be flat to up slightly. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thank you. So to what do you attribute the slower sales growth in the stores business? Was it in particular geographies that you saw a slowdown? Or was it weather-related? Or what can you attribute it to? You mentioned lower exterior paints. Was that weather-related? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, Steve. I'd say the most significant factors were DIY sales which slowed from a mid-single-digit to a low single-digit; and our protective and marine business which slowed from a low double-digit pace in the second quarter to a high single-digit pace in the third quarter. From a product perspective you mentioned our exterior results. Growth rates for our exterior paint and stain were both down significantly on a sequential basis. So we clearly felt the impact of some of the weather and storms. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And within the Lowe's store paint aisle now it's simpler than it used to be. But you still have Valspar Paint on one side and you got Sherwin-Williams paint on the other side. What's your longer-term strategy there for establishing those two brands within the DIY and to some extent the do-it-for-me channel there? What \u2013 which one is a higher value or a higher-quality product versus the other? Can you elaborate on that? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. I'd say first and foremost we're going to support our customer. And so our customers' decision on placement of our brands and positioning is very important. To your point it's been much simplified and we don't believe having an HGTV by Sherwin and a Valspar in the store is confusing. We're going to have different qualities at different price points that are easy and simple for sales associates and customers to understand. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I'd add to that, Steve, that the brand perceptions are different. The HGTV HOME appeals to the design audience whereas Valspar has really been a work horse brand covering a pretty broad cross-section of the DIY market. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And the last thing I would add on to it, you mentioned right at the end of your question, Stephen, about the professional or the pro side. We do feel as though there's a terrific opportunity there particularly with the Valspar brand to attract the handyman and help our customer grow there as well. Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Stephen. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great, thank you. Can you just talk a little bit more about your price efforts in Performance Coatings? And any end market mix effects that occurred in the quarter? Just anything you could see to help us figure out how this is evolving in the intermediate to long term would be helpful. Thank you. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, Chris. This is Al. I think, we've been very successful in getting the price through in our Performance Coatings segment. And you saw that in our second quarter operating margin which was flat over year. What the challenge was in our third quarter was we saw an acceleration of the raw materials and it impacted Performance Coatings more. So we're out with more pricing to recover those margins and we're confident we can get it. It's just timing and our ability to chase it. As far as mix of the business I think John in his comments highlighted auto refinish in particular Latin America the Industrial Wood Coatings business in China related to the tariffs and coil business. I don't think we're overly concerned with the overall mix. I think, it's just the shorter-term headwinds are going to persist probably through the next quarter or two. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. I think that's a great point Chris. To Al's comments, we're having good success in implementing the pricing and we expect that to continue. The problem has been that the baskets move as we've gotten closer to bending that curve. Teams are committed to doing it. We're committed to doing it. And in fact we've got more pricing already scheduled to roll in. So if the basket continues to move we'll continue to take the appropriate actions. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. And just as a quick follow-up. Regarding the growth in The Americas just to circle back there. There are obviously a lot of puts and takes regarding the U.S. housing market right now. But can you just comment on your own key drivers and what you see right now in the cycle that may differ from previous cycles and just how we can interpret that and how it affects your comps going forward? Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Chris, how about if I ask Bob to take a look at it from a market perspective, and then I'll break it down into the various segments that we participate in. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. We \u2013 as far as the market is concerned we look at the same data you do. Construction activity has been slow over the last few quarters. We expect that will likely continue into 2019 while remodeling has really driven growth in the industry. There's a lot of speculation now that overall remodeling spend is going to moderate in 2019. And to put it in perspective, I mean, the moderation we're talking about is from a mid-7% growth rate to a mid-6%. So still solid growth. We are not seeing moderation in our residential repaint results. So it has \u2013 certainly hasn't translated to our volumes yet. Keep in mind also, that paint is a unique category. I know you know that. But it's a unique category amongst building materials because more than 80% of the industry is repaint. And the current strength in residential repaint appears to be driven by both baby boomers who are electing the age in place and millennials who are showing a strong appetite for home improvement. The last two points I'd add is, first, the deceleration in exterior residential repaint activity in 3Q, we think likely translates to pent-up demand going forward. We'll either see that come out in the fourth quarter or 2019. And also the effect of Hurricanes Florence and Michael on paint demand is still unknown. While they didn't do as much damage as the two storms the year before, there's likely still going to be a significant rebuild and recovery effort. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And Chris, so when you look at that and how it impacts our business, first, we have terrific confidence given our industry leading positions and really all the contractor segments throughout our company store platforms. So we talk a lot about our residential repaint business. We now have five consecutive years of compounded double-digit growth. If you think about that momentum we've just got great confidence that that continues. In the new residential side, we've actually increased our exclusive agreements and now have an exclusive relationship with 17 of the top 20 national builders having added one more last quarter. So we've got good momentum there. From a property management standpoint, we have an exclusive relationship with 17 of the top 20 management firms. And when you look at the commercial side, we have a leadership position there by a wide margin. And we're growing there as we further penetrate our color and our product specifications. And I bring all that up because when you back out our DIY and protective and marine business and when you ask about what's happening in the market if you just look at our contractor business in the third quarter, we grew our sales by around 7% or an incremental $150 million in the third quarter alone. So we're on track this year to grow our contractor business $0.5 billion this year. If you combine that to last year, we've grown our contractor business $1 billion in the last two years. So it gives us a lot of confidence. And wherever the market is going to move we're going to be there. Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: You bet. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks Chris. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Just following up on that on the architectural breakdown, really appreciate your thoughts there. You mentioned that as you think about potential shift in the market, as people are thinking about a slowdown, we're looking at the DIY segment in particular. The DIY slowdown through your Paint Stores Group, can you compare and contrast that for us please with the DIY business through the Consumer Brands Group because that has been running a little bit soft for some time now. So are DIY sales through the Paint Stores Group now catching down to what's going on in the Consumer Group? And so what does that tell you the kind of \u2013 the looking \u2013 comparing those two please? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. So I'd say that when you look at the DIYer in the Sherwin stores, I'd say it is a customer who's looking for a specialty store experience. I'd say perhaps what's most important to understand is that if there is a shift in the economy and homeowners become a bit more thrifty, if you will, there will be some customers who aspire to have that experience in a Sherwin store or more specialty store experience and we'll be there to serve them. If it's a shift towards more of the home center customer, we have robust programs there in Lowe's and Minard's and we're excited to take advantage of those opportunities. And if it's a shift to a hardware store shopper, we have terrific relationships with the likes of Ace. So again it comes back to this unparalleled market coverage that gives us this confidence. Wherever the growth is going to be, we're going to be there. If it's a residential repaint or do-it-yourselfer, if it's a new residential or property management we're playing every point of the game here. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: That last point I'd add Nishu is that I think you'd find historically our DIY business in our stores has been a little volatile. We'll have strong growth quarters followed by a weak quarter. And that's kind of how we read this quarter is. It's just normal volatility. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Got it. Okay, thanks. And the second question on the load-in at Lowe's, the $0.16 I wanted to understand if that's a net figure. Does that just call out the supply chain impact? Or is that netting out the incremental revenue benefit and the profits from that? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes, it just called out the operating impacts \u2013 operating cost impacts. The $0.40 impact that we talked about earlier this year is really unchanged. That'll continue to rollout similar to the schedule we set with the second quarter, and then the rest in our third and fourth. Let me just explain the hit that we took just so we're all clear. I mean we took incremental people service, freight to respond to the customer load-in timing. That pulled forward to our expectations during what is a traditionally really peak demand period. We need to be responsive as we tend to changing customer needs and schedules. We would have \u2013 we probably would not have incurred these costs as much had the timing been later in the year. And just to be clear it's not exclusive to Lowe's. I mean, we have one supply chain, so we incur these costs throughout the supply chain that really fits the needs of all our customers. If you look at the fourth quarter, we have a little bit of a hit in there related to continuing to optimize our supply chain and as we get that supply chain optimized, you'll see our operating costs come back to normal \u2013 more normal operating levels. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Nishu. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, everyone, good morning. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Good morning, Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, Bob. Can you first off touch on the level of comparative activity in North American paint just given the sequential weakness in the markets? One of your larger peers called out a high single-digit increase for their professional paint stores based in \u2013 store based in North America, you came in at 5%. Do you think you underperformed the market to some extent or is it maybe just a geographic mix differential? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No, I don't think we're underperforming the market at all, Ghansham. I'd say when you're growing $1 billion over a two-year period, I mentioned the double-digit growth for five consecutive years in our residential repaint and I'd also point out that we're really proud of the investments that we're making in our stores. We believe we're the only ones with net store increases in the market. So, we're making we believe really good investments in new stores and territories. Over the last three years, we've been averaging 175 reps per year, been introducing new products at the rate of between 20 and 25 new products per year and we're enjoying the benefits of that. And we're continuing to work hard to make our customers more successful. So, I've got great confidence in the momentum we have and more determination to only accelerate it. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then just switching over to Consumer Brands. As you sort of think about total system costs with the segment, the inflation you've encountered with raw materials, freight, et cetera in 2018, do you think you'll be able to offset \u2013 basically be able to fully recoup these costs in 2019 for the segment assuming cost basket doesn't change materially on a sequential basis? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yes. I think, we have pricing going in as we speak. And yes we expect, assuming that like you said, the basket doesn't move again, we'd able to offset the raw material costs. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to go back to I guess the growth in the quarter. In the past I guess you've seen some labor constraints, was that an issue in Q3? Do you think that could linger? And then I guess the reason I'm asking is because you did make a comment that you think there's pent-up demand that could be satisfied. So, how does that affect your comp I guess going forward? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, Arun, I would say that we typically see labor constraints particularly in the repaint market in the third quarter. It is our customers' busiest quarter. If you look at where the storms affected business, those are predominantly warmer weather markets where they can paint \u2013 do exterior business later in the year. So, whether or not that business is caught up this year is hard to determine. But if it's not, it's not likely due to labor constraints because fourth quarter does not tend to be as constrained from a contractor capacity standpoint. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Right. And then just on your comment about the overall kind of macro picture. Obviously, hard to call. But, where do you see gallons kind of ending up this year? And then where do you see that going over the next couple years? I mean, what's kind of the peak you're still looking at? Or is it still in that 820 million to 840 million gallon range? And so that would kind of indicate like a low-single digit market growth going forward. And would that mean that you'd still be able to show growth in the kind of the 1.5 to 2 times that range? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. Based on our analysis of gallon growth by segment, it is hard to imagine that the U.S. market is growing faster than say 2.5%, 3% at the outside this year, but is more likely in the 2% to 2.5% range. We do believe that we can continue to grow volume at that pace or stronger in the contractor market. As John indicated, in the third quarter our contractor business was up 7%. That has a little bit of price in it but it's much stronger than the 2.5% volume. In terms of where the market peaks out, we realize that \u2013 we tend to talk about this theoretically, but from a theoretical standpoint if you consider how much the repaint markets have grown over the last couple cycles, we could see an industry gallon number north of 900 million, and would expect to see industry volume above 900 million assuming no significant economic disruption. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. I didn't hear if you guys mentioned the store addition count. It seems like maybe a little below historic levels. Is there any reason to scale back there? Or is it just timing issue to getting those stores up and open this year? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, Robert. We're on track to open between 90 and 100 new stores in the U.S. and Canada. Store openings in the U.S. and Canada year-to-date are actually up over last year's, 54 versus 50 last year. The difference is we've closed 11 stores in Latin America through the first nine months of 2018. So we net out at 43 right now. But we're still on pace, a lot of momentum, a lot of confidence and a lot of excitement behind our initiatives there to continue to invest in stores. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And John, there's some \u2013 one of your competitors, I guess, is under a little bit of pressure lately and there was some comments from the investor that thought there's no synergies between architectural and industrial. I was wondering now that you've had Valspar in the fold for a while if you could talk to maybe what some of those synergies are beyond just what's in an architectural vertical and an industry vertical, but what kind of overlap synergies throughout that portfolio? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. Truthfully, Bob, if they don't recognize those I don't know that I want to share ours. We see them. We're excited about them, but I'm fine with our taking different paths. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got you. Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Bob. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Hi, good morning. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Can you expand on this incremental supply chain cost that you talked about? Is that related to personnel costs or trucking costs? And is that one-time? And the reason I'm asking is you own your own trucks but there are many other industrial and retail companies that are complaining about higher logistical costs with trucking and fuel and all that. So I was just trying to wonder how much of that is one-time, how much of that could stay with us going forward. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, P.J. Clearly, there are incremental freight costs in the market and we see that. But to your point we see it on a less of an effect because majority of our volume is on our own trucks. That being said through the quarter we're running at capacity. And when you throw incremental volume into that mix we end up running almost above capacity and that's both on the manufacturing side and the distribution side. And my comment about the freight was more related to the supply chain optimization where maybe we had to make a product on the East Coast and ship it to the Midwest or we had to make a product on the West Coast and ship it back because of those dynamics. We basically are pulling out all the stops to make sure our customers are served which means we drove our inventory down a little bit also in the third quarter more than what you would see. But we're going to build inventory back more so than we have in the past in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: So the point Al made earlier about the optimization of the supply chain, the ability then to manufacture those products closer to the customer. As we further integrate in the facilities, we'll offset those. So we don't expect those to continue on. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: That's correct. That will \u2013 it's a one-time event in our mind. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Al, you also mentioned that raw materials accelerated during the quarter. Was there a LIFO impact in the quarter? And can you sort of quantify that? Thank you. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, P.J., I won't quantify it, but on a relative basis the raw material increase is the predominant part of our increase in costs. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, P.J. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just want to clarify something. Are your expectations for sales growth \u2013 same-store sales growth in The Americas Group for the fourth quarter, is your plan the same today as it was three months ago or something changed there? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I would say it's very similar because one of the things that I'll remind you is we had a very strong fourth quarter last year. Our comp store sales were up over 8%. And with the impact of really two price increases in October and November, our total sales were up for Paint Stores over 9.6%. So, yeah, we expect it to be in the mid-single-digit range all year for Paint Stores. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: In October last year Vincent stores was up 11% last year, and we're on top of that this year. So, we're feeling good about the momentum that we have there as well. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, excellent. And just as a follow-up then. I'm just thinking about you had a big tax benefit now in the guidance that seems to be maybe $0.60 to $0.60-plus. So what are the buckets of the other things? I know you have the $0.16 in Lowe's but what are the other issues that are sort of taking that underlying guidance number down? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: You know, let me \u2013 the tax rate just is part of a program. You know, and I talked about this in the second quarter. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities to reduce our tax rate. The reason you take the high range \u2013 high end of the range down is the $0.16 plus we had \u2013 we would have missed our sales number in the third quarter as well that we don't believe we'll be able to make up in the fourth quarter. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Just those two things. Thank you very much. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Vincent. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes, thank you. On raw materials what's your current outlook for the full year? And if we stay at current level particularly in oil prices, what would be your preliminary outlook for raw materials in 2019? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well Don, the \u2013 as we mentioned the impact in third quarter, the inflation ran higher than we expected coming into the quarter. We put industry average cost for our basket in the third quarter up 7%-plus. So that represents about a 100 basis point to 150 basis point sequential increase from second quarter. Most of the inflation was driven to your point by rising crude oil and propylene and the continued tight monomer market. So it's not just inputs, it's supply as well. And that disproportionately affected our Performance Coatings business. Titanium dioxide pricing was relatively stable during the quarter. We \u2013 that alone would put us at or maybe above the top end of our previous range. We initially talked about 4% to 6%, then we kind of zeroed in on the topend of that range at 6%. It's possible we could finish the year above 6%, in the 6-point-something range. But clearly second quarter and third quarter have both been unfavorable surprises to us. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And a follow-up on Paint Stores Group. That 5.2% same-store sales growth year-over-year what was the price volume breakout? And when \u2013 how should we think of this 4% to 6% increase layering in between Q4 and into 2019? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Don, price mix was about 2.5% in the quarter comparable to second quarter. And the second part of your question was on the price increase, Don, so far \u2013 and I know it's been short time here, but we're seeing the price effectiveness similar to what we've seen previously. And we would expect that roll-in to be similar to the past about 75% over that 9-month period. Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. It's Matt DeYoe on for Kevin. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hi Matt. Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC : So just looking at the LIRA data and trying to reconcile that with existing home sales, is it possible that LIRA remains elevated as contractors work through the backlog that was created due to labor shortages and just something else? And do you expect the trends to sync up with the existing home sales over time? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, good question, because \u2013 and we've been pondering the same question internally. What it appears to us now is that the offset to slower existing home turnover in the remodel market has been stay-in-place remodeling by \u2013 primarily by baby boomers. And baby boomers are significantly outspending all other generations of homeowners \u2013 outspending millennials by a rate of about 32%. And so, this was \u2013 this is a driver that we didn't anticipate at this stage in the cycle. We thought we'd be seeing higher existing home turnover and that that would be driving remodeling. But the decision to age in place, at least at this point in time by baby boomers and remodel the family home, rather than sell it is what appears to be driving the market. The good news there is that the millennials who are now coming into homeownership are also showing a real appetite for home improvement. On a per-household basis, they're doing like 42% more projects than the baby boomers. So at this point in time baby boomers are outspending everybody else, but as the millennial homeownership grows that's going to be kind of the second leg to this remodeling market. Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And I might have missed it, but did you quantify the synergy capture during the quarter for Valspar and kind of where we are cumulatively? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No. We didn't quantify it Matt. But we're on track to hit the $140 million to $160 million through the P&L that we talked about earlier. If you look at that over a two year period, we had seen the $60 million last year and we're on track for the $150 million midpoint this year. So we're at $210 million, and we still believe we'll come out of this year with a run rate of $320 million. And we're on pace to hit our longer-term targets of $400 million to $415 million. So we have upside there and room to run. Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC : All right, perfect. Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John your line is live, you may proceed with your question. Thank you. We'll move on to our next question which is coming from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one would be around the pricing impact in Performance. Have you seen any issues in terms of share loss because of the pricing that you're putting through? I guess how should we think about that and maybe some of the volume trends that you've been seeing more recently there? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: We have not. We've been working with our customers. We've taken some of that margin compression as part of our strategy to work through the pricing and retain the customers and we've not lost customers. John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. And then just one question. With unemployment rates kind of at record lows here and you have a huge number of stores and a lot of people working at them I guess how are you dealing with the inflationary pressures in terms of on the labor side for you? And I guess, how should we be thinking about that going forward if it pushes up or if it's kind of manageable at this point? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I'd say it's manageable. It might be slightly up over previous year, but nothing meaningful. I mean, we're working with our employees and we're really working hard to create the right environment where people want to stay. So we're addressing where we need to, but I don't think it's anything that you need to be concerned with. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And part of the magic there is that the full-time employee, the manager and assistant manager in our stores are on incentive comp. So they improve their wages by improving their volumes. John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Hi, Scott. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks for taking my question. So I know this is maybe a little bit funny question, but I'm trying to see like I'm on your website. It looks like the emerald paint kind of top end is $92.99 to $94.99 on a list price basis. And what I'm trying to actually get is like if I went back when you started the first kind of price increases where that would be. And then next year as you roll through more price increases where does that go? If you could kind of frame it for me? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, Scott. I wouldn't have that information off the top of my head on that particular product. But maybe what I can go is this that our focus on our contractors is really to make them more productive and more profitable. And when you think about the average project costing anywhere from 85% to 90% labor of that total cost, the total cost of raw \u2013 of product is a relatively small percentage. And what we focus on is making them more productive and more profitable. So the cost per gallon, if it allows them overall to be more efficient and profitable on the project is less and less of an issue. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : So I mean \u2013 and I get that. I mean, the paint is really a fraction. Of course, labor costs are up as well. But I guess where I'm going \u2013 I mean, are you seeing any trade down? Is there any \u2013 has there been any indication? Because I think prices are up quite a bit at this stage. I guess, is there any indication of a market \u2013 it doesn't have to \u2013 I was using residential paint as an example of a market that is starting balk and may balk into next year at the heavy increase in prices? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. Scott, if there's a shift, it's a shift up in quality. So you got to remember many of these customers are hiring tradesmen who are maybe less experienced and perhaps slightly less skilled. And so the quality of the product helps them get off the project quicker and more efficiently. So, we are seeing a shift, but it's actually up not down. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Perfect. Thanks, guys. That was my question. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Thanks, again. You usually have a pipeline of smaller acquisition targets that you stay in touch with. Are the smaller firms recovering yet so that maybe the bid/ask expectations are closing? Or are these smaller firms lagging so they're still not ready to sell until their earnings start recovering? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, I'd say it's a mixed bag, John. I mean, you find \u2013 much of that has to do with geographic, with the segments that they're in. Some are experiencing raw material pressure and that's having an impact. So, I mean, it's a mixed bag. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then as we get closer to year-end now are you still planning to keep adjusting for acquisition costs indefinitely or do you plan to at some point stop adjusting for acquisition costs? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, John. I think what you'll see is we will have additional acquisition and integration costs through next year. We'll give you an update as we have this year on our year-end call. I wouldn't imagine much after 2019 that we'd be calling it out because I would expect them to decrease significantly. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Question around the Huarun business. With the little wobble in China how is that business holding together? And with that view you have of China what are the insights you can share with us how you think China is doing internally? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Well, from an architectural Huarun standpoint, let's say well, we don't break those out. But I would say all three of our businesses, if you look at Europe, Asia and Australia are up year-over-year, year-to-date. So I'd say there's an architectural component. There's also a wood component piece. And as we've talked the industrial wood business in China has had some headwinds. The \u2013 we have furniture customers who are feeling the impact or appear to be feeling the impact of the tariffs shipping product back here into the U.S. And some of those customers are actually looking at shifting manufacturing out of China into the region. So the two components of Huarun on the architectural side year-to-date up and the Huarun industrial wood experiencing some pressure as our wood customers are facing tariffs. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then you called out a divergence between exterior and interior paint. I think that's the second time in maybe the last six or seven quarters that we've heard commentary like that. I don't recall that historically. Is there something changing in the business do you think where there's more volatility between interior volumes and exterior volumes that we should think about going forward? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: No. I'd say that at least in our model and the way that we work with our customers, Duffy, we're unlikely to lose one side of our customers' business. If we experience something like that it's typically weather-related. So if our customers are coming in our stores every day, buying product and they see a shift in their end markets, we're very focused on keeping those customers. We're likely to feel that with them. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And to add to that. I don't mean to be coy, but if you look at the geographic mix in our stores business and where we've seen the strongest growth over the last five years, there's definitely been a shift to the southeast and southwest. Hurricanes don't hit North Dakota. So when you have hurricane effects, it is going to have a larger effect on our business because our business is more heavily skewed toward the south. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, fellows. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Duffy. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your questions. Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates: Thanks, guys. I just wanted to impact that weather drag a little more with you, if you can help us think through that progression of interior versus exterior. How big is exterior? Maybe help us understand how \u2013 we know that weather was really tough in September, and particularly in terms of wet conditions and flooding conditions in the parts of the Mid-Atlantic. Maybe help us unpack how much of the growth was impacted by that, and what's the mix impact of margins there. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. Justin, just from a market standpoint, I would tell you that exterior is about one-third of the industry in volume. Interior is about two-thirds. Obviously that mix changes when you get into the second and third quarter, the warm weather months. The mix is heavier toward exterior. Our business would skew more toward exterior than the industry from a margin standpoint. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. Justin, we don't typically talk about margin by product segment and we don't want to start doing that today. Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates: Understand. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, it is fair to say that the exterior is a little more profitable than the interior. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: That's fair to say. Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates: And in terms of the wood, coil coatings comments in terms of tariffs that may linger, you say, I guess help us think about the potential revenue implications to the Performance Coating segment from that, and how that interplays with the revenue synergy opportunity that you guys see intermediate term in terms of the growth potential of that segment overall. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. I'd say, to compare those it's shorter term. We are working with our customers through that. And to your point about the sales synergy side, we're very excited. That's really starting to ramp up, and that's going to play long-term and be very beneficial to our company and to our shareholders. So, we'll work through this short-term side and we're really, really excited about what we're learning on the sales synergy side. Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates: Okay. Thank you. And last question from me is just thinking about what you're seeing on costs across the entire portfolio, not just TAG but everything. Assuming any deceleration not a recession, but a deceleration scenario in growth in the coming years does that dent your confidence in achieving the midpoint or the high end of your intermediate term margin objectives? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Justin, we've talked about \u2013 yeah, volume drives leverage through our organization. And without that volume it would be more difficult to get to the midpoint. But I don't think we're ready to give up on that yet. We have a lot of opportunities, as John talked about on TAG. We have great opportunities within consumers and those customers and Performance Coatings like we just talked about. So we have a lot of opportunities for market share growth as well in the different segments and geographies we play in. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, and I'd say that's what's so unique about our model, Justin. As you reflect back on my earlier comments about, if it's residential repaint or new residential or property management, we have the unique ability to be responsive to the market and be where the business is. Same with the industrial side. So we've got a lot of confidence in our ability to drive it and a lot of determination to do that. Justin Andrew Speer - Zelman & Associates: Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. Thanks, guys. A couple questions. One on the tax rate, Al, what should we be using for the \u2013 a normal tax rate? I know that you're always trying to have it be as low as possible. But is a low 20s number still a good number as we model out the out years? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. I think that's reasonable. I think what the variability you get is based on share-based payments, the timing of those that reduce our effective tax rate. I think we'll have discrete items. I think we'll have consistent opportunities to consolidate foreign legal entities, especially with the larger number that we have with Valspar. And I think, like I said, it's a program I think we'll be able to sustain that low 20%. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Well, but something over 20% like this year sounds like it was extra good. Is that fair? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, this year, that's fair. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Okay. And then back to the business. It's helpful to have the price/mix volume equation for The Americas Group. Do we have that for Performance Coatings as well sort of what mix price we're getting versus volume in the top line? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: You know, we typically don't call that out because of the mix \u2013 we have seven different businesses in there and we try to figure out the mix volume. What I would say related to that is our FX was a bigger headwind in the quarter and our pricing was a little bit short of where you would see TAG at. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Got it. And in terms of flowing price in Performance Coatings, I mean that is \u2013 we would expect that to take longer and just generally harder to get. Is that fair? Or any way you could sort of frame how we should expect the flow in the raw materials and over the next few quarters in performance side? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, I'd say it's fair, but I'd also say we've got pricing that's continuing to roll in as well. So the pricing that's rolling in this week was negotiated perhaps months ago. So we've got a steady stream of increases that are coming as well. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. We have talked about there being a six to nine month lag. And as we roll these in, it's sometimes hard to see them, but they are rolling in and they will continue. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Got it. And then, last one, just on the balance sheet, as the cash keeps falling in and you're paying that debt down, I guess, $1 billion a year, where do you want the business to settle before you may actually go back to larger buybacks? Is it 2.5 times leverage, 2 times? Where is the right number right now, especially given the credit markets and rate environment? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think, I would say in 2019, we're going to get back to our historical capital allocation. We do not need to be at 2.5:1, I would say, especially with how we view the stock as being undervalued. We have talked about opportunistically buying our stock and we will do that. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : So it's getting under 3 times is the key, at this point? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think if I have a view of getting under 3 times over the next year, I don't have a problem with that. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Got it. Thanks. Good luck, guys. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good afternoon, everyone. I got a question about Consumer Brands. Year-to-date the margin is down, but in the quarter it was up despite the load-in costs for Lowe's. Can you talk about that a little bit please? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Chuck, they can \u2013 as we've talked about, the Consumer Brands has \u2013 they will continue to chase price. They saw an incremental increase in third quarter. And the other part of that is our global supply chain, as you called out, the impact that had in our third quarter. I think as we roll out into 2019 as the pricing impacts take effect, we optimize the supply chain, I feel very good about our opportunities in 2019 to grow that operating margin. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : So, you look at what's happened year-to-date where it's down, the third quarter is indicative of where it can go if you add back the Lowe's impact. Is that a good way to think about it? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: I think that's a fair way to think about it. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then any \u2013 going to the lead pigment litigation in California, is there any insurance offset you can talk about there? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: We don't talk about insurance coverage, Chuck. It's just \u2013 there's no margin in it for us to discuss insurance coverage publicly. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Got it. All right. Thank you. And good luck for the rest of the year. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. The first nine months of the year you'd provided us adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 billion. And given a lot of the uncertainty out there, can you give us a range for what you think EBITDA will be for the full year to see what the operating, let's say, variability for the fourth quarter will be? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Mike, I think, based on where we called out the tax rate and where the EPS is, I think \u2013 and where the acquisition-related and purchase accounting is, I think, you can kind of get a range based on the 19.05% to 19.20%. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. So just to follow-up quickly on Performance Coatings, year-to-date margin is 9%. Are you happy with those results? And just curious given Valspar had higher margins for that type of business, where you think that could ramp to by 2020? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. I guess, I would look at the adjusted margin after \u2013 if you exclude the purchase accounting we'd be at 12.9%. No, we're not happy with that. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: We're not happy with that. Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: And I think what we've talked about we have a lot of confidence of driving that operating margin to where we talked about high teens to low 20s. But it's going to come with the additional pricing that comes in, revenue synergies. And we still have additional opportunities for integration synergies. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great, thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your questions. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Hello, good morning guys. Couple of questions, a lot of them have been answered. But I just want to make sure I understand the comment on the share repurchases. Given where the stock is today and given your 10 million-plus shares under authorization still remaining, can we expect you to be a little bit more aggressive over the next several months with share repurchases? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Here's how I'd frame that. We \u2013 on our call at the end of the year we said we'd offset dilution with share buybacks. We have a better working capital performance. Our CapEx is a little bit lower than where we thought. And so the $1.4 billion net operating cash that were generated through nine months is ahead of where we expect it to be. So, year-to-date we returned $600 million to the shareholders in dividends and buybacks. While being able to pay down the $850 million. We're going to pay off the remaining $150 million to get to $1 billion of debt repayments that we committed to. Any free cash after that is going to go to debt buybacks excluding any M&A. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just touching kind of returning to the unpleasant topic of lead litigation, it sounds like things are getting maybe a little bit less rosy if they were ever rosy. The Pennsylvania lawsuits whether or not you're successful in stemming the flow, is it possible to have \u2013 you march with these litigations through the states from east to west, is it possible that some of these states will come back and revisit what California has done, and can we open up a whole new Pandora's box here going forward? Just how do we get confidence or at least some sort of peace of mind about what this can do for you two years out, let's say? Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, Dmitry. Let me preface these remarks by saying we can't predict what any jurisdiction is going to do. We can't predict lawsuits that are going to be filed. I will tell you, we've successfully defended public nuisance in seven states. And in our mind those states have fully litigated that issue. So whether or not they can figure out a way to bring it back, I don't know, but whether or not they want to is the big question. As a reminder, this California case while it's not turning out in our favor, it's an 18-year-old case. And so any jurisdiction that is considering a lawsuit has to know that they are signing up for a long-term legal battle. And the question is does the outcome in California make us any more willing to make these cases go away faster? The answer is no. We are going to grind it out and we want \u2013 just want any potential litigant to know that's where they're in for. Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, Bob. That's very helpful. Thank you. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, Dmitry. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hi there. Wondering you mentioned the volatility that you guys can sometimes see in DIY traffic at European stores or DIY sales at your Paint Stores. Is that occasionally impacted by advertising spend? And can you maybe give us some comments on what your advertising spending rates kind of how those have trended during the course of this paint season? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: They've been consistent spending-wise and I would say that we've not necessarily seen the correlation that you might jump to with the decline or softness if you will. It wasn't a decline but a softer DIY side. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : All right. And then I've got to ask this question. You've got a major competitor with an investor suggesting that they should break up. If that happens are there pieces that Sherwin-Williams would be interested in? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: We wouldn't want to speculate on that. Whatever happens in the market happens and we'll deal with it accordingly. Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Understood, thanks. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks Mike. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Co. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Thank you, and thank you for taking my question after the bell. Looking, still beating the California issue to death, did you take the full amount related to your share? Or is there more to come? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, Rosemarie, we took the one-third of the $409 million judgment. So, we only took our share. We took our share, full share. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: But the entire share? I mean, we should not expect that there is more to come in that particular litigation? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: The only thing would change is if judgment changes. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay, thanks. And then looking at synergies potential, after one year of Valspar ownership, do you see more opportunities by consolidating more plans versus what you have done currently? Or are you still in the process of studying it? Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. I think like I commented before I think coming out of 2018, we'll be at that run rate synergy of $320 million. And we have more to go to get to the $400 million to $415 million. I would say, we're still studying opportunities across all of our segments and all of our regions. And yeah, I would expect to find more opportunities in those. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, are you equipped to supply your customers if they move their manufacturing operations particularly for wood out of China or coil for that matter? John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah. We're positioned very well in the region. So where they need us we'll be there. Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Great. Thank you. John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Thanks Rosemarie. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.: Yeah, thank you, Jessie. Let me close by thanking you all for participating in our third quarter call this morning. As usual Jim, Jay and I will be available today, tomorrow and throughout next week to answering any remaining questions you might have. So thanks again for joining us and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again we thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at sherwin.com beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes and will be available until Wednesday, February 20, 2019 at 5 :00 PM Eastern Time. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements, as defined under U.S. federal securities laws, with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells. Robert Wells : Thanks, Jessie, good morning everyone. Before discussing our results and outlook I'd like to call your attention to the accounting change mentioned in our press release this morning. This voluntary inventory accounting change made in the fourth quarter of 2018 was driven by the company's integration activities. As a result of this accounting change and in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a retrospective one-time expense adjustment to cost of goods sold of $58.9 million or $0.47 per share has been made resulting in revised GAAP 2017 fourth quarter and full year amounts. This revision increased acquisition-related costs and reduced previously reported segment profit for Performance Coatings and consumers brands groups by $35.7 million and $23.2 million respectively for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017 compared to what was previously reported. To be clear, there was no impact on fourth quarter or full year 2018 from this revision. We've summarized fourth quarter and full year adjustments to operating segment profit in the slide deck on our website under January 31, 2018 year-end and fourth quarter financial results. With that let me move on to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results. All comparisons in my remarks are to the revised fourth quarter and full year 2017 unless otherwise stated. Beginning with fourth quarter 2018, consolidated sales increased $84.7 million or 2.1% to $406 billion. For the full year 2018, consolidated sales increased $2.55 billion or 17% to $17.53 billion. As a reminder, the Valspar transaction closed on June 1, 2017; incremental Valspar sales from January through May of 2018 increased consolidated sales by 12.4% for the year. Organic growth for full year was 4.7%. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the fourth quarter decreased $56.6 million or 3.3% to $1.68 billion. Gross profit for the year increased $699.8 million or 10.4% to $7.4 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter decreased to 41.4% from 43.7% in the same period last year. Excluding impacts from purchase accounting and onetime items, consolidated gross margin in the quarter was 42.4% compared to 44.7% in 2017. Consolidated gross margin in the year decreased to 42.3% from 44.8% in the same period last year. Excluding impacts from purchase accounting and onetime items consolidated gross margin for the full year was 42.8% compared to 45.9% in 2017. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $87.2 million or 6.6% to $1.24 billion in the fourth quarter, and also decreased as a percent of sales to 30.5% from 33.3% in the same quarter last year. SG&A expense for the year increased $236.1 million or 3.5% to $5.03 billion but decreased as a percent of sales to 28.7% from 32% in 2017. Interest expense for the quarter was essentially flat year-over-year at $89.4 million. For the year interest expense increased $103.3 million to $366.7 million. The increase was primarily due to a full year of Valspar-related debt compared to 7 months last year. Consolidated profit before tax in the fourth quarter decreased $124 million or 54.9% to $102 million. The fourth quarter of 2018 included non-operating expenses of $135.9 million related to environmental remediation and $37.6 million related to a pension plan settlement as described in our press release. For the full year consolidated profit before tax decreased $109.7 million or 7.5% to $1.36 billion. Full year 2018 results included non-operating expenses of $167.2 million, $37.6 million and $136.3 million related to environmental remediation, pension plans settlement, and California Public Nuisance litigation respectively. Excluding acquisition and non-operating expenses our effective tax rate on adjusted income for the quarter was 19.1% and 19.5% for the full year. Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter 2018 decreased to $1.07 per share from $8.92 per share last year. The $1.07 per share in the fourth quarter includes non-operating expenses of $1.37 per share and acquisition-related expenses of $1.10 cents per share. The $8.92 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a onetime benefit of $7 per share from deferred income tax reductions and $1.24 per share in acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased 12% to $3.54 in the fourth quarter 2018 from $3.16 in the fourth quarter 2017. Diluted net income per common share for the full year decreased to $11.67 per share from $18.20 per share in 2017. The $11.67 per share includes non-operating expenses of $2.71 per share and acquisition-related expenses of $4.15 per share. The $18.20 per share from last year includes a $0.44 charge related to discontinued operations, acquisition-related expenses of $3.47 per share and a onetime benefit of $7.04 per share from deferred income tax reduction. Excluding these items adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $18.53 in full year 2018 compared to $15.07 in full year 2017. We have summarized the fourth quarter and year-over-year earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our fourth quarter 2018 press release. Let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment. Sales for the Americas group in the fourth quarter increased $65.4 million or 3% to $2.25 billion. For the year, net sales increased $507.9 million or 5.6% to $9.63 billion. Currency translation rate changes reduced sales in the quarter and the year by 1.8% and 1% respectively. Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean; i.e. sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months increased 2.9% in the quarter and 5.1% in the year. Regionally in the fourth quarter our southeast division lead all divisions followed by Midwest, Eastern, Southwest and Canada. Sales were positive in every division in the quarter. Fourth quarter segment profit increased $7.4 million or 1.8% to $413.4 million. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit 2.7% in the quarter. Full year segment profit increased $128.9 million or 7.3% to $1.9 billion. Fourth quarter segment operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 18.3% from 18.5% last year. Full year segment operating margin increased 30 basis points to 19.7% from 19.4% last year. Turning now to the Consumer Brands Group; fourth quarter sales decreased $37.2 million or 6.5% to $534.4 million. The new revenue recognition standard reduced sales by 2.8% in the quarter. Full year sales increased $584.3 million or 27.1% to $2.74 billion. Excluding the incremental five month sales from Valspar, sales for the group increased 0.2% in the year. The new revenue recognition standard reduced sales by 4.8% in the year. Fourth quarter segment profit increased $11.6 million to $12 million. Purchase accounting costs decreased segment profit by $24.5 million compared to $32.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017. In addition, the accounting change decreased segment profit by $23.2 million in the quarter in 2017. Full year segment profit increased $58.3 million or 28.7% to $261.1 million. Segment profit from the incremental five months of Valspar results was $75.8 million. Purchase accounting costs decreased segment profit by $110.9 million compared to $107.6 million in the year 2017. In addition, the accounting change decreased segment profit by $23.2 million in full year 2017. Fourth quarter segment operating margin increased to 2.2% from 0.1% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expenses in both quarters and the accounting change in the fourth quarter 2017, segment operating margin decreased to 6.8% in the fourth quarter 2018 from 9.7% in the fourth quarter 2017. Full year consumer group segment operating margin increased to 9.5% from 9.4% last year excluding the purchase accounting expense in both years and the accounting change in 2017. Segment operating margin decreased to 13.6% in 2018 from 15.5% in 2017. As a reminder, consumer brand segment also incurred approximately $50 million in expenses this year to support the launch of the exclusive partnership with Lowe's and $20 million in incremental supply chain costs which we described in our third quarter results. For our Performance Coatings Group, fourth quarter sales increased $56.5 million or 4.6% to $1.27 billion. Currency translation rate changes reduced fourth quarter sales by 1.2%. For full year, sales increased $1.46 billion or 39.4% to $5.17 billion. Excluding the incremental five month sales from Valspar, sales for the group increased 5.1% in the year. Fourth quarter segment profit increased $28.6 million or 34.1% to $112.3 million. Purchase accounting costs decreased segment profit by $55.2 million compared to $42.1 million in the fourth quarter '17. In addition, the accounting change decreased segment profit by $35.7 million in the quarter fourth quarter 2017. Full year segment profit increased $189.3 million or 72% to $452.1 million. Currency translation decreased segment profit by 1.7% in the year and segment profit from the incremental five months of Valspar results was $97.6 million. Purchase accounting costs decreased segment profit by $215.8 million compared to $183.1 million into 2017. In addition, the accounting change decreased segment profit by $35.7 million in 2017. Fourth quarter Performance Group segment operating margin increased 8.8% from 6.9% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expense in both quarters, and the accounting change in the fourth quarter 2017, segment operating margin was flat year-over-year at 13.1% in the fourth quarter. Full year segment operating margin increased to 8.8% from 7.1% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expense in both years and the accounting change in 2017, segment operating margin decreased to 12.9% in the year from 13% in 2017. That concludes our review of our operating results for the fourth quarter. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and provide our outlook for fiscal year 2019. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to make just a few additional comments on our fourth quarter and full year 2018 before moving on to our outlook for 2019. Our fourth quarter results that Bob just walked through fell short of our original expectations with a shortfall in revenue growth driving the majority of the weaker than anticipated results. We often view trends in the fourth quarter as indicative of the momentum we will carry into the following year. In this case, the improving cadence of our business late in the fourth quarter was encouraging, and January is giving us a solid start to the first quarter. In terms of the full year, 2018 was a record year for Sherwin-Williams by many measures. Sales and adjusted earnings per share were both records; sales increased to 17% to $17.5 billion compared to the prior year or 4.7% excluding the five month contribution from Valspar. Adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 23%. Adjusted EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, increased to $2.82 billion. Net operating cash for the year was a record $2.04 billion, an increase of more than $151 million compared to 2017, and 11.6% of sales. Free cash flow which we define as net operating cash plus CapEx and dividends was $1.46 billion compared to $1.34 billion last year. All of our operating segments contributed to this record performance. Within the Americas Group, full year sales increased 5.6% against a challenging prior year comparison of 8.8%. Residential repaint remained our strongest customer segment in the year, up by double-digit percentage. All other statements were positive for the year. Full year segment profit dollars and margin also improved year-over-year. We continue to invest in innovation and service introducing 25 new products; our eight consecutive year of double-digit product introductions. We opened 87 net new paint stores in the U.S. and Canada, and added 150 new sales territories. In the consumer segment, full year sales were up mid-single digits excluding the five months incremental sales from Valspar and the impact of the new revenue standard. Adjusted segment margin was down year-over-year driven mainly by expenses related to a new customer program and raw material cost increases, not all of which were anticipated. We feel very good about our product reset, merchandising and training efforts with Lowe's this year, as well as our strength and relationship with other key retailers. Performance Coatings Group sales across all product categories were positive led by general industrial and packaging, which were both up by double-digit percentages. Throughout the year, Performance Coatings Group combated persistent raw material inflation with price increases, some of which are still flowing in. This group also made commendable progress on continuing integration efforts. Company-wide, we delivered approximately $180 million in synergy benefit to the P&L in 2018, about $30 million above the midpoint of our expectations at the start of the year. We exited the year at a synergy run rate of approximately $360 million. Finally, we returned approximately $936 million to shareholders during the year, including $323 million paid in cash dividends, and $613 million to purchase 1.52 million shares of common stock, and we reduced our debt by $1.1 billion. Let me begin my comments on our outlook for first quarter and full year 2019 by saying that we remain confident in the sustainability of demand across most of our end markets. I'm also confident in our ability to execute on the key initiatives that drive our success in the short and long-term, and in our ability to deliver value to our customers. We entered 2019 well positioned and focused on what we can control. I'm less confident about the increasing number of economic, political and social variables that are beyond our control; these would include government shutdowns, Fed rate hikes, tariffs, trade wars, immigration and securities to name a few, any one of which could disrupt market demand and raw material supply. Whilst it's our job to focus on those things we can control and adapt to those things we cannot, these factors individually and collectively create uncertainty and expand the range of potential outcomes. For the first quarter of 2019 we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase 2% to 6% compared to the first quarter of 2018. The first quarter of 2019 will include expenses related to the defined benefit plan annuity purchase of approximately $0.43 per share. As we described in our call two weeks ago, demand in our North American paint stores inflected upward in December, and continue to accelerate in January. We're encouraged by this but remind you that January is a small month with March being the most critical month in the quarter. For the full year 2019 we expect core net sales to increase 4% to 7% compared to full year 2018. On an earnings per share basis, we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude Valspar acquisition costs and onetime items. On this basis and given our sales outlook we expect adjusted 2019 full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $20.40 to $21.40 per share, an increase of approximately 13% at the midpoint compared to the $18.53 reported last year on a comparable basis. This adjusted 2019 guidance excludes approximately $3.20 per share for acquisition-related expenses and $0.43 for other non-operating expenses. We've included a Regulation G reconciliation table with this morning's press release to better illustrate all the moving parts. We expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. One key assumption embedded in this outlook is that raw material inflation for 2019 will be in the low single digits compared to 2018. The rate of year-over-year inflation will be highest in the first quarter, and assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions, should diminish as we go through the second half. A few additional data points may be helpful for modeling purposes. We expect incremental synergies of approximately $70 million to $80 million in 2019 with a total annual run rate of approximately $415 million at year-end. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $320 million which is about 1.7% of anticipated sales as we continue to invest in capacity and productivity improvements, systems and new stores. Depreciation should be $257 million and amortization will be about $315 million. After focusing largely on debt reduction the last two years we'll begin moving back toward our more traditional capital allocation philosophy in 2019. We expect to reduce debt by $600 million by the end of this year which should reduce our net debt to EBITDA ratio to below three times by the end of 2019. Historically, we've targeted dividends at about 30% of prior year GAAP earnings. Next month at our Board of Directors meeting we will recommend a quarterly dividend increase of 31% to $1.13 per share, up from $0.86 last year. We expect to make open market purchases of company stock in 2019 at a level beyond what is necessary to offset dilution from options exercises. On December 31 we had remaining authorization to acquire approximately 10.13 million shares. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that set our strategy. Before moving on to your questions, let me wrap up today by asking you to save the date of Wednesday, June 5, on your calendars; that will be the day we'll host our Annual Financial Community Presentation at the Westin Hotel in Cleveland. The program will include presentations by several members of our leadership team. We'll host our customary Q&A session followed by a reception and lunch. Again, that date is Wednesday, June 5. We'll be sending out invitations and related information and a link to our registration site in April. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Stephen Byrne : I wanted to ask about what's driving the strength in your view in [indiscernible] 2018 market of double digit and what are your expectations for\u2026 Robert Wells : Hi, for some reason you're not coming through very clearly. Stephen Byrne : Sorry about that guys. So I wanted to ask about the residential repaint; what's driving the strength in that market of double-digits and what your expectation is for 2019? Robert Wells : Yes, I think over the last few years we've seen really strong growth in residential repaint, not just company-wide but industry-wide We've been growing residential repaint double-digits for five consecutive years, we think the industry is probably growing in the high single-digits. And a couple things driving that; one is home value appreciation, although home turnover has been slower than we expected at this point in the cycle, values have inflated and that gives homeowners confidence in reinvesting in renovation and redecorating projects. The second thing is the decision by baby boomers at this stage in the cycle to agent place; they've been investing in a lot of things over the last decade or two including kids' education, college educations etcetera, and now they're kind of unleashing some capital to renovate the family home or so it appears. Those are probably the two biggest drivers. John Morikis : Yes. I'd say from our perspective, we've been very deliberate in developing products and services that meet that customer's needs, and we take a very deliberate approach to this, we want to make sure that our products and our services help those customers make more money, we've got a terrific field organization through our stores to be responsive to these customers, and I think we're executing very well at the store level and rep level. Robert Wells : In terms of outlook, the -- by most measures I think our residential remodeling spend grew in the upper single-digits, the 7%, 7.5% range in 2018. We expect a little bit of moderation in that number in 2019 back to like the 6% to 6.5% range but still a strong year from a historical perspective. Stephen Byrne : John you mentioned there is a lot of variables going on here with factors inside assurance control and factors outside assurance control; and the guidance that was established, the 2020 targets of 11% EPS, CAGR, it seems like the world has gotten a little more uncertain since then. I just wanted to know how you think about that longer term EPS outlook. Thank you. Allen Mistysyn : You know, we made a comment on the last call on 15th about giving you an update on 2020 outlook at our June Investor Day. And I think we get about 6 months in under our belt and an outlook for the rest of 19, we can do that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Nishu Sood : Thank you. First question I wanted to ask was on the sales guidance for '19, the 2% to 6% in the 1Q, and then the 4% to 7% in '19. I think even if you take into account the slight definitional differences; total net sales versus core net sales and apply some acceleration. Given your commentary back it sounded like momentum had picked up back to normal -- sales momentum had picked up back to normal in January; so what is driving that sequencing of accelerated growth as the year goes on? John Morikis : Let me begin by taking the January portion of it. Our comment that we're off to a very good start, January sales will come in high above our first quarter guidance, so we're feeling good about that momentum. And as far as the year -- Al, you want to\u2026 Allen Mistysyn : So Nishu, when you look at the year, we always start with our U.S. and Canada paint stores that are still the growth engine of the company, we'll continue to drive to the higher end of that sales guidance of 4% to 7%. As you recall, we went out with a price increase on October 1 of 4% to 6% which should give you about effectiveness, a little close to 2.5%, and -- then the rest is really price mix. We really expect consumer to be at low single-digits and we're still seeing headwinds outside the U.S. in that group. We see some headwinds, continued headwinds in the retail part of that channel and we're -- as we've discussed, we're very excited about the Lowe's program. Even though we're not going to talk about it in particular in deference [ph] to our customer, we feel very good about where we're positioned and where we're at or a little bit ahead of our pro forma coming into '19 and with '19 included. And then I'd say Performance Coatings; we still feel like even with the short-term headwinds related to the tariffs that we had talked about, industrial, wood [ph] in China and in our coil business in North America, we still feel like mid-single digits is a good number for that group, it will be a little choppy by business by segment but overall, we've got a lot of momentum and a lot of good programs going and we feel very good about that. Couple of other data points would be; FX is going to be a little over 1% headwind for the year, and I think price we talked about 2.5% in stores but overall close to 2% on price. Nishu Sood : And then, regarding store openings in 2019, what kind of pace would you expect in 2019? Some acceleration from roughly 75 in '18 or what are you thinking about for 2019? John Morikis : I think we're going to continue to run the same pace here, that 80 plus to the 100 range, we feel good about that pace. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Robert Koort : I wanted to focus on the Performance Coatings and the momentum, I guess, the underlying momentum that started to develop there from margin perspective. How do you guys see the cadence of those margins as we go through 2018 -- I'm sorry, 2019? John Morikis : Bob, we certainly expect the margin expansion and we thought coming out of our second quarter, year-over-year improvement and then as you know, we took an accelerated increase in raw materials, that team is going out with price again. We believe that price is effective along with good tight SG&A controls and the synergies they are realizing, and to end the year flat on an operating -- essentially flat on an operating margin standpoint year-over-year, we feel very good about that. Robert Koort : And you guys obviously have articulated the cost synergies, and I know Wall Street is usually pretty reluctant to embrace revenue synergies but do you have any updated thoughts or anecdotes on what you might have been able to achieve from a revenue synergies standpoint with the Valspar integration? Robert Wells : Bob, we're not going to put a number on it but I would tell you that as we've mentioned before, our teams are very excited about the opportunities that we continue to harvest as we're working through this. Getting our teams together around the world dialing through this is creating more and more excitement. So every quarter that we've talked about it, we have felt good and I would tell you every quarter we feel better about what we've accomplished and what's ahead. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. Just sticking with PC; can you just -- could you give us a brief on what you're seeing on terms of top line growth, [indiscernible] coil versus GI packaging P&M? Just -- how are you thinking about your opportunities there would be appreciated. John Morikis : It might be helpful; I'll break it down a little bit by region as well. Chris, the largest that we have, obviously North America, has been the best performing for all of our segments. The one standout I would point out would be coil; we talked about that last year, the tariff impact on our coil business here in North America has been significant but overall, our performance here in North America has been terrific. Asia, I'd say coil was strong and GI was strong as well, and the drag that we're feeling there is in our industrial wood business, and that's also tariff related as well. And that a lot of customers there that are feeling the impact, we have customers that are moving manufacturing throughout Southeast Asia, and our teams fortunately were positioned well to capture it but our customers are in a -- kind of a state of flux as they're moving manufacturing from one country to another to be responsive to their tariff issues. Latin America; I'd say our GI and our packaging were very strong performers, [indiscernible] position our automotive business down there, we had some softness in the fourth quarter but our team down there is terrific, we've got a great leadership down there, great position and they've got confidence about the year 2019 as well. Overall, Europe I'd say was the softest and I would say that's across all of our businesses, and that's something that's continued here as we've turned the corner in the year as well. Christopher Parkinson : And just -- your teams also -- you've obviously have been executing well given the choppy macro environment, at least recently. How should we just seeing about your longer term margin potential; now that you're realizing most of the valve surgeries [ph] or at least the remainder of them in '19, just -- when we think about your historical margins and consumer, valves [ph] legacy margins and coatings; just -- where do you see your long-term opportunities outside of the whole price cost equation? Thank you. John Morikis : Chris, we have talked about Performance Coatings Group getting into the high teens to low 20s, as we integrate and as you recall the Valspar business was in the high teens, low 20s already; and the synergies that would help bring up the legacy Sherwin businesses. The same goes on the other side for consumer, and we believe getting those high teens and low 20s is still a reasonable target, and we're going to help drive the legacy Sherwin is going to help drive the legacy Valspar low teens up to that mid teen, high teen number, and that's our expectation still. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : I guess first off, obviously housing data in the U.S.; construction data in general has been very choppy, very public, very choppy. John, can you just sort of touch on customer backlogs, however, you define that for 2019 specific to the paint store sub-segment? What are your customers telling you in terms of contracted backlog etcetera? John Morikis : Ghansham I'd say that it's -- when you speak with our customers it's a very bullish discussion that we're having, our customers remain very confident about the year, the bidding that they're doing and the backlog that they have had, as well as what they see going forward. So we're feeling pretty good about our position and we're excited about continuing to grow market share in this space. You mentioned new residential, and we feel as though we've done very well on the national builder level, we're having very good penetration in the regional and local builders. Our position in the commercial side is strong and getting stronger, and we continue to pound away at this residential repaint. The point I'd make though as you go across the various segments, it's hard -- you're hard pressed to find customers that are anything but excited about the market that we're in right now. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. And then I guess just switching to consumer brands and the margin differentials, '18 versus '17. Can you just remind us how much of the differential relates to non-recurring investment expense related to the share gains from last year? Just trying to get a sense as to how to think about margins for the segment? And then, also related to that, what is going to be different in terms of the go-to-market strategy for consumer brands as you position in front of the paint season? Thanks so much. John Morikis : Let me let me talk first about the year-over-year margins, and as you recall, we talked about a $0.40 hit, that's about $50 million, about 40% of that was onetime and we realized those in our third and fourth quarter. You also have the ongoing investment so that other 60% as we've been ramping up the program, adding reps to get our rep coverage down to three to four stores per rep versus where we were and the other incremental investments in a small quarter that we have with the seasonal volume adjustments and consumer, it weighed heavily on the margins in the quarter year-over-year. On the... Robert Wells : Let me take the back side of that. As far as what's going to be different; Ghansham, I look at our position in the marketplace and clearly, we're very excited about the relationship that we have with Lowe's and I'll just talk about the alignment we have with our reps, but I'd also say that alignment starts at the top of the organization, the leadership there has very high expectations and we're excited about helping them grow into a number of segments and bring in the simplified branding proposition to them is as exciting, as well as making sure that we have people to help their sales associates. But it doesn't stop there, we've got a lot of wonderful customers in Menards and Ace and some of these other customers who have very strong desire to grow; and our approach to this is we want to help them in their specific areas of growth in bringing the services, the products, and brands that can help them reach their goals. Overall though when you when you look at the future and you say, okay, so what's different; it's our continued focus on those differentiators that we think will help each of our customers reach their goals that we think will help separate us from our competition and our customers to win. Operator : The next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : I just wanted to understand that the sales growth guidance; it looks like you're guiding to 2% to 6% in Q1, 4% to 7% on the year. The 4% to 7% on the year is potentially a little bit higher than what I thought. And was that also imply that the tag could be at the upper end of that, and so if that is the case, let's say mid-single as 5% to 7%, let's say that would potentially imply volume of maybe 3% and price of about 2% to 3%. I mean A) is that right? And is that an acceleration from maybe what you were thinking on January 15? Thanks. Robert Wells : I think you're right in what you said about the tag being at the higher end and your breakout between volume and price. And I think it's right where we were thinking it would be on the January 15th call; even we talked about January starting off a little bit better but it's a small amount as John highlighted and we'll see how the first quarter goes when we get into March which is the most significant part of the first quarter. John Morikis : Yes, I'd say the excitement is consistent. I'll mention, the new stores that we're adding, the new products that we're introducing; we just had our team together this week at those sales meetings to just share information about the opportunities going forward but it also gives us an opportunity to talk with our teams about what they see and we're feeling good about the momentum that we have. Arun Viswanathan : And then just as a follow-up on -- you know, you're lower down in the P&L may be on the gross margin line as price cost improves through the year. It appears that you could see some potential gross margin expansion, especially in the back half. Is that right? Any way you can size that opportunity for us? Thanks. Robert Wells : Arun, I won't size up the opportunity per se but you're absolutely right. As John mentioned, our first half raw material costs year-over-year will be higher than our second half. And as you know, with a 12.8% EPS growth at the midpoint, we're going to have to see margin expansion. And I think we're going to make good progress on that in 2019. But we have ways to go to get back to the previous company gross margins that that we would expect. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Could you talk a little bit about whether or non-raw material inflation is going to be this year versus last year? Robert Wells : You're going to have -- our biggest is probably in the salary increases that we're putting through, and -- we're going to be at market, it's going to be low single digits. And I think you're still -- we're still going to see some headwinds on the freight side of our basket, it went up significantly in '18 and we do believe it's going to be up again in '19, not near to that magnitude but certainly some additional headwinds there. And I think those would be the two main buckets. Vincent Andrews : And then just a follow-up; the 2% to 6% for the first quarter and you're obviously a month through, it seems like a wider range than normal. And you mentioned earlier that March obviously is the biggest month and that's ahead of us but what would get us to 6% versus 2%? Robert Wells : John in his opening comments highlighted the macroeconomic variables and the uncertainty around that. If you think about our first quarter, it's a small volume quarter so you get some relatively swings in volume cause larger percentage swings; and as we have talked about in the past, our first quarter and our fourth quarter are more impacted by weather. So, to get to the high end of that range it's going to come out of our stores in the U.S. and Canada being better than what we thought. Operator : The next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Would you comment on the pace of growth in your protective marine business in the fourth quarter and the outlook for that business for 2019? John Morikis : It was a good quarter for us and we had a lot of momentum in that protective marine business. We've talked over the last couple of years, we took a little harder hit when the petrochem share -- I'm sorry, the market went down because of our share in that market; that's come back and at the same time we've been working very hard in the adjacent markets. So, this is -- it's a good area of performance for us, terrific leadership here, a lot of new products coming out as well, and we're unique and that we're able to leverage our store distribution platform when needed, and as well as going direct on these larger projects as they're coming in. So we really like our position and really are -- we have very high expectations for that team here in 2019. Kevin McCarthy : John, it sounds like your business is trending nicely in January and the tone seems positive overall. If it turns out that the factors you can't control such macro and other factors don't cooperate; what sort of levers can you pull as the year progresses in terms of opportunities to tighten the belt, productivity actions etcetera? John Morikis : Kevin, one of the things that we would do is we'd look opportunistically at consolidating facilities, maybe faster than we thought or planned. We are controlling SG&A tight as we go, and I think as we see the year unfold and we have talked about this in the past; we really need to see how the second quarter unfolds, it's a large quarter and that will tell us kind of how some of these macroeconomic environment things work out, and we're just from there but certainly leading up to the second quarter we're going to control our SG&A pretty tight. Robert Wells : Kevin, I'd also adds to this that over the past historical view of the company, those choppy areas have also been areas of terrific opportunity for Sherwin-Williams. What you shouldn't expect is that we're going to stop adding stores or investing in innovation; you know, throughout those choppy years in the past we were the ones that have continued to invest in those areas that helped us kind of -- almost like a coil, spring back the market started to return. So we're going to continue to invest in our businesses in important areas but to Al's point; he reminds me every morning when I come in with a smile on my face talking about the sales flash that it's January. And so we're very guarded but we're optimistic. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So like I'm beating a little bit of a dead horse but I'm just trying to understand -- I mean, obviously we've had some very bad data coming on housing, and it kind of continues to dribble in that way; but you guys seem pretty bullish and your January is good and clearly, weather was a big, big factor in the fourth quarter. Tell me as you think it's just you're taking share and that's what's driving it; do you think there has been some fundamental improvement in -- I know January is a small month, but there is some fundamental improvement in the market or is it just simply, hey, we're taking some share here? Robert Wells : Well, I do think we're taking share, Scott, based on our growth rates, particularly in Residential Repaint. But I would also say these are kind of odd times relative to historical cycles. We've seen a decoupling of growth in existing home turnover and growth in Residential Repaint and remodeling activity. The latter, it continues to go up and up and up, while the former has languished for the last year. So I think the short answer is, we're seeing a lot more remodeling and redecorating activity done by homeowners who are planning to stay in place. And oftentimes, the decision to stay in place triggers investment in remodeling and redecorating. I'd also say that, to your point about uncertainty in the macro housing environment, we view that, a significant portion of that, as somewhat short term, much of which we'd attribute to the lack of affordable supply. And many buyers have been shut out of higher-cost markets, and the builders are almost unanimously working to develop lower-cost product finds. We think they're going to figure this out. And in the short term, we've seen a step-up in multifamily activity that's kind of filling the void of the incremental housing demand. But longer term, we think that the rate of household formation at this $1.3 million to $1.4 million level is sustainable. And to us, that translates to incremental demand for housing over the next 5 years. Scott Mushkin : My second question is regarding -- you've obviously increased the dividend quite substantially, and you're going to be buying back stock more than just what's being diluted by shares being issued. So I was wondering if you could kind of update us on where you're comfortable on your leverage and what your goals are for capital return to shareholders. Allen Mistysyn : As John talked about, we're going to still pay down another $600 million in debt in 2019. That should get our debt to EBITDA leverage below 3. And we're still targeting a long-term leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5. As far as being specific about the share buyback, here's what I would say. As we've talked about, we're getting back to our policy of -- and our historic policy. We're going to keep CapEx below the 2%. We're raising the dividend 31% to get back towards the 30% of prior year EPS. We believe that's the right place to be. And then absent M&A, we're going to buy our stock back. So rather than giving you a definitive, we'll see how the year plays out. Operator : The next question is from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Truman Peterson [ph] on for Steven. So first question I really wanted to focus on is your 2019 raw material outlook. Could you guys just break apart that basket and give me your views or give us your views on kind of the titanium dioxide versus the oil derivatives? Robert Wells : And before I get into that, Truman, it's worthwhile pointing out that, obviously, the majority of the inflation that we anticipate in 2019 is actually from annualizing raw material increases that we incurred in '18. So you recall that we saw a pretty meaningful step-up in raw material costs, particularly in the petrochemical side of the basket midyear last year, and so we're going to go 2 quarters before we annualize that. From kind of a pieces-parts standpoint, supply -- we think supply and demand in North American TiO2 is kind of at an equilibrium level that should result in fairly stable pricing. The decline in the cost of the petrochemical feedstocks that we've talked about should result in some sequential declines in the cost of resin, latex, plastic packaging, solvents and some of the additives. But it's difficult to predict when these commodities will show year-over-year declines. It's also important to keep in mind that, downstream from the feedstocks I mentioned to the monomers and the resin intermediaries, there are supply-demand dynamics that will affect price movement. So it's not just a matter of cheaper propylene translates to cheaper resins. Metal packaging has also been a real inflationary area over the past year due to the spike in steel and tinplate. And as steel prices reset lower, we should see some sequential improvement in the price of those products as well, but the timing is difficult to predict. Unidentified Analyst : Just kind of following up on that; I guess, with Europe and China slowing and TiO2 being a bit more of a global marketplace, have you guys seen any change in behavior from the TiO2 suppliers? And jumping over, if I could just play out a hypothetical on oil, if it remains down 15% to 20% throughout the year for the remainder of 2019, I guess, how would that change your expectations of your oil-derived raw material basket? Would you guys expect that low single digit to actually drop fairly significantly? Robert Wells : Well, the longer oil and the oil derivatives remain where they are, the more easing of inflation we should see. It's more of a timing issue than a matter of if, assuming, of course, that the supply of the intermediaries remains sufficient. On TiO2, we have not yet seen softness in demand in Europe, and probably less so in Asia Pacific, translate to declining pricing in North America. And to the extent that, that does not create slack in the chloride market, that it really affects more sulfate product, you won't see a big move in North American chloride product. So right now, our outlook for TiO2 is stable, and our outlook for the petrochemical side of the basket is it will decline slowly as these feedstocks remain down. Unidentified Analyst : If I could sneak one more in on synergies; I appreciate you guys breaking out kind of 2018 versus 2019 expectations. But could you just remind us where the synergies are really hitting Consumer, Performance Coatings, G&A. And I know you guys probably won't -- it will be difficult to quantify, but maybe could you just give us some qualitative analysis on it? Allen Mistysyn : Truman, we've been reluctant to break out synergies by segment. But what I will tell you is, in 2018, approximately 40% of the $180 million was in cost of goods sold. The remaining in SG&A. In 2019, at the midpoint, $75 million, about 2 -- about 55% of that will be in cost of goods sold versus SG&A. And then, just as a cadence for 2019, about 2/3 of that $75 million will be in our first half compared to one-third in our second half. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Donald Carson : A couple questions on Paint Stores Group. Just of that 2.9% same-store sales growth in Q4, how much was price versus volume? And how would you expect that to break out in 2019? And I'm just wondering, I assume that volumes were weak. Was it all weather related? That is, did it hit -- was it hitting just exterior? Or was there something off in interior as well? John Morikis : So a few questions there. First, price was approximately 2.5% in our North American stores. Same-store sales in North America were up about 3%. When you talk about the interior and exterior, I would describe it this way : they were both up mid-single digits, but both were below our expectations. Robert Wells : Don, in terms of your question about weather impact, as we said on the 15th, when you see a decline kind of mid-quarter with a rebound at the end of the quarter, that doesn't -- that indicates to us that it's something other than fundamental demand that is affecting our business in the middle of the fourth quarter. So -- and, and one only need look at weather data, particularly for the Eastern half of the United States, to know that a good portion of the country was underwater during the fourth quarter. So it feels like it was some, at least, partial impact from weather. Donald Carson : And then as you look out to 2019; what do you expect for the overall growth in the market in U.S. architectural paints compared to '18? And I know, Bob, you've talked in the past about how you see a nice commercial outlook this year due to a high rate of completions. Would that, plus a weather rebound, lead to significantly higher growth in the market this year? Robert Wells : Probably, not significantly. I mean, as a reminder, if you're breaking down the market, the industry, only about 6% or 7% of industry gallons go into commercial new construction. So a pickup in completions will help our business because it's a high-share segment for us. But it doesn't drive market growth to a meaningful degree over all. It looks like kind of a mixed bag in U.S. architectural. Housing starts have been weak, but there was a jump-up in housing -- in new home sales in November. If that drives a little more order growth going forward, that would be a good thing. Residential Repaint activity, which is the largest segment in the pro market, has been very strong for the last 5 years. And based on very early indications, it continues to be strong. DIY, on the other hand, has been lagging over the last couple quarters. And whether that is continued migration of business away from DIY toward do-it-for-me or whether the DIYer is just taking a pause, don't know. All of that -- it's a little early to start calling rate of industry growth in 2019. But based on the macro drivers that we're looking at, we -- it feels like 2.5% is a reasonable estimate. We're not going to be off by too much at that rate of industry growth. Operator : The next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : You don't break out Latin America earnings anymore, but the FX effect that you disclosed on The Americas segment seems like they took a pretty big hit to margins, probably, because of the translation. I don't know if you can comment on results qualitatively down there. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, John, you're absolutely right. We took a -- probably a close to 20% or a little over 20% FX hit that really impacted both their top -- their sales. But that being said, that team has done a very good job of raising price. As you know, a significant portion of the raw material basket is U.S. dollar-denominated. So as the currencies devalue, costs go up, and we've been chasing that with price and with controlling our SG&A. And I would say their profit was positive year-over-year. Or I should say positive... John Morikis : We're making progress down there, the teams are working hard. And to your point, we had a currency issue that we've had to deal with. But progress on the ground is -- it's moving in the right direction. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Michael Harrison : Wanted to go back to the comment on DIY activity. Just wondering, with the government shutdown and a lot of folks not working, did you have any indications that some of those people grabbed their paintbrush and got to work on some home repainting projects during that time? John Morikis : Not really, but we strongly suggest that they do. Now I'd say it's hard to really pin that down, Mike. We do feel very comfortable, as we've described, a lot of things going in the right direction but I don't think we can point to that as a driver or a speed bump. Robert Wells : We haven't seen a change in buying patterns across the segments in January -- a significant change from fourth quarter to January. Michael Harrison : Maybe that's an idea for your next marketing campaign? John Morikis : There you go, that's right. Michael Harrison : Then wanted to ask about the Huarun [ph] business within China. You mentioned the outlook for consumer kind of low to mid-single digit, but outside the U.S., would be softer. Can you just comment on kind of the trends you're seeing within the China consumer business? Any sense that the lunar new year downtime is going to be worse or better than last year? John Morikis : I'd say our business in China, Mike, is going through a little bit of a transition as it relates to the Huarun [ph] brand on the architectural side. They've been predominantly a brand that's focused on a lot of the wood -- interior wood that's been applied in-home. And much of that is shifting to a factory-applied product. The benefit of Sherwin and Valspar coming together includes our ability to bring technology to them to help them differentiate. We don't want to just go over there and try to be the lowest supplier, by any stretch. We want to bring technologies and brands and different features that we can help that team separate themselves from the competition as well. So we're going through that transition right now, and the strategy development is well underway, and we're executing pieces of it, but there's a long way to go. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Michael Sison : When you think about your outlook for '19 in terms of the range, any thoughts on which variables are most impactful in terms of getting to the high end to low end? Meaning, is it -- will sales get you there, raw materials or synergy? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, it's always volume, Mike. That's always the lead. And as we see U.S. stores grow and some of these short-term headwinds get annualized, we'll have a better feel for that. But demand is always the lead driver. Raw materials turnover certainly helps, but volume always drives the bottom line faster than anything else. Michael Sison : And then, if you get the pricing that's embedded in your guidance for this year, it sounds like stores, certainly, will have closed the gap. But just curious in terms of Performance Coatings and Consumer Group, whether they will be able to close the gap in raw materials this year. Allen Mistysyn : We have work to do in Performance Coatings, for sure. And when you say close the gap, I look back to 2017 and the increases we took throughout '17 and the fact that the Valspar businesses did not get the price increases that were needed. So we're still chasing that, and we need to get it as we continue to offer the services that we do to these customers. John Morikis : And I think that last piece is a really important component. The services, the products and technology, as we continue to introduce more, as these companies come together and we're able to leverage the benefits of both companies and bring those to our supplier -- or our customers in a way that positions us as a stronger supplier, a better partner, helping them reach their goals, that's an important component in our ability to get the pricing as well. So it's all coming together very well. But to Al's point, it's going to just take a little bit of time. We want to work with our customers. We want to keep the customer but also work with them in a way that allows us to get the price as well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Garik [ph] with Longbow. Unidentified Analyst : And just a follow-up on the pricing outlook, the 2%. How much of that is already secured from 2018 actions versus how much new incremental pricing you need to secure to hit the guidance? Allen Mistysyn : We've talked about the U.S. stores. The effectiveness improves over time, and we'll get to up to 75% over the 9 months. So we're still working through that. And the effectiveness is on track with where we expected to end with similar price increases. When you move to our other businesses, and we don't talk about those in detail as much, just because they're more choppy and the timing and amounts. And as you can imagine, the different businesses and different geographies have different load-in rates. So we believe we're getting the effectiveness we need. We see that in our Performance Coatings performance in our fourth quarter in particular. And we'll see continued effectiveness as we go through 2019. Unidentified Analyst : And my follow-up is just on some of the launch cost and supply chain adjustments that you saw. 2018 lingered into Q4, are any of those expected to continue into 2019? Allen Mistysyn : No. The program cost that we'll talk about in the first quarter is just your ongoing cost, and I'll just take the opportunity to, as a reminder, our first quarter in consumer is a small quarter still. So we're going to see the impact of the margin on those program costs that are -- I don't want to say 100% fixed but are pretty fixed. So in a small quarter and volume, we're going to take a hit on operating margin year-over-year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Gregory Scott Melich : Got through a lot, so I just want to make sure I got the cash flow sort of targets and leverage right. If I look at your guidance and take the midpoint, it seems like free cash flow this year should be maybe a touch under $2 billion. And even as the dividend went up a lot, say to $550 million and you paid down $600 million of debt, does that mean buybacks would probably be $800 million or $1 billion? Or is there another moving piece in there that we're missing, like the accounting change on leases or something else? Allen Mistysyn : No, there's not another moving piece. It will depend -- like I said, the share buyback will depend on M&A activity, but I think you're directionally accurate with the pieces. Gregory Scott Melich : And I think you mentioned before that the accounting change on leases was maybe half a turn of leverage. Any update on that and when you're going to adopt the new standard? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, we'll adopt the new standard in 2019. And we'll see an increase in assets and liabilities of about $1.7 billion to $1.8 million. Gregory Scott Melich : $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. And the impact on the leverage ratio? Allen Mistysyn : The leverage ratio, when you look at it from the rating agency standpoint, they're already factoring in a portion of that. But yes, you think about a $3 billion-plus EBITDA, it's 0.5 or 0.7, somewhere in that range. Operator : The next question is from the line of Dmitry [ph] with Buckingham Research Group. Unidentified Analyst : Just wanted to sort of go back to your outlook for the year. And I know you guys aren't big in construction exposure in Europe. But if there was one sort of theme that's come through this earnings call season is that the European construction and building construction market is probably as bad as anybody's seen that. Outside of your U.K. and maybe some other regions present in terms of paint, are you exposed to the construction market in Europe in any meaningful way through either General Industrial or coil or industrial wood type of businesses in Performance Coatings? John Morikis : Yes, coil would be a component, Dmitry, to your point, but if it remains down significantly, that it could have an impact. But there, we've got a pretty diversified business, and to be truthful to you, the market share that we have versus the opportunity, I'm not too worried about that right now. We've got a lot ahead of us to accomplish there. So we're pedal to the metal here in Coil Europe. Robert Wells : We also have some industrial wood exposure in Europe that's been soft as well. And when we acquired those businesses back in 2010, they made a point about the fact that they have a pretty solid joinery business, which would go into primarily residential construction. Unidentified Analyst : So there's a little bit of exposure, but certainly not anything that is untoward in terms of impacting your ability to grow? John Morikis : No, but in the spirit of transparency, I did mention earlier that the European market for our Performance Coatings business was the softest, and -- in 2018, and that's continued as we've -- the first to lap here with January. Unidentified Analyst : And then, just staying with Performance Coatings, they put up a flat year-over-year margin in terms of operating profit line in the fourth quarter. It sounds like, still, you expect a little bit of maybe negative margin delta for the first -- and maybe even first 2 quarters next year. So can you explain, or can you provide some visibility on sort of what drove the margin parity in year-over-year? Was it sort of getting the last chunk of Valspar synergies for the year, hitting the fourth quarter? Was it some raw material movements or prebuying or the price increase that you put in? I'm just trying to understand why I shouldn't be modeling continuing progression in margins in terms of year-over-year improvement for this business, given how strongly you finished in the fourth quarter. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Dmitry. But as I said, the pricing comes in differently than it does in our stores. It's not as uniform. So certainly, we saw some price impact our fourth quarter sequentially from the third quarter and, certainly, year-over-year. I think the team has done a very good job at managing their expenses. They have done a very good job of integrating and getting synergies faster than what was planned, and there's more work to do. But as we get in further into the integration, we start getting in the formulation changes, facility consolidations and the like. And they take longer, and the savings are harder to predict on timing. I would say, just sequentially, you're right. Our first half, from a raw material standpoint, is going to be higher year-over-year, and we're continuing to put price in to offset that. How well, we -- and effectively we can implement that, I'll tell you if we can start seeing margin expansion in our first half versus, I agree with you, for sure, in our second half. Operator : The next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research. Rosemarie Morbelli : I was wondering, one area we didn't really talk about is packaging. And if you could give us a little more details in terms of the non-BPA and then businesses which are not non-BPA related. John Morikis : We're very pleased with the performance of our packaging business, one of the strongest that we have. We have a very unique technology in our product. It's a V70 product that is leading application and coverage product. So we're excited about the growth that we're gaining here because of the ability for this product to run smoother and more efficiently in the plants of our customers. And so we are out. We're getting more and more approvals from the various influencers and owners. And we've had tremendous success getting the product online and demonstrating the value that can be generated even though the product might be slightly more expensive. But overall, the applied cost of this product is a savings and efficiency enhancement to our customers. So really excited about where this team is going. Rosemarie Morbelli : So if we look at Europe and the slowdown and the decline in almost every category, packaging still grew beyond what the market did. John Morikis : Yes. I think it's fair to say better than the market; but in Europe last year, they had some dynamics in packaging that affected the overall market that we were impacted by as well. Rosemarie Morbelli : What was that? John Morikis : Well, if you look at things like the harvest of product or food and the impact that it's had on our customers that has a direct impact on us. Rosemarie Morbelli : So we are talking about vegetables, and we are also talking about fishing, I presume? John Morikis : Yes, I'd say as a group, overall. We try to avoid having discussions about weather and vegetables on our earnings calls, so... Rosemarie Morbelli : Sorry. If I understood properly, the level of buyback is going to depend on whether or not you are going to have any M&A. So when -- I'm sure you have a long pipeline, but when you look at it, is there something that you could say could be imminent or pre-year-end 2019 that you could close or announce? John Morikis : I would just say that we're in discussions, some stronger, and we're more optimistic than others. But there's a long way to go. And a lot of I's to dot and T's to cross, so I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here. And we're having good discussions, so I'd leave it at that. Rosemarie Morbelli : And if I may just sneak one in. If we are looking at the same store comps, 2019 over 2018, are we looking at a similar 5% growth? John Morikis : I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question? Rosemarie Morbelli : Sure. Same-store growth 2019 versus 2018, similar growth at the 5% level more or less? Allen Mistysyn : More or less. John Morikis : Yes. Operator : Next question is from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Justin Speer : A couple questions, one, for housekeeping. Can you tell us what the pretax dollars are associated with that $0.48 transaction integration cost, where those reside in the P&L, and what that is on a pretax basis would be helpful. Jane Cronin : On a transaction and integration cost, about $40 million of it is cost of goods and 20 -- I'm sorry, $36 million is cost of goods and $21 million of SG&A. Justin Speer : And then a couple questions on the fundamentals. Just looking at your -- as it pertains to the first quarter and thinking mapping that out, can you remind us what the monthly comparison was for growth last year, January, February, March in the core Americas business? Allen Mistysyn : We won't break it out by quarter, but we had a pretty strong first quarter last year. Robert Wells : I want to say the comp was 5.2%. Allen Mistysyn : 5.2% is the comp. Yes. Justin Speer : But that's a step-down from like 8.2% in the fourth quarter of '17 down to -- I recall the weather was pretty cold last year in the first quarter, which I don't know how that affects your comparisons this year. We'll see. But I recall that growth stepped down in the first quarter last year versus the fourth quarter. Allen Mistysyn : That's correct. But you also had the effect of 2 price increases essentially in our fourth quarter of '17 because we went out October 1 in '17 versus December 1 in '16. So that moved it a little bit as well. Justin Speer : On that price cost front, in terms of the price cost dynamics that you're thinking through, particularly as you're kind of baking in assumptions for implied margins for '19, thinking about price cost for raws and non-raw cost inflation, if you're to snap a line today, how much margin tailwind are you achieving from what you already have in hand in relation to that cost bucket in terms of margin accretion for '19? Allen Mistysyn : We're just not going to break out what we think our margin growth is going to be. But as I mentioned, the 12.8% increase EPS at the midpoint. It tells you we're going to have margin expansion in the year. Operator : The next question is from the line of Eric [ph] with Cleveland Research Company. Unidentified Analyst : The 4% to 7% total sales growth guidance for '19 seems to imply an acceleration relative to the 2018, which I think was 4.7% that you said. And I know the 4% to 7% is a range, but in the midpoint of that range, what businesses grow faster in '19 than they grew in '18? John Morikis : Well, our stores will have to grow -- they'll carry it, Eric. As you know, they're the engine of the company, so we have high expectations there. But if you go across the industrial businesses, we feel as though -- the Performance Coatings business would be, as a group, probably the second fastest-growing, and then our consumer group in the lower single digits. Unidentified Analyst : And the improved growth in '19 relative to '18 from it sounds like, stores and Performance Coatings. Is that market growth? Is that price? Is that market share? Which one would stand out the most within that for both of those? John Morikis : They would all be key levers that we're using. We do believe that our market share growth is an important lever, but we certainly see opportunities across all of those that you mentioned. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Christopher [ph] with Bloomberg. Unidentified Analyst : Quick question on the debt this year. Is the plan to retire the outstanding debt that's due in 2019? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. The $300 million that's due in June, we'll retire that. Plus we'll retire another $300 million in short term that we had outstanding. Unidentified Analyst : And then, a technical question; in terms of the weather and in terms of actual application of paint, is there anything that precludes indoor painting at a certain temperature threshold? If it's below 50, have you seen slowdown in interior application in the past? John Morikis : No. The only impact, Chris, would be that if the projects themselves are pushed back, right, due to weather, temperature, rain, whatever it might be, but the application indoor, if it's a protected environment, the ambient conditions are typically such that they can apply what they need to apply. Operator : It appears we have no further questions at this time, so I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Morikis for any additional concluding comments. John Morikis : Thank you, Jessie. I'd like to close this morning by taking a moment to acknowledge the contributions of a valued member of our management team over the past 17 years.

Before summarizing our results for the quarter, I would like to remind you that our annual financial community presentation is coming up on June 5, here in Cleveland, Ohio. Please contact me or Jim Jaye to receive the registration link to this event. It's a great opportunity for you to meet and hear from our business unit, management team, and we hope to see you all there. Moving on to our results for the first quarter, all comparisons in my remarks are to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 unless otherwise stated. Consolidated sales in the first quarter of 2019 increased $75.9 million or 1.9% to $4.04 billion. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the quarter increased $48.2 million or 2.9% to $1.74 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the first quarter increased to 42.9% from 42.5% in the same period last year. Excluding impacts from purchase accounting, adjusted consolidated gross margin in the quarter was flat year-over-year at 43%. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased $29.5 million or 2.4% to $1.24 billion in the first quarter and also increased as a percent of sales to 30.8% from 30.6% in the same quarter last year. Interest expense for the quarter was essentially flat at $91 million. Consolidated profit before tax in the first quarter decreased $4.7 million or 1.6% to $298.9 million. The first quarter of 2019 included non-operating expenses of $32.4 million primarily related to a pension plan settlement as described in our press release and included in our previous guidance. Excluding acquisition related costs and non-operating expense, our effective tax rate on adjusted income for the quarter was 19.3%. Diluted net income per common share for the first quarter 2019 was flat compared to last year at $2.62 per share. Earnings per share in the first quarter of 2019 includes non-operating expenses of $0.27 per share and acquisition related expenses of $0.71 per share. The $2.62 per share reported in the first quarter of 2018 included $0.95 per share in acquisition related expenses. Excluding these items from both years, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to $3.60 in the first quarter of 2019 from $3.57 last year. We have summarized the first quarter earnings per share comparison in a Reg G reconciliation table at the end of our press release. Let me take a few minutes to breakdown our performance by segment. Sales for The Americas Group in the first quarter increased $74.4 million or 3.6% to $2.15 billion. Unfavorable currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.5%. Comparable store sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 3.6% in the quarter. Regionally in the first quarter, our Southeast division led all divisions followed by Eastern, Canada, Southwest, and Midwest. Sales were positive in every division in the quarter. First quarter segment profit decreased $6.3 million or 1.9% to $331.1 million. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit $4.5 million in the quarter. First quarter segment operating margin declined 80 basis points to 15.4% from 16.2% last year. Turning now to the Consumer Brands Group, first quarter sales decreased $1.9 million or 3/10th of a percent to $654.5 million including the divestiture of the Guardsman business. Sales from continuing operations excluding approximately $17 million in Guardsman revenue increased 2.4% in the quarter. First quarter segment profit increased $13.7 million or 18.5% to $87.9 million. Purchase accounting cost decreased segment profit by $22.9 million compared to $31.8 million in the first quarter 2018. First quarter segment operating margin increased to 13.4% from 11.3% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expenses in both quarters, adjusted segment operating margin increased to 16.9% in the first quarter 2019 from 16.2% in the first quarter last year. For our Performance Coatings Group, first quarter sales increased $3 million or 0.2% to $1.23 billion. Currency translation rate changes reduced first quarter sales by 3.9%. First quarter segment profit increased $7.9 million or 8.7% to $98.7 million. Unfavorable currency translation reduced segment profit $3.5 million in the quarter and purchase accounting expense decreased segment profit by $54.1 million compared to $57.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter Performance Group Segment operating margin increased to 8% from 7.4% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expense in both quarters, segment operating margin increased to 12.4% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 12.1% in the first quarter last year. That concludes our review of operating results for the first quarter. So, let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments on the first quarter and provide our outlook for second quarter and full-year 2019. John? John Morikis : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to make -- just a few additional comments on our first quarter before moving on to our outlook. First quarter volumes were a bit lighter than anticipated across all three segments, driving consolidated results to the lower end of our expectations range. We commented in our press release issued this morning that the North American architectural painting season got off to a slow start compared to last year. But it's important to keep this in perspective. It is traditionally the smallest revenue quarter of the year. It is - probably year-to-year. So it's often not very representative of underlying demand trends. Robust feedback from our professional painting contractor customers has long been our most reliable indicator of North American architectural paint demand. These customers almost universally remain optimistic about 2019 and continue to report unseasonably high project backlogs in a very healthy pipeline of new projects. This consistent feedback underpins our confidence in our full-year outlook, in spite of the slow start to the season. Our sales results in the quarter highlighted the geographic variability in demand, we have seen since mid-year last year. Volume growth in North America ranged from stable to strong with a few exceptions, while the softness in Asia and Europe was fairly broad based but also with the few noteworthy exceptions. Pricing was favorable across all of our businesses in a quarter, while the impact of currency translation on all three segments was a bit more of a headwind than expected, but we're not satisfied with our top line performance. Consolidated gross margin on an adjusted basis improved 60 basis points sequentially and was flat year-over-year at 43%. This is encouraging given our expectation that the rate of raw material inflation year-over-year will be highest in first quarter. We expect to see more gross margin improvement over the balance of the year as volumes pick up, the rate of raw material inflation moderates and we continue to benefit from pricing actions announced over the past year. SG&A in a quarter came in largely as expected and we'll continue to maintain appropriate discipline on spending as the year unfolds. Within the Americas group, sales increased 3.6% against the prior year comparison of 6.6%. Sales volume growth in our North American stores fell short of our expectations. Sales to protective and marine and residents or repaint contractors were our strongest customer segments in the quarter both up high single-digits over last year. All other customer segments were positive. Our business in Latin America went from positive double-digit growth last year to a high single-digit decline this year due to high-teens unfavorable currency translation. Segment profit dollars and margins for the group were negatively impacted by lower than anticipated volume, which in North America was likely the result as projects being postponed. During the quarter, we opened 15 net new stores finishing the quarter with 4,711 stores in operation, compared to 4,624 last year. Our plan calls for this team to add approximately 90 to 100 net new stores in the Americas by the end of this year. In the Consumer segment, first quarter sales were positive in North America. Even if we include the negative impact of the Guardsman divestiture, demand was considerably softer and non-domestic regions during the quarter most notably Asia Pacific, made pretty good progress on improving the profitability of this business. The segment margin excluding purchase accounting impacts increased both sequentially and year-over-year. This is the highest quarterly operating margin reported by this segment since the acquisition of Valspar. We are successfully executing our strategy in this business and we are well-positioned with our retail partners heading into this spring - selling season. Performance Coatings Group sales in the quarter grew modestly against a challenging prior year comparison of 9.8% on a performer basis. Revenue and volume growth in packaging and coil was offset by flat to down sales results in the segments other businesses. Geographically, sales increased in North America but these gains were offset by declines in Asia Pacific and Europe, where sales were down high single and mid single-digits respectively. We continue to see some benefit from our pricing actions across these businesses and regions as adjusted segment margin improved by 30 basis points year-over-year to 12.4%. EBITDA in the quarter was $533 million or 575 million on an adjusted basis to exclude the pension plan settlement expense and acquisition related costs. Working capital was a higher use of cash in the quarter as we built additional inventory through our fourth and first quarters to ensure our ability to respond to anticipated strong seasonal order volumes in our stores and retail customers. At the end of the quarter, we had $94 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to fund operations and reduce debt. The balance sheet reflects total debt of approximately 9.8 billion. We intend to reduce our net debt by approximately 600 million during the year, which will result in a net debt to EBITDA ratio below 3 to 1 by the end of 2019. After prioritizing debt reduction over other uses of cash during the past two years, we are resuming our historical capital allocation philosophy in 2019. We returned approximately $410 million to shareholders during the quarter including $105 million in cash dividends and $305 million to purchase 750,000 shares of common stock. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 31% to $0.0113 per share. At quarter end, our share repurchase authorization stood at $9.38 million shares, capital expenditures were $51 million in the quarter. Depreciation was $65 million and amortization was $79 million. As we move into the second quarter 2019, we expect consolidated net sales to increase 2% to 5% compared to the second quarter of 2018. With the Americas group at or above the high end of that range as a reminder second quarter revenue comparisons to 2018 in the Americas group and the Performance Coatings group are the most challenging of the year and consumer brands group faces comparisons to early load in volume from the lows program in the divested guardsman business. Our full-year 2019 revenue guidance remains unchanged with net sales increasing 47% compared to full-year 2018. On an earnings per share basis, we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude thus far acquisition related costs in non-operating items. On this basis and given our sales outlook, we are confirming our adjusted 2019 full-year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $0.02040 to $0.02140 per share, an increase of approximately 13% at the midpoint compared to the $0.01853 reported last year on a comparable basis. We've included a Regulation G reconciliation table with this morning's press release to better illustrate all the moving parts. We expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range, a few additional data points for the full-year may be helpful for modeling purposes, these data points have not changed from the guidance we provided in January, we expect raw material inflation for the full-year 2019 will be in the low single-digits compared to 2018. The rate of year over year inflation assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and those supply disruptions should diminish from the level we saw in the first quarter as we progressed through the year. We expect incremental synergies of approximately $70 to $80 million in 2019 and a total annual run rate of approximately 415 million that year end. We expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $320 million, depreciation to be about $257 million, and amortization to be about $315 million. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thank you. As it relates to your intermediate term outlook for U.S. housing, can you just hit on the key ongoing trends by sub-region, just any updated views on rates, affordability, single versus multi-family, and just any preliminary views on sales [ph] would be greatly appreciated? Thank you. John Morikis : Yes, Chris, and we're going to sound a little like a broken record on this subject because we continue to believe that the sharp declines in starts year to-date particularly in single-family is not a reflection of a decline in demand, and in fact March new home sales were pretty strong. So that kind of underpins our view that the rate of new home construction is unsustainably low at the current rate, given continued strength in household formation. Household formations are going to continue in the range of, call it, 1.2 million to 1.3 million annually for the next five-plus years. And historically, if you look at the rate of new home starts, they've run at approximately -- a rate of approximately 1.3 times the rate of household formations, and that's just to account for housing units that are taken out of stock over time either by natural disaster or demolition, whatever the case may be. But over the past four years, housing starts have run roughly in line with household formations. And as a result, what we've seen is inhabitable vacancies have largely been absorbed and single-family rental stock is being converted to owner-occupied stock, and we don't think that is going to be able to sustain demand for housing long-term. So, it's a broader answer to a little more granular question that you asked, but we think the challenge for builders continues to be building affordable entry level units given high land cost, high land development costs, labor costs et cetera. And while we think that the starts in the first quarter were abnormally low, we expect to see a pick up in starts as we go through the year. We agree with the outlook that home building should be up over 2018 and 2019, it's likely going to be up modestly, low single-digits. In terms of any regional variation, the Southeast continues to be very strong. Southwest has had some challenges, but should pick up as well, and that's where you're going to see most of the activity. Christopher Parkinson : Got it. And just a quick follow-up -- kind of the ongoing multi-year integration Performance Coatings, it seems like you guys are back on the track on the pricing fronts, can you just comment on your updated long-term views by sub-segment with just an emphasis on general industrial packaging and wood, just what have been the biggest surprises, both positive and negative? Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Hey, Chris, this is Al Mistysyn. I'm going to talk about the consolidated segment and then I'll let John comment about the individual pieces, but as we saw in our first quarter nice year-over-year margin improvement and that's really the teams doing a great job, working with their customers to get the pricing to offset the persistent raw material inflation that we saw, and also seeing nice synergy realization and controlling their SG&A. So, we have talked about targeting high-teens to low 20% operating margin, and we feel like we're on that track here in 2019 and more to come as the year progresses. John Morikis : So, one or two things I'll add to that, this continues to be something that we're very focused on. We believe that as the two companies came together, we found ourselves in an inflationary period and felt that it was important to work with our customers through that process of implementing these prices. I don't know we are going to breakdown every segment to tell you the ground that we're gaining in each one, but I will tell you that we are great gaining ground in each one. And while we've accepted some compression over the elevating raw material basket, we also believe that the solutions that we're bringing our customers and the services that we're providing as part of those solutions are opportunities for us to work with our customers in pushing through those price increases, and we're determined to do just that. Christopher Parkinson : Okay. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff John Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff John Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Are the raw material trends in the United States different than they are in the offshore markets? And how would you compare raw material price inflation U.S. versus the rest of the world? John Morikis : Jeff, I think there are some differences in certain commodities like titanium dioxide. I don't necessarily believe that the petrochemical side of the basket is vastly different as you look around the world. TiO2 has been stable in the U.S. And I think it's been moving a bit more in Asia Pacific and Europe. The petrochemicals, kind of surprisingly given the move in crude oil have been somewhat stable with as, you know, with propylene and ethylene actually trading down, you're trading lower year-over-year. We have not seen much benefit from that in our raw material basket yet, but we expect to as we move through the balance of the year. Jeff John Zekauskas : Okay. You said in your press release that your same-store sales growth was 3.6%, the quarter in the Americas group, like order of magnitude, are prices up 2.5 and volumes up one for the first quarter? John Morikis : Yes, Jeff, that sounds about right. We talked about the realization coming out of our year end call about 2.5, and we might be a little bit better than that, but I think you're directionally correct. Jeff John Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. John Roberts : Thank you. Well, Nippon's deals for Dulux in Australia change your strategy at all in Australia? John Morikis : No, it shouldn't. John Roberts : And then, in the packaging coatings area, are we still seeing penetration from non-BPA, or is that now largely over with? John Morikis : We're having very good success in our non-BPA RV 70 products. In fact, packaging with the exception of all our industrial businesses it was up globally and it was up in all regions. So, we continue to see a nice performance in our packaging business. John Roberts : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning guys. Just wanted to touch on the Americas group's margins, in the first quarter, they saw about 80 bips year-over-year. Could you just explain why this was, and how much of it would you say was it due to the lack of volume and leverage versus raw material inflation may be coming in a bit heavier than what you expected? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Truman, you know as John mentioned in his opening remarks, the first quarter in North America is our smallest quarter and most volatile, and it truly is all about the volume and, it's a little lower than anticipated in our North American, Paint Stores Group and to your point, we also saw higher year-over-year raw material inflation in the quarter. So those are driving that margin but that being said, we continue to invest an 87 net new stores over the past year with a corresponding increase in sales reps to support those stores, that's a continuation of our consistent long-term approach to the North American architectural market, and we have not slowed our cadence down on the store openings just because of the last two quarters we've had. And we believe this is going to continue to allow us to grow market share one and a half to two times the market, and has historically allowed us to gain a larger share of the market, when the -- when the cycle turns. So, we talked about the price increases and I feel pretty good about those, and with the price increase and the demand outlook that John talked about in his opening comments, I am confident, that our TAG organization is going to expand margins this year. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you. And to follow-up on that, with the raw material inflation you guys -- could you guys just give an update your prior I think low single-digit raw material inflation guidance and I'm just trying to understand your confidence in this in your guidance considering 2018, kind of caught everybody off guard, especially with your guys comment that 1Q is going to be the high watermark for raw material inflation, considering that oil seems like it's ticked up quite a bit here lately? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Truman. At this point, I think our outlook for first quarter being the peak appears to be at least correct so far, your point on oil moving it's certainly moved quite a ways but probably the ethylene have not, and propylene, in particular which is the primary feedstock still is down year-over-year, it's barely moved off a $0.32 bottom. So, those being the primary drivers of the petrochemical side of our basket still look very favorable. I'm not saying they couldn't move with crude oil but they haven't thus far. Our outlook for low single-digit inflation for full-year presumes that the highest year-over-year increase as you said was in the first quarter. And I think it's safe to assume that the market average price for the broad basket of materials we buy was probably up in the low to mid single-digits in the first quarter. We expect to see that moderate as we go into the second quarter. Not to say second quarter couldn't be inflationary but it will be lower inflation than we saw in the first. By the time we get into back half it should be deflationary. Truman Patterson : Okay, okay. Thank you and just a follow-up real quick. If I'm reading you correctly with propane and ethylene still being down year-over-year, are you saying that there might be a chance that your oil derived resins might be down in the back half of the year? Al Mistysyn : There's a chance, they stepped up sharply midyear last year and while we're not back to below the level they were prior to June last year after as we annualize that move up in midyear, there's a chance they'll be down year-over-year in the back half. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi, guys, good morning. John, in your prepared comments, you reference strong backlogs at the customer level for the Americas Group. Can you give us some more color on that which verticals in particular had a stronger backlog? What feedback specifically are customers giving you in current market conditions especially as interest rates progressed lower throughout the quarter? John Morikis : Ghansham, I'd say that we're really excited about the balance of the year because of the feedback that we're getting across all the verticals, all the segments. We've obviously have a terrific model in this controlled distribution where we're able to really keep our fingers on the pulse of the customer and the feedback that we're getting has been pretty universal as I mentioned earlier. It's solid across the geographies and the segments, so we're feeling very good about the balance of the year obviously get into a little bit of a slower start than we would like to have seen but still feeling really good about where we're headed. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. And then just on consumer brands, you mentioned that you're very well positioned across all the North American retail channels. Can you also expand on that? Do you think that channel itself will improve in 2019 versus the past couple of years or is that your specific positioning post the share shift that you're particularly excited about? Thanks. John Morikis : Well, I think our customers should hold us accountable to help them improve their results. We want to work with our customers and help them reach their goals. So we continue to work with those partners working to drive their success and we do that by helping to ensure that our products are consistent and the high quality, the brands are strong, that we have the right relationships in the right channels with the right assortment allows us to bring that value to the customers that we have and the consumers that they serve. And each one of those customers offer a unique opportunity growth and we're making sure that we're aligning our people of resources everything that we have to help them reach their goals. So we want to help those customers outpace the market. Ghansham Panjabi : Thanks you. John Morikis : Thanks, Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Koort : Thanks. John or Al, when you guys talked initially about your synergies from integrating Valspar, you mentioned that some of those manufacturing maybe would be a little longer tail? So can you give us an update on the progress there and what's left to come? John Morikis : Yes, Bob. We're still working through it by region as we talked about the longer tail on those is predominantly in the industrial space which are more complicated and take longer to get done. I would say there are amounts in our $415 million run rate that we talked about coming out of this year. But we'll get those fine tuned here in the next quarter or two and try to give more color around those as we go forward this year. Al Mistysyn : And Bob, I know you and I have talked about this to some degree. Our goal is certainly to attack those synergies but we're not going to do it at the cost of a customer. The goal is not to get just the cost out. We want to become more efficient. No question about it, but we're taking our time to make sure that we're taking the right steps. And as these synergies roll in, we want to make sure it's a more favorable experience for our customers and put our salespeople in a better position to serve those customers. Robert Koort : And can I ask your Lowe's business now you're the single line paint supplier there. Can you talk about how that makes you a better supplier, the paint aisle better at Lowe's having sort of a uniform or unified supply strategy there? Al Mistysyn : Sure. It ensures the terrific alignment that I touched on earlier. We are looking at a collaborative view of how do we help our customer reach their goals? And so the sharing of information and the tactics that we use are certainly in line with their goals. And it allows us to have more open dialog with how to best help them reach those goals. And so there's a lot of momentum there, is a terrific leadership team that is driven to improve those results and we want to make sure that our resources are in line with the goals that they have. Robert Koort : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. Bob, you were talking about your outlook for second half raw material costs potentially being down year-over-year. Does that conviction come from your purchasing costs for raws today being down year-over-year that will flow through COGS in the next couple of quarters? Bob Wells : Yes, that's part of it, Steve. We have been building inventory with lower cost petrochemical raws. Part of it is the lag that that our suppliers have in passing through lower cost feedstocks and those feedstocks working their way through the acrylic chain. And I'd say probably the latter point is most of it. Steve Byrne : Okay. And John, you mentioned some of your contractor customers have what you described as unseasonably high backlog other than maybe a break in the last six months worth of weather. Is there anything else that you could see holding them back from accelerating the execution of that backlogs such as access to good labor? John Morikis : Well, labor is clearly a piece of that. No question about it. And I think the first the projects aren't going to go away. I mean it's a robust bidding market right now. So there's a great deal of confidence on the part of our customers and I'd say to your point about the labor, we look at this as the opportunity for us to shine to our customers as they get under more pressure to serve their customers, the model that we have, the products that we have, the service that we provide, the alignment that we can reach with our customers becomes more valuable to those customers. So, our opportunity to help them to be more successful, so while it's a challenge for many of our customers from the volume standpoint they become more dependent on us and we like that, we like to demonstrate what we can do and how we can help them be more successful. Steve Byrne : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood : Thank you. Thinking about the sales outlook for the year the 4% to 7% with 2% in the first quarter and between 2% and 5%, I understand obviously there's some comps issue in the later start to the painting season. You mentioned the backlogs obviously in the prior question earlier in your comments obviously is giving you confidence, what else can you kind of describe for us in terms of what gives you the confidence to get to that 4% to 7% range for the year? For example, trends in April has the construction season gotten off to a more robust start with the later start, perhaps later in March. Just if you could kind of give us a little bit more color please on the outlook? John Morikis : Hey, Nishu. The start to April is in line with the sales guidance we gave and we talked about 2% to 5% with our North American stores being not only at the high end but above the high end and we feel good about that guidance. As far as the second half, you got to remember is our first half has its toughest comps, Performance Coatings did 90 in the first quarter 11% in the second quarter, so we're going up against a 10% quarter. Our store comps were 6% to 8% last year and our second quarter and as you know our second half tailed off. So if you look at comparisons of midst almost high single-digits in the first half and low single-digits in the second half. The other thing I would talk about some of the headwinds that we're facing in our first half will start to annualize and it's the exited business in the U.S. that will annualize, it's the Guardsman divestiture and even some of the tariff impacts that we saw on our industrial businesses. And then the final piece of that is our FX year-over-year comparison gets easier in the second half. We are basically neutral in the first half on FX last year and over 1%. And so now we're saying, we're going to be a little bit over 2% or a little bit over 2% in the first quarter. That'll be both a little bit below 2% because of seasonality but then in the second half we have easier comps. So it's a grouping of many things that goes into our confidence in the second half. Al Mistysyn : Yes, I'd like to add to that if I could, Nishu. I think your question is a good one about the confidence of our customers and I think I'll talk about a lot of really good points there, a few others that I'd like to expand on. One is we're not waiting for things to happen here. We don't open our doors and hope people come in. We're very aggressive and active in trying to grow our business and while our customers are confident with their pipeline, we also hedge our bets and making sure that we have growth. So we've talked over the last couple of years about our share of wallet initiatives as well as our new account activity. We've been very aggressive over the first quarter, really driving those activities inside our stores. So we're excited about not only what will happen from our existing customers but the opportunity to grow in both new accounts and share of wallet start with. Second, the investments that we're making give us a lot of confidence in new stores and new reps, new products. I mean we want to keep pushing that pipeline full of reasons for customers to continue to switch to Sherwin-Williams, we want to make it easier for our employees to be in front of those customers with something to increase the value of proposition. And then finally, if you look at the other pieces of the businesses, consumer benefits we think are strong as we get better alignment with our customers and we believe that we talk a lot about Lowe's and we're excited about that and we believe there's a lot of opportunity but there's a lot of opportunity with our other customers in those segments as well. And on the PCG side, I mean those businesses coming together with terrific synergies in products, people, relationships, specifications. It's hard for us to look at any one piece of our business and not be excited about the balance of the year. Nishu Sood : Got it. Thanks for all the details. Focusing in on the consumer brands group, if you factor out the Guardsman divestiture and currency the 4% call it organic sales growth you saw there and I'm not including obviously the inventory loaded in 3Q. It's the strongest quarter you've had there in a while and especially with the late start to the painting season and the weakness overseas it implies just a really nice result in North America there. Are there any one-off factors that might kind of temper the enthusiasm a little bit about the potential there, was there some reloading ahead of the spring season, just anything that might have boosted what looks like a pretty strong result in North America? Al Mistysyn : For the most part, Nishu, no. It's hard to draw that line at the end of the quarter to say which in any one year might fall on one side of the line or the other but the way you've asked your question is much easier to answer. There's nothing that we can point to say this happened this year versus last year. We think to your point the team is executing, we're implementing a good strategy but we've still are very excited about what's ahead of us as well. Nishu Sood : Okay, thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Nishu. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Steven Haynes : Hi, this is actually Steve Haynes on for Vincent. So if you guys could maybe just elaborate a little bit more on your titanium dioxide pricing outlook this year and whether you're thinking that maybe after a sustained period of inventory destocking whether or not the coatings industry will maybe need to restock in the back half? Thanks. John Morikis : Yes, we'll see to what extent the softness in demand over the last quarter or two has been destocking versus just a slowdown in demand particularly outside of North America. We think demand remains pretty robust in North America. It is likely the tightest TiO2 market, if you look across the regions and I think the pricing reflects that, the pricing in TiO2 has been relatively stable over the last couple of quarters. That's our expectation going forward. It's not to say that we're not going to see pricing announcements but unless you see the supply demand balance tighten meaningfully from here, I'm not sure to what extent any future pricing and announcements are going to get traction. Our outlook is stable, relatively stable pricing over the balance of the year. Steven Haynes : Okay, thank you. John Morikis : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson : Thank you. Bob, just a question on your outlook for the architectural paint market in North America both what you saw as growth in 2018, what you think could happen in 2019 and a particular question is we've seen a lot of strength in remodeling the last few years, that appears to be slowing and I know Harvard was out recently calling for much more of a slowing in 2019. So do you agree with that outlook and if so what would be the implications for the U.S. architectural paint market and your growth? Bob Wells : Hey, good question Don and as a reminder at where we stand right now from an industry standpoint more than 80% of gallon volume in the industry is going into the repaint markets both residential and non-residential. So it is what will drive industry volume over the foreseeable future. We think it's an oversimplification to assume that turnover is the only driver of remodeling activity, in fact if you look at all the historical drivers of U.S. remodeling activity only one and albeit an important one that is existing, home turnover has stalled over the last 12 to 18 months. The others including aging housing stock, home value appreciation, strong employment backdrop, consumer confidence et cetera remain intact. And I'd argue a lot of those are getting stronger. The other kind of difference in this cycle is in recent years there have been some unique non-traditional factors driving demand for remodeling. For example the Baby Boomers decision at least up to this point to age in place. Baby Boomers represent about a third of owner occupied households. But over the last couple of years have accounted for about 50% of the remodeling spend. And we're not seeing that slow down at least there's no indication that that's slowing down. As I mentioned in my previous comments on the housing market in general, the conversion of single-family rentals in vacant homes back to owner occupied and we've actually seen a reversal in the rate of home ownership, it's been declining or it's stagnant for years, now we're seeing it start to tick back up as those rental single-family rentals are being absorbed by owners. And it's important to note that the roughly three million housing units that went from rental or vacant to owner occupied over the last couple years on average are in higher disrepair than existing home transaction would generally be and therefore require more remodeling and higher spend per unit than a typical existing home transaction. And so our conclusion is absent a recession these factors are going to continue to drive growth and remodeling spend at higher rates than overall growth in the housing market. And it's true that Harvard has lowered their outlook for 2019 but we're still above 5% remodeling spend. And we also believe that you're likely to see kind of a shift away from high ticket which has been driving a lot of the remodeling spend over the last few years to lower ticket which primarily is painting and decorating. John Morikis : Don, I would only add a couple of seconds here. We've had five years of double-digit compounded growth in our res-repaint business. We believe we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on the paint portion of that remodel opportunity in a scenario focus for us, it's likely one of the largest opportunities we have as a company. And so we're very excited about the opportunity in this space. Don Carson : Thank you. Bob Wells : Thanks, Don. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I actually had two. First I wanted to get your thoughts on wins. I know local and regional builders and property managers are something you guys haven't focused on. So I just want an update there. And then my second question is as we look at the year to get it the high end of your plan or maybe even above what would you think would drive that? So a two-part question, thanks. John Morikis : So, on your first piece, Scott, we talk about wins and I'm assuming talk about winning businesses what you're referencing there? Scott Mushkin : Yes. John Morikis : So, coming into the year, on the new residential side we've now reached 18 of the top 20 new residential builders. So that was up one of the Top 20 in the last, I think was in the late third or fourth quarter we're still pushing very hard on the large builders but we're also very focused on the regional builder and we're doing quite well there as well. On Property Management, it's been a terrific focus of our team in the Americas Group and we're uniquely qualified here as you would expect with our platforms to distribute product and fulfill the needs of these customers on a national basis. So there's good progress there. Our numbers in the property management area are very similar in ratio of wins at the Top 20 for property management as they are in new residential. Bob Wells : Scott, I would say to get to the high end of the range, it's really the level of North America paint stores volume, but I would also say on North America volume across consumer and Performance Coatings it's still by far the largest segment we have or geography we have, and now to dictate where we fall into the range. Scott Mushkin : Thanks guys, appreciate it. Bob Wells : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Mike Leithead : Hey guys, it's Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning. First in North America your Paint Stores, I was hoping regionally you could give us some sort of sense of the magnitude of delta between your best and worst region. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of how hit the Midwest was from a demand standpoint because of some of the weather activities there? John Morikis : Yes, just a second to look at that here. I would say that the, well I'll say it this way that the Midwest and the Southwest were hit pretty hard in the year. The Delta, I don't know that we're going to show that from, look at each other like we don't share that information. Mike Leithead : Fair enough. John Morikis : Go ahead. Mike Leithead : And then second question just on raw materials versus volumes. It seems like most people anticipate coatings volumes to accelerate in the second half of the year. Yet raw material inflation is expected to stay relatively flat or even I think maybe potentially come down like you were saying earlier, Bob. I guess is there any concern that as demand picks up there may be inflationary pressure on raw mats or are there other factors that hold raw materials back from that? Bob Wells : Well, first, Mike to be clear, our growth outlook for the back half of the year doesn't necessarily we're not necessarily expecting industry volume to inflect at the same rate. We think industry volume was a little subdued in the first quarter but our expectation to accelerate growth in the second quarter and especially in the back half is pertains more to our business than it does to the industry. You're absolutely right, we see a strong pickup in industry volume it's likely to tighten some markets for raw materials. That's a high quality problem. Mike Leithead : Got it. Thanks, guys. Bob Wells : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Bob Wells : Good morning, Arun. Arun Viswanathan : Just on that point on the volumes. I was just curious on your comp performance in Q1 versus your own expectations and how you see that progressing through the year assuming that the comp on the volume side was in the 1% to 2% range. Could that accelerate as we go through the year, just curious given that there is been changes in Q1 to Q4, seem to be not as weak versus Q2 and Q3, in years past? Thanks. John Morikis : Yes. Most single-digit gallon growth that we realized in our first quarter was softer than we were expecting. And, when you look at our second quarter sales guidance that 2% to 5%, and our paint stores at above that range, it tells you that we're going see accelerating volume in the second quarter and we would expect that similar cadence going up against the weaker second half. Al Mistysyn : Got it, just in conversations with our customers, I mean they're very clear about their inability to get to that painting phase on the projects that they're on. So, these projects are there, they're eager to get to them, we expect that they will be and we're looking forward to serving them. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks, and just as a follow-up very strong margins in Consumer, the other two were a little bit, I guess later, but from your own kind of vantage point, if you do see this volume kind of improve, do you expect a material improvement in your hair margins in both segments and especially on the gross line as well? Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Yes. I'd say and in consumer group you know part of the improvement we saw in our operating margin was good tight cost control that team has been exhibiting throughout the past year, and with realizing synergies their gross margin was actually flat year-over-year, so they had -- have had to implement pricing and as we get volume to that group I would expect margin expansion. The level of the sequential margin expansion will depend on volume the 69 was a pretty sizable quarter, on Performance Coatings, I would say we're very happy with the progress we're making on our operating margin, our core operating margin being up 30 basis points we saw the teams make good progress on pricing, and again the synergy realization in there, and you know when you talk about it sequentially I just want to be clear -- that's a volume issue, and if you look at our sequential gross margins they were actually up. So, we're making good progress, we have a lot of confidence in our medium term operating margin targets of high teens to low 20's. John Morikis : Yes, I'd say that the Performance Coatings Group's effort in this area of pricing and margin really has been terrific. Those prices continue to roll into the first quarter. Our efforts are going to continue throughout the year. So, to Allen's point we're pleased with the consumer side, but we're really excited about the Performance Coatings margins. We expect those to continue. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks and just a quick follow-up if I can on the M&A front, having just discuss your priorities for buybacks versus M&A, have you seen any kind of bolt trans emerged that are attractive to you. And if so, which areas as being and if not what with all the excess cash against going towards buybacks? Thanks. John Morikis : Yes, I'll take the first piece Arun. We are looking business by business and we often talk about our approach to our M&A is driven by business units. So we look by business then by geography to understand if there are voids that we should be pursuing. And to us, we're not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere. We're really determined on executing our strategy and taking a very disciplined approach to that. We have increased amount of activity, we're engaged in a number of potential targets and we're excited about the stage that we are in given the integration of our Valspar, and how some of these might be nice bolt-ons to our businesses. Al Mistysyn : Yes, and as we talked about on our year end call, in 2019 we're getting back to our historical cadence, a capital allocation and we talked about panned out $600 million of debt, $300 million of that is long-term that comes due in June. The rest will be short-term, our CapEx will manage below 2%. As you know, we raised our dividend over 31% in the first quarter and expect that for the year and then in the first quarter we also bought back 750,000 shares of our stock for $305 million. So you look at for the first quarter, we return $410 million to our shareholders. That's a 27%increase year-over-year and you can be assured absent M&A we're going to buyback our stock. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. As a high level question for you regarding your first quarter sales variance, you reported 1.9%, I think the prior expectation was 2% to 6% and so in explaining that variance I think you called out the slower start in the states and challenging conditions overseas and just wondering which one of those was more important or whether they were equally important in terms of explaining the variance versus your prior expectation? Al Mistysyn : Well, it's all a matter of which of our business leaders we're talking to. So, I would tell you that, we often talk about the store's business, star TAG as the engine of the company and so we always point to that model as a terrific model. But it truly is the engine of the company and we'd like to see that engine going a little quicker. I mentioned just earlier that, from a painting contractors perspective, getting that painting phase of many projects in the quarter was a bit of a challenge. It's a smaller quarter for us. Its a smaller quarter for our painting contractors. So I don't think that they planned for perfection in the first quarter because of the volatility in the weather. And so they still remain very confident. That gives us great confidence. And as I mentioned I think we're uniquely positioned to serve those customers. So, on the architectural side, it's very important. On the industrial side, when we looked at the comparable there the comps in the first quarter were up 9.8% the second quarter were up a 11%. So, we're in the mid of the toughest comparison for both these businesses from a comp standpoint. Then it breaks down quite a bit down into the 4% range in the back half of the year. Meanwhile, we're continuing with our efforts and the momentum of growing our new accounts, the share wallet in on the industrial side gaining ground as well. So, architectural is important, the industrial right behind it, but all of them important in our future growth. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. That's helpful. And then second, I want to ask you about the packaging coatings business. I think that I heard you say that it grew sales directionally. Any color with regard to volume price and the outlook for the balance of the year there would be helpful? John Morikis : Yes, we have a terrific team in our packaging business, terrific technology, unique technology I would tell you that globally our packaging was up in the mid single-digits in and they were up in every region that we participate in. So, we've got good momentum and we feel as though this is something that's only going to continue. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you so much. John Morikis : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question. John Morikis : Dmitry? Operator : Dmitry, your line is live. You may proceed with your questions. Thank you. We'll move onto our next question which is coming from line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Justin Speer : Thanks. I just had a few questions. First starting out with the Americas Group, can you walk through the monthly trends in the quarter and then also to speak to maybe how things are shaping up in April 4 for that overall business and TAG? John Morikis : Yes, I think if you look at the start I'll with April. As I said earlier, it's in line with our guidance of the two to five stores being at slightly above that range. You know the first quarter, I would just say January was strong in February and March were softer. Justin Speer : Okay. So what should we expect within that kind of the mapping of your guidance, should we expect pricing power within this business to change from that 2.5% cadence as we look to the balance of the year at 2.5. Good, good one to think about. John Morikis : I think you know it gets a little bit better as we go forward. I mean we've talked about the effectiveness improving over a nine month period and that still holds today. Justin Speer : And in terms of the segment margins saying and thinking about and looking to the second quarter that the idea of you being maybe at or above the high end of that at 2% to 5% growth ambition. You know the implications for the second quarter and margins for TAG, you expect that now flips the positive year-over-year as you look to 2Q and then obviously the back half is going to be probably much better, but to keep positive on a year-over-year basis. John Morikis : Yes, it's just that way. I'm not going to start giving guidance by segment but as my earlier comments with the demand outlook and the pricing that we just talked about we expect to see margin expansion in the year. Al Mistysyn : To reach our 13.5% increase EPS, it's baked in there. That's for sure. Sure. Okay. Justin Speer : Flipping switching gears to the Performance Coatings business for the intermediate term plan and specific, it's a 2020 margin plan that high teens below 20% target by 2020. Yes. How much of that is under your control the pricing levers or the synergies and how much of market growth you're going to need and the reason I ask that is just I'm looking at this international market means fairly sluggish. Can you still get to that destination by 2020 from here because I think when I look at all the different businesses, this is the one that's the furthest part. So I just wanted to put that to you and see what you your thoughts are there. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Justin, first, we're going to give you an update on our 2020 guidance at our Investor Day in June. But we believe, we have a number of factors that are in our control that help drive you to that target one. One is volume and new account growth, the product innovation that John talked about the movement and b70 on the packaging side. We still have opportunities for synergies within that group and both consumer brands with the majority of them being more focused towards Performance Coatings as we get into product reformulations and raw material changes and then we get into the facilities that we talked about earlier. So I think there's a number of things that are in our control that allow us to move towards that target, how quickly we get there is to be determined. Justin Speer : Understood, and lastly for me in just terms of the consumer brands was there any load in benefit versus the prior year, I believe that the announcement was in February last year, we had a sizable win, a notable win, at a large customer, was there any load in benefit or tailwind year-over-year from that customer win that they graduated into the quarter? John Morikis : Yes, I think just the normal ramping up for us as the season, I don't think there was anything dramatic or different for the most part, Justin. Justin Speer : Let's fully annualized, I guess the energy you've anniversary at all of that tailwind, there's no more to come going forward in terms of just the apples and oranges benefit from that customer win. John Morikis : No, I'd say that we from an annualized Asian standpoint, we had a little bit coming and in Q2, the lion's share of it will be in Q3 from a comparison standpoint. Justin Speer : Okay, perfect. Perfect. Okay. Well thank you very much appreciate it. John Morikis : Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Dimitri Silverstein with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question. Dimitri your line is live. Dimitri Silverstein : Did you hear me now? John Morikis : Yes, Dimitri. Dimitri Silverstein : All right, perfect. Thank you. Stick my call again. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of sort of items outstanding. First of all in your Americas business your Latin American group given the high teens declines in foreign exchange, was that - was that a positive operating performance quarter for the group or not so much? John Morikis : But the top line and bottom line would have been diliutive. Dimitri Silverstein : So you lost all the money on the EBIT line there as well. Okay. I'm just trying to understand that the old paint store group and seeing how well it thought it did? Secondly in terms of European and Asia-Pacific demand environment particularly for the industrial part of the business short of comps getting easier in the back end of the year is there anything that you can see or are seeing or can point to in other words what would it take for it for the results there to get better at a macro level and what is it that you're doing in addition to that to make sure you deliver the growth that you expect to deliver in the back end of the year? John Morikis : Yes. You're talking about specifically Europe with this question to me Dimitri? Dimitri Silverstein : Europe and Asia Pacific. John Morikis : Yes. Okay sure. Yes. So in Europe you're right, overall there was some softness there as I mentioned we did see packaging up in every region so they were up and in Europe, and we believe in Europe, we have some really terrific teams that are coming together in our general industrial and our industrial wood businesses, as well as our protective and marine capabilities. So, our goal there is to really start capitalizing on the combined company and the synergies that result from these two companies coming together. I have mentioned earlier about some of the synergies, some of that comes in the way of cost savings but we're also anxious to do is to begin transferring the technology over there and that's beginning now, but it certainly offers a terrific opportunity going forward. In Asia, again overall a soft market, some of that was the result of the implications of trade where we saw our industrial wood business under tremendous pressure as more and more companies grappled with the impacts of the implications of the trade issues. Again our packaging business was up our coil were up it was up in both of those were actually up in double digit in Asia. So, good performance there. Our general industrial offers opportunity there. We're anxious to capitalize on but we do think the industrial was going to be under some pressure for some time given everything that's going on. Dimitri Silverstein : Okay. So it sounds like in you're definitely not looking for any kind of a macro pick up. It's basically entirely sort of self-help and in terms of Asia Pacific that the macro environment you're not optimistic at all it sounds like. John Morikis : I think, in all these markets, with our market share position, I mean we've got terrific opportunities. Yes. We'd like to see the markets improve. But in an odd way those grinding markets should position us to do even better and we like a grind. We like the opportunity to get in and show that what we bring in solutions and products and services are differentiated. So, if the market comes that's great. If not our teams know our expectations of them. We want to grow. Dimitri Silverstein : Great. That's a very good answer. Thank you for that information. The last question, just the North American market given the little bit of a slow start weather or otherwise in the paint business, I noticed particularly in Asia there seems to be a little bit more promotional activity, as you look across here your distribution channels are you having to be a little bit more promotional this year or is it basically, business as usual and there's no incremental promotions that are needed to get the volume up. John Morikis : No. I don't think that there's any significant difference in the promotional activity that's taking place right now. We're certainly we don't feel as though that's necessary. Dimitri Silverstein : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Dimitri. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Garik Shmois : Thanks, and thanks for taking my question. I just want to clarify on the volume ramp, the rest of the year. There's a comment that was made that you expect to outpace the industry. Just want to be clear. Is this a broad based comment across businesses or is this targeting TAG in particular. John Morikis : Well, we certainly believe that our TAG business is positioned to outpace the market. We've talked about that for many years and you know the fact this year that we've got the new stores, new products everything that we have going. We're really excited about this year's season, in fact not only just everything from a investment and resource standpoint but the activity that our teams have demonstrated in this additional area that we've talked about and I think may not be valued as much as we value by some of our investors which is the new account activity and share of wallet. So, we absolutely see a terrific ramp to outpace the market in our stores business outside of that. When you say you know is it just limited to our stores. I jokingly made the comment earlier, it depends on who inside our company we're talking to, but I say that tongue in cheek because the reality is when we sit and talk with every one of our businesses and we review the opportunities, it really is very exciting to talk about some of the things that were on the verge on the line trials that were on the promotional or the programs that we're working on with our customers. So, we think we have a foot in the right direction and every one of these businesses and that's not to say there won't be challenges but we feel really good about where we are and where we're headed. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thanks. And my follow-up question is just as you think of the new store openings going from 15 in Q1 to the 90 to 100 for the full-year. How should that track the rest of the way, and are there any support costs or staffing costs that can be lumpy that we should be aware of? John Morikis : Yes. For the many years, we've been opening stores that at 90 to 100. We opened 15 in the first quarter and then we'll open 35ish in the fourth quarter and the rest time that we are in the second and third quarters - third and fourth and there's no lumpiness to that to the expense that you would expect. Garik Shmois : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Garik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning, everyone. John Morikis : Good morning, Chuck. Chuck Cerankosky : I want to switch subject a little bit. The deferred pension asset dropped more than $200 year over year. And Al could you give us the implications what that means to earnings per share and cash flows going forward and even what happened in cash flows in the first quarter as well as the annuities were purchased and how it impacted the financial statements please. Al Mistysyn : Sure, the annuity purchase came out, the defined benefit plans. It did not impact the net operating cash that were reported. That really was the net operating cash impact was really an increase in our working capital and primarily architectural inventory to get ready for the spring selling season to make sure, we're servicing our customers at a very, very high level. The impact of the pension settlement and the annuity, we took $32.4 million over hit, that's in other income and expense if it allowed us to monetize the over-funded pension plan that we had and it's a little over the $200 million in cash that we now have available to us to fund our defined contribution pension plan in which we use $65 million in the February to fund that contribution. So going forward, that are losses another good, three or four years, where instead of the company having to outlay cash, we'll use that money that came out of that VB plan. Chuck Cerankosky : All right. Great, thank. If any way to put Al an annual EPS number on that, would it benefits? Al Mistysyn : Yes, we haven't, Chuck. I mean it's not material it's baked into our guidance and not material year-over-year to call out. So we didn't. Chuck Cerankosky : Thank you, best of luck with the rest of 2019. Al Mistysyn : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. PJ Juvekar : Yes, thank you for taking my question. When you look at your business, how much of your paint is order online and who is ordering online? Is it mostly contractors or DIY customers? Can you just talk about sort of online purchases of paint? John Morikis : I think that's a relatively small percentage of our purchases and it's nearly all professional contractors that are using that. We do have P.J. a program that's continuing to ramp up in the area this e-commerce to allow customers to do more business with us. You see areas that we're testing in different parts of the country and we would expect over the not too distant future to conduct more business over the Internet but we don't want to - we want to enhance. We don't replace our stores. We want to enhance the service and the capabilities of our stores and our reps through e-commerce. And we believe this is going to be a terrific tool to allow our customers to get the most out of the resources that we bring to the table. PJ Juvekar : Okay, thank you. Would you say it's less than 5% today? John Morikis : Yes. PJ Juvekar : Okay. And then one last question, you didn't talk much about the vast postindustrial business particularly the big machinery business with Cat and Deer. I was wondering what's going on in that business and what trends you are seeing? Thank you. John Morikis : Inside the questions -- I'd say overall our business there is doing well, we again have a lot of respect for these customers we're working hard to bring more solutions to them. I'd say this was an area that when you look at the combination of our companies both technical organizations we're working on opportunities to enhance features of the product to help our customers, one company had solved one area of an issue and the other one had supplied another and when we got our technical teams together we've really found an opportunity to enhance what we believe to be is a terrific solution for those customers but also that might be expandable into other areas as well. So, it's an exciting part of our business one that we expect to continue to grow. PJ Juvekar : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, P.J. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Gregory Mallett with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Gregory Mallett : Hi, thanks, some try and keep it brief. Just want to make sure I got the pricing dynamic right. It's 2.5% was the pricing mix in the Americas group comp, if we looked at Performance Coatings, should we assume that the price realized was something north of that maybe 3.5% or 4%, if my back out math is correct and I had a follow-up for Al. Al Mistysyn : Greg, I would say the way that pricing rolls in is more choppy than our stores, that I talked about, and I would say it's not quite that high. Gregory Mallett : Yes, but it wouldn't be - it would be higher than I'm just looking at the math, if I had back the FX for North America to grown 4%, there must have been more price in Performance Coatings than in America's Group? Al Mistysyn : I would say it's similar amount and our volume was up low single-digits in Performance Coatings. Gregory Mallett : Yes, I feel that I was looking for. And then second on the guidance for the full-year, could you remind us what the tax rates you guys are using for that, at the midpoint or in a range. And then link that to the buyback as well. I mean you have more buyback than we had at least in the first quarter? Do you look at that 300 million this first quarter sort of a new higher level of run rate or just given where the share price was more opportunistic, if you think about the full-year? Al Mistysyn : Yes. The tax rate, tucker the core tax rate we expect to be in the low 20%. Obviously, we're a little bit lower than that, in the first quarter but comparable with last year because of the favorable impact you get on Scott comp is heavier in the first quarter, just historically there's been more options exercised than you, we have some vesting of our issues. As far as the share buyback, I think, you know we are going to be opportunistic and we were in the first quarter with where we saw our stock price. I think you had done the math free cash flow in our last call and got a little bit higher, directionally than I would have been. I think your number was 800 to 1 billion. So I might be a little bit lower than that but it's going to depend on the M&A activity and how that unfolds throughout the year that will determine how much we ultimately buy. Gregory Mallett : So, it sounds like for purposes of guidance you're still assuming maybe a couple million shares for the year not 3 million or 4 million. Al Mistysyn : That's fair. Okay. Al Mistysyn : Thanks a lot. Good luck guys. Thanks. John Morikis : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Eric, your line is live. You may proceed with your question. Thank you. We will move on to our next question which is coming in the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please with your question. Mike Harrison : Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask a couple of questions on the Lowe's business specifically about the bottom line contribution that you saw in Q1 and what you're expecting in Q2. Can you just talk about how that played out compared to your expectations and in are the costs related to that Lowe's business where you want them at this point? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, out of respect for all our customers we don't want to comment on any individual customer impact on our results. Now, as far as the costs go we did lay out the fact that we were going to take a $50 million charge in about 40% of that was one time. So, that remaining 30 million if you will spread pretty evenly out through the fourth quarter that '19. Mike Harrison : All right, and then one of your competitors that serves the DIY market sounded a little bit more optimistic about trends in DIY. Wondering if you share that view and if so what do you think is generating some of that improvement. John Morikis : Well, we're certainly positive about the space we think that they mentioned earlier you know working with our partners to drive their success is important. Our view is that we're providing customers the brands and the quality of product that can help separate them from our or align them with their customers. I will say that during that process, we always are making sure that we have the right relationships and that we're in the right channels and with the right assortments, with the right customers. So that review is something that's ongoing and something that we work very hard on. Once those decisions are made and we work really hard to align ourselves and put our customers in the best position to win. Mike Harrison : All right. And last question I had, I was just wondering John if you can comment on the recent personnel changes. I know you promoted David Sewell to COO and then made some changes at the top of Performance Coatings and consumer. Is this just moving people up the ladder or does it suggest some more significant changes going on strategically at the top of those two segments? John Morikis : No, I think if you look historically Mike at the company, I think it's 27 over the last 32 years we've had a Chief Operating Officer. The company is we have strong expectations and we want to grow, we want to grow fast and I believe David Sewell is a wonderful, talented leader that can help us accomplish our goals. Aaron Erter into our Performance Coatings is I think a tribute to the commitment that we have in identifying talent and making sure that they have the experiences to continue to develop. Rob Lynch backfilling Aaron Erter I mean I go down the list, I mean we work really hard at developing a strong depth of talent to be able to execute what it is that we're trying to do. But what we're trying to do is grow and my belief in having a COO is specifically targeted at helping us to drive our business with more speed. Mike Harrison : All right, thanks very much. John Morikis : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G Research. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the refinishing. Could you give us some details on the trends whether it is in North America and in international markets? John Morikis : I'd say refinishing in North America, Rosemarie was a relatively soft market and I'd say that that we are kind of floating right with the market and that doesn't bode well for us as you would expect. Our expectations for our teams are not to run with the market. So we feel as though we're positioned well, we've got some new technology that we think can help to expedite the efforts that we have. We've got -- it's oddly enough another opportunity of the synergies of the two companies come together. We have an Ultra K, Ultra 9K technology that's waterborne technology that we believe is a wonderful quality product, great color helps in productivity all the levers that you would look at for vehicle refinish. And so while our performance in the first quarter reflected kind of what we see in the market not only in North America, I would say around the world for the most part. Our expectations for this team going forward will be to outperform the market. We feel we're holding our own. I guess would be the answer. Rosemarie Morbelli : So with everyone texting and teenagers doing all of that at the wheel of a car, why do you think the demand is so slow, I am assuming you are counting on accidents in order to grow that particular business? John Morikis : Well, we don't like when you frame it exactly that way. But there are distracted drivers that certainly have some impact on it. I'd say that there's a general softness in the market and we're we believe that there are opportunities for this business. So overall I think collisions industry wide were down in the low single-digits but again when I look at our market share opportunities, there are growth opportunities for us and that's what we're working with our teams to capture. Rosemarie Morbelli : So even with AI causing costs to stop by itself even if someone is distracted at the wheel, you still think that with the market decline you can still gain share and growth? John Morikis : No, and part of that comes back to what I talked about earlier as far as the technology, all of this creates pressure in a segment. And that pressure forces people to find better solutions to what it is that they're trying to do. There are going to be some accidents out there. And so if you look at the opportunity to help those customers whose business might be under pressure because of everything that you've just described, those customers are going to be looking for solutions that help them do their what they want to do more profitably. We think we can help our customers accomplish that goal by bringing in the solutions to win. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay, that is very helpful. And if I could just have one last question in terms of China and the demand which obviously had slowed down because of tariffs but seems to be picking up in terms of domestic demand. Would that be helping, are you seeing it first of all and is it mostly in your wood business that you would see it, if it is now growing? John Morikis : Well, part of that has to do with the focus of our business as I would say that we're looking more into that domestic business Rosemarie, but it's not been the primary area of our focus. So while we're looking to grow in those areas that speaks more to the point, I made earlier about the fact that given our market share and the opportunities to grow that we need to always be looking for those opportunities regardless of what's happened in the market. We've not been traditionally solely focused on one area but we've been more focused on the export of products than we have been the domestic market. And so that gives us a terrific opportunity to grow forward in the future. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, Rosemarie. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments. Bob Wells : Thank you, Jessie. I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this my last quarterly earnings call. It's been my pleasure working with you all over the last 17 years and I'm confident I'm leaving you in very capable hands with Jim Jaye. As usual, Jim and I will be available to take any follow-up questions over the balance of the week. We also hope you will join us in Cleveland on June 5 for our annual financial community presentation. Again just contact us if you need the registration link. Thanks again for joining us and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Again, we thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

And the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thanks Jessie and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. All comparisons in my remarks are to the second quarter of fiscal 2018, unless otherwise stated. Consolidated sales in the second quarter of 2019 increased $104.1 million or 2.2% to $4.88 billion. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales by 1.5%. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the quarter increased $142.8 million or 7% to $2.18 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the second quarter increased to 44.7% from 42.7% in the same period last year. Excluding impacts from purchase accounting, adjusted consolidated gross margin in the quarter increased to 44.9% from 43.1%. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $23.4 million or 1.8% to $1.33 billion in the second quarter but decreased slightly as a percent of sales to 27.3% from 27.4% in the same quarter last year. Interest expense for the quarter declined $4.3 million to $89.2 million. Consolidated profit before tax in the second quarter increased $137.6 million or 25.6% to $675.7 million. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 30.3%, which includes the previously disclosed tax credit investment loss. Excluding acquisition related costs and the tax credit investment loss, our effective tax rate on adjusted income for the quarter was 19.7%. Diluted net income per common share for the second quarter 2019 increased to $5.03 per share from $4.25 per share in the prior year's second quarter. Earnings per share in the second quarter of 2019 includes charges for acquisition related costs and a tax credit investment loss of $0.75 and $0.79 per share, respectively. The $4.25 per share reported in the second quarter 2018 included charges for acquisition related costs and environmental expense provisions of $1.23 and $0.25 per share, respectively. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 14.7% to $6.57 in the second quarter 2019 from $5.73 last year. We have summarized the second quarter earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table in our press release. Let me now take a few moments to break down our performance by segment. Sales for the Americas group in the second quarter increased $131 million or 5% to $2.76 billion. Comparable store sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 4.3% in the quarter. Regionally, in the second quarter, our Southeast division led all divisions, followed by Midwest, Eastern, Southwest and Canada. Sales were positive in every division in the quarter. Second quarter segment profit increased $42.5 million or 7.5% to $612.4 million. Second quarter segment profit margin increased 50 basis points to 22.2% from 21.7% last year. Turning now to the consumer brands group. Second quarter sales increased $26.7 million or 3.4% to $804.5 million. Sales from continuing operations, excluding approximately $16 million in revenue from the divested Guardsman business, increased 5.6% in the quarter. Second quarter segment profit increased $49.8 million or 54.7% to $140.7 million. Purchase accounting expense decreased segment profit by $22.5 million compared to $28.5 million in the second quarter 2018. Second quarter segment profit margin increased to 17.5% from 11.7% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expense in both quarters, adjusted segment profit margin increased to 20.3% from 15.4% in the second quarter 2018. For our performance coatings group, second quarter sales decreased $52.4 million or 3.8% to $1.32 billion. Currency translation rate changes reduced second quarter sales by 2.7%. Second quarter segment profit increased $6.1 million or 4.3% to $150.3 million. Purchase accounting expense decreased segment profit by $53.9 million compared to $47.6 million in the second quarter 2018. Second quarter performance coatings group segment profit margin increased to 11.4% from 10.5% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expense in both quarters, segment profit margin increased to 15.5% compared to 14% in the second quarter 2018. I will conclude my remarks with an update on our California lead litigation. As we reported in the press release last week, 10 California cities and counties, Sherwin-Williams and two other companies have mutually agreed to resolve litigation, subject to court approval. The agreement ends a nearly 20-year legal battle that challenged the company's legal advertising of lead-based paints over a century ago when such paints were the gold standard and specified for use by the federal government as well as state and local governments across the country. Terms of the agreement call for a total payment of $305 million with each defendant paying approximately $101.7 million over six years. The $305 million is a significant reduction from the court's original $1.15 billion judgment and reduced $409 million judgment ruling following the defendants appeal. Sherwin-Williams continues to believe the California case was an aberration. All other appellate courts have found that companies should not be held retroactively liable for lawful conduct and truthful commercial speech decades after they took place. Seven other states have already rejected public nuisance claims similar to those brought in California. Sherwin-Williams is pleased to have reached an agreement to resolve this litigation and will continue to vigorously and aggressively defend against any similar current or future litigation. That concludes our review of our operating results for the second quarter. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments on the second quarter and provide our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2019. John? John Morikis : Thank you Jim and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. I would to make just a few additional comments on our second quarter before moving on to our outlook. Our second quarter was a strong one with record results in net sales, EBITDA, profit before taxes and net operating cash. While consolidated second quarter sales came in at the low end of our expectations, North American paint stores, a growth engine of our company, performed well in the quarter and was above the high end of our revenue guidance as we anticipated. Overall, our consolidated sales results continue to highlight significant regional and end market demand variability with growth in North America and Latin America, partially offset by softness in Asia and to a lesser degree, Europe. Pricing was favorable across all of our businesses in the quarter. Consolidated gross margin on, an adjusted basis, improved sequentially and year-over-year to 44.9%, just below the low end of our annual long term target. The improvement was driven by the realization of previously announced pricing actions and a sequentially lower rate of raw material inflation. SG&A in the quarter came in largely as expected and we will continue to maintain appropriate discipline on spending as the year unfolds. All three segments delivered sequential and year-over-year profit margin improvement. Within the Americas group, sales increased 5% against a prior year comparison of 7.7%. Sales were positive in all North American customer end markets in the quarter, led by residential repaint, which was up high single digits. Sales in protective and marine, new commercial and property management were all up mid single digits and new residential sales were also positive. Selling conditions remain challenging throughout much of the quarter, likely delaying a number of projects in multiple end markets. Our customers continue to report very solid backlogs heading into the back half of the year. Looking at total segment profitability. Segment profit dollars increased by more than $42 million, segment margin expanded by 50 basis points to 22.2% and incremental margin was 33%. Year-to-date, we have opened 20 net new stores finishing the quarter with 4,716 stores in operation, compared to 4,642 last year. Our plan calls for this team to add approximately 80 to 100 new stores in North America by the end of this year. In the consumer segment, second quarter sales increased by 3.4%, including the impact of the Guardsman divestiture which was about 2.1%. Sales and profitability improved in North America and Europe but were partially offset by softer demand in Asia and Australia and New Zealand. Volume leverage and cost control, which were partially offset by incremental investments in a new customer program, are enabling us to continue to drive the profitability of this business as segment margin, excluding purchase accounting expense, increased both sequentially and year-over-year to 20.3%. We continue to feel very good about our strategy in this business and in particular our relationship with our largest customer. Performance coatings group sales were down 3.8% in the quarter with variability by region and business. Comparing businesses, revenue growth in our packaging and coil divisions was more than offset by softness in the segment's other businesses, most notably in our industrial wood division which continues to be impacted by tariffs. Geographically, sales were up in Latin America and flat in North America which were more than offset by softness in Asia and Europe where sales decreased by low double digit and mid single digit percentages, respectively. Notably, packaging and coil continued to be positive outliers in Asia and Europe. Despite the sales decline, adjusted segment margin increased 150 basis points to 15.5%. Evidence of good cost control and that pricing actions are gaining traction to offset the raw material inflation we have experienced over the last two years. EBITDA in the quarter was $908 million or $921 million adjusted to exclude integration costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.9% in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA year-to-date was $1.5 billion or 16.8% of sales. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $650 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 33% year-over-year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $9.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet. We reduced debt by approximately $375 million in the quarter and intend to retire a total of approximately $600 million this year which will result in a net debt to EBITDA ratio below 3 :1 by the end of 2019. We paid $105 million in cash dividends and purchased 325,000 shares of common stock for $145 million in the second quarter. At quarter-end, our share repurchase authorization stood at 9.05 million shares. Capital expenditures was $77 million the quarter. Depreciation was $65 million and amortization was $78 million. As we move into the third quarter 2019, we expect consolidated net sales to increase by a low single digit percentage compared to the third quarter of 2018. Although we do not typically provide quarterly sales guidance by segment, I would like to provide some additional color this quarter due to end market variability. We expect growth in the Americas group to be in the mid single digit range. I want to reiterate that we continue to feel very good about the demand environment for our North American stores with our customers reporting full order books and working to catch up on jobs, that were likely delayed by weather in the second quarter. For the consumer brands group in the third quarter, we expect sales to be down by high single digit as we face tough comparisons to the largest portion of last year load-in volume through the Lowe's program as well as the final quarter of the divested Guardsman business. We anticipate performance coatings sales to be up by a low single digit percentage. While comparisons do ease in the back half of the year, we do see a near term catalyst driving significant improvement in the European or Chinese macroeconomic environment at this time. We expect demand in these regions to remain highly variable as it has over the first half of the year compared to a relatively stable demand environment in North America. As a result of our revenue outlook for the third quarter, we are reducing our full year 2019 revenue guidance and now expect sales to increase 2% to 4% compared to the full year 2018. At the same time, we feel good about North American stores volume in the second half, the progress of our pricing initiatives, the trajectory of raw material inflation and our ability to control spending. Given these dynamics, we are reaffirming our adjusted 2019 full year diluted net income per common share guidance to be in the range of $20.40 to $21.40 per share which excludes Valspar acquisition related costs and non-operating items. This is an increase of approximately 13% at the midpoint compared to the $18.53 we reported last year on a comparable basis. We have included a Regulation G reconciliation table with this morning's press release to reconcile adjusted and GAAP earnings per share. A few additional data points for the full year may be helpful for modeling purposes. These data points have not changed from the guidance we updated in April. We expect raw material inflation for full year 2019 will be in the low single digits compared to 2018. The rate of our year-over-year inflation assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions should diminish from the level we saw in the second quarter as we progress through the year. We expect incremental synergies of approximately $70 million to $80 million in 2019 with a total annual run rate of approximately $415 million at year-end. We expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $320 million, depreciation to be about $257 million and amortization to be about $315 million. With that, I would like to thank you for joining us this morning and we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Your cost of goods sold was down about 1% in the quarter and I imagine your volumes were up. Can you analyze the decrease? How much of that was lower raw materials? And how much of that was cost reduction effort? Al Mistysyn : Hi Jeff. This is Al Mistysyn. And you are absolutely correct. We did see a sequential decrease in our raw materials from quarter-to-quarter. As we discussed on our first quarter call, we thought the first quarter would be our highest raw material costs year-over-year, declining into the second quarter and then sequentially from there. So a good part of it was raw material cost, but you are absolutely right. We continue to focus the team on implementing the synergies that we had talked about. We had approximately $75 million in synergies in our guidance. We have talked about two-thirds of that being realized in the first half and the remaining one-third in the second half. And you are seeing the benefit of that as well. Jeff Zekauskas : And the raw material is continuing to move sequentially lower for you in general? Al Mistysyn : Correct. And that's what we talked about, Jeff, in our guidance at the beginning of the year and that hasn't dramatically changed. Now what we talked about was low single digits for the full year, probably the highest in the first quarter. The basket ticked down in the second quarter and we think it's reasonable based on what we are seeing now to expect the back half to be slightly deflationary. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi guys. Good morning. I guess first question, John, on your comments on customer backlogs. Can you sort of expand on those comments? Is it a reflection of just stronger fundamentals, given the drop in interest rates? Or just weather disrupting 2Q and pushing it out into 3Q? What are your customers sharing with you? John Morikis : Well, I think there is an overall confidence that we started the year with, Ghansham. And I think it's continued as we have progressed through the year. To your point, clearly weather did impact our customers. Not just our customers, I would say all trade. Certainly painters, but construction in general. But I think as we look forward in the back half of the year, it's going to be a dead sprint for our customers. There is a backlog that they are carrying over and we believe, quite frankly, it's an opportunity for us to shine for our customers, because of the backlog that exists and the demand that they will have on them. We think the position that our teams are in to serve those customers will ultimately end up with customers that have a higher level of loyalty to our people and our stores as a result of the service we provide. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Thanks for that. And then for my second question, you have had Valspar in your portfolio for a few quarters now and the industrial facing business is already facing a tougher macro economic backdrop, especially overseas. How are these businesses performing relative to your initial expectations from a cyclicality standpoint? How would you characterize that? John Morikis : Well, we are very pleased, as you would expect. And these businesses are doing very well. If you look at packaging, for example, we had growth in all regions and we continue to focus on great relationships with great innovation to help grow that business. Our coil was strong across all regions except for North America, which was down slightly and I would say that was largely the impact of some of the tariffs. When we look at the opportunities from a market share standpoint and the growth opportunities, we are really very, very excited. Our challenge right now is prioritization. As we move forward, there are terrific opportunities, terrific customers. We have just got to make sure we are focusing on the right opportunities and executing well. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Thanks again. John Morikis : Thanks Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Koort : Thanks very much. Can you give a more granularity on the big margin lift in consumer brands sort of the buckets where that came from whether it was costs, price, raws, et cetera? John Morikis : Sure, Bob. Yes, there is a number of levers, starting with the strong volume performance we saw in North America. And as you know, we always start with volume, because that's the one that gives us the most leverage from an operating margin standpoint. We did get a little bit of a benefit from the raw material decrease sequentially. The synergies that I talked about with Jeff also impacted our consumer brands group in the quarter. So you are seeing the nice volume lift in North America and those are other two factors is what's helped driving that margin expansion. Robert Koort : Great. Thanks John. John Morikis : Thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thanks. In terms of the Lowe's agreement, do you just have any general views on how much of the legacy business at Home Depot that Thompson's, Minwax, Purdy, et cetera you have recaptured thus far and how much there more is to go? And just do you have any additional programs in the pipeline to further help Lowe's close the gap with Home Depot, maybe at pros, et cetera? Thank you. John Morikis : Yes. Chris, we have a number of programs, initiatives and focus on execution on those that are out already. So yes, I think that we have a number of initiatives and programs for our customer and we are really focused on the execution. As you would expect, we are not going to disclose what those are here on this call, but we clearly have a terrific relationship in a lot of areas that we are focused on to grow. Christopher Parkinson : Right. And just in PC, can you comment broadly just about how you are feeling the longer term competitive positioning in each of those markets, pricing power ability and just how those views funnel into your longer term outlook for PC margins. Thank you. John Morikis : Yes. So we have spoken about our goal to drive this business up to a 20% operating margin and we feel as though the businesses, the customers, the technology all give us even more confidence than when we initiated this acquisition. The key area here is our focus on the solutions that will help our customers to be more successful. When we look at this business, we are not driving and chasing every shiny object. We are really focused on those areas that are meaningful for our customers that allow them to reach and exceed their goals and in turn allow us to provide a reward for our shareholders. So we are very focused on the right customers, the right programs, the right technologies, having the right people at the right place doing the right things that drive these results. And we have great confidence in our ability to do that. Al Mistysyn : And Chris, I would just add to that. On the pricing side, you can see, after two significant raw material inflationary years in the past few years plus the inflation we saw year-over-year in our first quarter, our adjusted operating margin improved 150 basis points in the quarter. That tells you we have to be getting price to be able to get on top of that raw material inflation. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. How have your new stores that you are building now compare to your legacy stores with respect to size? Does that affect the cost to build out these stores and the operating cost of these stores? And has your view of optimal store density changed? John Morikis : Yes. Steve, I think they are changing. And I think I would describe it this way. Historically, when I was in our stores organization, we typically look for 5,000 square feet. That was the model we tried to put those everywhere. Now, I would say that our teams and we have terrific leadership teams here, 30-years plus experience with Peter Ippolito, Bill DeSantis. I mean these people really have been with our team for quite a bit of time and they are really driving us to be more responsive and more selective in what it is that we are doing to drive the results in the markets that we need. In some cases, we might be going with a little smaller stores. In some cases we might go a little larger store. We are focused on these different end markets. And so we are tailoring the footprint and the store as well as the staffing to be responsive to those segments that we are pursuing. So I would say they are adjusting. You are exactly right, but it's not adjusting one way or the other. It's adjusting more to reflect the market opportunities. Steve Byrne : And the optimal store density, any update on that? John Morikis : No. I would say, we are still continuing to learn. We continue to add stores. And I would say that we have not reached a saturation point here where we are saying we are not going to add any more stores. We can point to markets like Cleveland or Atlanta where our saturation is stronger than some other markets and we still need stores in these markets. And we are excited to continue to add them. And I would also say that our field organization is doing a better job of getting these stores up and profitable faster as well We are students of continuous improvement. So these new stores are a focus. We don't just plug them in and wait for them to get better. Every day, we have teams working on how do we get these new stores up and profitable faster. Steve Byrne : And just a quick one on the consumer segment. Any changes in the spray paint business at Lowe's? John Morikis : There is not a meaningful change. There was, I believe, some area outside of the paint department that there were some adjustments. But we are really focused with this customer on making that paint department the most successful it can be. And that's what we are really focused on. Steve Byrne : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. In the PC segment in particular, can you talk about what you are seeing from your customers as far as their inventory? Are they destocking your products? Is that part of the volume issue there? Or do you think that's just closer to their real demand and consumption? John Morikis : I would say their consumption is a bit choppier, Duffy. I would say the demand, it's not a smooth line up, down or sideways. There's choppiness. And so we are starting to see, I wouldn't say starting to see, we have seen perhaps more orders of smaller volume as they are trying to adjust their inventories. From our perspective, the ability to serve those customers with our facilities close to these customers, with a quick response and platforms that we are building to be more responsive, we think it's a way of differentiating with our customers. Jim Jaye : And Duffy, I would just add to that. John talked about the macroeconomic headwinds we are seeing in China that have continued through the first quarter and in Europe. We don't expect those to get materially better. That being said, we have had businesses that we called out packaging and coil that are still performing well. Latin America has performed well in the quarter for industrial and we still feel most optimistic about North America. Duffy Fischer : Okay. And then the change that Ace Hardware made, is that big enough that that will be seen in your results? And if so, kind of what's the timing of that? John Morikis : I will let Al in a second talk about the impact on financials. But I will say, they have announced a decision to augment their assortment with Benjamin Moore and they will continue to offer many of our well-known brands, the Minwax, Thompson's, Cabot, Purdy. And this was a deal that we assumed with the Valspar acquisition and the program itself had many assumptions in it that really just didn't play out. And as you would expect, we have began reviewing these programs. We found ourselves where a mutually beneficial path forward was difficult to construct and under in terms of that agreement, we felt as though our view is, we have got to be focused on those areas that we can drive meaningful results for those customers, but also in the same token, the results for our shareholders. Al Mistysyn : And the timing is such, Duffy, that we don't believe there's going to be any material impact on our 2019 results. From an operating margin standpoint, it's well below the segment average. But we did include those both the topline and bottomline impacts on our 2020 guidance. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thanks. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the paint stores comp in the quarter, which was quite impressive given the weather and some of the third-party data that's out there. So I guess a couple of questions to this. I know there were some initiatives starting a couple of years ago to really go out and try to build the customer base. So maybe you could discuss on if you have sort of reached a tipping point on that and/or strategically you figured out a better way to serve clients and to pick up incremental share when the conditions are challenging, does your service offering play a real role in that? John Morikis : Yes. Well, let me begin by pointing out that Q2 was the toughest comparison to last year. Same-store sales were up 6.8%. So comps were tough and you are right, our team has finished up 5.3%. And this focus that we have been talking about, our new accounts and share of wallet, even the new products that we are introducing, those efforts are clearly coming to fruition. It was wet, no question about it and it impacted, as I mentioned earlier, both the painters and all trades. By some measures out there, this was the wettest in 125 years. But this as you mentioned is a resilient team. As I mentioned earlier, we have got great leadership. And this is a point where we love our model and the position that we have in the market and our team is executing very well. Are we doing anything specifically different? I would say, we continue to train our people. We continue to hire the best people we can. We have talked openly about hiring around 1,400 college graduates a year to ensure that we have got a steady pipeline of people. And we continue to focus on the training that will allow them to differentiate. When you look at some of the areas inside the store with staffing and the quality of people, even the inventory you might notice that we have had a slight uptick in our inventory. That's nearly all in the architectural business. We want to make sure we have the inventory when they need it, close to the customers and we are really focused on those areas that will help our customers be on the job and most productive. The products that we are introducing are helping them. The services that we are introducing. But there is not one silver bullet that we would say, this is what we did this quarter. I would say, it's a culmination of many, many years of good leadership by that team and a lot of execution in the field. I want to thank our teams in the field, because they are doing a terrific job representing our company. Vincent Andrews : And just maybe as a follow-up, if you could give us sort of your sense of where the M&A outlook is both for small transactions and then something potentially larger than that, particularly given one of the announcements that was out there by a large competitor? John Morikis : Yes. So there are number of comments out there regarding what's out in the market. We don't make a practice to talk about any particular project. I will say, because I have been consistent in this though that we have been very clear in our position on automotive OEM and it's not an area of interest for us. As far as M&A, I would say we are very, very active. We are pleased with the progress that we have on a number of projects and we think it's an important part of what it's going to help us grow, but we don't feel that we are sitting here with the absolute need for acquisitions to grow. We think it's an opportunity, but we have got a lot of growth opportunities and sales synergies as Valspar and Sherwin come together. Al Mistysyn : And Vincent, I would just like to add to that that M&A is an important part of our capital allocation policy, as we discussed in June. As John mentioned on his opening remarks, we returned $660 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. It was 33% increase year-over-year. We are going to, with CapEx, continue to invest in growth opportunities, in new stores and in capacity expansions in a number of our North American businesses. And then as we talked about the dividends up 31%, but absent M&A we are going to continue to buy back our stock. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Very clear. Thanks very much guys. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Good morning. John Morikis : Good morning. P.J. Juvekar: John, I think you talked about your consumers brands margins jumping up 580 basis points and some factors behind that. I was wondering, if you can talk about how different brands like Valspar HGTV Paint are doing at Lowe's? And were there any surprises positive or negative in your first full season? John Morikis : Well, we are not going to talk specifically on any brands, but I will just say that the process that we are going through with Lowe's, we continue to learn. I think we are trying to be responsive and we believe that we are very driven. I mentioned earlier a continuous improvement mentality here. We think that as we go through this, it's important that our efforts are always on finding where we are and how we get better. And I think we share that culture, not only with Lowe's. Lowe's is a terrifically important customer, but if you look at other customers like Menards and others, I mean that's our mentality. It is to gain alignment and seek improvement. And so I don't want to get into any specific profitability of brands, products, SKUs, any of that. But I would tell you that when we set these goals to march up into the 20% operating margins for this business, we know that there is improvement needed and it's not just going to be by setting the can on the shelf. We want to help our customer succeed and that's in all facets of the business. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then back in June, you pushed out your 2020 goals due to mostly higher raw materials. But since then the raw materials, particularly ethylene, propylene trends have really come down. Your margins seem to be improving here despite a difficult weather quarter or weather-wise quarter. So do you have any updated comments on your 2020 goals as we sit here today? Al Mistysyn : Yes, P.J. We are very pleased with the progress we are making on the gross margins, 44.9% in the quarter, saw a nice improvement there. But year-to-date, our gross margins are 44% and the pricing activity that we have had needs to continue. As you know, our long-term rates are 45% to 48%. So we have work to do to get to that. And I expect as we progress obviously and I talked about this on the previous call, to get to almost 13% increase at our midpoint for EPS, we are going to need margin expansion and we are up 9.5% year-to-date. That tells you we have to be up a little bit over 16% in the second half to get to that midpoint. And that tells you, we do expect margins to continue to expand in the second half. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, P.J. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks. I have two questions, both on the outlook as much as what we just saw. If we look at the Americas business, to get that mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter, is that going to be more volume or price, especially if you consider, it looks like the second quarter was probably 2% volume and 2% price if I look at the comp? Is that correct? Al Mistysyn : Hi Greg. I think the price will be a little bit better than that, maybe closer to 2.5%.And I would expect a similar type of cadence in our third quarter, which would tell you that we have to be up low to mid single digits in volume. But I do expect volume to improve sequentially. Greg Melich : So an acceleration in comp in the third quarter is more likely to be volume than price? Al Mistysyn : Correct. Greg Melich : And then second on consumer brands. Just a little more color on the inflection of it being up to go into down high single digits. I think you mentioned it was the cycle and just load-in and then Guardsman. Is there anything else there? And then how should we think about when those items cycle for the fourth quarter and beyond? John Morikis : I think like we talked about it in the second quarter, we feel very good about North American volume. We did see some softness or continued softness in the retail channel. I would expect that to continue. And then outside of that, we have a couple of our smaller businesses outside the U.S., specifically Asia and Australia that were soft in the first half. I don't expect them to get materially better in the second half. Greg Melich : So that decline that you see in the third quarter could also persist beyond? John Morikis : Not to the degree. Our largest load-in was in the third quarter for Lowe's. The headwind of Guardsman goes away after the third quarter. So I think materially -- Al Mistysyn : Yes. I would say, yes, it's largely the load-in and Guardsman annualization. John Morikis : That's right. Greg Melich : Got it. That's great and then just if I could sneak in one more on the three times leverage and getting to that point. How important is that point to where you would -- where do you want that to stabilize when you think about, you mentioned buying back stock after you get through the dividend increase and invest in CapEx? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Greg, we are committed to -- yes, I think long term, we have talked about two to 2.5. We will be under three by the end of this year. We committed to paying down $600 million of debt. We paid off the $300 million of 7.25% debt in June and the rest will come out of short term. But yes, I think we will be below 3 :1 at the end of this year and the target is still two to 2.5. Greg Melich : That's great. Thanks guys. Good luck. John Morikis : Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks Greg. Jim Jaye : Thank you Greg. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thank you. What's going on in coil that's allowing that business to be an outlier in industrial coatings? John Morikis : Well, we have got a lot of good products and a lot of really good people serving really good customers, John. I don't think there is a blanket statement that we would make across the board except that we have got some really good things that are happening and we are determined to continue to drive them. John Roberts : Okay. And then in industrial wood, do you need to restructure that business? Or do you just wait to see how the trade issues play out? John Morikis : No, that's a good question. We are forced to take some cost out of that business. We have seen a material change in the market at least for the time being and we are adjusting accordingly as you would expect. John Roberts : Thank you. John Morikis : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Mushkin : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess I wanted to poke a little bit more on the volume outlook. I think last call I asked what would generate upside surprise and you guys said increased volumes over expectations. So it seems like volumes did come in better in the second quarter, maybe the volume outlook. I am specifically talking to the Americas. And I am just wondering what's changed in the thought on volumes? Is it the market? Is it the things you guys are doing specifically? And then I had a follow-up. John Morikis : Yes, Scott. Coming into the quarter, we talked about our paint stores group being at or above the high end of our range and that happened. They were up 5.3% and that was a positive even in spite of the wet weather we saw. Our consumer group came in pretty much as we expected, but it's a tale of two cities, if you will. We had strong growth in our North America business even including the soft retail sales that I talked about. But we also saw a continued softness in Asia-Pacific and Australia. And I expect those to continue. And they are probably softer than what we had planned. And then finally in performance coatings group is where we really saw softness, Asia-Pacific and Europe, with the macroeconomic headwinds. Although we expected them to continue in the second quarter, we did not expect them to be as heavy as they were. So that again we expect to continue in our second half. So I would say we have to be realistic about the forecast. Our teams have opportunities and they wake up every day driving market share growth with new products and leveraging technology and services to provide solutions to our customers. But it's very difficult to come over the top when we are seeing the headwinds we are seeing from a macroeconomic environment. So that's really what we are seeing. It's continued retail sales softness and more than we expected in consumer along with Asia-Pacific and ANZ and then in performance coatings was primarily Asia-Pacific and Europe. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. And my follow-up is just, again, it goes to the paint store group of the Americas. I know you guys have been pretty active in remodeling stores and just wanted to get any color you have there. How much of that, the comp, is being attributed to that activity? So any update there would be great. John Morikis : Yes. I would say we have always maintained a commitment to, what we call, store readiness, the appearance and that includes not only just the physical appearance, the painting and displays, but even our employees. And I would say it's a contributing factor. But Scott as we look at the model there, it's really important to understand that there is not one lever. We want to continue adding in those areas, the services, the quality of products and the differentiation that helps our customers to be the most successful. And if we continue to do that and help our customers to win and then funny thing happens. We become successful as well. And so that's what we are really focused on. I know there have been a couple of questions now pointing to, is there one thing here? And this is just a continuation of a long strategy executed by really wonderful leadership and outstanding people in the field. Scott Mushkin : Appreciate it, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. John Morikis : Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thank you Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Just a question on the outlook you provided. It sounds like there is an element of conservatism in your PCG outlook and it's related to kind of macro challenges in Europe and China still remaining weak. I guess, is that correct? And if there is some resolution on the trade side, do you see that kind of helping you to get to the upper end of guidance? Or how should we think about the range you have provided with regards to PCG? Thanks. John Morikis : Yes, Arun. I won't use the term conservatism. I would say realistic is more apt to be how we have approached the forecast. If the trade wars ended today, it will not help us through the rest of this year. Many of those customers and we have tried to characterize this in the past have already decided to move and that process has started. It's tough for them to stop and then start. But we are well positioned to accept that business and wherever they go, whether it's in Southeast Asia, if they come to Mexico, wherever those businesses land. What will drive the needle on our guidance towards the high end is North America stores volume. And that's always the case. It's the growth engine of our company. We expect to continue to grow our market share and grow 1.5 to two times the market. And I believe we are doing that in the second quarter. And I believe we will do that through the back half. It's just that that will be what drives it to the high end of the range. Arun Viswanathan : And just on that point, it sounds like resi repayments are still holding up pretty nicely, high single digits, commercial likely is pretty strong. So it seems like most of your end markets are doing quite well, but you do face tough comps there. So what gives you the confidence that some of these markets will continue to grow so heavily, especially resi repaint where we have seen double digit quarters for many years here? John Morikis : So I think it's five years compounded growth rate of double digits. You are right, Arun. And I would say this, as far as your comp question, the back half of the year actually gets a little bit easier. It was the first half that was a little tougher. And in fact, the second quarter itself was the toughest comparison. So from that standpoint, we feel the comparisons get a little bit easier. We don't like to fly the victory flag as a result of easy comparisons. I mean it's a reality. But what we are really trying to do is continue to invest in those areas that allow us to continue to grow our account base and our share of wallet with those customers. And so all of these initiatives, it's the new products, it's the skill training that we have put with our employees, the addition of specification reps. I mean you can go through the long list of things that we are doing. All of those we think are driving in the right direction and we are going to continue to feed this. We have said it number of times already this morning. It's the engine of the company. We are going to continue to put fuel in this machine and push it as fast and as hard as we can go. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. Mortgage rates, as you know, have fallen more than a full percentage point since last November. My question is, if you look back at history, can you speak to how lower mortgage rates flow through to demand for architectural paint? And if there is a positive linkage there, what sort of lag effects should we be thinking about in terms of impact on remodeling or existing homes? Any thoughts along those lines would be appreciated. Jim Jaye : Sure. I think the drop in rates over the last few months in general is supportive of new build. If you look at builder sentiment, most recent data that I have seen is June and builder sentiment is pretty positive in June. But I think, Kevin, what's fundamentally the driver and we have talked about this for several quarters now, is the rate of household formation which continues to be very strong but new home construction has not been keeping up with that. It's been unsustainably low. So we think there is still some pent-up demand out there that eventually, if certainly there is demand out there for new homes especially at the entry level and that's what we are starting to see some of the builders are adjusting to that. We had positive growth in the new res space than our first quarter. From a remodeling perspective, one of the things that people often point to is existing home sales and that's been very choppy over the last year or so. New data was out this morning that wasn't particularly great, but at the same time there is a lot of other drivers beyond existing home sales that I think are helpful for remodeling in the repaint business for us. So you have things like baby boomers aging in place and they are doing a lot of remodeling to make homes the way they want them to be. You have strong employment numbers. You have home value appreciation continuing to move in the right direction, maybe a little bit slower than the past, but still continuing to appreciate. And the other thing I would point out, a fact that we presented at our Analyst Day as well is, since the last peak, there has been about close to 20% growth in the square footage that's out there to be repainted. And so we think there is plenty of demand out there in the repaint. We are very well positioned to continue growing that part of our business. Kevin McCarthy : Thanks for that Jim. As a brief follow-up, with that as the backdrop, would you be confident that industry architectural gallonage can rise directionally in 2020? Jim Jaye : I don't want to comment specifically on an outlook for 2020, but we have seen gallon growth over the last several years. And I think based on some of those factors that I have just said, the pent-up demand and the increased square footage that's out there, yes, I think we can see gallon growth continue to improve. Kevin McCarthy : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hi guys, nice quarter. Still waiting on my Bob mural. So hopefully that's not part of cost savings. On a serious note, when you think about the Americas Group, the outlook for the second half of the year, the first half you had weather issues. And if weather is favorable and the backlog for your customers are really good, where could growth be? Could it be a couple of percent better if weather plays its part? John Morikis : Yes. I mean it's really hard to speculate. Mike, you are right. I mean, I think if the weather is better, we have a more mild entry into winter and our customers are able to paint a little bit longer or they are able to capitalize on the weather and catch-up on some of these projects. It would definitely add to what it is that that we have projected. But as Al mentioned, we are trying to be realistic. We are in the midst of some pretty unique weather patterns and we don't know what's going to happen, not that anyone does. And for our forecast, we think, reflects the best that we have as far as our low crystal ball. As it relates to the customer though and the demand, that's the piece that we are blessed with. We have got over 4,000 stores, over 3,000 territories out there. We are getting the feedback from our store managers. We get the feedback from our reps about how our customers are feeling. That's the most important part to us. If it gets delayed, it gets delayed. I mean we don't think those projects are going to go away. But what we are confident is how our customers are feeling about their pipeline of projects. Mike Sison : Got it. And then as a quick follow-up, how are you thinking about pricing for the store heading in the 2020? Every year, it's hard to tell what inflation is going to do. But just when you think about use the October-ish, you start to think about some sort of pricing actions potentially. Can you maybe give us an update on your current thoughts there? John Morikis : Yes. I would tell you more about how we think about it than our current thoughts and we get together on a monthly basis. We look at our total cost basket, not just raw materials, but just total costs. And we make a very informed decision as a team on a monthly basis. And as you know, given your coverage of our company, the first people to know that clearly are our employees, the second, our customers and then we go public with our investment community. So we have nothing to announce right now. We will stay close to it and we will make adjustments as needed. Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. John, to following up the prior question, if you do see deflation in raw materials, what areas are you most at risk for giving back some pricing? I assume it's not the stores, but perhaps performance. Is that fair? John Morikis : Well, you know, what we have typically have seen over a long history is that on some of these large projects as it relates to the stores more stadium or very large kind of marquee projects on the store side, those might get a little pressure overall. And on the performance coatings side, you know, I was very deliberate in my conversation or my response there earlier about looking at total costs. We ere continuing to add in those areas that we believe can help our customers reach their goals. And some of it clearly is in the raw material cost and other areas it could be in facilities or different investments that we might make to help a customer be more successful and more profitable themselves. So as we look at it. I would say that it's a discussion that we always have to have, but the discussion isn't a discussion that takes place on one day. If we are doing our job all year, we are doing our job in delivering the solutions and services that allow our customers to be successful. That conversation is a better discussion and one that our customers understand the need for us to stay healthy as well. David Begleiter : And John, just on TiO2, do you expect to pay higher prices for TiO2 in the back half of the year than the first half of the year? Jim Jaye : Yes, this is Jim. Industry pricing for TiO2 has been fairly stable over the past three quarters and we don't see anything really changing a whole lot in the global demand environment, favorable or unfavorable. So our view at the beginning of the year was TiO2 fairly stable for the year and I think that's still our view at this point. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Garik Shmois : Thank you. I am just wondering if you can comment on if new residential construction does increase in the second half of the year, just given some of the leading indicators that you cited, what's the usual lag between when starts increase and when you start seeing that demand come through? John Morikis : I would typically see it in a few months. Garik Shmois : Okay. Has that changed over the last several years? Has that lag gotten extended due to weather, labor constraints or any other factors? John Morikis : Yes. It may push it back depending on the market, I would say. It may get pushed back or be a little more volatile in some markets where the labor shortages might be a little tougher to your point. But I don't know that it's a material amount. Garik Shmois : Okay. John Morikis : The builders are clearly working on how to deliver efficiency into their process. So there is some opportunity there from a speed standpoint, but there is some volatility, to your point, about labor as well. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thanks for that. I just want to follow-up on consumer. You talked about some of the comp headwinds you are facing in the third quarter, but should we expect volume growth to turn positive in the fourth quarter as you anniversary the Lowe's load-in and the Guardsman exit? Jim Jaye : I would say, Garik, we got to see how the inventory levels, what happens to the inventory levels as we come out of season. Obviously, we are working closely with Lowe's. But last year being the first year and we are putting a ton of inventory in to make sure we are servicing these end customers, it's an anomaly. So this year is the first year where we are going to see a more normalized run rate and process and we are still going through that right now with them. John Morikis : But importantly, I think the core of the question is, we do expect to help our customers grow their business. Garik Shmois : Okay. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Hi. Good afternoon. John Morikis : Hi Mike. Jim Jaye : Hi Mike. Mike Harrison : I was wondering if you could maybe break out the same-store sales growth number between exterior and interior? Is it fair to assume that the exterior growth was much weaker? John Morikis : No, actually broader markets, the exterior, believe it or not, was up slightly ahead of interior. And when we went back and started the dial-in on that, what we saw were on those days when the weather had been supportive of exterior paint, we saw some really incredible increases. And so we saw chunks of business going out on the exterior side, which gives us great confidence in the future if we get a little more stable weather pattern of what we are capable of. But we had a very good performance in both interior and exterior. Mike Harrison : And then I wanted to ask also, you made several references in the press release and then in your comments to cost controls or cost management. I know you mentioned specifically that you were taking some actions in industrial wood coatings. But are there some other areas where you are taking additional actions? Or should we think of these as being part of the Valspar synergies? Just how do we think about that cost management that's going on? Jim Jaye : Yes, Mike. I think part of it is the Valspar synergies, part of it is just our normal part of our culture of continuous improvement. And as we talked about going into 2020, we are not going to be calling out synergies because we want to roll that into just part of our culture. And you could expect, as John talked about, we are going to take action where we need to in certain, whether it's markets or geographies or parts of our business where we see softness and continued softness over a period of time. On the other hand, you are going to see us continue to invest in growth opportunities whether that be in our stores group, consumer group programs or performance coatings to drive future sales. Mike Harrison : Thank you very much. Jim Jaye : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question. Dmitry Silversteyn : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of things. Number one, as you look at your margin recovery in performance coatings, you talked about continuing to sort of press for pricing. I am just trying to understand if by that you mean getting greater traction on the pricing you have implemented at the end of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019? Or do you plan on going out with new pricing as the year unfolds because you feel that you still have a couple of quarters of catch-up to do? And then secondly, if it's the latter, how does that jive with the slowing industrial markets that you are seeing beyond wood just in general sort of macro slowing in industrial, not necessarily maybe in your business. John Morikis : Hi Dmitry. I would respond that we have a little bit of everything that you have talked about. We have got some areas where we have already had those discussions and we are working with our customers, rolling pricing in and we have some areas where, if you look reflective in the past here on what's happening to raw material costs, we are yet to recover some of what has rolled in, in raw material costs. While there might be some relief, the basket is still higher in some products in some areas than when it was in 2016. And so we are having those discussions on a customer-by-customer basis and our goal, I know it sounds a bit repetitive here but in helping our customers to be most successful and helping them by bringing in the solutions that help them win. We need to stay healthy as well and we are having those discussions on a regular basis. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up staying with the industrial theme. You talked about the coil coatings being a standout for you in terms of growth and wood coatings obviously for last couple of quarters has been problem child and that's totally understandable. Can you talk about perhaps maybe not regionally but so much as sort of a product type, if you will, what your other businesses in industrial in performance coatings have done in the second quarter and what your outlook for the second half of the year is in terms of capital projects or protective and marine? I know you are in pipeline business and a few other businesses as well. So if you can kind of look at maybe end-market or product categories and give us a little bit more granularity on what your view is of the market. John Morikis : Sure, Dmitry. Maybe if I break it down a little bit by region initially and just tell you in North America overall, I would say it was flattish. Our general industrial business was positive and we expect that to continue here. Europe, I would say was soft for the most part, excluding as I mentioned, packaging and coil. And I want to give our packaging team their due. I have spoken about coil, but really it's packaging that's leading the pack. So I don't want to get a phone call this calls over from my President, Sam, in our packaging business to correct me here. They are doing a terrific job. So I want to give them their due. Asia-Pacific was soft overall, again packaging and coil were the exceptions here. Both of those were up double digits in Asia. And we expect that to continue in both packaging and coil. And Latin America was positive in every category as well. So our focus, giving you the best forecast, we don't generally like to forecast by segment, but I would say that we don't see a lot of change to what's happening right now. We expect to continue to grow in those markets and continue to work closely with our teams to make sure they have the resources that they need to win. And as I mentioned earlier, every day we feel like as though we have to earn the business that we have and when we are blessed enough to work with some of these new customers, we are focused on making them successful. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. That's fair and thankful. John Morikis : Thank you Dmitry. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : Hi. Good morning guys and nice quarter. First, I just wanted to look at your EPS guidance. You all lowered your sales guidance from about 5.5% at the midpoint to 3%, so a decent deceleration, if you will. But you left EPS guidance unchanged. Could you just walk us through some of the positive offsets relative to your prior expectations? Are raw materials easing more, getting better pricing power synergies, cost controls or anything like that relative to your prior expectations that help EPS unchanged? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Truman. I think part of it is volume in North America and the continued strength that we see in our North America stores. If you think about the TAG organization in the second quarter, they had flow-through of over 32%. And you asked the question on the first quarter we are down 80 basis points and what is the outlook for that TAG organization? And we said, we are confident in our ability to grow our operating margin year-over-year. We were up 50 basis points in a considerably bigger quarter. That bring us about flat and we are optimistic about the continued progress we are going to make in that group. It's the largest segment we have. It's the fastest growing. The other segments, we talked about the softness outside of the U.S., but continued progress in holding the price with raws flattening as we need to keep that price to get back up to whole on our margins over the past few years and then synergies that continue to flow through both first half and second half. So it's really a combination of a number of things and mix being one of them. The bigger, faster stores in North America stores growth. It's our highest margin business that's going to help drive the margin and drive our EPS. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thanks for that. And then jumping back to a few previous questions on performance coatings. Revenues fell 4% in the quarter. It looks like demand will be a bit of a headwind in the back half of the year as well. Could you just run us through how pricing has acted historically in this type of environment? And really what I am trying to look at is, in the back half of 2019, do you think you can improve your operating margin sequentially versus the second quarter because in the past couple of years, you guys have mentioned an ability to do that? John Morikis : Yes. Truman, one point that before jumping into that is, you are exactly right on the numbers but I would also point out that the comp for the quarter was 11% for the PCG. So some tough comparisons there. But I think if you look at the pricing historically what has happened and this is over decades and not just Sherwin but also Valspar is that we have historically gone out with pricing and we have worked with our customers to get the pricing into the market. Our goal has always been to get the pricing and retain the customer. And I would say that in this time of integration, we have been very open with our customers about our willingness to work with them in stepping this pricing in. But the fact that we needed to get the pricing and during that same time we have been working very, very hard to provide those solutions if its products, services, whatever it might be to make them more successful. And our success in rolling this in is evidenced by the most recent quarter in our results, we think, continues to point in the right direction going forward and we are never going to reach the point here where we just say, we can't do better or we don't expect this improvement. We clearly see opportunity for improvement. This was a better performing business. We need to get back to those levels and our teams understand that and we are working hard to get it. Truman Patterson : All right. Thank you guys. John Morikis : Thank you Truman. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Justin Speer : Thanks for the time guys. Just a few questions or two questions. One, if you could characterize the monthly cadence trends in the quarter and maybe even into July thus far in your core Americas business? John Morikis : Yes. I would say, Justin, July is in line with the quarterly guidance we have provided for that business. In the quarter, it's hard to look when you have date changes in that. We talked about even I have gotten a number of notes about maybe and what it may in the history of mankind. So as you would expect, there are ups and downs within a quarter depending on weather patterns. So it's hard to point to one month and say, okay, that was good and this one's softer because of that. So we feel good about the 4.3 same-store sales growth on top of a 6.8 same-store sales growth last year. Justin Speer : Okay. And then the one thing that stood out to me in the quarter positively as well was the cash flow side of things. Very strong in the first half of the year, but particularly in the second quarter. I don't think we have your cash flow yet out from your filing. But just trying to get a sense for what drove that above and beyond working capital. Was there any one-time item that explains the strength there? And how should we think about the full year free cash flow as a percentage of revenues this year, given how strong the first half has been thus far? John Morikis : Yes. We did have a very strong first half, $758 million, up $179 million year-over-year. Core net income and earnings always is a big driver. Our working capital was a lower use of cash. So even though we are carrying more architectural inventory like we talked about into the end of year and into the first quarter, you start seeing that improve as the year goes on and we get to the summer selling season. So I would expect some benefit there. Not any real one-timers, I would say. You look at free cash flow, again, we are targeting and modified, I would say, free cash flow over 11%. We are going to make progress towards that. I am not committing that we will get to it exactly this year. But we are certainly going to make progress through that this year. Justin Speer : Okay. And then a lot of people picking at this question a lot of different ways and I know you are in terms of reading the tea leaves for performance coatings, you recast your view in terms of the timing of achievement of the margin goal, the intermediate term destination for performance coatings. Is there anything incrementally in the softening macro environment that dissuades you from achieving that goal? It sounds like you are still confident. But does this make it a harder put in terms of slower conditions than maybe what we are thinking even a few months ago? John Morikis : Yes. For our businesses, we get the most leverage out of volume. If you get projected macroeconomic headwinds for longer periods of time, we had talked even in our first quarter that we thought we would get past these trade impacts and we will start seeing a better cadence into our second half. We still may. I talked about maybe not helping our guidance number for this year, but certainly heading into next year. That remains to be seen. So it's hard to predict when these businesses come back. That being said, like I talked about, we have market share opportunities in all our businesses across all our regions and we have people waking up every day, trying to drive growth in those businesses aside from any macroeconomic headwinds. So we are still confident about getting the high-teens, low-20s, timing. If it moves a little bit, it moves a little bit. But we are committed to hitting those and we believe we can. Justin Speer : Excellent. Thank you guys. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Chuck Cerankosky : Good afternoon everyone. Just an all-in quick question before a financial question for Al. I saw, John, you opened I think five paint stores in the quarter versus 18 or so in the second quarter last year. Was Sherwin itself delayed by the weather in getting the stores open? John Morikis : Well, we had some, I am sure but we had some impact. I think our net stores there. Jim Jaye : Yes, that's our net store number. For the six months, we have opened 29 new stores versus 33 last year. In that TAG number, we have some closures in Latin America. We did have some closures in North America. But this is a process that we go through every quarter, every year looking at stores and trying to refine the base to be more effective, both on the topline and our bottomline. So I wouldn't read into it anything as far as the net new stores. But we are still going to open 80 to 100 stores and we may net a little bit below that. Chuck Cerankosky : Okay. And more importantly, looking, Al, as you are paying down $600 million in debt, good free cash flow behind the company. With the stock price where it's at, do you lean towards paying down more debt than that? Or do you bite the bullet and the year as you would like to say without cash and buyback the stock? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Chuck, we are going to be consistent in that approach. We are not going to hold cash and like I said a bit earlier, absent M&A, we believe our stock price has good value and we will continue to opportunistically buy it. Chuck Cerankosky : Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks Chuck. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for hanging on for me. I was wondering if you could give us a little more details on the performance coatings, the packaging side of it. Where do you see most of the growth? Is it on the food cans? Is it on beverages? And considering that there was some kind of a secular decline in North America, where are you seeing the growth? John Morikis : Well, we are experiencing good growth across the markets. Rosemarie, if you go back to the comments I made about the European, Asian and Latin America growth of packaging, it may vary a little bit in each of those segments. If you had a lean one way or the other, I would say, probably beverage a little bit slightly higher than food. But we are, by market, focused on those areas with the greatest opportunities. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. And then I was wondering with the election of Johnson as the new Prime Minister in the U.K., is that and his expectations of getting out of Brexit regardless and how? Is that changing your U.K. strategy or European strategy, for that matter? John Morikis : Well, we have put a number of war games on this as you would expect. From an inventory standpoint, we have built up, we have taken down, we have built up and now we have taken down again. We will play this out business by business to understand the best approach. Our supply chain teams have really dialed into this as well as our procurement teams. So at the core of the question, I think you should know that we have looked at this as a number of different ways and we will be responsive by business and with our vendors and suppliers to make sure that they were positioned properly in the market. Rosemarie Morbelli : So you don't think it could have a negative impact based on what you are doing? John Morikis : No, I don't think it would be significant. But like you and everyone else, we are going to stay close to it and adjust accordingly. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you. And just lastly if I may, if since you are out of the private label at Ace, my conclusion, based on your comments, would be that, yes, it will have an impact on the revenue side in 2020, but we could see higher margin just on that particular piece of the business. Am I correct? Al Mistysyn : That's fair, Rosemarie. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. Great. Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So I would like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Jaye for any additional concluding comments. Jim Jaye : Thank you Jessie and thanks everybody for participating in our call today. I appreciate your continued interest in Sherwin. I will be available for calls the rest of the week as well my colleague, Eric Swanson. Please contact Natalie Darr to get yourself in the queue. And thank you again. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thanks, Jessie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. All comparisons in my remarks are to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, unless otherwise stated. Consolidated sales in the third quarter of 2019 increased $136.2 million, or 2.9% to $4.87 billion. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales by 0.9%. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the quarter increased $215 million, or 10.7%, to $2.23 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the third quarter increased to 45.7% from 42.5% in the same period last year. Excluding impacts from acquisition-related amortization, adjusted consolidated gross margin in the quarter increased to 45.9% from 42.8%. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $72.1 million, or 5.7%, to $1.35 billion in the third quarter and increased slightly as a percent of sales to 27.6% from 26.9% in the same quarter last year. Interest expense for the quarter declined $7 million to $85.3 million. Other expense for the quarter increased $29.3 million to $31 million, primarily a result of debt retirement expense and expense associated with Argentina hyperinflation. Consolidated profit before tax in the third quarter increased $293.9 million to $709.8 million. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.8%. Excluding acquisition-related costs and the reduction of the California litigation expense, our effective tax rate on adjusted income for the quarter was 19%. Diluted net income per common share for the third quarter 2019 increased to $6.16 per share from $3.72 per share in the prior year third quarter. Earnings per share in the third quarter of 2019 includes a charge for acquisition-related costs of $0.77 per share and a reduction of the California litigation expense provision of $0.28 per share, a $3.72 per share reported in the third quarter 2018 included charges for acquisition-related costs and the California litigation expense of $0.87 and $1.09 per share respectively. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 17.1% to $6.65 in the third quarter 2019 from $5.68 last year. We have summarized the third quarter earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table in our press release. Let me now take a few moments to break down our performance by segment. Sales for The Americas Group in the third quarter increased $232.5 million, or 8.7%, to $2.90 billion. Comparable store sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 8.1% in the quarter. Regionally in the third quarter, our Eastern Division led all divisions, followed by Southwest, Southeast, Midwest and Canada. Sales were positive in every division in the quarter. Third quarter segment profit increased $85.9 million, or 14.9%, to $663.7 million. Third quarter segment profit margin increased 120 basis points to 22.9% from 21.7% last year. Turning now to the Consumer Brands Group. Third quarter sales decreased $92.1 million, or 11.9%, to $678.5 million. Sales from continuing operations, excluding the Lowe's load-in and the divested Guardsman business, decreased approximately 6% in the quarter. Third quarter segment profit increased $31 million to $114.9 million. Acquisition-related amortization decreased segment profit by $22.6 million compared to $26 million in the third quarter 2018. Third quarter segment profit margin increased to 16.9% from 10.9% last year. Excluding the acquisition-related amortization in both quarters, adjusted segment profit margin increased to 20.3% from 14.3% in the third quarter 2018. For our Performance Coatings Group, third quarter sales decreased $4.3 million or 0.3% to $1.29 billion. Currency translation rate changes reduced third quarter sales by 1.6%. Third quarter segment profit increased $32.6 million to $137.4 million. Acquisition-related amortization decreased segment profit by $54.3 million compared to $55.4 million in the third quarter 2018. Third quarter Performance Coatings Group segment profit margin increased to 10.7% from 8.1% last year. Excluding the acquisition-related amortization in both quarters, segment profit margin increased to 14.9% compared to 12.4% in the third quarter 2018. I'll conclude my remarks with a comment on our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we refinanced and extended the maturity of our debt to improve our liquidity position and to lock in favorable interest rates ahead of expected rate increases. Specifically, we tendered approximately $1 billion of our 2020 senior notes and $500 million of our 2022 senior notes. We financed this transaction with $800 million of 10-year notes at 2.95%, $550 million of 30-year notes at 3.8% and $150 million of commercial paper. That concludes our review of our operating results for the third quarter. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments on the third quarter and provide our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2019. John? John Morikis : Thank you Jim and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to make just a few additional comments on our third quarter, before moving on to our outlook. Our team continues to execute at a high level. We delivered another strong quarter as adjusted EPS increased more than 17% to $6.65. Our results were driven by outstanding performance in our North American paint stores where we grew same-store sales by a high single-digit percentage and generated growth in every customer end market. On a consolidated basis, adjusted gross margin increased over 300 basis points year-over-year to 45.9%. While, we still have work to do this improvement shows that we are making progress towards offsetting the significant raw material inflation, we experienced over 2017 and 2018. We remain committed to achieving our long-term full year gross margin target at 45% to 48%. The increase in gross margin in the quarter was driven by strong North American volume growth, operating efficiencies and moderating raw material costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 150 basis points over the prior year to 18.9%. And for the second consecutive quarter, all three operating segments increased segment profit and margin compared to the prior year. I'm also pleased with our ongoing integration efforts and we remain on-track to exit the year at a synergy run rate of $415 million. Looking at our topline, consolidated sales increased 2.9% in the quarter in line with our revenue guidance of our low single-digit increase. Our sales vary by region with North America and Latin America each increasing by mid single digit percentages in the quarter. We continued to see softness in Asia and Australia and to a lesser degree, Europe. Within The Americas Group, sales increased 8.7% against the prior year comparison of 5%. Sales were positive in all North American customer end markets in the quarter led by residential repaint which was up low double digits. Sales in commercial and DIY were up high-single digits, while protective and marine, new residential and property management were all up mid-single digits. Looking at total segment profitability, segment profit dollars increased by more than $85 million and segment margin expanded by 120 basis points to 22.9%. We leveraged the strong volume growth to deliver incremental margin of approximately 37%. We ended the quarter with our customers continuing to be very optimistic reporting solid backlogs for the remainder of the year and a strong sense of confidence heading into 2020. Year-to-date, we've opened 31 net new stores finishing the quarter with 4,727 stores in operation compared with 4,653 last year. Our plan calls for this team to add approximately 80 to 100 new stores for the year. Similar to prior years, we will have a significant ramp up in the fourth quarter. In the Consumer Brands segment, third quarter sales were down mainly related to the comparison to last year's load-in of the Lowe's program and the impact of the Guardsman divestiture. Sales decreased slightly more than we expected due to weakness in international markets, most significantly in Asia and Australia. In North America, we remain very encouraged with our relationships, with our largest customers where we are also committed to helping them accelerate sales to the pros who are shopping in the home center channel. Segment margin, excluding acquisition-related amortization increased year-over-year to 20.3% driven by synergies and moderating raw material costs, along with improving year-over-year supply chain costs. We continue to feel good about our strategy in this business and our portfolio of Hero brands that serve the North American retail market. Performance Coatings Group sales were down 0.3% in the quarter, as choppy industrial demand led to variability by region and business. Geographically total segment sales were up in North America and Latin America, but were offset by softness in Asia and Europe where sales decreased by high and low single-digit percentages respectively. From a business perspective, our packaging and coil businesses remained our strongest performers delivering growth in every region as our customers continue to value our technology and service solutions. Our automotive refinish business delivered modest growth in the quarter led by solid performance in the Americas. Sales in the general industrial and industrial wood businesses decreased year-over-year, primarily due to softness in Asia and Europe. Despite the sales decline, adjusted segment margin increased 250 basis points to 14.9%, due primarily to moderating raw material costs and good cost control. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $919 million or 18.9% of sales. Excluding integration cost and the lower California Litigation expense. Adjusted EBITDA year-to-date was $2.4 billion or 17.5% of sales. Year-to-date, we returned over $892 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 46% year-over-year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $8.9 billion of debt on the balance sheet. We reduced debt by approximately $435 million year-to-date. We intend to retire a total of approximately $600 million this year which will result in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 3 :1 by the end of 2019. During the quarter Moody's raised our rating outlook to positive from stable, noting our strong business profile and meaningful deleveraging since the acquisition of Valspar. We paid $105 million in cash dividends and purchased 250000 shares of common stock for $127 million in the third quarter. At quarter end, our share repurchase authorization stood at 8.8 million shares. Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter, depreciation was $65 million and average amortization was $78 million. Moving on to our outlook for the fourth quarter 2019, we expect consolidated net sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Given that our North American professional painting contractor customers continue to report solid backlogs and a positive demand outlook, we expect growth in The Americas Group to be in the mid to high single-digit range. We expect Consumer Brands Group sales will be flat to up slightly in the fourth quarter. We expect Performance Coatings Group sales to be down low-single digits as industrial demand remains highly variable by region and end market. Against this backdrop and given our strong performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our adjusted 2019 full year diluted net income per common share guidance to be in the range of $20.90 to $21.30 per share, which excludes Valspar acquisition related costs and non-operating items. This is an increase of approximately 14% at the midpoint, compared to the $18.53 reported last year on a comparable basis. We've included a Regulation G reconciliation table with this morning's press release to reconcile adjusted and GAAP earnings per share. A few additional data points for the full year may be helpful for modeling purposes. As planned, we expect raw material costs in the fourth quarter to further moderate from the levels we saw in the third quarter, assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions. We expect our 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $320 million, depreciation to be about $257 million and amortization to be $315 million. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thank you. Now that you're done with the Valspar integration, so it appears you have long-term opportunities to expand margins across all three segments, but specifically Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings. Can you just give us a quick update on any non-raw material levers you have left to pull to try if margin's higher? Thank you. John Morikis : Yeah, Chris. First let me just take a bit of exception to your comment about now that we're done with the Valspar acquisition integration. There's still quite a bit of work to be done there and we're working hard to fully integrate, not only the domestic piece here but we've got quite a bit of work to do in the non-domestic and a whole lot of work to do on the sales side. So a lot of opportunity there to leverage going forward. Al Mistysyn : And Chris this is Al Mistysyn. Just as a reminder, we talked about the synergy progress that we're making and coming out of this year at a $415 million run rate through the P&L $315 million. And that $100 million is going to be by and large facilities and manufacturing and other consolidations as well as formulation adjustment. So there are other levers to pull along with our continued focus on market share opportunities and delivering new technologies innovative solutions and services to our customers to drive growth organically and that's where we think we're going to see the benefits. Christopher Parkinson : Got it. Then you did hit on this a little on your prepared remarks, but can you just kind of walk us through the rest of the PC sub-segments of packaging, general industrial coil, wood and refinish. Can you just hit on the key highlights that you're looking into over the next 12 months or so and then also give us a quick comment on whether or not you're fully content with your competitive positioning in each of those substrates? Thank you. John Morikis : Well, we're certainly not satisfied with our competitive position. We want to continue to grow in our competitiveness and we believe that our teams are doing a terrific job in aligning our services and our technology to help our customers meet the solution and deliver the solutions that they need to be successful. To your first part of your question as we talked about overall, North America and Latin America for the quarter were positive. We expect that momentum to continue. I'd say as I highlighted earlier that the European and Asian markets, we saw some softness there and I would expect that's going to be bumpy going forward here for a little while. But if I look at it from a business perspective, we're really excited about the momentum in our coil business. As I mentioned that is our strongest growing business right now. It's been a race if you will between our packaging and our coil business. This quarter the coil business was the strongest performer and it was double digits in every region. And we've got some really good momentum there going forward and feel really good about that business. Our packaging, we talked a lot about our unique technology there. We expect that business continue to grow. That was up single digits and it also was up in every region. So again two terrific teams really hitting on all cylinders and we're really excited about that and expect continued momentum. We don't talk a lot about our Protective & Marine business. That business was up single digits and mid-single digits and a lot of good momentum there. Another good leadership team and we really gained some ground in some very key focus areas. In the past we talked about our heavier weight in the petrochem and our focus on some of those other adjacent markets. We're getting good penetration there. So we're excited about that. Our automotive business was up in three of their four divisions. Overall they were up low single digits and we feel as though they grew some share here in North America, so we're pleased with that. Our GI business was up in the Americas, North America and South America. Again terrific leadership here. We are experiencing some soft softness in Asia and Europe. And when you look at our industrial wood business that's the area of softness that we've had really around the world. The industrial wood business has been soft and we expect that to be bumpy for some time. Christopher Parkinson : Very helpful. Thank you. John Morikis : Yeah. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. You spoke about your raw material comparisons improving in the fourth quarter. Is that a year-over-year phenomenon that is -- are raw materials moving sequentially lower from the third to the fourth quarter? Or is that \u2013 that has to do with the year-over-year comparison? Al Mistysyn : Yeah, Jeff. We do expect raws to get sequentially better, not to the magnitude that we saw in our third quarter. As you remember the second and third quarter last year, we really saw a ramp-up in our raw material cost and then it moderated a little bit in the fourth quarter. So we do see a little bit of sequential improvement and we believe the fourth quarter will be lower year-over-year. John Morikis : I would add to that. As Al said, the broad basket was down slightly year-over-year in the third quarter, but I think you have to look at a little bit by architectural and industrial. So the decrease was really driven more Jeff on the petrochemical side of the basket where certain parts of the basket were down, not all, but certain parts were down year-over-year. And what I'd remind you is certainly we don't buy or sell propylene or ethylene and each of those different feedstocks have their own market dynamics associated with them. But as Al said, we're still expecting the basket to be down modestly year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but the highest level of inflation was in our third quarter of 2018 last year. Jeff Zekauskas : All right. And then for my follow-up, are there any plans to increase prices in the stores business in the North American paint market in 2019? Or is that not on your agenda? John Morikis : Well we have work to do Jeff. We're still facing the significant raw material cost inflation we experienced in 2017 and 2018. And with our consolidated gross margin improvement, we are making progress towards our goal of the 45% to 48% as I mentioned earlier. But as to the specifics of your question, we're still reviewing our options and our pricing strategy at this time. And I'd say that we do that on a regular basis with great frequency. We're sitting down talking about where we are and where we need to be. And I'd say that has been our past practice, we'll first communicate that to our customers and then to the financial community. Al Mistysyn : And Jeff, I would just add. Since we have not announced any price increases at this point, when John talked about TAG being up mid- to high single-digits that implies it's a vast majority of the volume. Jeff Zekauskas : Great. Thank you so much. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Hi, good morning. John Morikis : Good morning, Mike. Mike Harrison : The same-store sales number in Q3, can you just talk about whether part of what we saw there was some pent-up demand after dealing with some poor weather during Q2? And I think even maybe into July? Can you just talk about whether that was unusually strong in your opinion that 8% number? John Morikis : Well Mike I would say there are a few issues here. Certainly, I'd say coming out of the quarter, we did speak to the fact that we felt our customers were going to be in a sprint to catch up on some of the work that was out there and that they were really working hard to capture. But I'd also say that our customers continue to be very bullish about their pipeline both in the fourth quarter and into 2020. We're growing share. We feel good about the execution of this team on their efforts. We've got a lot of plans that they're implementing and growing share of wallet and new account activity that we've been talking about for some time. And I want to thank this team, because they're executing at a very high level. You have to go back I think it was the third quarter of 2014 to find this level of performance. But I'd say that when we look at this team's drive and execution combined with the outlook that our customers are giving us we're feeling pretty good and we're pretty feeling really good about the share that we're gaining right now. Mike Harrison : All right. And then I wanted to ask about the independent dealer channel as well. It sounds like your competitors are working to kind of integrate their store network with some of the dealer network. Is that something that Sherwin does as well? And can you maybe just talk about what you saw this quarter in your sales through independent dealers? John Morikis : I'd say overall the independent dealer market has not been a very strong portion of the market. We do not integrate our independent dealers with our stores. We operate those as separate businesses. And our goal as we work with our independent dealer customers is clearly to help them in their approach to growing their business. And through our stores obviously we have a direct relationship with those end users as well. Typically, those might be customers with some different expectations. Some of those customers that are going into a dealer might have different expectations than those that are coming into our stores, but our store people are out building those relationships driving them into our stores with regularity. Mike Harrison : Thanks very much. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, Mike. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. John Morikis : Good morning, John. John McNulty : Good morning. With regard to the contracts that you have, can you give us some color as to how much visibility they have into their backlog as they look out? I know it's going to vary a little bit from residential to non-resi, but can you give us a little bit color on that? And how much you see in terms of that mid single-digit type growth that you're seeing in the fourth quarter, how we should be thinking about that rolling into 2020? John Morikis : Well you hit on a number of really good points. First is that the residential repaint contractor's vision versus the nonresidential or commercial will be on the opposite ends of the spectrum. So commercial contractor might be bidding the projects that's not even out of the ground yet where a residential contractor might be bidding something that could be painted in the next couple of weeks. We're blessed. So we have a number of stores and a number of territory -- reps that are out there working with those customers and we try to capture and understand as much as we can about what's happening in the market through those contacts. So a better line of sight and quicker on the residential a little more distant on the commercial side. John McNulty : Great. Thanks for the color. And then maybe just one follow-up. On the SG&A as a percent of sales ticked up I guess marginally. I guess what was driving that? Was that the -- just the rapid pace of what you saw in the same-store sales side and trying to keep up with it? Or was there something else we should be thinking about? Al Mistysyn : No, John, I think you hit it right on the head. It's keeping up with the increased sales, but also we have 75 additional stores year-over-year commensurate number of reps. So we continue to invest in our growth opportunities specifically in North America stores. Regardless of -- we saw a little softness in consumer because of the year-over-year dynamics there and we saw a little bit of softness in industrial. You can be rest assured we'll continue to invest in these growth opportunities specifically on North America stores. John McNulty : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Al Mistysyn : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thanks very much and good morning everyone. This is the second quarter in a row where you really had what appears to be just outside same-store sales performance versus the data that's out there and the other comments that are out there. And I know we talked about this a bit last quarter, but I want to ask a question, a little bit differently this time around and just understand, was there anything you're doing as you're prospecting new business, whether it's a greater part of the wallet \u2013 existing wallet or a part of the wallet that you don't have? Is there anything you're doing with data or other technology that's sort of allowing you to find more leads? And we've also in the past talked about how when you open new stores, sometimes other stores close. Has there been an acceleration in that trend? I'm really just trying to understand sort of what's driving this big sort of what appears to be a step change in share gain and how sustainable you think it is looking into next year? John Morikis : Yes. So Vincent, the answer is yes. We're trying to use as many tools and improve the tools and as many new tools as valuable and improve the tools that we have currently or consistently used in the past. And I would say that a big part of that also comes down to the execution. We're always trying to \u2013 we're hiring 1400 college students a year. We're bringing them in. We're spending more time training them in the different aspects of the business that will help them and I think we're getting better at that. And I think when you're wondering what's happening and I think it's using the tools. It's really good programs. It's really good products and it's a lot of determination. We don't unlock our doors and wait for something to happen. I mean we're out there aggressively trying to grow this business and build relationships. And to your point, we talked about it last quarter. We hope we talk about it again next quarter because our focus is on making that happen. If you look at our residential repaint business this is \u2013 we've had five years of compounded growth, double-digit growth in this business and we expect that there's a lot of momentum there to continue as well as in these other segments in the commercial and property management as well. But we're not waiting for it to happen. We're very deliberate in what we're trying to execute. Vincent Andrews : Thanks. And as a follow-up, Al if I could ask you about the fourth quarter guidance. I mean by our estimate you aid about $0.31 of what I'd call non-recurring cost, hopefully the FX hit and the debt extinguishment and if you take those out, you really had phenomenal leverage, all the way through the income statement. So it just seemed to me that maybe the fourth quarter looks a little conservative. Is that a fair statement or not? Al Mistysyn : Vince we try to be as realistic as we can when we put our guidance together. I look at FX as just part of our ongoing business. It's hard to say, hey we're going to back out if I take a hit in one country or another. We choose to be there. We choose to operate our businesses there because we think there's opportunity. We also did have the benefit in the quarter on supply chain improvements in our Consumer Brands Group that helped the operating margin growth. As you recall last year we talked about the load-in to the new customer program that caused us some challenges in that quarter. So that benefit won't be there and going forward. But if you look at our fourth quarter, at the midpoint, our full year guidance is to be up almost 14% like John talked about. That tells you we got to be up almost 21% in the fourth quarter on top of a 12% increase a year ago. So I think those are pretty strong results for our fourth quarter and we feel very good about that. Vincent Andrews : I appreciate the color. Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. I'd like to just continue with Vincent's question about your aggressiveness going after new projects that seemed to be driving your market share gains. Just one question for you with respect to your dedicated sales force. What fraction of their compensation is variable? And has that changed? John Morikis : It's not changed and I want to say it's about 60-40, 60 fixed, 40 variable, Steve. It might vary just slightly but it's just about 60-40. Steve Byrne : And John you mentioned this $85 million year-over-year profit gain in The Americas Group. If we take this split in same-store sales between volume and price and you mentioned 37% incremental operating margin on that volume you had lower raws. There was something that was a drag. Was it Lat Am? And can you quantify that? John Morikis : Well our Lat Am business was up low single-digits in sales. We did have a profit improvement in the quarter. I'm trying to frame it in a way that you've asked the question there Steve. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Steve I'd say you look at the flow-through and as Jim was alluding to we're not seeing as much of a benefit on the raw material moderation in our architectural side of the business. So the stores, when you get up into the mid-30s on flow-through, we feel very good about that. So we continue to add the stores that I talked about and we had 75 additional year-over-year and we continue to have commensurate number of reps. So I think we feel good about that flow-through incremental operating margin. And if the stores could do that all the time we'd be happy with that. Steve Byrne : Very good. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. With regard to your same-store sales growth of 8.1%, how would you characterize the relative contributions from volume versus price in the quarter? Jane Cronin : Yes. I would say that the price was an impact of about 2.5% and then the reminder would be volume. Kevin McCarthy : Excellent. And then I wanted to ask about your non-raw material costs. What we sometimes hear from other companies is that yes, raw material costs are ebbing but companies are experiencing inflation in other categories like labor, freight, warehousing et cetera. Is that the case at Sherwin? And if so, how does that enter into your thinking about potential optionality for seeking additional price in the future? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Kevin, clearly we're seeing wage inflation. And if you look at it year-over-year it has ticked up a little bit as unemployment has continued to decline. And we have seen freight increases and distribution increases. When we look at \u2013 as well as health care. And when we look at our cost, we look at it as a total cost basket and try to determine where that's headed, what the impacts are. We obviously try to push back on that and get efficiencies to offset it. But absent getting those offset, we have to go to the market with price. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Al Mistysyn : Good morning Arun. Arun Viswanathan : Just beating a dead horse here just going back to the same-store sales number. Presumably you did that with new construction also relatively weak. So, just trying to understand the step change from say Q2 which is maybe 2% or so volume going up to 6% now. Would you attribute all of that to share gains? Or was it certain regions that were weak in the prior quarter doing a little bit better? And then what are your thoughts on the new side going from here? It seems like there's been some improvement in affordability. Does that give you a little bit more optimism for that market actually returning into your business in 2020? Thanks. John Morikis : Yes. Arun so we -- let me just start with the last piece that you just spoke about as far as the new residential. We do enjoy a wonderful position with the largest percentage of the larger homebuilders in the country. And we work really hard every day trying to help those important customers deliver on time and homes that their homeowners really enjoy and that includes the services and products that help them to deliver. And so as that business picks up, you're right, we will be working hard to grow those relationships. I believe it's either 17 or 18 of the top 20 national homebuilders we have an exclusive relationship with and we're working really hard on the regional and the smaller homebuilders to leverage those existing services and products that are within our company already. As it relates back to the growth that we've had in the core stores and the momentum that we have there, a good portion of it is share gain. You're right. Our teams are as I mentioned, again, I don't want to sound like a broken record here, but this is a team that's executing very well on the programs that they have and the services that they provide. And we don't know what's going to happen going forward with weather or labor, but we can tell you that we're working really hard to position our company favorably with these customers. We had that leadership team in about two weeks ago walking through segment-by-segment and across the country. There's a lot of optimism about not only where we are, but where we're going. So, we're feeling really good about this but there's no complacency here. There's a lot of work to be done, a lot of customers out there that we're working on and focused on to continue to grow. And that's what we're going to be doing this afternoon and moving forward. Arun Viswanathan : And I just wanted to get your thoughts on the priorities for your cash flow going forward. You've talked about buybacks in the past. I guess if we're to go back 10 years, bolt-on M&A wasn't a huge part of your strategy, maybe it was in the stores business, but not so much in Coatings. So, maybe you can just reiterate what you're looking at as far as opportunities to deploy that cash flow and maybe rank order your preferences between buybacks debt reduction and M&A. Thanks. John Morikis : Yes. Let me start with M&A and then I'll toss it to Al to talk about the remaining capital deployment opportunities. But I would say this Arun, we're really pleased with the progress that we're making. We're actively involved in a number of projects. We do feel we're blessed that we're not desperate for growth. We don't feel as though we have to have acquisitions for growth. Although we have a number of opportunities that we're pursuing we have a number of organic growth opportunities as well. And so we look across all of the businesses and we're identifying those areas if it's geographic or from a technology standpoint that will allow us to further create shareholder value. And those are the discussions that we're pursuing and still quite frankly have quite a pipeline to get to. So, we're working it. We feel good about the progress we're making on a couple of really good projects, but there's more for cash deployment and I'll let Al just touch on that. Al Mistysyn : Yes Arun. We are generating a lot of cash through the nine months of over $1.7 billion almost with 12.1% of sales and we manage our CapEx below 2% as you know and we've gotten back to our historical capital allocation policy. We've raised the dividend over 31%. And with the dividends and share buybacks, we've returned over $893 million to our shareholders, a 46% increase and we're going to be very consistent on that going forward. So, as you know we're not going to hold cash. And absent a more robust M&A pipeline, we're going to buy back our stock. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, Arun. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. John Morikis : Good morning Duffy. Duffy Fischer : A question just around kind of the new strategy in the home center for you. This is your first full year going through the paint season, going through that fewer -- or more people salespeople in the stores. When you look back this year, how would you grade yourself with the new project? And again should we expect a bigger step forward next year again? John Morikis : Yes. I'd say Duffy that we're pleased, but not anywhere near satisfied. Next year we'll be better than we were this year. There's a lot of elements to this program that rolled out this year for the first time in our largest customer and we're determined to get better there and there's a lot of opportunity on both the do-it-yourself side. And as I mentioned earlier there's a professional side here that enjoys the home center experience that's purchasing a number of products that are available for the home center channel that we want to help our customers in that home center space to be better in pursuing. And so this first year as the program rolled out we were learning and improving, but we're not happy with where we are. We want to continue to grow. Now, we've spoken that overall for the entire business on a global basis, we expect this to be low single-digit growth business, so there's going to be some work ahead. We also know that there will be some bumps and some choppiness if you will and it's not as smooth as some of our other businesses. But I don't want at all to give the impression that we're satisfied or complacent here. I mean there's a lot of learning that we've done and we're going to try to learn and apply and be better at this going forward. Duffy Fischer : Okay. And then one for Al. Al on the California settlement, what's the size of the cash outflow and what's the timing of that relative to the book numbers you gave us in the release? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Duffy the Santa Clara California case was resolved for $305 million with each co-dependent paying $101.7 million over six years. We made the initial payment of about $25 million on September 23rd of this year. We'll make annual payments of approximately $12 million on or about September 23rd next year and all the way through 2024. And then we'll make a final payment of approximately $16.7 million in September of 2025. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thanks guys. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, Duffy. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question. Don Carson : Well, thank you. Question on consumer, your revenues were down 12% year-over-year. You said half of that was due to Lowe's load-in and Guardsman in the year ago number. What was driving the other half was that all international softness? And can you comment on, how you see that unfolding as you get into fourth quarter? You talked about being down slightly in that business in the fourth quarter is that all going to be international or is there still a tough comp against Lowe's and Guardsman? John Morikis : Yeah, Don. I'd say the sales miss you're right by a point or two from our forecast. And the miss is as you mentioned largely attributed to our international business. There is some work here to be done. We are certainly focused on this largest piece of our business here in North America. We do think longer term there are some opportunities as we reposition our brand in China to be a better competitor there. We do have a very small business small \u2013 in a smaller market in Australia that we didn't perform very well, and there's no hiding about that. But overall, if you look at the international business it was a drag and we have a goal of driving those better and we think we can. Jim Jaye : And Don I would just add to that your last statement. Guardsman is behind us. It was divested in September of last year and we are not going to be going up against any significant load-in the fourth quarter. Don Carson : Okay. And then Al a follow-up on plant consolidation, I know you had kept a couple of U.S. plants going for longer than originally planned in order to service the new Lowe's business, what's the status of those plants? Have they been closed yet or what is the current plan? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. We're continuing to put in capacity \u2013 expand capacity in other sites to make sure we're going to service first our stores' strong, strong volume growth that we see had in the third quarter and the outlook plus the Lowe's volume growth that we've seen. So, we haven't made those calls yet, but as you know our normal practice we will tell our employees first and then we'll talk about it going forward. Don Carson : Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you Don. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Yeah. Hi, good morning. John Morikis : Good morning PJ. P.J. Juvekar: John can you talk about the DIY paint growth versus contractor applied paint growth? The reason I'm asking is we are getting different signals from you and your competitor. I think your competitors saw decline in same-store sales growth in their own stores. So, what is the split between the two? Is it 60-40 contractor DIY? And how faster this market is growing? John Morikis : Our business through our stores is about 85% professional painting contractor or property management and that's the piece that is obviously growing the fastest. We did have some growth in our DIY business. The DIY business relatively small piece and it's really focused on the specialty high-end consumer that's looking for a specialty store experience. So, we clearly are really focused on the professional side. P.J. Juvekar: What is the overall industry in terms of DIY and contractor? Not just your own stores but overall industry. John Morikis : The DIY piece would be the largest piece overall. Jim Jaye : Yeah. If you look at the overall industry DIY is about 38% of the gallons. So it's a bigger slice in the industry obviously than it is in our stores. P.J. Juvekar: All right. John Morikis : But well \u2013 yeah 38 overall the segment larger than any one particular professional segment. P.J. Juvekar: Right. Al Mistysyn : P.J. what I would add to that though is we still can see \u2013 continue to see the trend from Do It Yourself to Do It For Me as the population ages. That leads into the resi paint that we talked about being high-single digits in the quarter. We grew high-single digits compounded for the previous five years. So, as the demographic trends continue, and we are probably skewed more heavily to new construction as John mentioned earlier than the overall market. We will continue to grow faster in the market with those trends. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. A quick question for Al. Al, your goal was to get the leverage below three times by end of this year? Now once you get there, would you be willing to look at a bigger acquisition? And is Europe still an attractive market for you given that the recent slowdown in the European overall economies? Al Mistysyn : Yeah, I think P.J. you're right. We are going to be below three to one by the end of this year. Our target is two times to two and half. And as John talked about with \u2013 earlier about M&A, we're going to be very disciplined about our approach to M&A that \u2013 we look at it for the long term not. I understand Europe is a little bit slower. Asia is probably slower than what we had expected, specifically on the industrial side. But we look at the long-term. So, if the right opportunity were to present itself at the right price. We absolutely would go after it. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you, P.J. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks. I'd love to follow-up on the Performance Coatings group. I think John you mentioned a few times still chasing some of the cost increases from a few years ago. Could you put that in context of where we are now? I guess, if you back out FX Performance Coatings was up 1.3%. Was that all price and what do we think we can still get there and now that raw materials appear to be moderating? John Morikis : Yeah. Greg, a good portion of that was price volume was down. We talked about softness in certain markets and in certain regions of the globe. I would say, we're not done we are \u2013 our year-to-date operating margin is 14% just over 14%. We've talked about targeting a high-teens to low 20s, and you look at the significant ramp-up in raw materials that we saw in 2017 and 2018. We talked about Valspar specifically on industrial not being -- not getting a price early in 2017. So we're still chasing that. So as -- I'm happy with the progress we're making. The team has done a great job at cost control and the synergies that I talked about that are to come but we got more work to do. Jim Jaye : Yeah. I'd add to that Greg that as we've been going through this process, we've made a conscious decision of trying to work with our customers. While the raws increased rapidly, we try to work with our customers, and allowing them to work through the pricing to their customers ultimately. And we accepted some compression there as the new owners of the business that hadn't had a price increases in the market that it really needed and had quite frankly demonstrated over the last few decades because of the cost -- the overall cost -- the relative cost of raw materials and overall cost of goods. You need to get the pricing through when it rises. Here we made a decision that we work with our customers that's to Al's point, we're working with them in a way to pass those through because we need to recover that as well. Greg Melich : Got it. And just to make sure in this quarter the 1.3% sales growth ex-FX that was volume not price? Or it was price not volume? Al Mistysyn : It would be more price than volume. Greg Melich : It would be more price. And there's one thing and John I just wanted to -- you had an announcement through the quarter about looking at a new R&D facility and headquarters. I know, it'll take a few years. Could you just take us through the thought process of why now and what you're really looking at when you think about that? John Morikis : Sure. Well as you mentioned, we're going through a pretty robust process and its -- to find a solution to meet our needs. And Greg, I know you've been here and many on the call have been to our building here to know that we operate in a building that's nearly 100 years old. And as we look at our ability to recruit and retain the highest caliber people in an productive and efficient environment -- the technology and innovation that we need to drive to continue to drive results that we know we can continue to drive on top of factoring in the maintenance costs and just overall issues that we faced in this building. We feel it's necessary to move towards the solution. We're in the midst of that process. We hope to make an announcement on the location by year end or early 2020. But realistically, Greg I would say that, this is not something that we prefer to do quite frankly. It's not something that we think is any type of -- we deserve a reward or this is our of necessity to be able to hire and retain the best people in this industry. And we owe it to our employees quite frankly to put them in a better environment that they're working in right now. And we look at the retention of these terrific people we need to make this move. Greg Melich : Got it. And is having -- is bringing facilities together given you still have in Minneapolis and in Cleveland different areas, is important to get those people together or did actually make sense to have sort of two towers of power? John Morikis : I'd say that, we're really looking at this to your point of where does it make sense? I don't -- I'm not a believer. I mean you can talk about the people in Minneapolis and then you could say, well, what about the people in Shanghai or in the U.K or \u2013 so where we believe that there are opportunities in synergies, we'll bring those together. But we're not at all -- we don't believe that every technical team needs to be here in Cleveland. That said, we like the idea of possible of getting our marketing people and our R&D people closer together and more consistency where there are synergies and efficiencies amongst the R&D teams. And that's what we're working towards. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. Good luck guys. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. John you mentioned strength this quarter in coil and refinish maybe gaining some share. What's driving that share gain? And is there more going forward in both those frontlines? John Morikis : Yes. I think what's nice about -- the growth is coming is in every region -- double digits in every region. So there's a lot of growth in a number of different segments and quite frankly, there's still some drag -- some pressure that we're feeling in the ag business, where it's been more influenced by some of the dynamics -- impacted by tariffs, the sales of the farming -- the products that are on farms or the equipment that they're storing all -- some of those delays are impacting coil. So we see upside there.  But overall I'd say that, this is a team that's really executing very well in bringing the products and technologies to customers in a very efficient way. And we've long talked about the efficiencies to be gained by the combined Sherwin and Valspar teams coming together and the assets and technologies and we're just starting to see some of that. So we think there's a lot of really good opportunities ahead for this business, despite where it's performing right now. David Begleiter : Very good. And Al just on the debt refi what's the benefit to the interest expense going forward? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Obviously with the low interest rates that we refinanced the 2.25 and 2.75, 2022 we did the \u2013 you recall in the second quarter we did the $400 million U.S. euro currency swap. So net-net, it's going to be pretty neutral going forward, maybe down a little bit depending on what we do next year. David Begleiter : Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thank you. Good afternoon. John Morikis : Good afternoon John. John Roberts : Back on that -- the project. Will that be cost neutral to your operating cost the new headquarters and the new R&D facility? John Morikis : Yes, John. We're still crunching those numbers and it's hard to fully get a feel for that until you determine location, design and things like that. But we're in multiple buildings around Cleveland, Ohio all pretty old. My expectation is we're going to see some benefits of ongoing operating cost. John Roberts : Okay. And then on the next earnings call you're going to give 2020 guidance. Will that still continue to be on an adjusted EPS basis excluding amortization? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. We're going to certainly call out amortization. We'll see how -- what we do with integration, but we're working through the plan John, and how best to communicate. But the goal here is to make sure our shareholders had a clean line of sight for our ongoing operating results. John Roberts : Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Garik Shmois : Thanks. I was wondering if you can comment on inventories in Performance Coatings? If you saw some of the volume decline related to additional drawdowns? John Morikis : In Performance Coatings, I'd say there's probably not too much of that. I'd say what we might see is maybe a few more orders of lesser size, so greater frequency of smaller orders. But I don't know if we point to a significant reduction in inventory as having much impact on our number. Garik Shmois : And my follow-up is just switching to The Americas Group. I was wondering if you can break out interior versus exterior same-store sales. John Morikis : Exterior was up double digits and that would include paint stains and primers. Interior sales were up high-single digits. Garik Shmois : Great. Thanks a lot Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Justin Speer : Good morning. Thank you or good afternoon. Just in regards to the Performance Coatings business, the ambitions that you're driving towards, I guess just the primary reason for being behind trends was the pricing cost. But now that looks to be on a little bit better footing. But then you have that counterbalance against underlying emerging market or international markets a little slower or weaker than maybe you're expecting maybe a year or plus ago. But I guess my question is what are the incremental steps you need to take to drive towards that optimized scale in this business? And when do you think you'd get there? John Morikis : Yeah, Justin. The comment about slowing in some of the regions we're in and macroeconomic discussions that I've had. We still have great market share opportunities across each of these businesses and each of these regions and you see that in coil and packaging as example where the teams have done a great job tying together technology and services to provide those solutions to those specific customers in those regions and they're making progress there. There's no shortage of other opportunities across each of the other businesses. And then specifically on the synergies, the $415 million run rate versus the $315 million we'll have to the P&L acquisition to date that will be by and large on Performance Coatings. And just -- and by design, the industrial integration was coming after the architectural integration and we're on path. We have a plan and rest assured as we implement those synergies we'll see those through the P&L. That being said, coming out of this year we talked about this. We're not going to be talking about synergies any longer. This is just going to be part of our normal culture of continuous improvement. Justin Speer : So that makes sense. One of the follow-up questions I actually had on that subject on the synergies. I just want to make sure I understand the mechanics of this $315 million in the P&L, are you saying that you've already done the work to drive that incremental $100 million of synergy such as that's going to be realized in 2020? Or is that something that carries into beyond 2020? $100 million? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. If you recall at our Investor Day, we talked about that $100 million being spread out over the next few years. I would say the $100 million has projects in the pipeline to support it, but we got to get to execution and really dial in to what we think we're going to say. So there might be a little bit of variability in there. But we definitely have the projects identified. Now it's all about execution. Justin Speer : Perfect. And the last question is more near-term focus, because we're thinking about the implied margins for fourth quarter given that right now it's tough for us to draw a really good bid on typical seasonality as it pertains to -- particularly Consumer Brands or Performance Coatings. But just maybe some indications of where the margin destination is going mapping towards your fourth quarter implied guidance. Al Mistysyn : Yes. As you would expect with our stores, our North America paint stores in TAG in particular being up mid to high single-digits at higher gross margin that's going to help. But you definitely see a seasonal tick down. So, I would expect our sequential gross margin to be lower. But certainly -- and this is a little bar, but certainly, high by year-over-year. Justin Speer : Yes, I guess in terms of that Consumer Brands in particular. Although last year you saw sequential degradation that was almost what 800 basis points? Is that the typical sequential degradation you should think about in Consumer Brands? Al Mistysyn : You're going to see a little -- think about because we have the load-in in the third quarter and then didn't have any in the fourth quarter. It would be less -- it should be less than that this year. Justin Speer : Perfect. Thank you very much guys. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : Hi, good afternoon guys. Nice quarter. Yes. Hoping we can touch on the raw material outlook a little bit more just break out between your resins and titanium dioxide. It looks like propylene is down pretty significantly here. You're starting to see that flow through to your resins. How should we think about that going forward over the next few quarters? And then on the titanium dioxide part, it seems like there's some moving parts there you have. Your old U.S. business seems fairly robust, but some of your competitors don't seem quite as healthy while at the same time we have some slowing international markets Europe in particular. Al Mistysyn : Sure Truman. Yes, I'll parse that out maybe in a couple of different pieces, maybe I'll start with the TiO2 piece. I mean what we're seeing the industry pricing for high-grade chloride TiO2 has been pretty stable over the past year and we're not seeing anything necessarily overly favorable or unfavorable that's going to change that in the fourth quarter. I think it's one of the earlier questions that we will talk about our view on TiO2 for next year when we give our outlook in 2020. I think on the petrochemical side of the basket, that's where we're seeing some of the benefit right now in certain parts of the basket. Again we don't sell propylene or ethylene directly. Those are key parts of what we make and there's other market dynamics there as well but I think that if things were to stay flat where they are right now heading into 2020, we did say that the first quarter of 2019 was the highest inflation that we had this year. So, the things will stay flat from here. It's probably reasonable to think that 2020 could -- we could see some tailwind there. But beyond that, pretty hard to tell what's going to happen. Truman Patterson : Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And I just want to dig in to your gross margin a little bit more. Nice performance up over 300 bps or so. Is there any way you all could just rank order the buckets -- the major buckets of what's really driving this pricing, raw material, volume, leverage, synergies, et cetera? And then piggybacking off of the prior question. Going forward is there anything near term why we wouldn't expect this to reoccur over the next quarter or two quarters? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Truman. I will start with volume and especially when it's our North America Paint Stores volume. That's always going to be the best leverage we have. It is our highest margin business and it grows fast than company and such a -- it's our growth engine. It's such a big portion of our business that drives our margin. We did have the year-over-year comparison with the run-up in raw materials that we saw in the second and third quarters of last year. So, probably a little easier comp than what you'll see going forward. We did have synergies in the quarter and we did have the benefit of the year-over-year supply chain improvement. So, with moderating raw material cost as we talked about the teams have done a nice job with pricing discipline. But again there's more to go there. We have been chasing that significant increase in raw materials the past three years now. And year-to-date our operating -- our gross margin adjusted is 44.7% proper. So, we feel good about the progress we're making, but we got a ways to go to get to the long-term target or 45% to 48%. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thanks guys. Al Mistysyn : Thanks Truman. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort : Thanks guys. Appreciate your patience. Two quick ones if I could about North American architectural. First I'm wondering if you've seen the interest rate reductions. We've seen some of your customers in the housing new residential housing market certainly seeing their stock prices catapult higher. Are you starting to see some visibility there from order trends that gives you some confidence there's going to be some improvement in that market? John Morikis : Yes. What I would say, our third quarter, we felt good about the third quarter. It was up mid-single digits in our new res space. If you look at some of the reports that are out there, Bob, homebuilder confidence is at the highest level in about two years right now and mortgage rates are certainly helping drive that, the solid job growth. There's lower new home inventory out there. If you look, kind of, at the second half of 2019, it's been pretty steady gains in the single-family construction. It's regularly that we always talk about, though that\u2019s on the other side. The higher cost for land, labor, materials and the regulatory piece too. So those are some of the headwinds. But I'd say, overall, what our customers are telling us, we feel pretty good about. The most recent data talks about is a little bit mixed, single-family permits and starts were positive sequentially and year-to-year. Multifamily was a little bit more mixed. So, overall, though I think we feel pretty good about what our new res is heading right now. Bob Koort : And as you maybe staying in that vein and looking at some of these indicators. I noticed the Harvard LIRA numbers look awfully darn ominous for next year and certainly contradicted by your results in the stores group. Do you have any sense of what might be driving that or any news on the correlation of sort of their perspective forecast versus your business, to give us some comfort that maybe it's not as dire as they're suggesting? Al Mistysyn : Yes. I would say, there's a number of things we look at there, Bob. So LIRA, the leading indicator of remodeling activity, certainly they are forecasting sort of a modest decline in the back half of next year. But what I'd remind you is they measure that in dollars. And so, a lot of it is driven by big ticket, big remodeling projects. Some of the smaller projects like a painting of your kitchen or a painting of a bathroom; those tend to hold up maybe a little bit better in an environment like that. I'd say existing home sales are another driver. Those have been pretty choppy over the last year. Today, there was some new data out that said they were down sequentially, but that followed two months where they were up. Year-over-year, existing home sales are still up low single-digit, so that will be a driver. And I think when you look at all of that, you look at the aging housing stock that's out there, home value appreciation is still continuing, the employment backdrop is good. And to John's earlier point about share of wallet and new account activation, I think, we still feel pretty good about the repaint opportunity for us. Bob Koort : Great. Thanks for the help. Al Mistysyn : You bet. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question. John Morikis : Good morning, Dmitry. Good afternoon. Operator : Dmitry, your line is live. You maybe on mute. Dmitry Silversteyn : Good morning or good afternoon. Thank you for being patient and taking my call. Really quick. On the DIY or hardware, I guess on the consumer side of your business, was the price realization in North America similar to sort of the 2.5% level that you saw in your company-owned stores? And what was the pricing like in Australia and China and Europe for you in that business? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Dmitry, I'd say, it was a little bit less than what you would see in the stores. I would say, Dmitry, outside the U.S. in those smaller consumer segments it's not material. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. So most of it \u2013 okay, so less than 2.5% for the division overall. But if the international was flattish, let's say, then domestic was less than 2.5%, is what you're telling me? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Dmitry Silversteyn : International was flat, right? Okay. Got you. And then secondly, just to follow-up on the strength that you guys are seeing in coil. I know, business has changed a lot, especially since you guys bought it from Valspar -- when you bought Valspar. But historically, it's been a business with the large North American exposure to the commercial construction market. So is there anything that we can sort of extrapolate from your strength in that business to what it implies about the commercial construction market in North America? Or were the share gains really the main driver more so than the market performance? John Morikis : I would say, it's a little bit of both, Dmitry. There clearly were some share gains and we also are the benefactor of some of the Commercial business. I'd also mention that we -- as I mentioned earlier, we did experience some pressure on the ag side that drew that back down a little bit. But you're right. We benefited from some of the commercial. We grew share and we continued to -- we're determined to continue to drive it. Dmitry Silversteyn : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you very much for taking my call. John Morikis : Thank you. Thank you, Dmitry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and I will \u2013 my thanks as well for hanging in there. I was wondering if you could -- if you have a better idea as to the sales synergy you are anticipating? I think that you did not really give us any specific numbers when you bought Valspar and we're waiting to see how this was going to unfold. Do you have a better feel as to how much growth we could see from that? John Morikis : We do, but we're not going to share it today. We feel good about it Rosemarie. There are a lot of efforts and a lot of projects that have been identified that we feel really comfortable about pursuing, but those are going to be things we think we're going to talk about as we are implementing them not before. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. That's fair enough. Looking at packaging, there is -- I'm assuming that at this point most of the non-BPA coatings has been replaced so to speak or rather the BPA has been replaced. So what kind of growth rate are you looking at going forward? And it's a fact that some beverage companies are going from plastic or at least they are saying they will going from plastic containers to aluminum cans. Is that going to help? John Morikis : It is going to help, but again, I might take just a bit of exception to your assumption that we have moved through the non-BPA to -- or the BPA to non-BPA. There's quite a bit of road ahead there. I'd say we're in the very early innings of that conversion. So we're excited about this opportunity going forward as there -- there's a lot of runway ahead in that conversion. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. That's good to hear. And then lastly if I may on the automotive. Is that mostly refinish? And can you talk about the trends there? John Morikis : It's all refinish and the trend for us particularly in North America, we're gaining some traction. Over the last couple quarters, we've spoken about the fact that the combined technologies the legacy Valspar and Sherwin technologies coming together provide an overall better system with greater speed for the VR shops to push vehicles through with greater efficiency. And we're out demonstrating that to customers right now with some very good traction, so we feel really good about the team's efforts there and we have some expectations for them as we go forward. Rosemarie Morbelli : Are you seeing this new technology and share gain offsetting or more than offsetting the decline in the level of collisions? John Morikis : Yeah. That's a good point, because if you do look at the overall market, it was a relatively flat market due to the decline in collisions. So it's a very good observation on your part. That's what leads us to believe that the low single-digit gain that we achieved here in North America gives us some modest share gain. Rosemarie Morbelli : All right. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thank you. Jim Jaye : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Perrella : Good afternoon everybody. Two quick ones. You touched on it for the Americas, but for Performance Coatings and for the Consumer segment, what is your visibility into your order book? How far out can you see into your customers' order patterns? John Morikis : Well, it varies by segment. We take great pride in that Chris. When you talk about as we do solution selling and consultative selling, it really takes a very good understanding of what your customers are trying to accomplish, so that you can be there one they need you if it's with product or service. Again, varying degrees. So when you look at a VR shops, vision might be a little bit shorter. And if you look at Protective & Marine as an example, where their pricing and coating projects that could be out a year in advance, I mean, there's a wide spectrum of projects. When you look at various OEM customers, I mean, there's -- depending on the industry varying degrees of line of sight. I think the point there -- the important point is though that we work closely with our customers to understand that. We want to be the ones that are helping them avoid excess inventory, avoid obsolescence, avoid having products that can be the wrong product and you do that by getting close to their needs and understanding what they're working on. So we've got a pretty good line of sight in most of the segments we're always working to make that better. Christopher Perrella : All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time. John Morikis : Thank you. Jim Jaye : Thank you Chris Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys, sorry to interrupt your lunch break. But just sort of going back to share gain question for the Stores Group. John just from a high level standpoint. Is this what you would consider to be a normal evolution given where we are on price cuts for the industry you being market leader, having led the industry with price increases initially and perhaps willing to eat some share as consequence and now you're reverting on share? Or is it broader than that? John Morikis : I'd say our approach Ghansham is pretty consistent. I know you've been following us for some time. Our view -- and I'll touch on this a bit earlier as it relates to the price cost. Our first effort is always to try to offset not just in our stores business, but in all our businesses try to drive efficiency into the equation to offset the raw material costs. We don't feel as though that that's a share question, because it -- when we don't have to go out with the price increase, our customers reward us with their loyalty, but the simple fact that we're open and honest with them about what's happening. That said, as cost go up and I use cost not to just point to raw material cost, but if it's labor or freight or others that we are unable to offset then we're in front of our customers talking about that. The key part of the equation there is we're helping them to be successful. And so as we're having these discussions and helping them to be successful, we're then reducing whatever it is that we're facing. Hopefully, we're able to offset raw material cost with efficiencies, but if the costs are going up we have to be open with them and we have those discussions. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. That's helpful. And then just finally your 2020 financial targets were pushed up by roughly a year of increase in material cost, and I think FX as well. Just given the obvious momentum you're now seeing in Stores Group, which is a very profitable segment for you how does that timeline change at this point? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Ghansham, it's still looking a couple of years out. We're in the middle of putting together our 2020 plans. Obviously, we'll share those with you at our year end call. I mean, you look at some of those metrics and we're making progress whether it's on EBITDA with an 80 basis point growth year-to-date with net operating cash over 12% of sales. So we're making progress on different fronts. The factor there with raw material cost and it's also top-line growth. And if you go back two years, I think, we were expecting a little bit better top-line growth than what we're seeing across the different segments. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Thanks so much, Al. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Hocevar : Hello. John Morikis : Good afternoon, Kevin. Kevin Hocevar : You're guiding to mid to high single-digit same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter in your Paint Stores. It sounds like most of that will come from volume. How big of a factor can weather play here and where that ultimately shakes out? Because it sounds like the backlogs are there, but obviously weather starts to get a little funky here as we head into the winter. So if the winter turns out to be harsh do your customers have enough flexibility to do indoor jobs on bad weather days and outdoor jobs on sunny days? Or does a harsh winter make it difficult to hit that type of growth? John Morikis : Well, Kevin there's a number of points to that. And the first I might say is it's a smaller quarter. So it can be influenced a bit easier than the larger third \u2013 the second and third quarter. And often times what it might impact is the progress on a project. So yes, if it's nicer weather they might be outdoor painting -- there might be outdoor painting taking place, there might be issues if it's really a harsh winter as we saw last year with all trades and their ability to get on the project and move a project through the cycle. So it's all dependent upon what kind of weather and to what extent we deal with it and we really don't know. I mean each one of these can be different and unique in their own and we're going to just respond the best way we know given whatever we face. Kevin Hocevar : Okay. Great. And then in the Performance Coatings, you talked about your team being focused on controlling selling expenses given the softer end market. Could you elaborate on that? And what levers are you pulling there to dial back cost there. And if things get worse -- deteriorate from here are there more levers that can be pulled? Al Mistysyn : Kevin, this is Al. Yes, there's always more levers to be pulled. I mean -- and we try to -- as I say we're controlling our cost. Industrial wood is an example where as John talked about it's been soft and we think it'll be soft going forward. But there's other areas that we're still investing in for growth opportunities. So I think the teams have responded to the slower sales and we'll continue to manage that. Kevin Hocevar : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Jaye for any additional concluding comments. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Jessie and thanks everybody for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your interest in everything we're doing and your support. I will be around and Eric Swanson will be around for your questions over the remainder of the week and we look forward to talking with you. Thanks so much. Have a great afternoon and rest of your week. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

For the year, interest expense decreased $17.4 million to $349.3 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower year-over-year debt levels. As described in our press release, we recognized non-cash pre-tax impairment charges in the quarter totaling $122.1 million related to recently acquired trademarks. Additionally, the company recognized pre-tax gains in other income and interest income of $34 million and $19 million respectively related to a Brazil indirect tax matter. Consolidated profit before tax in the fourth quarter increased $195.4 million to $297.4 million. This includes $71.3 million of other adjustments and $119.3 million of acquisition-related costs. Fourth quarter of 2018 includes $173.2 million of other adjustments and $137.5 million of acquisition-related costs.

This includes $69 million of other adjustments and $389.3 million of acquisition-related costs. 2018 includes $341.5 million of other adjustments and $484.4 million of acquisition-related costs. We have summarized fourth quarter and full year adjustments to consolidated and segment profit in a slide deck on our website under January 30th, 2019 year-end and fourth quarter financial results. Currency translation rate changes decreased consolidated profit before tax by $22 million in the year. Excluding acquisition-related costs and other adjustments, our effective tax rate on adjusted income for the quarter was 18.1% and 19.1% for the full year. Diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to $2.66 per share from $1.07 per share. The fourth quarter of 2019 includes per share charges of $0.97 for acquisition-related costs and other adjustments totaling $0.64 per share. The fourth quarter of 2018 includes charges of $1.10 per share for acquisition-related costs and other adjustments totaling $1.37 per share. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20.6% to $4.27 from $3.54. Diluted net income per share for the full year increased to $16.49 per share from $11.67 per share. Full year 2019 diluted net income per share includes acquisition-related costs of $3.21 per share and other adjustments totaling $1.42 per share. Full year 2018 diluted net income per share includes acquisition-related costs of $4.15 per share and other adjustments totaling $2.71 per share. Excluding these items, full year adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $21.12 from $18.53. We have summarized fourth quarter and full year comparisons including the acquisition costs and other adjustments in a Regulation G reconciliation table in our fourth quarter 2019 press release. Let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment. Sales for the Americas group in the fourth quarter increased $108.8 million or 4.8% to $2.36 billion. For the year, net sales increased $546.8 million or 5.7% to $10.17 billion. Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months increased 4.6% in the quarter and 5.3% in the year. Regionally, in the fourth quarter our Southeast division led all divisions followed by Southwest, Canada, Midwest, and Eastern. Sales were positive in every division in the quarter. Fourth quarter segment profit increased $36.1 million or 8.7% to $449.4 million. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit $4 million in the quarter. Full year segment profit increased $158.1 million or 8.3% to $2.1 billion. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit by $15.5 million in the year. Fourth quarter segment margin increased 70 basis points to 19%. Full year segment margin increased 50 basis points to 20.2%. Turning now to the Consumer Brands Group. Fourth quarter sales increased $5 million or 0.9% to $539.4 million. Full year sales decreased $62.3 million or 2.3% to $2.68 billion.

Excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the trademark impairment charge, fourth quarter segment margin increased to 10.8% from 6.8%. Full year Consumer Group segment margin increased to 13.9% from 9.5%. Excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the trademark impairment charge, full year segment margin increased to 17.5% from 13.6%. For our Performance Coatings group, fourth quarter sales decreased $63.5 million or 5% to $1.21 billion. Full year sales decreased $117.2 million or 2.3% to $5 billion. Currency translation rate changes reduced fourth quarter and full year sales by 1.1% and 2.3% respectively. Fourth quarter segment profit was negative $7.4 million including a charge of $117 million related to trademark impairment, compared to segment profit of $112.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Currency translation rate changes increased segment profit by $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Acquisition-related amortization expense decreased fourth quarter segment profit by $53.1 million in 2019, compared to $55.2 million in 2018. Full year segment profit was $379.1 million, including a charge of $117 million related to trademark impairment, compared to full year segment profit of $452.1 million in 2018. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit by $7.1 million in the year. Acquisition-related amortization expense decreased full year segment profit by $215.5 million in 2019, compared to $215.8 million in 2018. Fourth quarter Performance Coating Group segment margin was negative 0.6% or 9% excluding the $117 million trademark impairment charge compared to 8.7% last year. Excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the trademark impairment charge, fourth quarter segment margin increased to 13.4% from 13.1%. Full year segment margin was 7.5% or 9.8% excluding the trademark impairment charge compared to 8.8% last year. Excluding acquisition-related amortization expense and the trademark impairment charge, full year segment margin increased to 14.1% from 12.9%. That concludes our review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and the full year. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis who will make some general comments and provide our outlook for fiscal year 2020. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to make just a few additional comments on our fourth quarter and full year 2019 before moving on to our outlook for 2020. We ended the year on a strong note, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 21% compared to last year's fourth quarter. In terms of the full year, we delivered another year of excellent results for our shareholders. Sales grew by 2.1% to a record $17.9 billion. Adjusted gross margin improved to 45.1%, reflecting our pricing efforts and moderation of raw material inflation. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14% to a record $21.12 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $235 million to a record $3.1 billion or 17.1% of sales. Net operating cash increased $378 million to a record $2.32 billion or 13% of sales. Return on net assets employed increased to 15.1% on core profit before tax. Total shareholder return for the year was 49.7% and we returned approximately $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, an increase of 28% over the prior year. We reduced our debt by $660 million and we ended the year with net debt-to-EBITDA below three times. Before moving on to my comments on our segments, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the integration of Valspar. While there's still much to be accomplished particularly outside the U.S., I wanted to thank our teams for their tremendous hard work to date in bringing our two businesses together and for increasing the value we are and will be able to deliver to our customers and to our shareholders. Since the beginning of 2017, Sherwin-Williams has generated $6.1 billion in net operating cash or 12.2% of sales. We've used that cash to invest approximately $800 million back into the business, reduced debt by nearly $3 billion and returned approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders including $1.1 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in share buybacks. We will no longer be calling out synergies related to the Valspar acquisition as it becomes more difficult to distinguish between acquisition synergies and our ongoing continuous improvements initiatives. We exit 2019 having a benefit of about $315 million from synergies in the P&L including about $75 million that was realized in 2019. We've identified approximately another $100 million in opportunity, largely related to our supply chain optimization efforts in Europe and Asia. As previously communicated, we expect to realize a small portion of this benefit in 2020 with the majority being realized in 2021 and 2022 as projects are completed. Let me now turn to just a few comments on our operating segments, all of which contributed to our record performance in 2019. Within the Americas Group, full year sales increased 5.7% against the prior year comparison of 5.6%. Residential Repaint remained our strongest customer segment, up by double-digit percentage year-over-year. This is the sixth year in a row we've grown Residential Repaint at a double-digit level. All other segments grew in the mid-single-digit range for the year. Full year segment profit dollars and margin also improved year-over-year. We continue to invest in innovation and service introducing 27 new products, our ninth consecutive year of double-digit product introductions. We opened 94 new paint stores in the Americas Group this year and closed 32. To be clear, we opened 84 net new stores and added 150 new sales territories in the U.S. and Canada. Of the 32 stores we closed, 26 were in Latin America and were related to changing market dynamics. In the Consumer segment, we generated growth with our largest retail partners in North America though full year segment sales decreased due to lower than expected sales in Asia and Australia and the impact of the Guardsman divestiture. Adjusted segment margin improved to 17.5%, driven by synergies, operating efficiencies, pricing, moderating raw material costs and lower acquisition-related amortization expense. Performance Coatings Group sales for the year were variable by geography and end market and were impacted by unfavorable currency translation rate changes. Growth in North America and Latin America was more than offset by softness in Europe and Asia. Mid single-digit growth in our packaging and coil lines was offset by softness in other product lines, most notably industrial wood. Adjusted segment margin increased to 14.1% from 12.9% in the prior year. Pricing, synergies and good cost control drove the improvement. Turning to our 2020 outlook, we currently see a similar environment to last year with North America architectural demand remaining solid and industrial demand remaining variable by geography and end market. We have many opportunities to grow share in all of our businesses and I remain highly confident in our ability to provide customers with solutions, based on innovation, value-added service and differentiated distribution. We enter 2020 well positioned and focused on what we can control. For the first quarter of 2020, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by 2% to 5% compared to the first quarter of 2019. We expect the Americas Group to be at or above the high end of that range. We expect Consumer Brands to be flat or slightly up excluding the impact of the Ace business, we exited in 2019 and we expect Performance Coatings to be up by low single digits. For the full year 2020, we expect net sales to increase by 2% to 4%, with segment performance similar to what I described for the first quarter. On an earnings per share basis, we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude Valspar acquisition costs and onetime items. On this basis and given our sales outlook, we expect adjusted 2020 full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $22.70 to $23.50 per share, an increase of approximately 9.4% at the midpoint compared to the $21.12 reported in 2019 on a comparable basis. This adjusted 2020 guidance excludes approximately $2.79 per share for acquisition-related expense. The Regulation G reconciliation table in our press release illustrates these moving parts. We expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. One key assumption embedded in our outlook is that the market rate of inflation for our raw materials basket in 2020 will be flat compared to 2019, assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions. We expect the basket to be lower year-over-year in the first quarter and to a lesser extent in the second quarter with year-over-year costs, flattening out or slightly increasing in the back half of the year. A few additional data points may be helpful for modeling purposes. We'll continue to make investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. These investments include new stores and reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems and product innovation in both our architectural and industrial businesses. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel. These investments are embedded in our full year guidance. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $320 million, which is about 1.7% of anticipated sales. Note that this estimate does not include any expenditure related to our previously announced headquarters and R&D center project. We expect to provide you with an update on this project in the near future. Depreciation should be $275 million and amortization will be about $310 million. Historically, we have targeted dividends of about 30% of prior year GAAP earnings. Next month, at our Board of Directors' meetings, we'll recommend a quarterly dividend increase of 18.6% to $1.34 per share, up from $1.13 last year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. Before moving on to your questions, let me wrap up today by asking you to save the date of Wednesday, June 3 on your calendars. That will be the day we'll host our annual financial community presentation at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York. The program will include presentations by several members of our leadership team. We'll host our customary Q&A session followed by a reception and lunch. Again, that date is Wednesday, June 3rd. We'll be sending out invitations and related information and a link to our registration site in April. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. Can you just talk a little bit more about your expectations for U.S. housing and the consequence of architectural volumes outlook just given some more constructive data? Just in terms of what you're hearing from the Americas Group heads and their customers, do you expect broader volume participation this year? Or just what are the key puts and takes? Thank you. Jim Jaye : Sure, Chris. Good morning. It's Jim. What we always talk about when we have this question is we look at our sentiment from our 4,500 store managers and our 3,000 sales reps and they continue to be very optimistic about what they're seeing as we end the year and as we head into 2020. As we've talked about this in the past from a big picture perspective, certainly we believe that the continuing household formations in that 1.3 million range annually will support what's going on as we go forward. But as you point out Chris, the more recent data is encouraging. We're seeing strengthening in single and multifamily permits starts and completions at the year-end. And really the three-month trailing average for all of those was up double-digits. We were at the builder show that just happened. And I would tell you optimism at that builder show among our customers was very positive. And you have other things out there that are supportive as well. The mortgage rate remains very reasonable and some of the recent reports by some of the national homebuilders are also talking about strong orders. So I think we feel very good about where housing is headed from a macro perspective. Al Mistysyn : Hey, Chris, this is Al. I'd just like to add on to that comment by saying as you look at how our North America paint stores group unfolded throughout the year, our second half was stronger than our first half. And even as you look at what TAG performed we're at 4.8% you look at our same-store sales up 4.6%. To put that in perspective, architectural gallons were high single-digits in the quarter because as you -- as a reminder, we did not go out with price in our fourth quarter. And historically, as we've seen momentum in our second half and in our fourth quarter that translates to growth in our first half. So that's what makes us feel pretty good about the paint stores in architectural in North America. Christopher Parkinson : Great. And just a quick follow-up. You previously discussed potentially getting your margins in consumer performance back up to -- towards let's say 20% was targeted. But can you just simply update us on your conviction and your ability to do this? And just also highlight to the investment community any key non-raw material levers you can continue to pull to potentially make this happen in each segment? Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Chris. We're not coming off our numbers. I am confident in our ability to hit those financial targets we laid out for 2020. As I talked about on the June Investor Day, I confirm that we'll hit those targets but on a lag. And I think throughout 2019, we made significant progress and are on the right path to attaining those goals. And we've even attained some of those goals already. If you look at our core gross margin at 45.1% for the year, it's at the low-end of the targeted range that I had laid out at 45% to 48%. And you look at our strong net operating cash. And if I looked at net operating cash at 13% less CapEx, you get a little over 11% net operating cash less CapEx which is the target that we have laid out. So I am very confident in our ability on Performance Coatings and Consumer Brands to expand their margins to that mid- to high-teens low-20s and they made good progress this year. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Byrne : Hey. Al, you just mentioned that the same-store sales metric in the fourth quarter was mostly volume in TAG just because you lapped the year-ago price. And Jim you mentioned the strongest region was the southeast where in October they were really underwater in that region. So can you just comment on where you think backlog is in architectural paint contractors? And where do you think this could drive same-store sales in 2020? John Morikis : Well, Steve I think we're feeling really good about the market and the feedback that we're getting from our customers. As you've just mentioned there is a backlog. Part of it I think has to do with labor. We continue to believe that backlog if you will in labor supports our model and helps build loyalty to what it is that we're trying to do for our customers which is driving the technology and services that help them to be more successful. And we've got a lot of new products that we're launching going into this year a lot of services that we're introducing all directly pointed at trying to help those customers to attack those. So to your question we think geographically it's pretty solid. There's no pockets that I've been in yet or -- nor that we've heard from our teams where people are feeling softness. There's a general consensus that contractors are feeling very good could do more if they had more labor. And we want to be there to help support them accomplish their goals. Stephen Byrne : And John did you anticipate that changing some of the acquired brands to the Sherwin brand would impact the outlook for sales for those products? John Morikis : Yes. I'd like Al to talk to it from a financial perspective but absolutely. In fact I would say we're feeling really good about the fact that we've gotten here as fast as we have. As we entered into the integration, we're always listening to our customers and always listening to our employees and the fact that our customers the retention of both our customers and our employees is so high in allowing us to move aggressively in this brand consolidation gives us really a great sense of pride of the speed and execution that we're moving in. Al Mistysyn : Yes and Steve, I would just add this is not indicative of the underlying businesses. If you look at healthy businesses operating margins are expanding and we saw that in Consumer Brands and in our Performance Coatings Groups this year. And as John talked about in his opening remarks I mean we generated strong cash flow over the period end of 2017 through 2019. And we'll continue to do that. We saw strong cash flow in 2019. So as a reminder we looked at this Valspar acquisition over the long term. It's hard when you're going into an acquisition to predict timing of when certain events happen. But as John said improving our operating efficiencies by consolidating brands that's only going to help us going forward. Stephen Byrne : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Can you talk about business conditions in China and in Europe? And maybe your offshore operations generally in 2019 how much did they grow in revenue terms? Or how much did they shrink? And whether business conditions in China in the first quarter of 2020 are very different than what they were in the fourth quarter of 2019? John Morikis : Right. Well I think specifically to China, I'd say that the environment that we find ourselves in some of our business has been a challenge. If you look at our industrial wood for example with the tariffs and generally a weaker economy it's had an impact on our business. We've had pockets of strength in Southeast Asia particularly in the cabinets area wood. So I'd say from a wood perspective it's been the most challenging. That said, if you look at our packaging business as an example we had a terrific run there in Asia actually across the globe in packaging. Our coil business in Asia was positive. We had some pressure in our general industrial business there. Our automotive business is pretty small Jeff in Asia, but it was positive. So I'd say a mixed bag there. Clearly some pressure, but our market share there is such that it gives us terrific opportunity for growth and that's where we're headed. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And then just a small question. You talked about most of the growth in the stores business in the fourth quarter coming from volume. But in previous quarters, it seemed that price was a larger element. Did you simply annualize your price increases or was there some competitive activity that led to a lower price benefit? Or was there a mix effect? Why was price a smaller component in the fourth quarter? John Morikis : Yes. There was virtually no price in the quarter and it was because last year 2018, the price increase went in the 1st of October Jeff. In this year, we rolled it in January 1. So, the fourth quarter was exposed from a pricings perspective. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much. John Morikis : And I'd just point out as Al mentioned, so when we look at the architectural gallons in that fourth quarter up the high single-digits, it was a really good quarter for our team in our TAG business. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys. Good morning. John Morikis : Good morning. Ghansham Panjabi : Can you help us with the margins on the Americas Group segment? Did that play out the way you thought it would during the fourth quarter? During the third quarter, you had a nice year-over-year acceleration in margins. I think it was up 120 basis points, 4Q was closer to 70 basis points and that was also in a very healthy increase in sales. What were the offsets there? Al Mistysyn : Yes. So Ghansham the way I look at -- I start with the flow-through. When you look at flow through in TAG in the fourth quarter and it was over 33%, so we saw nice leverage on our gallon increased. As John talked about in his opening remarks about investments and additional opportunities and we have taken a long-term strategic view of the market. And aside from just new stores and new reps that we talked about John talked about expanding our digital platform that I think -- and we believe will give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. And we're expanding and investing in that tool to get better aligned with our customer to offer better services to make them more efficient. Ultimately, as we've talked about we want to drive higher topline growth for them and profitability. So, we started that really coming in third quarter and fourth quarter and you'll see us continue investing at the next year. John Morikis : Yes. Ghansham I think when we were together actually we talked a little bit about some of the investments we were making on that digital. And we're really proud to be announcing that we'll be rolling this out nationally at the end of the first quarter. We think this is the start of a -- we have a number of products in the pipeline here, but the start of a process that we've been really investing in. And to Al's point we're cranking that up. And the idea here is increasing that loyalty and the contractors leaning on us to be more efficient in what it is that they're trying to do. We talked early about labor. And this -- the launch of this digital platform will help them run a more efficient business. It's not just external though. We're also investing internally. We didn't talk about this last year. We've made it through one year now with our sales reps now having had iPads for one year. We think that's improving the productivity of our sales organization to be more responsive to our customers. This year we've just announced to our team we're rolling out iPads into our stores to make them more productive and more efficient and more responsive to the needs of our customers. So, we are investing. We're investing in this business. We have great confidence of our position right now. And quite frankly, we see some competitive opportunities that we want to take advantage of. So, we're putting our foot on the gas here. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Thanks for clarifying. And then just for my second question on the Performance Coatings segment. Even with the industrial markets having been weaker for everybody including you, the margins were still up year-over-year. Was there any residual price catch up or any significant mix benefit from businesses like packaging that drove the margin expansion apart from just synergy flow through? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Ghansham that's a very astute point. As packaging and coil sales have expanded faster than the rest of the businesses, we did see some lift in the margin on that. Yes, as we've talked about in the past, our industrial business took the brunt of the run-up in raw materials in 2017 and 2018. We've been chasing that for the last few years. It doesn't come in uniformly like our paint stores group. So, yeah we saw some pricing flow through in our fourth quarter. And then the other thing I would say is, as we are investing in growth opportunities we are also laser-focused on controlling and managing our costs where our businesses and/or regions aren't performing to where you expect them to perform or seeing a path to a set target. So, we're controlling our costs and consolidating operations as well. So you can expect that to continue as we go forward as we continue to invest in other areas. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. Thanks so much. Al Mistysyn : Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you, Ghan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to -- in the release you had laid out some acquisition-related costs still in 2020 kind of to the tune of what looks to be $300 million to $350 million or so. I guess what is that still being spent on? And I guess how much of it is -- how much should we be thinking about as actually a cash hit? And then I guess tied to that how are you thinking about cash conversion as we look to 2020, because it obviously took a big step-up in 2019, but curious how or where we go from here. Al Mistysyn : Yes John. I'm glad you brought that up, because it's important that for an apples-to-apples comparison we wanted to call out acquisition-related costs. And the amortization depreciation year-over-year is very similar, embedded in that number is about $30 million in additional integration costs. And we wanted to include that in our guidance in the Reg G table, but we're not going to be laying that out going forward. That breaks out just so for modeling purposes a little more back half versus front half loaded. But this gets us in the next phase. Like John talked about synergies is part of our continuous improvement process. We're going to get back to integration activities it's just part of our normal operating process. As far as cash flow, John you've followed us for a very long time. 13%, that's always the new high watermark. And as I talked about in our Investor Day and earlier, net operating cash less CapEx we're targeting 11% and we expect to continue to hit that target as we go forward. John McNulty : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. With regard to the pipeline that you're seeing from your customers, it sounds like the residential side is pretty solid. Can you speak to the non-resi side and what you're seeing there? John Morikis : Yeah, it's very good. If you look at the commercial side property management, I'd say John, trying not to get ahead of myself here but we're feeling really good. I was just -- came back from our national sales meeting. We had 8,500 of our closest friends together talking about just that, and very bullish environment very positive. And if you go from the commercial to property management into health care, I mean there's a general feeling that our customers are really excited about what's ahead for 2020. So, we're really looking forward to this year. John McNulty : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. John Morikis : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning. Just curious on the paint store side, was there any change in the quarter? I know that you put up an 8 comp in Q3 and that would imply like a 6 volume and you did a 5.3 here. So it doesn't appear that way. I'm just curious if you noticed an improvement in Q4 or a deceleration. And do you expect kind of similar kind of mid- single-digit volume growth in 2020? Thanks. John Morikis : Yeah, Arun, I'd say the largest impact that we had was our Protective & Marine business that runs through our TAG business. The Architectural business as we mentioned was up high-single-digits. We talked about the fact that we've had another double-digit increase in Residential Repaint, and just talked about some of the other segments and the confidence that we have there. If you look at those indicators that we often cite spray equipment, non-paint items, everything points in the right direction. So, high-single-digit architectural gallons going through impacted by the P&M business. And the P&M business through our stores was largely impacted by oil and gas which was under pressure. And we had some timing of some big projects likely not going to be starting out until the beginning of the second quarter. So we saw a little bit of softness in P&M in the fourth quarter, probably going to see a little bit in the first quarter. But again the pipeline that we're looking at here is really solid. Al Mistysyn : Yes. And Arun I would just add to that. The price increase that we went out with in our North America stores on January 1 was 3% to 4%. We expect an effective rate of just below 2%. And as John laid out in the opening remarks we expect paints \u2013 our TAG organization to be at the high end of our 2% to 4%. So you think 4% to 6%. If there's less than 2% in price the rest is volume. Arun Viswanathan : Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for that. And then just as a quick follow-up on PCG, obviously there's macro pressures and regional variability as you said. Do you think that is kind of tilted to the downside just given the coronavirus? Or maybe you can just offer your thoughts on where we are potentially destocking wise or \u2013 especially in Europe and Asia is there any potential for stability there as we move through 2020? Thanks. John Morikis : Yes I think we look at the comparisons of 2019 to 2020 and we have higher expectations moving forward. It might be helpful. Or maybe I could just talk about each of the segments just briefly. If we look at our auto and maybe I'll just do it for a number of the regions rather than just the two because I'm sure there's some more questions there. On auto we'd say, North America we feel really good. Probably the best I felt in the time I've been CEO or COO. Collision shop business here is very strong. I think we're in a really strong position and we're going to take advantage of that going forward. Europe, I'd say we had a little bit of softness in our auto business in Europe. Asia, as I mentioned earlier, it's a small business up, mid-single digits. In Latin America, we have a leadership position. It was impacted primarily by currency. We had a good quarter in auto in Latin America. Packaging, clearly the non-BPA is giving us a terrific opportunity. We believe that's an ongoing transition with plenty of opportunity for us ahead. And so we're investing in this business. We're investing in technology and in capacity and really trying to stay aligned with our customers. We've got great partners that we're trying to support. And if you look at this \u2013 this was a double-digit quarter for them. North America was strong double-digits. To your question about Europe and Asia, Europe was up but Asia was up really, really strong double-digits. And there our business in packaging is growing both in beverage and in food. In coil, new business wins really across the region, North America throughout everyone. We did have a little bit of softness in comparison in Europe. But this is a team that's really hitting on all cylinders and we're working hard. So those are the ones that are really performing quite well. GI, Asia we felt some impact there in our general industrial, largely in the heavy equipment and ag equipment. But we have a good pipeline of projects and good \u2013 really good people there. We expect to really see some improvement in our performance in this business. Industrial wood I talked about earlier. China a lot of pressure. Feeling good about Southeast Asia. Europe was another area of pressure as well. So amongst all the businesses I would say, the one we're feeling the most pressure in would be the industrial wood. And then Protective & Marine, I talked about largely running through our North American business through our TAG. But if I look at our smaller businesses albeit Asia is a very small business, it was up strong double-digits for us. Europe, down slightly as we had some pressure and some comparisons to some business there. Latin America was up slightly as well. So that kind of captures all the regions all the businesses, Arun. Hopefully, satisfied some other questions with that response. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Great, thanks. Thanks, Al. Al Mistysyn : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit further on capital deployment. You've made some nice progress again on the balance sheet. John just wondering if you would foresee any material change in the balance of acquisition activity versus repurchases as you look ahead into 2020? John Morikis : I think, the M&A, activity is something that we're really focused on. We think it's an important part of our future, although, we don't feel as though we have a gun to our head. We've got -- the challenge for us right now, quite frankly, internally is prioritization of the opportunities. So, we're very active. And I would say to answer your question you should see us deploying more cash into M&A. I don't think you're going to see the transformational type of acquisition that Valspar was. But we're working business-by-business, to understand region-by-region, where it is there are opportunities. I want to clearly point out that we are not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere. We are absolutely determined to invest where we can return -- generate a return of share for our shareholders. And each of our businesses are developed a really good strategy that they're executing. And any of those M&A, opportunities include the right to win in those markets. So we're not going to be there. We're not deploying cash in commodity areas. And we're not deploying cash for the sake of saying that we can be somewhere. We're there to make money. Kevin McCarthy : Understood, that's helpful. My second question relates to raw materials. It sounds like you anticipate some relief to start the year, just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as to the individual categories like, pigment and petrochemicals et cetera. And then with regard to resins in particular, just wondering if you could comment on, your degree of internal integration versus external, purchases of resins and how that's evolved in recent years if it has. Thank you. Jim Jaye : Sure. Sure, Kevin. Glad to answer that. As John said in his comments and you're right, our outlook for this year is that the overall basket will be flat compared to 2019. And that's assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks, no supply disruptions. It will be lower year-over-year in the first quarter. It will be a lesser extent in the second quarter. And then, sort of flatten out and maybe increase in the back half. If you remember, we had our highest rate of inflation in 2019 it was in the first quarter, which moderated through the year. So, our full year outlook that's our best estimate at this time, the visibility once you get a couple of quarters out is a little bit murkier. When you get to the specific categories Kevin, we expect the petrochemical basket to be in line with our overall raw material outlook, probably a tailwind in the first quarter, maybe into the second quarter, before flattening and again increasing in the back half. We're seeing right now key feedstocks propylene, ethylene are down, year-over-year as we enter 2020. And other key materials like epoxy for example, more on our industrial side are also down year-over-year. From a TiO2 perspective, right now what we're seeing is relatively stable, moving into 2020, based on the current demand environment that we're in. So, that's kind of a big picture look at it from a resin internalization standpoint. I'll let Al take that one. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Kevin, I don't think our strategy has changed. We've picked up a nice business with EPS, as part of the Valspar acquisition. We've got to even invest in more assets to internalize resins, but it's a balance. We look at where we can make the most from a -- not just -- not a cost necessarily but from a differentiation standpoint. And we have as we've talked about a number of projects in the pipeline across each of the segments to continue to drive, what I'd call continuous improvement opportunities. You saw some of that benefit in our Consumer Brands group this year. And helping their margin expansion and you should expect that going forward. John Morikis : Yeah Kevin, if I could, I'd just like to add just one other component, that was just slightly touched on by Al on the proprietary development of technology. We're looking at this opportunity to serve our customers, particularly the painting contractor who's looking to maximize productivity. And we're combining the asset that you're asking about in a way I think that's really unique for Sherwin. We're trying to position ourselves to provide solutions and technology to help those customers to be more productive. I mentioned earlier, the number of products that we are introducing. And here, I'd just like to take the opportunity to talk about three of those. Because I think it highlights what Al just talked about from a resin capability standpoint. And I'll be very brief on this. But this gives us the opportunity to develop products that really help our customers in a unique way. We're introducing a product this year called Flex Temp that provides a contractor the ability to get out earlier colder temperatures and stay out longer in hotter temperatures. It actually has a spread of ability to be applied from 35 degrees Fahrenheit up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit with no change in viscosity, terrific uniform application. And so it extends the ability of these painting contractors to be out. So when we talk about labor and the challenges of getting caught up, we're looking at ways to make them more productive. We're introducing a new product called Emerald Rain Refresh that again same platform of technology proprietary. We'll hold on to this. No one else will have it. But this is a product that not only optimizes applications so that you have more productivity from painters with less experience. This is a product that when it rains or it is hosed down, it looks like it was just painted. So after every rain the home or commercial building to look as if it was just painted brand new clean. So these painters that have applied this in the commercialization process have just been really raving about it. And the last one just to be brief again, we're introducing a new extension on our Emerald line, which is our top of the line product. This will be the finest paint that we've produced yet, outstanding hiding, great applications. So again painters with limited experience. We're making limited experienced painters better painters. Best application, better touch up, all with this idea that if we're developing resins and products for them, the loyalty to Sherwin increases. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you so much. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Walker : Hi guys. This is Anthony Walker on for Bob. Maybe just two quick ones. Can you talk about the performance of the international businesses within the consumer segment, which you acquired through the Valspar transaction? In the past you've talked about potential strategic or rationalization opportunities there assuming the businesses continued to underperform. How should we think about the timing and the opportunity there? John Morikis : Yeah. I think -- let me just walk through the three areas there just briefly. First, Asia, I'd say the business is certainly going through a transition. We've talked about the fact that this Ballroom [ph] brand was predominantly focused on interior wood. So we're shifting that strategy as much of that business internally and region is now shifting to a shop or factory applied application. And so the teams are developing a strategy and executing pieces of it to pursue and reposition the brand there. Again a small piece of the business, but we think this is an important one. Future opportunity here is terrific. We're gaining -- we're making some progress in the quarter. We started to see a positive trend in Asia. So I'd say that one is trending the right way. Europe we made significant progress this past year. Sales were positive in mid-single digits. Operating profit improved to a low double-digit percentage, so feeling that we are pointing in the right direction there. Australia is a bird of another color. We've got some challenges there. And quite frankly we're not performing as needed. We have plans and teams executing on this. This is one that you should expect us to get closer to and see some improvement or making some tough changes. Anthony Walker : Great. Thanks. And then just one on the price increase that you announced for the Paint Stores Group. How should we think about that flowing through the results in the year? Will we start to see that show up in the first quarter in full? And then how should we also think about the magnitude of what I assume are labor freight and distribution expenses as sort of tempting to offset? Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. The pricing will roll out on a similar cadence to past price increases. You'll see some of that for sure in the first quarter. And then as it takes hold over the next six months, we'll get full effectiveness as it flows through all of our customers. When you look at our cost basket that we've talked about, merit increases are higher than what they've been in the past, health care benefits continue to rise and as we've absorbed those over the past number of years. But this price increase is not unprecedented to cover costs other than raw materials. And if you go back in the first quarter of 2014, we went out a price increase to cover those costs, because as you can imagine it's a compounding. If you don't get it in the first year and it compounds over three or four years, it gets to be pretty steep. So that's kind of why this justification with this price increase. John Morikis : Yeah. We're not getting thank you notes from our customers obviously, but many of them are facing similar situations. So the fact that we waited until January 1 gave our customers an opportunity to kind of recalibrate as they're bidding going forward in the New Year. And secondly the fact that they're experiencing the same thing I think has helped in the execution as well. Hello. Operator : Thank you. We'll move on to our next question, which comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Hi. Good afternoon. John Morikis : Hey, Mike. Mike Harrison : Wondering if you could give us an update on the progress at Lowe's. And maybe just more broadly speaking your expectations for DIY in the first half of 2019. It seems like with refinancing activity having picked up and the easy weather comps and the store resets and the training that's been going on at Lowe's that maybe that business could be stronger yet you guys provided guidance that suggests that consumer is more flattish for the full year. John Morikis : Yeah. So, a piece of that just a reminder as we have the ACE business that's coming out. So that's a piece of the go-forward forecast, Mike. But I would describe our opportunity at Lowe's quite simply as we think we're moving the ball in the right direction, but we're never satisfied. And we're investing. I mentioned earlier in my remarks about that we're stepping up our investments in the home center channel. Obviously, they would be a big part of that. We see that there are opportunities in both the consumer side and the professional side those pros that paint, we think it's a terrific opportunity for us to help our customer. On the consumer side, we have a lot of opportunities to help convert shoppers into customers. And we made a big commitment to this relationship and we want to see this thing through. And the opportunity here is to help execute and that's on all fronts. So I don't think you should ever expect us to say that we're done. This is a business that we're looking at just aggressively as we do our own stores business. We think there's opportunities, and we're committed to helping our customer win. Al Mistysyn : Hey, Mike, I would just add to that that, we have talked about this in the past that embedded in our Consumer Brands segment is our retail channel that has been under pressure consistently. And as Lowe's has performed better, they certainly are taking share from that segment. And then we're trying to be realistic. When we look outside the U.S., we're trying not to build -- although optimistic trying not to build a hockey stick to our sales guidance. And -- but rest assured we expect more out of those teams outside the U.S. Mike Harrison : All right. And then I wanted to also ask about the ColorSnap consultation brand and how that's contributing to paint store sales growth. How much of North America do you have covered with the ColorSnap offering at this point? I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of what stage we're in with that rollout and how much more it could contribute? Thanks. John Morikis : Yeah, we're pretty early in it. There was an opportunity. And again, this goes back to helping our customers. Mike, you really hit on something here, because this has worked out quite well for us not so much just for the consumer, but our residential repaint contractors are leaning on us to help accelerate the selling process for them. And as we employ this as well as the digital ColorSnap, which is an AI application that's new and continuing to -- we continue to enhance the previous platform, it allows our customers to accelerate through their process of closing business. This is the professional painting contractor to a homeowner. So I would suspect that you're going to see that as a component one of many items that we are going to continue to leverage and add service and productivity that helps build loyalty to the painting contractor. But it's still got a lot of opportunity across the country. A lot. Mike Harrison : All right. John Morikis : Thank you, Mike. Operator : We'll move on to our next question which comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you, good morning. John can you discuss your plans for store openings and any closings in 2020? And any impact on the cadence of store openings from either your digital strategy or how you're trying to service some of your larger customers going forward? John Morikis : Well we expect to continue in that range of 80 to 100 stores. We -- I don't know that it's changed in any way from a store cadence. We'd like to see a smoother rollout of the stores rolling in. I've been trying to fix that since I ran that business 15 years ago. But I'd say that we feel really good about it. I also want to thank our teams because I think we're getting -- continuing to get better at it. The stores that we're opening and we're cranking up faster and the impact is better. Some of that has to do with the quality of people in the stores as well as the systems that we're adding to those. So I'd say you should expect us to continue to add in those stores at a similar rate to what we've had. Al Mistysyn : Yes. David, I'd just add. When you look at TAG and we closed 32 stores in the year 26 of those stores were in Latin America. We have talked about the pressure we've been under Latin America. As you know we take a rigorous and consistent view of our portfolio of businesses brands customer programs and other investments. And as we've not been able to see a line of sight to above average growth either in sales, operating margins, cash we've had to take action. We're not exiting those markets but pushing those sales through what I would call more of a dealer network which is a little less asset intensive. And I think you'll see some of that continue here in our first half. David Begleiter : Very good. And John just lastly what's your sense on the pool of available painters in both the quantity as well as the quality in 2020? John Morikis : Let's say, it's under pressure. Our customers as I mentioned earlier would like to move faster and there are a number of wonderful painters and many people entering in the industry that are learning as they go. And as I mentioned as I ran through those products briefly, we're taking that into consideration as we're building products and helping our customers to improve their efficiency. So I'd say they're both under pressure. People that typically enter into the trades, we're working with those professionals to help train those employees, but there's a pressure in finding them. David Begleiter : Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Hi, good morning. Good afternoon. John Morikis : Hey P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Plastic single-use plastics are coming under pressure. So it's bags and bottles. I was wondering if as bottles come under pressure would some of the food and beverage stuff move to cans? And would that become an opportunity for you on interior or exterior coatings of the cans? John Morikis : Yes. The answer is yes. We would welcome that transition and we want to work to support our customers to do that. As I mentioned earlier the progress that we're making in our packaging business in both food and beverage has been fantastic and more of that transitioning into our packaging and customers' business is terrific. And that's why we talk a lot about this in our stores business. But even on the packaging side, we're really determined to help our customers through technology to help speed up lines to help minimize -- not damaged, but trying to buy imperfections in the coatings. But the idea here is as we help them become more efficient in driving efficiencies into their plant, the better supplier we are. So we're really focused on making them better. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then my second question is, now that your leverage is below your target of three times, what is your willingness to look at M&A, what size? And would 2020 be the year that you come back into the market for M&A? Al Mistysyn : P.J. we have consistently are looking for acquisitions of any size. I mean, I think you're right, as you look at our debt-to-EBITDA ratio under three in 2020, I don't expect to pay down debt. And as our EBITDA grows, you'll see us drive that target down towards the 2 to 2.5 long-term target that I have. But yes, we are actively looking for acquisitions. But as John mentioned earlier, we're taking a disciplined approach to that. And I'd say we raised the dividend 18%. We'll keep CapEx below 2%. But absent those M&A absent any acquisitions, we're going to buy back our stock this year. John Morikis : Yes. But I think to your point though our COO David Sewell got his teams really leaning forward in this area looking for those opportunities, not only just simply from the opportunity, but from the strategic value that can be gained from it. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, P.J. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. All I've got left on my list is Al can you just -- the tax rate stepping up this year, is that just sort of your starting point? And then you see how the year plays out and what things your team comes up with. Or do you -- how should we be thinking about the higher tax rate? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Vincent. That -- I'm always looking at the tax rate. It's a function of how many options and how our legal entity consolidations flow through to help that tax rate. So I started at the low 20% range and then I expect our tax guys to develop plans and continue with the programs that are going to continue to drive that down. Vincent Andrews : Thanks very much. Al Mistysyn : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yeah, good morning. Just one for me. Volumetrically how fast did the North American architectural market grow last year do you guys think? Jim Jaye : We haven't seen official data yet on that Duffy. If I go back to probably the most recent data we have is 2018 gallon growth was a little over 2%. I want to say, it's probably similar in 2019 and probably at a similar level in 2020 sort of that low single-digit level if I would guess. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thanks guys. Jim Jaye : You bet. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Justin Speer : Perfect guys. I just wanted to unpack that if you could help maybe further unpack the nature of those SG&A investments. And how you think they'll unfold from a percentage of revenue standpoint? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Justin, we're not going to go down the P&L by line on the guidance. I think what we've consistently done is grow our store count, grow our rep count and then these additional investments are going to come through pretty evenly throughout the year. And we're not going to quantify them because it's like any other review that we do. We want to see how the first half unfolds, how volumes look and it may give us an opportunity to accelerate in the back half of the year like we did this year. So I think it depends, but they're in our guidance and we'll continue to manage those accordingly. John Morikis : I would say Justin, we are planning on sharing a number of these with you during our financial community presentation on that June 3rd date where we'll give you some idea from -- in some of these areas the digital I think you'll be really impressed with. And to the extent that we're comfortable in sharing, obviously we don't want to point specifically for competitive reasons to what we're doing. But as much as we can as things roll out, we'll share what we've done, but not what we're going to do. Justin Speer : Okay. And I guess maybe because I'm sure you pilot, I know you piloted a number of these different programs. But just curious how the -- there's like a response rate in terms of growth improvement to the model. Or is it just a stickiness in this widening of the moat, bringing the customer closer, the relationship is good? But does it change the growth algorithm or the amount of gallons that flow through, all else equal? John Morikis : Yes, we're doing this for growth. We absolutely believe it improves the stickiness, the moat -- any metaphor we want to use, but we are growing our business and we're going to do it profitably. And we think that the more solutions that we bring to our customers to help make them more profitable, the more likely we're going to continue to be their supplier. And so, we're really focused on not just one lever, one silver bullet, but a number of these that will enhance their ability to be successful. And as a result, we become a better supplier to them. Justin Speer : Thanks. And my last question is just on the consumer business. Just, how much mix benefit from that transition in Ace will you -- are you thinking or estimating for your 2020 targets there? Al Mistysyn : Yes. What we talked about is the Ace business, that private label business, was about $100 million a year, considerably below the average of our consumer operating margin. We didn't lay that out and we're not going to, but you should expect margin improvement because of that. Justin Speer : Thank you, gentlemen. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Garik, your line is live, you may proceed with your question. We'll move on to our next question, which comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just wanted to make sure I'm understanding this clearly on your TAG and paint stores demand outlook for 2020. The full year guide, I think, it implies that volumes grow pretty much in line with 2019, maybe at a bit of a slower pace even. When I'm listening to you all, you're very optimistic on the architectural volume side. Seems like that market is even accelerating, which would imply that Protective & Marine in that non-res market might even be decelerating versus 2019. Just trying to understand how you all are thinking about that. And if you can walk me through the parts. John Morikis : Yes, Truman, I'd say, you're right in sensing our confidence in the architectural side, having just finished the quarter in the mid single -- or I'm sorry, high single digits, gives us confidence moving forward. On the Protective & Marine side that runs through there, we've got the fourth quarter and likely the first quarter right now that we're seeing is likely a little softer than we would have liked to seeing, but feeling pretty good about it going forward. So, I think, we're trying to be just in line with what our customers are telling us and we feel pretty good about the number that we put out here. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Truman, the other comment I would make is, as I mentioned earlier, if you look at the way the year unfolded for paint stores in North America. We had a strong second half versus the first half, even a 9%, 8%, 7% TAG increase in the third quarter, which is a large quarter and a very good result in a large quarter like that. So, I think, when we get through our second quarter and see how the year is unfolding, we can give you an update then. Truman Patterson : Okay, okay. And then, final question for me, just on the raw materials basket. Can you just discuss what kind of tailwinds you actually saw in the fourth quarter from an overall basket perspective? And then, just remind us what you ended up seeing in 2019 as a whole. Jim Jaye : Yes, Truman. Costs for the broad basket that we buy, I would say, moderated slightly in the fourth quarter 2019 from third quarter of 2019. So it kind of played out as we thought. Fourth quarter 2019 was also lower year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by lower cost for resins solvents. And we don't provide specific dollars on the savings of the raw materials, but you can see the positive trend, I think, reflected in our year-over-year gross margin improvement. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you. Jim Jaye : Sure. Operator : Thanks. Your next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with G.Research. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. John Morikis : Hi. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. John, I was wondering if you could give us a little more on the impairment charges. I am assuming that the bulk of it is the woods coatings in China, but you also mentioned one impairment taken in the Consumer Brands category. Is that ACE? Or a little color on which product lines you are more or less eliminating as there is no growth and those for which you are going to change the brand name. John Morikis : Yes, Rosemary. I would not classify it as no growth. I would characterize it in GI and in automotive. As we've put in implemented our systems, our legacy systems, we've gotten customers to move to a new label and that has helped us optimize or streamline our operations. That's the biggest impact. Another example would be in Australia. We're under pressure that we talked about earlier about driving operating margin and cash flow improvement. And one way to do that is, reduce the number of brands you're trying to support. And so, in that area, we also move from -- remove focus if you will on one brand and driving it more through the Wattyl brand. And again that's going to help us in the midterm here to reduce our costs and keep investing in labels and merchandising and different things like that. So, the Walroom brand in China has been under pressure. John talked about that transition certainly from -- to factory applied coatings. That is an impact. And as that transition continues to move and expand, we're not expecting or anticipating any other impairments going forward. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. And then the goal was very optimistic. Your projections of 2% to 4% on the revenue line is stronger or higher than it was 2019 versus 2018. And yet if I look at your EPS projections at the midpoint it is up 9% versus up 14% in 2019 over '14 if I have those numbers right. So, I am wondering what are the offsets? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Rosemarie. I'd say that we're -- if you're comparing last year to the go forward as I talked about the price increase that we went out with and being effective under 2% that's below what we really realized through the first three quarters of last year. Our raw material moderation isn't as strong as what we saw in 2019. And these investments that we talked about even though we're seeing slower in our second half of 2019 on Performance Coatings, we continue to invest back in this -- in our businesses that we think are going to provide growth opportunities in the future, not only the new stores and the new reps that we even accelerated in the back half but this digital program that John laid out. And then, some other -- our home center channel that -- so yes, we're continuing those investments in 2020. John Morikis : It may not have an immediate feedback or a payback, but we're running this company longer term than just one quarter. And we absolutely believe these are the right investments to make. And so we're moving forward aggressively taking advantage as I said of not only the market, but we really think there's some competitive opportunities out here that we want to take advantage of. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. So nothing really special just going forward and investing where you need to? John Morikis : Investing where we need to be skinning back where we can, but leaning forward we think that we've described it internally Rosemarie as a coil. We feel, we're cranking this coil down and we expect it to respond given the investments that we have in a very positive way. Al Mistysyn : And Rosemarie we don't expect the market to be this way. But if you go back to 2007 '08 and '09 when we added 260 new stores when we came out of that you look at our market share growth not only on the three-year but the 5-year and the 10-year compounded average growth rates we think we're well above market growth and that's the attitude we're taking. We look at it long term and expect as John mentioned that coil to grow market share faster than what we've done in the past. Rosemarie Morbelli : All right. Looking forward to that coil deploying. Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Perrella : Hi, guys. Quick ones on LatAm volume. Has that flattened out for you at this point and you're looking for inflection in 2020? And then just a little color on consumer pricing. Do you expect to get about half of what you get in the TAG group for 2020? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Chris I would say for Latin America, our volumes have, I would say, improved as the year has gone on. But where you're seeing it is, as we continue to see the devaluation, we're continually -- that team is continually having to go out with price. 60% of our raw materials are dollar-denominated, so every deflation we see in Brazil as an example we're constantly chasing with price. So the biggest portion of our impact right now is price. But some of the things that we're doing on streamlining sales organizations and focus on the right segments and customer segment will help drive growth in the future. John Morikis : Yeah. We're just not waiting for the market. We're not waiting for currency. We're trying to do -- we mentioned earlier, control the things we can control. And our Mexico sales were up high single-digits clearly offset by Argentina and Brazil and some of the other regions. As Al mentioned, we're trying to be very aggressive in Brazil. The store reduction is an example of that. But we're looking to drive more profitable sales to the most efficient channels down there. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. And Chris the second question on price. Yes. In Performance Coatings, we do still have opportunities for price in certain businesses and regions. And as you remember 2017 and 2018, we saw the big run-up in raw materials. Our industrial businesses were impacted the most. Although, raws have moderated and our expectation is in 2020, they're not back to where they were at the beginning of 2017. So we're continuing to need price. We've expanded our margins, but we expect and I feel confident that we'll get to the high teens and low 20s. And recovering those raw material costs, plus the incremental freight cost, plus the merit increases and health care that I talked about on TAG, those are affecting our Performance Coatings Group and we're having to offset those. So, yeah, we're going to continue with price. Christopher Perrella : All right. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Chris Bottiglieri : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First of all, I want to kind of follow-up on your comment earlier on the auto business looking the best that it's been in your tenure. A little surprising to hear, I mean, are you starting to see like accident frequency inflect or total loss rates come down? Or is it more so just competitive dynamics where you feel like you're taking share from the channel? John Morikis : Competitive dynamics we're taking share. I think the market -- there's been some compression we think and we've talked about that openly with safer cars and safer attributes that are going into these vehicles, which are absolutely critical. So we're doing it by the technology that we're bringing and the services that we're bringing. The combination of Valspar and Sherwin together we have a new improved system that we think has been very well received by the marketplace. And we're really working hard to serve those customers in a way to help their throughput through those facilities. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. That's helpful. And then one other question on coronavirus. I just want to think there are like potential impacts maybe like a more of an indirect impact. Recognize you don't have high exposure to like Chinese TiO2. But are there any impacts to that market that could manifest in the global supply chain if the work stop continues? Or any other like feedstock or inputs that again if we continue to see more business shutdowns and extended holiday that could maybe have an impact on your business? Curious how you think about that? Jim Jaye : Yeah, Chris. Let me start just by saying first when we look at this the health and safety of our employees is number one obviously. And so we're monitoring that very carefully and the recommendations that are out there. We've suspended travel to and from China in the short-term. And we're limiting some travel inside the country to business critical. So we're doing that. But I think we're working closely with our teams there our customers our suppliers. Haven't seen to this point any negative impact and we'll continue to monitor that closely. I think it's just too early to see. John Morikis : Now we've got some very good leadership on the ground there. Jason Wu and his team are keeping us fully abreast. And I'd say right now from a procurement standpoint we're staying close. So there's a couple of dynamics. There's a raw material piece of it and there's also the point that Jim just mentioned about trying to make sure we're doing everything we can to protect our employees and work with our customers. There's a whole lot of people trying to do everything possible to do that, but there's a lot of uncertainty and we'll react as it unfolds. Chris Bottiglieri : Got you. Really helpful. Thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. So I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jaye for any additional concluding comments. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Jesse, and thanks everybody for joining us on the call today. Myself and Eric Swanson will be available as we always are for your questions today, tomorrow and into next week. And again, appreciate your interest in Sherwin, and we'll talk to you very soon. Have a good day. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the Company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the Company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to question. I will now turn the call or for John Morikis. John Morikis : Thanks, Jesse. Good morning everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy during the pandemic. Given the extraordinary circumstances over the last quarter, we've changed our typical format a bit today to provide you with some additional perspective. After my opening remarks, I'll turn the call over to Jim Jaye, our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for some short comments on our first quarter results. David Sewell, our President and Chief Operating Officer will follow Jim, and provide you with details on how we're responding to the pandemic. After David's remarks, I'll share some color on what we're seeing across our various end markets before turning it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Allen Mistysyn, who will provide you with our revised outlook for the year. Let me begin today by thanking the more than 60,000 employees of Sherman-Williams for their courage, determination, and resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their extraordinary effort to serve each other, our customers, our company and our communities during this challenging time truly has been inspiring. This wonderful team has my deepest appreciation and my deepest respect, and I'm confident in their ability to meet the challenges ahead of us. Clearly, we're in a much different economic environment than anyone could have imagined when we provided our 2020 outlook back in January. More than 26 million have filed for unemployment benefits in the U.S. alone since mid-March and other geographies also remain under significant pressure. Sherman-Williams is not immune from these realities. We are seeing major near-term impacts to demand in most of our end markets. We have a long-tenured and experienced management team that has successfully managed the Company through a number of challenging times, recession in the early 2000, the 2008-2009 financial collapse, and the integration of Valspar, the largest acquisition in the Company's long history. Our entire global team remains undaunted and has taken actions to navigate this crisis. We remain very confident in our ability to manage the near-term impacts we're seeing, while positioning ourselves for continued long-term success. We've developed and are executing a comprehensive response to the pandemic, focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, our customers, our company, and our communities. We're implementing multi-phased contingency plans across our businesses to adjust to the near-term business environment. We are well positioned from a balance sheet and liquidity perspective. We've adapted in order to stay connected to our customers through this crisis, including modified operations in our stores and increased use of e-commerce and other technology. We believe we're seeing a pause in demand in many of our end markets rather than destruction of demand. We believe the long-term fundamentals remain intact. We intend to continue strategic investments that support profitable growth. These include continued investments in our stores, our products, our e-commerce platform, and other initiatives as we look for opportunities to expand our business. But before moving ahead, I'd like to thank our team again for remaining focused and delivering on our first quarter plan, even as the COVID pandemic began to impact us. Let me now turn the call to Jim Jaye for some additional comments on the quarter. Jim Jaye : Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. In addition to this morning's press release and our commentary on today's call, we've provided a slide deck on our website with additional information. All comparisons in my remarks are to the first quarter of 2019 unless otherwise stated. Overall Sherwin-Williams delivered a strong first quarter that was line with our expectation, with year-over-year improvement in sales, gross margin, profit before tax, EBITDA, diluted net income per share and net operating cash. First quarter 2020 consolidated sales increased 2.6% to $4.15 billion, and consolidated gross margin increased to 45.6% from 42.9%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $93.4 million to $392.3 million. Diluted net income per share for the first quarter of 2020 increased to $3.46 per share from $2.62 per share. The first quarter of 2020 includes acquisition related amortization expense of $0.62 per share, and the first quarter of 2019 includes acquisition related costs and other adjustments of $0.98 per share, as described in the Regulation G reconciliation table included in our press release. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share, increased 13.3% to $4.08 from $3.60. Adjusted EBITDA increased $48 million to $623.1 million or 15% of sale. Cash from operations was $54.9 million, an increase of $91 million year-over-year in the quarter. As is typical for us in the first quarter, we use cash to build inventory levels in advance of the busier spring and summer selling season. We continue to monitor the demand environment closely. From a segment perspective, the Americas grew same-store sales by 7.4% and improved segment margin by 140 basis points. Consumer brands group and performance coatings group also delivered improved segment margin performance. Additional details on our segment performance are included in the slide deck I referenced previously. Let me now turn the call over to David Sewell for some specific comments and how we are responding to the pandemic. David. David Sewell : Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Let me also add my sincere thanks to our entire global team. Without a doubt, our incredibly talented and dedicated employees remain our most important asset and we have implemented a wide range of temporary policies and protocols over the last two months to protect their health and safety. These actions include enhanced paid sick and/or family leave, alternate flexible and remote work arrangement, visitor and employee screening protocols, social distancing best practices, additional PPE and sanitary procedures, and we have established a global crisis response team among many other measures. We also took the unprecedented step of temporarily closing our paint stores sales force to further protect employees as we move to serving customers with curbside pickup and delivery option. As for our customers, we provide essential products and services that are helping painters create and maintain clean and healthy living environment and healthcare facilities, manufacturing plants, residences, and for other vital infrastructure. Many of these contractors have expressed their gratitude to us for keeping our stores open and enabling them to keep their businesses running, doing their jobs, generating income and supporting their family. We're also supporting industrial customers in mission critical areas, such as food and beverage packaging, healthcare equipment, food manufacturing, water treatment, and energy infrastructure. During the crisis, we have delivered critical coatings product to producers of ventilators, oxygen tanks, and hospital bed frame. At this time, all major architectural and industrial plants and distribution service centers are in operation. The utilization rates vary based on manufacturing site and customers serve. We have had no significant issues with raw material availability or supply. We've had a very small number of North American stores closed intermittently during the crisis related to varying government borders. The vast majority of stores remain open. All of our businesses have developed and are executing on multi-phased contingency plan to adjust to the near -term business environment. We have taken targeted action to reduce costs, pause or eliminate certain programs, cut general expenses and delayed filling open positions. We've also made adjustments to a small percentage of our workforce through involuntary leaves and reductions in force. We have additional levers we can pull, if necessary. Through all of this, our employees continue to support the communities where they live and work. To-date, we have donated hundreds of thousands of masks, gloves and lab coats to those on the frontlines fighting the virus. We have also manufactured and donated hand sanitizers to many hospitals throughout the country. Our entire team remains focused and determined as we manage through this crisis, and we're confident we will emerge from this as a stronger company. John Morikis : Thank you, David. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe we are seeing a positive demand rather than destruction of demand, and we continue to feel confident in the long term trajectory of our end markets. While some economies cautiously begin taking steps to reopen, the pace and scale at which this will happen is far from clear. We believe April will be the most challenging month of our second quarter from a comparison perspective, with some gradual improvement as the quarter progresses. Whether the recovery gains momentum in the second half of 2020 or not until 2021 remains to be seen, we believe providing additional granularity on our end markets and how they might begin to emerge from the current environment may be helpful to investors. Let me begin in the Americas group with our North American stores. Again, first quarter trends were very strong with same-store sales 7.4%, reflecting robust underlying demand. We've seen a dramatic near-term pause brought on by the pandemic, with all end markets except DIY being significantly impacted. In residential repaint, customers are delaying interior work related to social distancing concerns and having painting contractors in their home. We expect this demand to return gradually as the pandemic subside, and customers and contractors implement appropriate protective measures. We expect texture repaint work to gain momentum near-term, which will help to offset some of the interior softness. In new residential, starts were strong double digits to begin the year as workers return from stay-at-home orders, work on these homes should resume. Our national homebuilding customers remain positive long term, though cancellations have increased and order rates have soften near-term. Activity should eventually improve as mortgage rates are low in the supply of homes is limited. As a reminder, there's about a 90 to 120 day lag from the time construction begins to the painting phase. In new commercial, many of our customers were reporting strong backlogs and our first quarter sales were up mid-single digit. Construction has been deemed as essential in most locations and jobs in progress will be completed. Work is largely continuing albeit it at a slower pace due to increased job site restrictions and labor challenges. We start to be delayed in the second quarter. So we're optimistic that they will pick back up to the economy begins to reopen more broadly. In property maintenance, overall renters demographics are favorable though apartment terms have slowed dramatically near-term. Management companies remain positive and expect renter movements begin quickly once the economy reopens. Maintenance related to hotels and restaurants is likely to return more slowly. Some CapEx projects have been put on hold in some areas due to local mandate. Our DIY business is strong as consumers are nesting and using stay-at-home time to work on affordable home improvement projects such a painting. We expect our DIY business to remain solid in the second quarter before returning more normal low-single digit rates as stay-at-home orders are lifted. In protective and marine approximately 40% of our sales are tied to oil and gas, which has fallen sharply over the last quarter. Major oil and gas companies are suspended or delayed capital expenditure projects, which have and will continue to impact our results. Conversely, our sales in other end markets such as water and wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical, flooring, rail and marine remain as planned, which will help to offset the softness from weaker oil and gas. While we're seeing short-term disruptions and headwind, the long term drivers we've cited in the past remain intact, including household formations and demographic trends. Given these long term drivers, we intend to continue to invest in our business. We anticipate opening approximately 50 new stores this year, while continuing to focus on sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products and productivity enhancing services. Moving on to an update for consumer brands group. DIY demand in North America continues to be strong as stay-at-home mandates of increased home improvement demand. Sales of homes and other retail channel partners continue to perform well and we are encouraged by growth process with multiple customers in this channel. Looking at our international businesses, we expect our sales to be under considerable pressures through the second quarter. Our expectation is for these businesses to slowly return to more normal activity in the third quarter as the economies of the world begin to open. Lastly, let me comment on trends in performance coatings group. Overall, we anticipate industrial demand recovering more slowly than architectural demand. From a geographic perspective, North America remains the largest region performance coatings and was our strongest performer prior to the pandemic. We would expect it to be true going forward. We have started to see some recovery in China at a slower pace than anticipated. We expect continued pressure in Europe and Latin America. In packaging, demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. We anticipate strong continued demand and additional business wins driven by sustainability trends, and our non- BPA Valpure V70 coatings. In coil coatings, we're seeing a temporary pause and slower pace from commercial construction projects. Jobs in progress will eventually resume and coupled with the continued capture of new business, we expect this business to remain one of our best performers. In general industrial, we're seeing substantial demand weakness in various end markets, including heavy equipment, agriculture, transportation, and general finishing. We expect this recovery will be slow and we'll see continued pressure throughout the rest of 2020. In industrial wood, softness across various end markets including furniture, kitchen cabinetry and flooring has continued. It is difficult to forecast the timing of improvement though many of the same drivers influencing you new housing could benefit business. In automotive refinish, the business has been impacted by the various state home mandates that have been instituted across the country. The decrease in miles driven has led to a decrease in collisions. The pace of recovery in this business will depend on how quickly stay-at-home orders are lifted, and people begin to return to their normal routine. Let me reiterate that while we are seeing near-term pressure across most markets we serve, we're confident in a long term trajectory. Now, I'll turn the call over to Allen Mistysyn, our Chief Financial Officer to talk more specifically about our revised 2020 guidance, our cash and liquidity position, and our approach to capital allocation. Al? Allen Mistysyn : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We anticipate the negative impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and global economies will most likely continue through the second quarter. We do not expect immediate meaningful improvement ahead in most end markets we serve and we're unable to predict when any noticeable improvement in those end markets will occur. Given the near-term trends and indicators we see at this time, we anticipate second quarter 2020 consolidated net sale would decrease by a low to mid-teens percentage versus the second quarter of 2019. Looking at our operating segments for the second quarter, we anticipate the Americas group to be down by a low double digit to mid teen percentage, consumer brands group to beat up by a high single digit to low double digit percentage and performance coatings group to be down a high teen percentage. For the full year 2020, we are revising our sales guidance to reflect uncertainties and the timing and pace of improvement in the U.S. and global operating environment. If economic conditions begin returning to normal in the third quarter of 2020, and continue improving through the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year consolidated net sales to be flat to down a low single digit percentage. If economic conditions do not materially improve until the first quarter of 2021, we anticipate full year 2020 consolidated net sales to decrease by a mid to high single digit percentage. This revised full year 2020 consolidated sales guidance is compared to our previous full year guidance of an increase of 2% to 4%. On an operating segment basis for the full year, we anticipate the Americas Group to be flat to down by a mid single digit percentage, consumer brands group to be up or down by a low single digit percentage and performance coatings group to be down by a high single digit to low double digit percentage. Considering our revised range of potential sale, we are revising our diluted net income for common share for 2020 to be in the range of $16.46 to $18.46 per share, compared to our previous guidance of $19.91 to $20.71 per share and compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings per share guidance include acquisition related amortization expense of approximately $2.54 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2020 earnings per share of $19 to $21. One key assumption embedded in our outlook is the raw material deflation we expect to realize for full year 2020. We expect the raw material basket to be lower year-over-year by a low single digit percentage. Switching to our balance sheet which along with our liquidity position remained strength of the Company, at March 31, 2020, we had $239 million in cash and $2.5 billion of unused capacity under our revolving credit facility. At the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio improved 3.1 times on net debt to adjusted EBITDA compared to 3.5 times a year ago. As Jim noted earlier, during the first quarter, we use cash to build architectural inventory level in advance of the spring and summer selling season. However, our teams reacted quickly, slowing demand, various businesses in region where it occurred and aggressively reduced inventory which helped reduce our year-over-year working capital of $151 million. You have completed a number of actions over the past year to reduce our risk and improve our financial flexibility. We recently completed a bond issuance in March for $500 million of 10-year note at 2.3%, this $500 million of 30 year note at 3.3%. These are the lowest coupon rates in the history of the Company. The proceeds of these issuances reduce to complete a tender offer for 500 million of 2.75% note due in 2022 will also be used to pay off the 429 million, 2.25% note that are coming due in May. Our next long-term debt maturity in 2021 is $25 million. In the first quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our company stock and increased our quarterly dividend by 18.6% to $1.34 per share. We are committed to maintaining this dividend increase through the rest of 2020. As David mentioned, we are executing contingency plan to reduce spending and conserve cash. As part of those plans, we are lowering our full year 2020 capital expenditure forecast from $320 million to $180 million and temporarily delaying our share repurchases until we see improvement in the end markets we serve. Finally, we have put a pause on spending related to our new headquarters and R&D facility project but continue to work various planning process. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your question. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Chris Parkinson : So, I'll leave this fairly open ended, but do you speak to some of the key trends in the Americas group, such as the sustainability of the DIY boost? Any color on the magnitude of the divergence between exterior and interior paint trends? And just how to think about things on a sub-regional basis for what you're seeing in April? Are there any differences between for instance, the Southeast versus the Northeast? John Morikis : Thanks Chris. First, I would say regarding the DIY business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the nesting phenomenon, if you will, as our customers, it's largely the result of their spending more time at home. And we believe that that will continue largely through the stay-at-home orders. Historically, if you look at the underlying principles that have us believing that this gradually shifts back to the, do it for me as opposed to DIY primarily. We think those are still intact. Those are the aging demographics, the home appreciation, the aging housing stock. And that, as well, I would say that if you look at the last recession in DIY, it grew, not in huge amounts, but it was not protracted either. Here, we have a much more significant jump in DIY business and we're experiencing it DIY business in our stores, for those customers that are still preferring a more specialty store experience and through many of our customers and our consumer brands business and we're working hard to serve them as well. As it relates to your next question regarding the, what was it, interior versus exterior? Both were up double-digits in the first quarter, and we expect that as the season starts to turn a little bit here that we'll start to see more lift in the exterior business as a result of more contractors, getting the go ahead from homeowners. In some cases right now are preferring not to have -- many cases right now are preferring not to have painting contractors enter their home. And regionally, you asked a question, what we see regionally. I'd say that we are starting to see more estimating, and I would say the close rates in those estimates are growing. Largely in Southeast and Southwest right now, they're lagging in the Northeast and in the Midwest, which you would expect heavily influenced by what's happening in New York, what's happening in Illinois and Michigan. So, I'd say, going back to the point that we referenced a few times in the prepared remarks. We'll go structurally there's not been much shift. So, we expect this, do-it-yourself to continue short-term, gradually shift back to do-it-for me, and we love our position with those customers to be able to capitalize on that. Chris Parkinson : Also just as a carrier of that, can you just very quickly just break out the trends in P&M across the Americas group and PC, just if you go through the oil and gas protective insect corrosion and then just the smell and rain? Just anything changing there in terms of your thought process? John Morikis : Yes. So, I'd say in P&M, we mentioned that that represents about 40% -- I'm sorry, oil and gas represents about 40% of our P&M business to our stores. And we have a very strong position there. I'd say that the oil prices have had an impact primarily in the upstream business, where your offshore shale et cetera, midstream, wood storage. Downstream, I'd say in refining and cracking is still quite a bit of investment going on. What I'm really pleased with is the shift that our teams are putting into place that pivot to where the business is not as certainly where we are. We have a strong very strong position in those areas that are under pressure. We got wonderful talent, wonderful products, and we're doing a very good job I believe in moving into some of those areas that are underserved by Sherwin right now in the oil and gas as well as other areas that we mentioned. Those are the water, wastewater, food and beverage even pharmaceutical flooring. So this is a pretty experienced team we have here. And we're taking advantage of those experiences, the scar tissue, if you will, from some of the past experiences. We're not waiting for things to happen. We're trying to capitalize and drive things to make them happen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey, John, just kind of picking up on the live few comments, right. So your comments are being that says sort of pause in demand versus necessarily a disruption in demand, but some of the metrics in terms of U.S. unemployment and start of market to change dramatically over the past couple of months. I guess what gives you confidence that apart from the dislocation that you and others will see 2Q that this is in fact a pause versus something that's going to have a tail with it? John Morikis : So, I think in each markets, when we look at the drivers of those segments, we look through and understand we think was a pretty good line of site on what's going to happen. I think if you look at for example in new residential, we feel there is a pause that there is a fundamental need for housing in the country, and that while the short term traffic in models and the feedback that we're getting from our large new residential customers clearly indicate some concern with the shorter term. We're not running the quarter, I mean, running the Company to have a great second quarter here. And that's it. We're doing the best we can with the cards that we were dealt with the in the second quarter. But we're looking at the fundamentals and we believe that if you go by segment, do our business that there are some various sound fundamentals in areas where there is some softness. We're not waiting. We're moving into those areas that offer opportunity. And so segment by segment we're dissecting our business understand we have the right people doing the right things to capitalize on those opportunities. Allen Mistysyn : Got it and I just add to that. And that's partly why, the unpredictability about how our segments come out of this and timing of that, that's why if you will bifurcated the guidance to say okay. If we see things start improving in the third quarter and then continue to improve in the fourth quarter. We think flat to down low-single digit, but it the true recovery doesn't start until the first quarter of 2021. We're looking at that mid-to-high single digit down estimates. So we perfectly understand the uncertainty, so that's why we are giving a range of the timing of when we expect the businesses to come back. Ghansham Panjabi : And then, just on the DIY piece that you're benefiting from in the stores group power of consumers engaging with your associates. I mean generally your stores offer very high, but then for consumers, how are your associates pivoting towards this new reality of social distancing. And then just sort of related to that, are you seeing any from a high level standpoint, are you see any specific trends that are visible in terms of maybe DIY piece being a bit more price-sensitive in terms of the choice of pick? Thanks. John Morikis : Thank you for that question because it gives you a terrific opportunity to recognize a wonderful team. We've got a terrific leadership team and Peter Ippolito and [indiscernible] and all our division presidents there. But more importantly, as strong as those leaders are, we've got just a wonderful team in our stores and are close to customers and sales reps that are doing a terrific job. And your question gives me just that the opportunity to thank this wonderful team for everything they're doing. You're right, it's changed things. We are a curbside only. So, it's given us an opportunity to leverage some of the investments that we've made in our digital platform. We have orders coming in via the digital platform that we've been invested in with a much greater utilization so we're excited about that. And I would tell you, we've been inundated with emails and notes and even phone calls from customers that have gone out of their way to, to comment and recognize our employees and their willingness to work with people. We've gotten utilizing a color fulfillment so customers can go online order colors and have them into their homes in relatively short period of time. And our people in the stores are eager to help these people, over the phone to make sure that they're taken care of. And then the transaction takes place, it's a contact a transaction when these employee or these customers pull up into our stores and their product is ordered to the back of the car. I don't know I couldn't tell him how many points of contact I've had with people recognizing that's a wonderful service and approach that we're taking. And that's in on our stores, I would say that we were blessed with a number of really, really strong and good customers on our consumer brands team, and [Eddie Peps] and [Keith Velora] [indiscernible] the two leaders running that businesses really helped us to try to be as responsive as we can to that important segment and channel to our customers. And we're trying to in-still as much as we can in our learning's from our store site into those customers and vice versa and just really providing solutions to our customers. So, we're really excited about this and say that the trend that we're seeing in our DIY business is exciting on the consumer side as well as our stores. Ghansham Panjabi : And the pricing sensitivity fees? John Morikis : Yes, I'd say that on pricing we continue to see a positive mix in our business. I say that my side contractors, who recognize that 90% of their projects are labor costs many homeowners, particularly those that are shopping at a Sherwin-Williams store, are typically willing to pay a little more to get the finished that they're looking for, and to have it be as productive as possible. So, we are seeing a positive mix shift in both the a pro or contractor business that we see as well as the do-it-yourself. Operator : Your next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : I guess two points. So, on the raw material side, down low-single-digit, just given what we've seen in oil prices and propylene, it seems a little bit on the low side. Can you give us a little bit of color into what you're seeing in the various baskets for raw materials, and how you're thinking about how they trend throughout the year? John Morikis : Sure and good morning, John. What I would say is given the significant decline in crude as you point out, we do expect to realize lower year-over-year raw material costs throughout the remainder of 2020. The full year will be down by low-single-digit percentage as we talked about compared to our prior estimate of being flat for the year. I think the rate in the second half of the year will depend largely on how the downstream derivatives like propylene and ethylene react to the declines in crude. And I would say also if demand is not improved through the second half of the year, then we could potentially see a more meaningful benefit. The majority of the benefit year-over-year is going to be on that resins solvent side. If you take a look at the TiO2 side, I think we've seen strong demand there in the first quarter and the second quarter, but it's probably too soon to fully understand the supply demand impact and the effect on pricing there. I would say at this point we do anticipate stable to potentially lower prices for TiO2 in the back half. Historically weaker global demand has resulted in lower pricing. But again, I think the decline that we're expecting to see in the basket is tied more on the petrochemical side and it's really going to depend on how propylene and ethylene response. John McNulty : And then I guess in the stores business, so if I understand it correctly, you shut down the front part of the store kind of in late March. Is there a way to think about how much sales dipped when you went just to curbside pickup and just so that we can kind of think about when these required closures and that type of thing and how to think about the snapback? Can you give us a little bit of color or anecdotes on that? John Morikis : Yes. It's hard to say exactly how much of a decline we're seeing, but we saw, but in our second quarter guidance, we're talking about the America's group download double-digit to mid-teen. I think, just commentary as we've seen April progressed, the weekly sales on architectural have improved week to week from a dollar volume standpoint. As a reminder, April, was there a toughest comp a year ago? If you think about how North American same-store progressed to the second quarter last year's April was a strongest quarter and then it took down and then it took down in June. So we were fully expecting April toughest comparison. So that's what makes it a little bit harder to gauge how much is related to the shelter in place and the changes to our sales floor. Allen Mistysyn : John, I would add just though, David Sewell here our COO has got all our businesses leaning forward in a very positive way. So, I'm a bit more optimistic, I might say, in the sense that we've come into this business with a pretty strong performance, a strong comp store sale number. And David has our teams, every one of them, including our stores, taking the activities. Right now that will help us grow even faster coming out of it. And so, the activity that we have in new accounts and product demos and information, this is probably some of the most impressive time we've had. Because we have had some customers on the professional side that has had interior projects that have been delayed, they're not able to get on the exterior projects. And so it's provided our teams more accessibility to some of these customers. And our new account activity is actually up as a result of this. Our demos of new products are up. So, you've start to David and our teams not only in our stores and all of them for what we're doing during these times. And so I guess what you're asking, as these stores close, how quickly do they rebound. Our desire, really strong desires to come out of this much stronger than even what we were before. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : I wanted to go back to the comments you made earlier. I guess you referenced potential for opening 15 new stores this year. Maybe you can just discuss how you see that playing out? Are there particular regions that you're targeting? And if you could relate that to some of the performance that you saw in Q1 or Q2 that you're seeing right now, are you targeting areas where maybe you're seeing some weaker performance regionally or is it just underpin penetrated areas? John Morikis : It varies by division. We are looking at in some areas what we call still in markets where we have underserved markets in areas that we might have more penetration, but we're missing some gas in this. A lot of areas, quite frankly, that we're just not happy with our performance yet. And in the area of market share and our position and we've got a long way to go. And so I'd say, it's kind of a balance between the two. We'd like to take advantage of our position in the market, while providing more accessibility to our customers. And at the same time we have to get after some of these markets that are underserved. Arun Viswanathan : And then just as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask about the refinish business as well. We all in miles driven dropped significantly. Maybe just give us your thoughts you've had some growth recently in the last couple of years through a bigger business for you now. So, did you comment on that business and what you see for the outlook there? John Morikis : Sure. You're right, we've seen a mile driven down considerably, and we expected that impact could be for another 30 to 45 days following the end of the stay-at-home order. So a little bumpy right now if you will and that business no pun intended. But our teams are really doing a nice job there. I think, I've mentioned last quarter, it was a bold statement and I stand by it. I think our position in this auto refinish businesses as strong as it's been since I've been on this floor of the building here and a lot of confidence in our leadership in automotive, a lot of confidence in our performance coatings team and what we're doing. I think we've got a lot of determination in this business to outperform. We're going to have to get some cars on the road be able to see some of that though. I say here though, as well if I could. The effort that we have and the connectivity and virtual learning and the virtual demos that our teams are initiating here in other area out of adversity sometimes comes the best. We've had a lot of things that we've been working on that we've been able to accelerate. And we believe it's helping to convert some of these customers. Some of them were on the fence before assemble it just come online before the pandemic. And, again, we expect to be able to capitalize on this as we come out. Arun Viswanathan : And just lastly, I know you've talked about evaluating your business in Australia.Could you just comment on where you stand there and the progress that's been made? John Morikis : Sure. The virus impact on Australia has been severe as well. We're 100% contact with there. But, I'd say we've started to address to your question our SG&A in our position long before the pandemic. And I'd say that our judgments not only in Australia, but I'd say in Europe, even in Asia. If you look at Europe, we have a 70% flow through on our business there. Australia we've taken -- we think the appropriate SG&A steps there as well as in Asia. Prior to the pandemic, we believe right size some of the business there and it made some very difficult decisions in some areas. And we've invested in some other areas to be able to capitalize on our growth. So I wouldn't limit it to just Australia. I think we're taking what we believe to be the appropriate aggressive steps for these businesses to drive the operating margins. We've said time and time again, we're constantly looking at programs, we're looking at brands. We're looking businesses even stores every element of our business. If it's helping us reach our goals, we want to put our foot on the gas. If not, we're making difficult decisions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you for taking my questions. Just curious about your North American consumer business, your guidance for second quarters is quite robust. Is the trend that you're seeing in April, representative of your outlook for the second quarter? Are you seeing and that strong of a volume growth during the month of April? John Morikis : I would say unprecedented growth in April. Allen Mistysyn : I'll agree with that Steve. And we really started seeing it kick-in about mid-March and that trend has not only continued but accelerated in April. Steve Byrne : And, David Sewell made some comments about trimming the sales force or the personnel in, in the tag group in his remarks. Can you just comment on what you expect SG&A to be in the second quarter versus the first? David Sewell : Yes, we are not trimming just to be clear. We're not trimming personnel in our tag organization. In fact, we'll continue to invest as John talked about it in new stores. We will see the trend in SG&A decline in our in our second quarter. Because of the sales shortfall, we probably won't see the percent of sales improve. But the steps that David talked about in our contingency planning, they're material and as he talked about as we see demand and the trends in demand develop, we have other levers, ready to go to poll, if we need to, but we are not going to be cutting our stores organization. John Morikis : Steve, maybe just to make sure, I'm not sure what you may have picked up or the way we may have said it, but we're always looking at our investments and there are times in our normal business that we might be skinning down in an area and invest in other areas, but I think the idea that is important to hear is our stores businesses, very sound fundamental business that, that we expect to put more gas in that tank every chance we can. Steve Byrne : And if I can just squeeze one more in about housing starts, are your -- are your contractors indicating to you that, it's a slow down driven by a delayed permitting? Or are they also seeing any problems with labor? John Morikis : I don't know that the labor issues coming up right now. I think the, let me go back to the very first part of your question. We don't think that the fundamentals have changed and neither has our position in that market and we feel the gap in The Sherwin-Williams value proposition is wide and I'd say it's growing wider. If you look at rate and this may go back to the question Ghansham asked, so why we have confidence? If you look at, rates are, low housing supply is limited, and while there's some short-term impact to the business, we feel as though the fundamentals are still there. I remind you that we have an exclusive relationship with 18 of the top 20 nationals and front of regionals where we have the opportunity there. We have exclusive with 73 of the top 100. So, there's more opportunity there for us to leverage. And I would tell you that, the value that we bring in distribution our reps, the products even the design tools and local training are really areas that we're focusing on. And so, I'd say our customers right now for the most part are dealing with the short term. But I would tell you the discussions that we're having with them. In fact, last week alone we had discussions with, top all top 10 builders that reached out to us wanting to ensure of our supply chain and our capability to serve them. And I can assure you we're ready more than ready to serve that's part of what gives us confidence. There's going to be some bumps in the road in this quarter no question and maybe rolling a little bit into the two three, who knows that terrific relationships we're going to be right there with them. No one has the responsiveness to serve our customers. I show them lamps. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Koort : I wanted to ask about the CapEx reduction, pretty dramatic decline. I know you've mentioned, John only 50 new store openings, which maybe is about half of what is -- well, is that the bulk of that decline or where else are we seeing the CapEx reduction? John Morikis : Yes, Bob. Within our global supply chain, we are paring back some of the capacity projects that we had scheduled at the start of this year, going into next year. I would tell you that, that decrease of 140 million -- what we'll do throughout the year is monitor again how the demand trends are developing. And as we see -- for instance, our stores architectural start building back up, we'll turn some of those back on, the timing that causes the delay. But I think the 140 million would be kind of your max case. And then, as we see things turn around, we'll start investing back in our plans, in our distribution centers, in the automation to help with our continuous improvement projects and operating efficiencies and things like that. Robert Koort : And I'm sorry if I missed it out, but you gave some guidance on second quarter TAG sales. Did you comment on what the daily receipts in April suggested? We were thinking down 30% or something pretty huge and then moderating, is that reasonable? John Morikis : Actually, our receipts have held up pretty well. I think maybe as we get into early May, we're going to see a gap but then start improving as we get towards the second half of May and into June as -- because as I mentioned, as we look at the progress in our weekly sales, that keeps improving. As we are staying close to our customers, we're not getting a lot of concern about bad debt or solvency of our customers. So right now, as we look at it, I do expect a little bit of slowdown here in early May and maybe mid-May, but then pick up -- start picking up again. Operator : Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question P.J. Juvekar: Hi, John, Al and the team. Good to hear from you. How much of your -- how much is your online ordering up in the quarter from contractors or DIY? And how much of these orders are curbside pickup versus delivery? And longer term, do you think that's a new trend that will remain in place post-COVID? John Morikis : So, you're probably not going to like these answers, other than online is significant. Curbside versus delivery, I'd say the largest part of our -- I'd say it's probably on the contractor side pretty evenly split. Obviously the Do It Yourself curbside delivered right outside of our stores. And I would say regarding the future, yes, we want our customers using this system. We believe it helps in our customers\u2019 efficiency. We think it helps our efficiency. It allows us to be a better partner to them and allows our customers to move seamlessly through our business and really begin utilizing the tools and resources that we have much better. David Sewell : Yes, P.J., it remains to be seen if curbside has staying power. I think by and large know when you look at residential repaint contractors, they liked the interaction with our stores. They like the interaction with our reps. On the DIY side, I think there's some color counseling that, that they like to get while coming into our stores and currently they're really not getting that interaction. So we'll see, they may have some staying power, but I do think there's still a lot of interaction and support they get from our stores on making recommendations on colors and different things like that. John Morikis : But I might add though, P.J. that, the curbside aspect of it, we think that has legs and that, that will continue, as one of the outtakes that customers enjoy, in some cases, the ability to get in and get out. The majority of the customers that come into the morning, start their business, have their crews at our stores, can still do that and those that want to come in and zip out, we'll offer the best of both. P.J. Juvekar: And just related to that, let's say in the future, it's an online order followed by delivery. Does that lower barriers to entry in the business or is it an advantage for you, because you have a local store and you can get there faster? John Morikis : Yes, I\u2019d say it's a huge advantage to us. It's really no different when you think about it. The customer picking up the phone and requesting an order and having us deliver that product to them, it's really no different from that aspect. But I would say that we really enjoy this store platform that we have and the ability to do both, the multipoint distribution capability. We're 30 minutes from you anywhere. And our ability to deliver in quick turnaround or with quick responsiveness, we think is important. But it's also a foundation we believe, because those customers that are in every morning, they're building a partnership with our employees. There's a loyalty that grows. And I'd say that loyalty grows both ways. It grows with the customer to Sherwin and Sherwin to the customer. And we think that distribution is one and albeit one very important aspect of the stores. But we really value our role in our customer success. And I'd say we may have value more than others, because we have a terrific relationship with these customers. But I'd say these are valuable important in building the partnership and that partnership includes problem solving for the customers, training, job management, helping them really run their business and it evolves. It evolves from just a transaction to a strong relationship. And I would tell you 35 years ago when I was in a store, I built some of those strong relationships. And unfortunately about a year and a half ago, I lost mom. And I would tell you, I was shocked. When I went back home and found a few contractors that I served, when I was a store manager that came back and spent time with me there. I think I share that story, because I think it captures the essence of what we do in our stores. We build strong relationships and they last and delivery is important, but we do a lot more than just deliver. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Just want to ask on the Americas Group guidance for the second quarter and the rest of the year. We've talked about this on prior calls, but you've really been gaining a lot of market share. And by my estimation the second quarter you kind of lapped that step up in share again that really started to take hold in the second quarter last year, in that really bad weather period. So when you think about what you're telling us about 2Q and what you're telling us about the balance of the year, is that reflective of sort of how you think the overall do it for me, or just general paint industry is going to do? Or are you still baking in that you're going to continue to gain share even though the comps are may be getting a little harder? John Morikis : We're going to gain share. We've been very clear on that. We're going to gain share and we're just getting started. I look at what's happening and what we're doing during this time and the work that, that leadership team and what they're delivering and I\u2019d say we've got the best people in the field, the best store managers, best reps, they\u2019ve got great resources. And we're making investments, Vincent, during these times that we expect to come out as pretty strong. David Sewell : And Vincent, when you look at those -- we look at the long-term and we got an SG&A question earlier. But as we keep adding reps, we keep adding stores, we invest in the product innovation and e-commerce platform. This is just the confidence that will exit the environment and position better to grow multiple in the end market. And to highlight that point is -- similar to what we saw coming out of the 2008 and '09 recession, and I'll highlight for you, the three, five and 10 year compounded average growth rate of architectural sales in our North America stores grew at a high-single-digit rate in each of those three categories which we believe was a multiple of the end market. And we believe the same dynamics are in this situation. Vincent Andrews : As a follow up, one of the other things we've talked a lot about over the last few years, when we had a low unemployment environment, it was a bit challenging and in periods where there was pent up demand from bad weather to prosecute that demand. But obviously, as we go through the summer, we're unfortunately going to have some pretty unattractive unemployment numbers. And I'm just wondering, have your customers talked to you about they're actually able to go out and hire more painters now. And so maybe we will see a benefit from that, at least for some period of time over the next few quarters? John Morikis : We might, I think it's a little bit early for that, but we might. And again, that's where I want to feel like I'm preaching on this store platform. But I mean if our customers are hiring people that might be less skilled or less experienced, that's where we can shine for them. We work with those customers. It's just the products that we provide and the rheology that we use in our products to make sure that they flow in level better than others, the touch up, the fact that we own our colorants and how the touch up is easier and better. All of that allows maybe a less experienced or less skilled or growing in skill maybe painter to be a producer for our painting contractors. So we like this type of environment where we can shine. And that's what we'll continue to really try to leverage as we move through this process. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Wondering, John, if you can quantify how many of your stores are closed in North America right now? And are those all situations where you've been restricted by the government or are there situations where you have a handful of stores and you've decided to consolidate business from that handful into one or two locations? John Morikis : Yes, Mike, let me have David Sewell answer that one. David Sewell : Hi, Mike. Right now we probably have close to 30 stores in North America that are closed. Those are all -- all those stores are due to government mandate. The team is doing a really nice job in trying to fulfill orders and deliveries from other locations that are open. And then as that continues to hopefully open up those stores, we will immediately open up when the government allow. Mike Harrison : And also I was wondering a little bit about the cadence of demand from contractors as we're probably going to see some slowing in existing home sales and some of these commercial projects may get deferred, your competitor yesterday talked of the coming air pocket in some of that commercial business in particular. Is that something that you see as well or do you think it's going to be steadier? John Morikis : I think there is structures coming out of the ground right now, while there was some delay in getting on those; one, because of the stay in place or stay home; and the other, in some of those areas where they're allowing workers to come in with restrictions. So, there'll be likely some delay in those. But our customers are still feeling good about those. The other thing I would mention is, we track very closely requests for specs, for colors, for data sheets, all things that we look at as data points in helping us to understand kind of the trend and they're very strong. And so we think short-term there's going to be some bumpiness in this quarter. We get that again, second quarter is going to be a challenge. We're going to get through that. And as our contractors and our specifiers and our architects are working on projects, we're going to be the ones right there with them helping them. Mike Harrison : And then just quickly, you guys introduced this microbicidal paint a couple of years ago, Paint Shield. Has that been tested for effectiveness against this coronavirus and are you getting an increased interest in that product for either commercial or residential applications right now? John Morikis : We do but it's not a virus -- it\u2019s not a coating that kills virus. That is a microbicrobial, very easy to say. So, it'll kill some bacteria, but it will not kill a virus. Now that said, we've had an interest as overall health and well-being, the concern of ensuring that you have as safe an environment as possible has helped us in this area. And we do have more interest on that product. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : I was wondering if you can speak to the price contribution embedded in your same-store sales growth. I think you had an increase of 3% to 4% on January 1, perhaps you can lighten us as to how much of that has been realized at this point? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin, that increase has gone as expected and we've realized just under 2% of effectiveness in the quarter. We do expect that to get a little bit better into the second quarter but progressing as planned. Kevin McCarthy : And then secondly, Al, with regard to capital allocation. As we paused share repurchase activity, is it safe to say that M&A activity is likewise paused for some period of time or how would you characterize level of interest for full timer larger acquisitions at this point? Allen Mistysyn : Well, we have a lot of interest in the acquisition. I think what we're continuing to do is work with the teams on generating the targets and filling our pipeline. Obviously, in this environment, it is challenging. That being said, I feel very good about our liquidity, the amount of cash we generate. With 2.5 billion in available liquidity sources, we've done a lot of work pushing our near-term maturities out. So, I feel very good about our balance sheet and our capacity to make M&A as we come out of this and we and we see some of these targets may be coming to the market. So I feel very good about our position. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : John, Al, how should we think about decremental margin in your various businesses in Q2 here? Allen Mistysyn : When you say decremental margin with all the businesses except for our consumer brands being down, what I think you see is all the actions that these groups have taken in continuous improvement, I point to our Performance Coatings Group who -- as we saw demand through the second half of last year slowing, they really have done a nice job controlling costs, improving even -- how their operations are, you saw nice pickup in their first quarter operating margin was up. So, I think, the way I look at it is all the actions that we've taken coming into this, and all the actions we're taking now, I would not expect to see -- it's not dollar for dollar decrement if you will, I think you're going to see better than that. How much? Obviously, it depends on volume. And -- but I think we've done and taken the right action. John Morikis : Yes, I think if you look at that business, particularly the Performance Coatings Group, strong leader Aaron Erter and Todd is in there that are -- for the last over a year period have been really driving -- have a wonderful leadership team beneath them that are really driving expense reductions down to be in a position to leverage everything that we can here. So, I think there's been a lot of good work and it'll only continue. David Begleiter : And John just in Consumer Brands very strong results, are you gaining share in this business or it\u2019s just the underlying growth of the market as we see it right now? John Morikis : It is early to tell. I think, right now we're working very hard to be the best supplier we can and as data comes out, we'll know better. But right now we're trying to build the brand, products and make sure that we're servicing our customers better than anyone else could. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : So John and Al, you all have touched on this quite a bit, but I'm hoping to ask it a little bit differently. In the Americas Group, you're expecting the second quarter sales to be down low-double-digits to mid-teens. And then for the full year, flat to down mid-single-digits. At the low end of the four year guidance I think it implies that revenues improve to kind of a mid-single- digit decline in 3Q and 4Q. Could you just walk us through how you all are getting there? And maybe some of the assumptions that you're making that even at the low end we're going to try to improve versus the second quarter. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Truman. As we start seeing where this is really going to come in and as we start seeing states start opening up and the shelter in place executive orders are removed and job sites start opening up more and we can get back to work, I think as that progresses through the quarter, I expect to see improvement in the trends in the weekly sales rates. And then when you get to the third quarter and the fourth quarter, I expect that to continue. Exterior, even in the second quarter coming into the third quarter, on res repaint, there's opportunities as John talked about. I mean, there are commercial projects that are in place today that need to get painted. There are housing units in place today that need to get painted and we expect those to happen here. It's just timing. So -- and as we carry the additional stores and reps that we put in last year and that we're putting in this year, you would expect the ramp up as we get through the third and fourth quarter. Truman Patterson : And then on the Performance Coatings demand, you're expecting it down high-single-digits to low-double-digits in 2020. Could you just give us an idea of whether you're seeing any of the pricing contracts start to soften, especially in the face of a lower raw material environment? Allen Mistysyn : Truman, make sure just jump on the pricing. The amount of sales we have indexed or tied to an index is probably less than 10% within Performance Coatings, it's less than 3% overall. I just think historically -- and I'll even go back to my experience from 2000 and 2001, industrial just seems to be a slower recovery than the architectural side of our business. Asia-Pacific, which is by and large back to work, is slowly coming -- growing. But I think you'll see China in particular, pick up a lot faster as the U.S. and European economies start getting back on their feet. Our business has a significant component that's export related. And then it's just -- what do you think Europe and Asia -- or I'm sorry, Europe and in North America, how we come out of that. So, it's going to be a little choppy across businesses, across geographies, but like we talked about, I mean, packaging is going strong. We expect that to continue as we get back to work and people driving their cars. We'll start seeing auto refinish picked up as John mentioned. So I just think the cadence is a little bit slower than architectural. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thank you. I'm glad you're all well. You gave us the June quarter sales guidance, but not earnings guidance. Where in your cost structure is the most uncertainty that you can't flow that through? Is it in labor costs or the stores\u2019 cost, raw materials but what are you most uncertain about there in your cost structure? Allen Mistysyn : John, we haven't -- we've given sales guidance only through '18 and '19. I've got no reason to start giving EPS quarterly guidance now. I don't think there's uncertainty around our cost structure. I think the plan, the actions we've taken to reduce our costs, reduce our discretionary spending, hold open item, are all are going to impact the second quarter. But we're not managing the company for the second quarter. We're managing it for the long-term. And we're really looking at the recovery coming out of the third and fourth quarter and really drive our momentum into 2021. That's what we're looking at. John Roberts : Then to come in earlier on the raw material basket being down low-single-digit percent. I assume that\u2019s a price index for the raw materials? Do you have significant inventory of raw materials to work down, your dollar purchases of raws will be down more than that low-single percent? Allen Mistysyn : John. Really the vast majority of our dollars are in bulk tanks at our factory. We're not buying ahead of any material nature. We're staying close to our suppliers and making sure they're able to service us. And in particular, I would say, the team has done a very good job of managing this rapidly increasing unprecedented DIY demand. I think they're retrofitting plants, they\u2019re moving products around to build capacity. And our suppliers have done a terrific job making sure we have the raw materials needed to keep up with that demand. And I think our procurement teams and our global supply chain team need to get a lot of credit for that. But no reason that we would be buying ahead on raw material. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop capital. Please proceed with your question. Garik Shmois : Thanks. I just want to be clear, just on the 2Q Consumer Brands guidance. Does that include the ACE exit and your softer Asian fundamentals? Because if it does, it does seem that the retail piece is running mid-teens if not better if I'm not mistaken? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, it does include both of those. Just one comment on the ACE business that we exited. Because we're getting towards the end of that agreement, I mean we are shipping ACE, the final I would say inventories of the private label in this quarter, it'll be all done. So I would say that from a quarterly standpoint, the second quarter is probably the least impacted and then third quarter will get back to a little heavier, then fourth quarter moderate a little bit just because it's a small quarter. And it does include Asia as well. Garik Shmois : Just want to also follow up just on the comment earlier around exterior here in the Americas gaining momentum. Just wanted to see, is this just seasonal or are you seeing an increase in contractor backlogs as kind of driving some of that momentum that you identified earlier? John Morikis : Yes, I think it's a number of drivers. I think certainly seasonal. When you look at sequential improvement, there's a piece of that. I'd say that our teams are doing a very nice job of really focusing on this business through contractor relationships and as well through product technology. You may recall last quarter I talked about a product that's FlexTemp. We're having really good feedback and interest from residential customers as well as new residential. This is a product that can be applied down to 35 degrees or up to 120 degrees without sacrificing performance or application. And so, it's that type of innovation along with the service and the relationships that we're building in our stores that has us believing that we're going to grow here and outpace the market. Operator : Thank you. We'll move on to our next question, which comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. David Bellinger : So, comparable sales, again very strong here. Can you talk about what you were seeing early in the quarter from an underlying demand perspective? It seems overall housing metrics were improving in a pretty good state. And regarding the early trends of Q2, how long do you think that DIY\u2019s performance, the outperformance there gets pulled up. Is there some potential pull forward in demand out of the back half of the year? John Morikis : I will take a first run at this and let Al jump in. When you asked about our run early, I would say life was really, really good. We were having -- we thought this was the year and we still again feel the fundamentals are there, but we were smoking. On DIY I'd say -- and Al I can come back, if you want to add anything on that? Allen Mistysyn : DIY, I'd say that it's hard to say if you're pulling forward, there might be some of that, we\u2019ll have to see how it unfolds. When you think about the professionals that are going in and doing homes, often times what you'll find is DIY customers more willing to take on projects like a small room, bedroom, living room, whatever, not typically two story foyers, often times exterior is off limits just because the scope of the work there was scaffolding and then the work that goes there and you want to try to complete a project, those projects typically take a longer time. So, DIY consumers are typically more focused on smaller, more manageable projects. And what you see is a lot of activity right now. And quite frankly, we like it. We think that the idea that, that not just the short-term benefits of having customers purchasing products, but the idea that customers are enjoying the benefits of a repaint, we think is a positive longer term. These customers can get an idea of the impact that a relatively low cost investment can have on their home and certainly their mental well-being in the time like this when a lot of people have a lot of anxiety and stress, it's relatively inexpensive.  Some of them they\u2019ll tackle themselves and if some of them down the road say, what I got to go back to work, but this room would look well, look nice, painted as well, then that might carry over as well. But what to see if it's a pull forward, we've mortgaged some of that or not? John Morikis : I think that it will slow as people get back to work and if unemployment ticks up, we don't expect to see a continued surge in DIY. And we're also monitoring on the res repaint side. We believe and again we'll see how this plays out. But by and large that the people that want to do a DIY project aren't going to hire a contract, but people that tend to hire contract, painting contractors to do the work, are going to continue to hire painting contractors. We're not expecting a big hit in our res repaint due to the surge in DIY, and certainly on exteriors, as we talked before. Typically those are going to be done by painting contractors. David Bellinger : God if that's all very, very helpful. And if you could tie your comment there I think towards the pricing increases planned throughout the year. Has there been any data that suggests customer pushback on higher pricing in this environment? And how is that shaping your thinking towards further pricing opportunities from you? Thank you very much. John Morikis : It's not impacted as we can see right now the choice of products. In fact as I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing a positive mix shift in quality. And just like we have in the past, we get together monthly as a management team, review our total cost basket and we make decisions on a monthly basis. And when we do that we talk to our employees, our customers and then we share with the financial community. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with G.Research. please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : I was wondering if you -- one area we didn\u2019t talk about clearly is Latin America. Could you give us a feel for what is happening there in terms of the demand, the shutdown if any or the lack of shutdown, actually, which may create more issues going forward? John Morikis : Sure. Rosemarie, let\u2019s Chile is likely maybe best described as the closest to having normal operations. I'd say Argentina and Ecuador for the most part are closed for most of the time. In Mexico, about 60% of our stores are operating normally and roughly balanced, are running on curbside or -- we got a small, a very small percentage close but for the most part it\u2019s split between the normal and curbside. And then Brazil, I'd say roughly about 34 of our stores are closed. And the remaining open about which is about 53%. Those 53% represents over 70% of our gallon. And so that's through our own stores there. If you look at our business to our dealers, about half of our dealers are closed and about 60% of the home centers are closed but offerings delivery only. So a little bit of a mix in Brazil. Allen Mistysyn : And Rosemarie I just add, in the first quarter, if you look at the impact of FX on our Latin America team it was in the mid-teens and embedded in our Q2 guidance is that accelerate as we see the devaluation in the real, Argentinean peso, the Mexican peso. So that's going to be an additional drag on those businesses in second quarter. Rosemarie Morbelli : So in the past few years, you\u2019ve given us a number of stores in Latin America and in North America, you have now put them both together. Are you still closing down stores in that region? John Morikis : Last quarter, we did close eight in Latin America. And I think this goes back Rosemarie to the point that I made earlier about our ongoing, I\u2019d call it a pretty rigorous review of businesses, brands, customer programs, other investments and we've closed eight. And those were in areas that were persistently soft markets. We've got a terrific leadership team down here as well. And David and that team are working closely together to evaluate every one of these operations.  They're going to stand on their own or they make tough decisions. And we've made some tough decisions. And we'll continue to look at that business. We want to continue to grow that business. There are some dynamics in that market that makes it little more challenging. But we've got a lot of upside potential we should be in as well. Rosemarie Morbelli : And then lastly if I may. Can you talk a little about any changes in the competitive environment? Everyone is trying to gain share. Everyone is trying to offset the impact of the pandemic. Can you give us a feel for what\u2019s going on in the marketplace? John Morikis : Are you talking just whole in general or? Rosemarie Morbelli : Yes. In general, but if you can look at the different areas you're doing business in? John Morikis : Yes, it'd be hard to do that for every part of the company and every region. Maybe I could make this statement that we have a lot of respect for our competitors. A very good global competitors and there are a lot of really good regional competitors. Everyone's business is different. These are really challenging times. We're going to do what's right strategically for us and our customers through our strategic vision and model that works for us. And other companies may be taking a different path. But we have a lot of respect for them and it keeps us motivated and driven. It's a healthy paranoia, if you will, because good competition makes you better, we've got a lot of really good competitors. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : I have two, one is on pricing. You mentioned architectural. Could you talk about Performance Coatings Group, the pricing environment there given everything that\u2019s going on? And then I have a follow-up on stores. John Morikis : Greg, as you know, we\u2019ve kind of been chasing the price and raw material through '18 and '19. So, we did go out with selective price increases in the first -- early in 2020. We talked about the small number of contracts we have on indexing. But I think the dynamics within our Performance Coatings Group are similar to the dynamics that we talk about in our architectural, and that is, we continue to invest in innovation that helps our customers be more effective, more efficient, drive faster line of speeds on their manufacturing lines to drive their total cost of application down. And it's really what we're looking at to move off of just price kind of cost metrics. And I think that's important to continue to focus on and we will continue to do that. And continue to expand our services to our customers to drive growth for both of us. Allen Mistysyn : Help them make more money, help them achieve their goals. Help solve their problems, everything we can do. Greg Melich : Great. And then second on the stores business. What percentage of the orders are you now taking via e-commerce, whether it be either the app or website as opposed to just I guess the phone or walk in order? And are there any products that your customers especially new accounts are asking that you add to the assortment in this environment where you can really leverage the stores network? John Morikis : Regarding the online. I would say this way, Greg. It's a growing, it's a high percentage growth, but it's relatively low overall. So while we're excited with the percentage, it's off of a relatively low phase as we're really now getting behind this. We expect that to continue. And we're going to come out of this better as a result of it.  As far as products that our customers are asking for it, yes, there's some and we're looking into them. We\u2019re likely to find them on our shelves before we talk about that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Are the social distancing practices of Sherwin-Williams uniform across its store network, or are they different in different states? And how do you expect them to evolve from now to the end of the year? Will the state set your guidelines for will you set them? David Sewell : Hi, this is David. Thanks for the question. We have some standard protocols that we follow for social distancing. As our stores come back, the team has done a phenomenal job. There will be details on floors, we will be guiding walkways. So, it's a little different dynamics than say at our manufacturing plant, where Joe Baxter and his team have done a great job of ensuring strong social distancing practices. We follow CDC guidelines at a minimum. We have some healthcare professionals that we consult with as well. So we take that very seriously. And we try to go above and beyond everywhere we can. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And when you think about the next year or two in terms of the value of paint, we're going to go through a period where raw materials are going to come down quite a lot, the consumer is going to be distressed, the contractor market is going to be much loser. Now, Sherwin really likes to price for value as do many coatings companies. Do you think we're going to go through more of a deflationary period in terms of product pricing and paint with raw materials coming down and the margins being good? Or do you think we're going to have more of a continuation of the pattern before the recession, where there would be intermittent general price increases as a base case? John Morikis : Jeff, I think, an important element to keep in mind is the cost structure of a contractor. When you mentioned the Sherwin stores 90% of the cost of goods for a painting contractor is labor. And so our focus is on driving the efficiency and productivity and profitability of that customer through innovative products and services and we'll continue to invest in areas that will help them to do that. And we believe in turn our position with that customer improves and it improves from a loyalty, usage and acceptance standpoint. And so not our intent -- we know we have to be competitive in the marketplace at the price of entry, if you will, into the market. We'll continue to ensure that we're competitive, but we'll also be making those investments we think that will help justify the price that we're charging our customers. Allen Mistysyn : And Jeff, I think that's a very important point by continuing to invest in that innovation and making the painting contractor more effective where they can get more jobs done, the same number of people makes it -- paint such a small portion of their costs. But I would point to, \u201810, \u201811 and \u201812 when we saw the big run up in costs, raw material costs and they rolled over and we by and large held our price \u201813 through \u201816 and we saw a nice improvement in our gross margin. But you can only do that if you\u2019re continuing to invest in products and services that are going to continue to help the painting contractors make more money. John Morikis : Yes, you can't offer commodity products and services and ask for specialty store margins or pricing. Operator : My next question is from Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Perrella : A quick question on inventory levels with the rapid drop in demand, actually you\u2019re guys building into the spring for robust business. I think Al touched on this a little bit. Where are your raw material standing and what to the best of your estimate is a working capital impact in second quarter? John Morikis : Yes, so Chris, we I think did a very good job of managing our inventory. And I would just say that the raw material inventory is much smaller part of our overall inventory, but we did a much better job, a very good job of managing inventory down where we saw weakness in demand and that helped contribute to the 151 million improvement we saw in working capital in our first quarter. I think you're going to -- and we do and did build architectural inventory to what we had planned coming into the season as we're seeing a little bit softer or we're seeing softer sales in our TAG group. We're still seeing, like we've talked about that unprecedented increase in the DIY through the home center channel. So, you've seen a switch and I talked about it earlier about our global supply chain. I mean we're building and producing every gallon we can and we're continuing to look and work with our customers on getting the right products made, getting the right product and inventory into the store shelves, both in our stores and with our retail partners.  So, it's definitely varies. Packaging, we're building inventory as much as we can across all the regions because we continue to see strong demand. But I can assure you we'll continue to manage our inventories lower. And we've done a lot of different things. We've cut -- we have more communication between the selling organization and our supply chain. We've cut batch sizes, we cut safety stock. We've gone to more of a make and ship model in some cases versus make -- versus make to stock. So there\u2019s a lot of leverage that we've pulled and will continue to pull as the demand environment unfolds. Christopher Perrella : And one quick one with the implied sales -- with the sales guidance for 2Q, is there any implied channel draw down in your Performance business? Or is that all basically straight volume out of your factory to the customer? John Morikis : It's all volume out of the factory. So again I think in those markets in particular, the team has done a nice job of driving inventory down, so just more out of the factories. Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. I'd like to pass the floor back over to management for any additional concluding comments. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Jesse. This is Jim Jaye. I just wanted to thank everyone for their questions and interest today. And I hope it came through very clearly on our confidence and determination to manage through this near-term as we go forward. Before we sign off today, I just want to do a housekeeping note to all of you. We will be postponing our Annual Financial Community presentation, which was scheduled for June 3rd in New York City this year. It's our intent to reschedule that event hopefully later this year. We don't have that date yet but as we have details, we'll let us know whether that's going to be a virtual presentation or not. So, thank you. As always, I along with my colleague Eric Swanson will be available for follow-ups. And please contact Natalie Darr in our office to be added to the queue. And thank you. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Once again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

Thank you for joining The Sherwin-Williams Company\u2019s Review of Second Quarter 2020 Results and our Outlook for the Third Quarter and Full Fiscal Year of 2020. With us on today\u2019s call are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; Al Mistysyn, CFO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at sherwin.com beginning approximately 2 hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the day on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company\u2019s earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy during the pandemic. Let me begin with some high level summary comments on the quarter. All comparisons are to the second quarter of 2019, unless otherwise stated. Overall Sherwin-Williams delivered a very good second quarter given the environment. Total company consolidated sales were in line with the updated guidance we provided on June 22 with sequential improvement in each month of the quarter. Despite sales being down for the quarter, we delivered year-over-year improvement in gross margin, profit before tax, EBITDA, diluted net income per share and net operating cash. Second quarter 2020 consolidated sales decreased 5.6% to $4.6 billion, inclusive of negative currency impact of negative 1.5%. The estimated negative impact from COVID-19 on consolidated sales was approximately 8%. Consolidated gross margin increased 330 basis points to 48% from 44.7%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $71.7 million or 10.6% to $747.4 million. Diluted net income per share increased 28.8% to $6.48 per share from $5.03 per share. The second quarter of 2020 included acquisition related amortization expense of $0.62 per share. The second quarter of 2019 included acquisition related amortization expense and other adjustments of $1.54 per share. As described in the Regulation G reconciliation table included in our press release. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.1% to $7.10 from $6.57. Adjusted EBITDA increased $57.5 million to $979 million or 21.3% of sales. Net operating cash increased 42% year-to-date to $1.07 billion or 12.3% of sales. Segments sales were also in line with the updated guidance we provided on June 22. Segment margin in The Americas Group improved to 23.8% of sales, driven by favorable customer and product mix, lower input costs and reduced spending. Adjusted segment margin in the consumer brands group increased to 26.5% of sales, resulting from operating leverage on the nearly 22% top line growth and lower input costs, as well as actions taken over the past year to improve our international operating margins. Adjusted segment margin in the Performance Coatings Group decreased to 13.6% of sales, where lower input costs and good spending control were able to offset some, but not all of the impact of the high teens sales decline. Additional details on our segment performance are included in the slide deck provided with our press release and available on our website. Let me now turn the call over to John Morikis, for some additional commentary on the quarter and our outlook. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Let me begin by thanking the more than 60,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams for their continued determination and resilience under very challenging circumstances. As I mentioned on our last call, our senior leaders have persevered through several previous crises. Their experience has been a true differentiator during this time and enabled us to deliver significant improvement across many measures in the quarter. Our entire team has my appreciation and respect, as they continue to serve our customers at a high level. The quarter played out better than we anticipated with the pace of year-over-year decline decreasing sequentially throughout the quarter. Consolidated sales were down by a mid teens percentage in April, but came out of the quarter with June flat to last year. The pace of recovery was faster than expected in some end markets, which led us to revise our sales guidance on June 22. As Jim mentioned, gross margin in the quarter expanded to 48%, driven by favorable customer and product mix and lower input costs. The industry basket of raw materials was down by mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter compared to the prior year. In terms of cost control, our team quickly developed and began implementing a comprehensive contingency plan in March to adjust to the pandemic. We reduced the SG&A spending in the quarter by $40 million, but also maintain strategic investments to support long-term growth. Let me talk a bit about trends we\u2019re seeing in each of our segments before moving on to our outlook. In The Americas Group, we\u2019re now into the summer painting season and no one is better positioned to serve professional painters than we are. We\u2019ve safely and responsibly opened all our store sales force in the U.S. and Canada and customers in all segments tell us they\u2019re eager to get back to work. Last quarter, we commented that we believed that we were seeing a pause in demand rather than demand destruction. We still believe this is the case based on the momentum we saw in multiple segments as the quarter progressed. While we don\u2019t typically comment on the pace of business by month, I would like to provide a few data points that maybe helpful given the current extraordinary circumstances. In DIY our business continued to grow at an unprecedented pace and was robust throughout the quarter. After DIY, new residential and residential repaint were the best performers in the quarter and both recovered to deliver positive growth in June. Commercial improved in each month of the quarter and was down slightly in June. Property maintenance and protective and marine also improved sequentially, but have not yet returned to grow. From a product perspective, exterior paint is recovering faster than interior paint, as you would expect due to social distancing requirements. Exterior paint sales increased by mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter and with June being the strongest month in the quarter. The interior paint sales decreased by low-single-digit percentage in the quarter, but improved throughout the quarter, finishing June flat to last year. Additionally, spray equipment pump sales are often a good indicator of future demand as contractors are unlikely to invest in this type of equipment, unless they anticipate significant future demand. Spray equipment and pump sales were down mid single digits in the quarter, but recovered to finish strong in the month of June. Pricing came in as we expected and was approximately 2% in the second quarter. We expect a similar level of effectiveness in the third quarter. We still anticipate opening approximately 50 new stores this year, while continuing to focus on adding sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products and productivity enhancing services. We also continue to invest in our e-commerce platform and we\u2019re pleased with the continuing uptick in usage. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. DIY demand surged throughout the quarter, driven by consumers nesting and tackling home improvement projects during the pandemic. We generated strong double-digit growth by working closely with our retail customers to capture this demand, most notably Lowe\u2019s, our exclusive national home center partner. Our global supply chain organization continued to adapt and invest during the quarter, including pivoting from 5 gallon pails to single gallon cans on multiple production lines to help meet the unprecedented DIY demand. Internationally, we saw positive growth in Europe, while China and Australia remained soft. We leveraged the strong sales growth to drive significant operating margin improvement compared to the prior year. Our margin improvement also reflects the benefit of actions taken over the past year to focus our portfolio, including rationalizing SKUs, exiting the ACE private label business, streamlining our European business, and reducing costs in Asia and Australia. This enhanced profitability will enable us to reinvest in the business to drive long-term growth for our retail partners, especially in the Handyman remodeler, pros who paint category. Lastly, let me comment on the trends in the Performance Coatings Group. Demand improved sequentially across the group in the quarter, though the pace of improvement remained variable by geography and business unit. From a geographic perspective, Asia was the strongest performer in the quarter, down by a low-single-digit percentage. All other regions were down by double-digit percentages, though North America was significantly better than Europe and Latin America. In packaging, sales were positive in every region for the quarter and were up a high-single-digit percentage. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. In coil coatings, the resumption of selected commercial construction projects drove sequential improvements during the quarter, including exiting the quarter positively in June. This improvement aligns with my earlier comments on commercial construction within the TAG segment, which improved sequentially in the quarter. In industrial wood, we saw sequential sales improvement during the quarter. Many of the end markets served by this business including furniture, kitchen cabinetry and flooring are influenced by trends in new residential construction, which has gained momentum in our TAG business as I mentioned earlier. In general industrial, most end markets including heavy equipment, agriculture, transportation and general finishing, remained soft, though the business did improve sequentially. Encouragingly, general industrial was up high-single digits in Asia for the quarter. All other regions were down double-digit percentages in the quarter. In automotive refinish, miles driven and traffic congestion remain at reduced levels. We saw sequential improvement in the business during the quarter, though a return to growth continues to depend on the lifting of stay-at-home orders and the resumption of more normal travel routines. Certainly, the pandemic is not over, and numerous uncertainties in the economic environment remain. However, to the extent that economies are beginning to shift from the containment phase to the recovery phase of the pandemic, our team is energized and engaged to capture current opportunities and deliver above market growth. We anticipate third quarter demand to improve sequentially from the second quarter but softness to continue in some end markets in the U.S., and internationally for the remainder of 2020. Against this backdrop, we anticipate third quarter 2020 consolidated net sales will be up or down by a low-single-digit percentage versus the third quarter of 2019. Looking at our operating segments for the third quarter, we anticipate The Americas Group to be flat to up by a low-single digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up a low-double digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be down by low to mid-single digit percentage. For the full year 2020, we\u2019re revising our sales guidance upward modestly to approximately flat with last year. This guidance reflects continued uncertainties in the timing and pace of improvement in the U.S. and global operating environments. On an operating segment basis for the full year, we anticipate The Americas Group to be flat to up by a low-single-digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up by a high-single-digit percentage, and Performance Coatings Group to be down by a low to mid-single-digit percentage. We are revising our diluted net income per share guidance for 2020 to be in the range of $19.21 to $20.71 per share compared to our previous guidance of $16.46 to $18.46 per share, and compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $2.54 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2020 earnings per share of $21.75 to $23.25, an increase of 6.5% at the midpoint over the $21.12 we delivered last year. Embedded within our outlook is the assumption that the industry raw material basket will be lower for the full year by a mid-single digit percentage. Based on our current outlook, we expect the second quarter will be the most beneficial in terms of year-over-year deflation. We expect the second half benefit will be less than the first half benefit, given comparisons to the deflation we saw in the back half of 2019. Let me close with some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remains the strength of the company. At June 30, 2020, we had $188 million in cash, and approximately $3 billion of unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities. Our leverage ratio improved to 2.8 times on total debt to adjusted EBITDA compared to 3.3 times a year ago. Given the improving sequential demand we are seeing in several end markets, we\u2019re raising our CapEx guidance for the year from $180 million to $280 million. This is largely related to architectural and packaging capacity expansions restarting. This CapEx guidance includes a minimal amount of spending related to our new headquarters and R&D facility project. Earlier this month, the company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $1.34 per share, an increase of 18.6% over the $1.13 per share dividend paid in the second quarter of 2019. We are committed to maintain this dividend increase throughout the rest of 2020. In May, we paid off $429 million in 2.25% notes that were due. Our next long-term debt maturity is $25 million due in 2021, followed by $660 million due in 2022. We paused open market share purchases during the second quarter, believing it inappropriate to be buying shares at a time when we were forced to adjust our workforce and pause multiple spending programs. Again, given a stabilizing environment, we would expect to return to repurchases in the second half of the year, with a minimum goal of offsetting dilution from options. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have a long tenured and experienced management team that has successfully managed the company through many challenging times. They have demonstrated this ability once again over the last several months, and I\u2019m confident they will continue to deliver strong results. We also believe the long-term fundamental strengths of our end markets remain intact. We have the people, the products and the services to help our customers succeed. We remain very confident about the future and our ability to create shareholder value over the long-term. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Chris Parkinson : Thank you. So, you seem to have some pretty solid margin results, especially in Consumer. I wish \u2013 I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a testament to a few different variables, but primarily the amount of volumes just moving through the system and leveraging what you\u2019ve been refining as your U.S. cost base. You\u2019ve often spoken about 20% annualized margins in Consumer Brands from 13% level to time of the Valspar acquisition. Can you update us on your long-term thoughts on this target and what you\u2019ve learned further about this platform in a COVID-19 environment? Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Hey, Chris, this is Al Mistysyn. Hope you\u2019re doing well. Yes, I think we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making on operating margin within Consumer Brand. I think you\u2019re right; it\u2019s too soon to come off our long-term margin target of that 20% range. As we\u2019ve always talked about, volume is the single biggest driver of leverage across all our businesses. And with the unprecedented surge we\u2019re seeing in DIY across all channels, that is absolutely driving the majority of the margin improvement. And you would expect, and we expect that the demand will return to more normalized levels as the year progresses. That being said, there absolutely is good cost control taking place in North America. As you recall, we exited the ACE business last year. That helped improve our gross margin, our operating margin. We took action to reduce our footprint and costs around that. And we\u2019ve also taken action, as John talked about in his opening remarks, on our international businesses. We\u2019ve commented before, the performance of those businesses haven\u2019t been up to what we expect. I think the team has done a nice job with a variety of things; pricing actions, SKU rationalizations to make those operations more efficient, cost reductions and even in \u2013 we talked about the European flow through. In our first quarter we saw a nice similar improvement in flow through on our second quarter, and then even in Asia and Australia where we saw sales backwards, we\u2019re still positive on profit. So there\u2019s a number of factors that are allowing us to drive these margins, but volume is always first. John Morikis : Yes. And Chris, I would just add a couple of other items. One is, I do think we\u2019re operating more efficiently this year versus last year in serving our customers. I think that\u2019s a tribute to our global supply chain team doing a really terrific job and better planning and execution. We\u2019re more efficient I think this year in serving our customers; we\u2019re optimizing our supply chain better. We\u2019re doing this, I might add, while investing CapEx in areas such as our filling lines and dealing with the COVID challenges that everyone is dealing with. And I\u2019d like to just call out our global supply chain team during this really challenging time, this COVID issue. There\u2019s a team that\u2019s working 24/7 throughout all of this to serve our customers and to help our customers win. So I think we\u2019re being a little more effective in utilizing and optimizing our supply chain. You also asked about the COVID-19 environment and what we\u2019re learning. And I would say for me, what that\u2019s done is it\u2019s really reinforced the importance of our strategy. We have long spoken about this approach that we\u2019re taking on really driving value for our shareholders by focusing on what\u2019s right, where our customers value our solutions. And the other approach that I\u2019d say is we\u2019re really focused on covering all the bases. And I think what\u2019s happening right now, you asked about the DIY, is a great example. We\u2019ve got a terrific focus on our residential repaint. But we\u2019ve also been really focused on helping our customers grow DIY. And we take that approach in each of the markets we serve. So, whichever way the table tilts, we want to be first-in-line right there. So if it\u2019s DIY versus res repaint, if it\u2019s new residential versus remodeling, if it\u2019s commercial \u2013 new versus commercial repaint or whatever segment pops up, we want to be number one there. Chris Parkinson : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And the second question that I have is just it does appear that you have some potential emerging I would characterize them as structural tailwinds in both resi repaint and likely new resi, based on what some of your customers are talking about for the second half, but probably more importantly for 2021. Can you just update us on your general housing views? Any comments on reverse urbanization? And just your efforts to accelerate share gains? And if you could sneak in a comment also about how that\u2019s playing into your intermediate to long-term outlook versus the non-resi and protective fronts, which look a little less bullish, that would greatly be appreciated. Thank you. John Morikis : Well, you pretty much covered the entire company with that question, Chris, so yes. Chris Parkinson : I apologize. John Morikis : No. It\u2019s good. It\u2019s good. We love it. Let me start with the res repaint. We did see sequential improvement in the quarter. It turned positive in June largely driven by the exteriors that we talked about. We do see customers delaying interior work, that\u2019s related to the COVID-19 as you would expect. It\u2019s very uncommon to hear of projects that have been canceled, so we expect the interior to return, albeit probably gradually. To your point about our share gains there in res repaint, it is an area of focus. We are very pleased with the performance and we\u2019ve been talking quite a while about this idea of new accounts and share of wallet. And we\u2019re really trying to drive this. And we\u2019re really trying to bring more solutions to our customers right now than ever before. And this is an environment where our solutions add value. Complexity and challenges that our customers face, they allow us to demonstrate our solutions. And we are we believe uniquely positioned to help our customers to deliver. They want high quality projects. They want product on time. They want it efficiently. And they want to make more money. And we help them do that. And I believe when you dial it down, and there\u2019s a lot of detail into it, but if you look at it, I think it\u2019s \u2013 our stores are where they\u2019re needed, our products are where they\u2019re needed, our innovation is where it\u2019s needed. Our people are trained, they\u2019re knowledgeable. We hire the best. We do everything we can to keep them. Our voluntary turnover is in single digits, so we\u2019ve built these terrific relationships with customers and we work really hard to make them successful. And while these customers are experiencing delays or new regulations, if it\u2019s COVID or just emotions that they\u2019re dealing with customers, there\u2019s no room for errors, no room for disruptions. And our stores and our reps and those relationships help us tremendously. As it relates to commercial, I would say we saw sequential improvement in the second quarter, the pace of recovery, I would say has been more muted than the residential side. Projects have started to reopen and may have some limitations to them as our contractors are learning to work with social distancing and the limits around them of how many workers can be on a project and its slowing efficiency for our contractors. As a reminder I might say that new commercial starts are typically painted 12 to 18 months after the ground is broken. So we\u2019ve got a little runway here. But as far as we see, this is again a terrific opportunity. These are contractors who \u2013 these are typically very large projects. They\u2019re bid projects so they\u2019re competitive and these customers; they don\u2019t want delays or problems. And they learn to lean on our teams to be able to run their project successfully. Trend wise, I would say that the \u2013 when you look at the Architectural Billings Index, it\u2019s improved sequentially. In May, it was 32. It\u2019s now in June up to 40, still below the 50 expansion threshold that shows it\u2019s growing. But we remain pretty optimistic about this. It\u2019s \u2013 particularly in the area of new construction. While our customers are challenged, we think that it\u2019s a terrific way for us to be able to demonstrate what it is that we do and why it\u2019s special. And the last thing I would say is we\u2019re working really, really hard here in the area of specifications both in product and color. And that\u2019s an important metric that we monitor. So we actually gauge. When we talk with you folks about why we have confidence and we do, it\u2019s driven by the number of color requests we get, the number of data sheets and information we get. We monitor all of that. And the pipeline looks very good to us. So we\u2019re feeling good about our position, feeling good about what our customers are telling us, and we\u2019re really feeling good about the ability of our people to be able to deliver for them. What was the last one you talked about? The protective and marine or the industrial side. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve seen \u2013 we\u2019ve seen sequential improvement during the quarter. It\u2019s not returned back into year-over-year growth. Protective and marine, about 40% of our sales are tied to oil and gas, and that\u2019s obviously fallen sharply over the last quarter. Major oil and gas companies have delayed CapEx projects, which will continue to impact our results. But these aren\u2019t decorative products that we\u2019re talking about \u2013 or projects, I mean that we\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re most often very corrosive environments and they require corrosion control to protect the assets and protect safety of the employees and those around it as well as the environment. So we\u2019re focused on that business to continue to grow, there\u2019s still penetration opportunities. We\u2019re also focused on other areas like water, waste water, the flooring, the rail and we\u2019re gaining very good ground there. But given the weight that we have in the oil and gas, we expect while we\u2019re gaining in some of these other segments, we would expect to see meaningful growth what\u2019s most likely beginning in 2021 in protective and marine. Chris Parkinson : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Long answer, Chris. That was a long question, so. Chris Parkinson : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. With volumes down in the quarter, did you dip into lower cost inventory layers in your cost of goods sold? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Jeff, we\u2019re \u2013 as you know, we\u2019re a LIFO, last in, first out, kind of company, so you might see a little bit of that. But we churn our raw materials so quickly, especially in this kind of environment on the architectural side with DIY, it\u2019s not meaningful in that respect because of the turns that we get. The just-in-time inventory that our suppliers do a great job keeping up with us and this environment, with the DIY surge that we talked about, a lot of impact on gallon cans and other specific raw materials related to that. So it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re churning our inventories very quickly on raw materials. Jeff Zekauskas : So what really happened in terms of the gross margin in the second quarter? In that year-over-year, maybe your sales are down $275 million and your gross profits are flat to up, and your gross margin is up about 300 basis points. And even versus the first quarter, maybe your incremental gross margin is 70%. What was the thing \u2013 was it really volume in the Consumer Brands business or like what unusual thing happened in the second quarter so you have your cost of goods sold down, I don\u2019t know 10% or 11% year-over-year? Al Mistysyn : Right. No, Jeff, I think there\u2019s a number of things that are occurring in our second quarter that give us a tailwind. You bring up \u2013 you talk about the volume through our Consumer Brands Group that we just talked about on the previous question with Chris. When you see that kind of volume, and in our first quarter, we also talked about customer and mix change. And that\u2019s across really each of the segments. In some respects, you got TAG that we talked about with DIY and res repaint performing better than the other segments. We talked about from a product standpoint exterior growing faster than interior, paint growing faster than non-paint. I talked about the exiting of the ACE business that as you know it was a drag on our gross margin. That helps. And then we did see \u2013 as John talked about in the opening comments, lower raw material costs. And we expected to see that in our second quarter with the way raw materials trended last year and with our second quarter likely being our biggest year-over-year change. And then even \u2013 I would say, even within our Performance Coatings Group with the different segment growths and the different region growths, there\u2019s a mix there that helps. And then finally, as TAG performs better than Performance Coatings, that segment mix gives you some lift. So it\u2019s really a combination of a number of those things happening. But I would say with PCG, for example, the consumer businesses outside of the U.S., this is hard work being done over the past year to get us in line for whatever happens. And when volume comes back, I would expect to see both of those areas even improve faster. Jeff Zekauskas : All right. Great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s a remarkable margin. Al Mistysyn : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi. Good morning, everyone. John Morikis : Good morning, Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi : Yes, so on the do-it-yourself growth, you saw explosive demand towards the end of the first quarter, and clearly that level was sustained throughout the second quarter. Was the 20% plus increase in Consumer Brands for 2Q purely matching demand or was there some level of inventory replenishment as well? And just more broadly at the company level, including at TAG, how are you kind of thinking about any sort of do-it-yourself fatigue, given that some of the demand increase is potentially just a pull forward of activity as well? John Morikis : Well, let me just start with \u2013 I think what you\u2019re getting at is the service to the retailers. Is that correct when you talk about service? Ghansham Panjabi : Correct. John Morikis : Well, we\u2019ve seen obviously an unprecedented level here. And the surge has been some \u2013 invited some challenge, obviously. Our teams have adapted I would say, Ghansham, decisively and quickly. But the surge was significant, and it\u2019s created some challenges. We\u2019re uniquely positioned, I think, at Sherwin-Williams to utilize assets that others might not have. And I would tell you we\u2019re pulling every lever possible. We\u2019re determined. But I would say that we\u2019re still chasing. We believe that we\u2019ll be in a position to begin building inventory again as we come out of the third quarter, going into the fourth quarter, into the first quarter. But right now, we\u2019re focused on meeting demand. And again I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t call out this terrific effort by the global supply chain team with everything they\u2019re doing in this environment, but also the ability to work with our customers. These are unprecedented times, not only for us, but also our customers. So the better line of sight that we have to be able to isolate in on what are the most important skews and working with them to deliver is really what we\u2019re after. And this is a new experience. We\u2019ll come out of this better. And we\u2019ll likely sit with our customers at the end of the year and talk about inventory levels as we begin next season. And if we need to step up and put more in inventory to serve our customers, we\u2019re going to take care of our customers. As it relates to DIY, I think fatigue as you mentioned it, we don\u2019t support that attitude by any customer, by the way. Reality is that we find that the more customers are home, more \u2013 and different customers are coming in. And in our stores, it\u2019s often referred to as it\u2019s a COVID project, where people have been in their home for some time and they might have a bedroom that they\u2019ve never really considered repainting. And they realize that it\u2019s very affordable and highly impactful project. And they tackle it. The beauty of it is, is that what we\u2019re finding is very little overlap from customers coming in. And while I\u2019m sure there are some, but it seems to be very little where customers are talking about this was a project that I was going to have a contractor do and I\u2019m going to tackle it myself. These are what we\u2019re getting from our customers in our stores are customers that are looking at a wall that\u2019s probably not been painted, likely wouldn\u2019t have been painted, and they\u2019re painting them. And so through our stores, it\u2019s a relatively small percentage. There\u2019s a nice gain. It\u2019s only 10% sales through our stores. But through our retail partners we\u2019re doing everything we can to make that an easy experience so that it\u2019s not just one project. We want it to be easy. Your question is, do they have fatigue? We want to make it a wonderful experience so it\u2019s an easy, impactful experience that they went through seamlessly and they want to do more. And we\u2019re working with our retail customers to capture those customers and make them repeat customers going forward. Al Mistysyn : And Ghansham, I\u2019d just add. It\u2019s not only an investment in inventory that we\u2019re doing, I think our global supply chain has come up with a number of creative solutions to expand capacity of the key product lines where we\u2019re chasing demand. And that\u2019s everything from investing in capital to retrofit 5 gallon lines which are predominantly pro to gallon lines as John talked about in the opening remarks. It\u2019s finding where we may have capacity in industrial sites that have the ability to make an exterior stain product line and ramping that quality process up and to make sure we\u2019re providing the right quality and the right process but doing it quickly to try to improve our filling rates across all the different channels. So it\u2019s not just investments in inventory, we\u2019re looking at all areas to expand our capacity. John Morikis : Yes, and you look at those assets, those facilities that are producing stain, for example, for our industrial wood where we\u2019ve got capacity right now, and these are highly technical products. So the finished product to the consumer is every good \u2013 every bit as good as if it had been manufactured in existing plant because the tight specs we operate on the industrial side. So it\u2019s really the best of asset utilizations you can get. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. And then just for my second question, given the recurrence of COVID in the southern states of the U.S., have you seen any directional shifts in demands specific to states like Florida and Texas? And do you anticipate having to make some adjustments to your sales floors being open? Thanks so much. John Morikis : We don\u2019t at this time anticipate having to adjust sales floors. I would tell you that our customers and our employees love those sales floors open, but number one is the safety of our employees. So we\u2019ll stay close to it. As of right now, we\u2019ve not. And I\u2019m not sure if you were asking about the shift of business to the southern states? If you were, I would say, we\u2019ll take it anywhere it comes. If it\u2019s in that market and it starts moving aggressively, we\u2019ll do everything we can to serve those customers wherever they are. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. Thanks so much. John Morikis : Thank you, Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort : Thank you. Good morning. Al Mistysyn : Good morning, Bob. Bob Koort : I wanted to ask about China. One of your big competitors, I think they\u2019ve got an even larger business than you on the deco side there, and talked about trends getting about back to where they were before by the end of the quarter. So I was wondering, is there anything in particular to your business the cities you serve, the routes to market that would make it different and sort of what are your prospects there given that we hope maybe that the lockdown ending sooner there you would see a sooner response. Maybe something about the DIY versus pro or do-it-for-me or how can you help us characterize the trends in China? John Morikis : Well, there\u2019s very little if any DIY business there typically in China. But the approach that I would take first off is that it\u2019s a relatively small percentage of our business. We saw sales in Asia that were down significantly in the second quarter largely as a result of the COVID pandemic in architectural. We think that that\u2019s a slower recovery in the architectural business there. But again, it\u2019s really a very, very small piece of our business. We\u2019re there really looking at the future. We\u2019re investing in the right people, the right \u2013 we\u2019re doing a lot of branding work, doing a lot of research. We\u2019ve got a couple of really good tests going on right now that have gotten a little cloudy with everything that\u2019s been going on, on different aspects of our business, so. I think you should expect from our perspective that to be a bigger part of the business down the road, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going be anything that\u2019s going be material in the next quarter or even next year. Bob Koort : Got you. Let me ask you on commercial construction broadly. Obviously, you got the coil business there and you do see some of that activity through your stores group. Is there some angst that you\u2019re going have a W kind of recovery there where we get some of the backlog finally gets through but then the commercial markets just aren\u2019t as strong given all the work from home and other issues out there? What do you sort of see as the path-forward into the second half and into 2021 for commercial construction-related activity? John Morikis : Well, to your point, we are close to that through the commercial business through our TAG business and through coil. I would say in our coil business, the resumption of select projects, it drove sequential improvement during the quarter. And I would say that so much so that we finished June positive in June. So I mean we see that momentum moving in the right direction. Not sure if there\u2019s going be an air pocket or a gap, if it does happen or when it will happen. What we\u2019re doing, Bob, we\u2019re working really hard right now to minimize any impact. We call it \u2013 I call it a pothole. We\u2019re driving down the road here. We\u2019re doing everything we can to fill that pothole. And the beauty of our model, the direct model, is that we can control that. And so we\u2019re working with our customers to understand where those projects are. So we\u2019re not waiting for customers to call and place an order or go online to place an order. We\u2019re attacking this. We know the specifications. We\u2019re trying to get more products specified. We know those projects. We know the painting contractors that are on those commercial projects. And we\u2019re leveraging our strategy, and we\u2019re capitalizing on the segments that we offer to offset whatever might be coming down the road. So I\u2019d say no one\u2019s positioned like we are to capitalize on these opportunities. But rest assured, we\u2019re not a retailer that just simply opens a door and waits for people to come in. We\u2019re out there right now hunting. We know that there might be a hole in the road. We\u2019re not waiting. We\u2019re aggressively going after it to fill it. Depending on what it looks like if there\u2019s a gap or not and how much there is, we\u2019ll find out if we experience one. But I would say this, if we do experience one, we think it will be short-lived. Bob Koort : Terrific. Thanks for the help. John Morikis : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. So, John, you were just talking there about your folks are out there hunting, and I recalled part one of the ways you motivate that sales force within The Americas Group to be aggressive and out there on the hunt was a reasonably large portion of their comp was variable. Can you remind me what that is? And while it incentivizes effort, does it also contribute to lower cost of goods when there is a slowdown in sales? John Morikis : Its \u2013 for our reps, it\u2019s about a 60/40. We do not look at this as a cost saving mechanism, Steve, at all. I\u2019d say, like everyone, we expect that our employees are motivated by our incentive plans. That\u2019s why we have them. But I would say, one of our executives this morning, I was speaking with mentioned a keyword to me, pride. Pride in what we do, pride in who we are, pride in wanting to win. And I\u2019d say, this team we\u2019re leading right now, I\u2019d call them goats. These are the best. And there\u2019s an element here of incentives, and we want them to be out there to provide for their families. But they\u2019re driven by far more than that. There\u2019s a sense of pride in what we do. And we want to win. And we don\u2019t want to win by a little bit. We want to really, really win. I\u2019m going to stop right there. There\u2019s a lot of really good people doing what\u2019s right there. Steve Byrne : And so just getting back to the cost of goods decline in TAG was so significant. Can you break that out? What portion of that was lower raw material cost? And what were the key drivers there? I think you also had some store closures. Was that a contributor? Can you just lay that all out a little bit, please? John Morikis : Yes. Why don\u2019t I take the stores, and then I\u2019ll ask Al to talk about the rest there for a second. So year-over-year, we have 68 more stores this year versus last year, given what we laid in last year. We have 178 more reps this year versus last year. For the year, we\u2019ve opened 16 new stores in North America. And that\u2019s offset by the closure of about 33 stores. 24 of those were in Latin America, nine in North America. Steve, the way I\u2019d point to the Latin America closures were these were underperforming stores in persistently soft markets. That\u2019s the way I would characterize those. The nine in North America that were closed were mainly stores in Canada that were underperforming. And we did have some stores in North America with lease expirations that we\u2019ll plan to relocate. We do expect to open 50 new stores this year, down from our originally planned 80 to 100 due to the COVID. But you should expect us to ramp back up into that 80 to 100 going forward. Al Mistysyn : And Steve, the TAG, starting with their customer and product mix that I talked about earlier, the DIY and res repaint performed better than the other segments, exterior versus interior and paint versus non-paint helped drive margin improvement. On the raw material side, we\u2019ve talked about ROS moderating. It\u2019s less of an impact on our architectural businesses, but it is still helping in pricing. We went out with a 3% to 4% price increase to offset other inflationary items, whether it\u2019s wages, healthcare, and the like, and that price increase is performing as expected and its effectiveness of around 2%. And then the last thing, I would say is, the team did a really nice job pivoting and really reducing discretionary spending, cutting travel very rapidly, and our SG&A was even down year-over-year, so all those helped drive that operating margin higher. Steve Byrne : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. John and Al, just looking at TAG, looking at the margins in Q3, how should we be thinking about the incremental margins either year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter given what you\u2019re seeing on ROS and volumes here? Al Mistysyn : Yes, David, I mean we\u2019re not going to give guidance on individual segments. But you look at a couple \u2013 I\u2019ll give you a couple of data points to hopefully help you out. One is, we\u2019re going up against a strong third quarter in TAG of last year. Same-store sales were up in North America a little over 8%. They had strong operating leverage on those sales. And so we\u2019re going to go up against a pretty tough quarter. We\u2019re going to start investing back in the business, as John talked about, the advertising and merchandising that we paused is going to come into our third quarter, but we also expect to see better volume. As we talked about, same-store sales were down in the second quarter, 6.9%, our forecast right now in the third quarter for sales to be flat to up low-single-digits. And as we talked about, the better volumes we can put through our North America stores and the chain, the better leverage we get. So, whether we see sequential margin improvement will depend on where that volume comes in. If it\u2019s at the higher end of our range, we have a shot at getting sequential improvement. If not, it\u2019s going be difficult to get there. And then, year-over-year, the way ROS kind of have unfolded through last year and into this year and the product mix benefit I still expect to get in the third quarter, year-over-year, I do expect to see some modest improvement. David Begleiter : That\u2019s very helpful, Al. Appreciate that. And lastly, just on ROS, Al, where are you seeing raw materials decline? And specifically, on TiO2, what\u2019s your expectation for pricing in the back half of the year? John Morikis : Yes. David, I\u2019ll take that one. What we saw in our second quarter, the industry basket of ROS was down by mid-single-digits year-over-year and that was really driven by resins and solvents, and we don\u2019t provide the specific dollars in the quarter, but you can see that positive trend reflected in our year-over-year gross margin improvement. If we look at our outlook kind of going forward, our second quarter we expect will probably be the biggest benefit year-over-year. We still will see \u2013 and that\u2019s really because we\u2019re going to see tougher comparisons in the second half of the year. We do expect that the second half raw material basket will be down by mid-single-digit percentage overall, similar to the first half. And as Al mentioned a moment ago, it\u2019s a little more heavily weighted towards the industrial part of our business than \u2013 the benefit will be a little more there than on the architectural side. So for the full year, we\u2019re going to be down mid-single-digits or that\u2019s the expectation on ROS and that\u2019s compared to our \u2013 earlier this year, we said it would be down low single. So we\u2019re seeing some good benefit there again driven by resins and solvents. If you look at the petrochem side of the basket, we\u2019re seeing lower year-over-year propylene and ethylene pricing. More recently though what I would say is we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a sequential tick up in ethylene and propylene contracts and we\u2019ll see how that plays out as the year goes forward. On the TiO2 side of the basket, we\u2019re still anticipating stable pricing trends in the back half. Some of the third-party forecast that we look at are reflecting a little bit more economic resiliency than some of the prior forecasts, sustained by the DIY demand. I would say the North American TiO2 market has been the most stable and we have seen some indications of lower sulfate TiO2 pricing internationally. But as you know, the majority of our TiO2 buy is chloride-based TiO2, which we really haven\u2019t seen movement there. So to sum that up, again, we\u2019re going to \u2013 similar kind of in the back half, down mid-single-digits on the ROS basket led by the resins and solvent piece. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thanks and good morning, everyone. Maybe on DIY paint packaging, we\u2019re hearing from a variety of sources that that\u2019s starting to get tight and there are some concerns about price increases on DIY paint packaging into the back half of the year and into next year. Is that something that you\u2019re anticipating? Is this something you need to get ahead of potentially with pricing into the retail channels? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Vince, it remains to be seen if there is a gap in supply or that we are stressing our packaging suppliers for share with this unprecedented increase in demand, but we\u2019re working very closely with them. We do not expect an increase in price in the second half on packaging. And as far as a price increase, like we always do, we\u2019ll try to manage our costs first and we\u2019ll look at it as the second half unfolds and decide if an increase is needed based on the current environment, but we\u2019re not expecting an increase in our second half. Vincent Andrews : Okay, very good. And then, just maybe you could talk a little bit about the M&A environment in both directions. Is your pipeline getting more active on the buy side? And as you\u2019ve gone through the portfolio again in the COVID environment, is there anything that you might be looking to sell? John Morikis : Well, on both sides, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re always active. There are a number of projects that we\u2019re engaged in and I\u2019d say the gap, if you will, of pretty wide margin in the midst of the COVID seems to be narrowing and good discussions are taking place. I really, really appreciate the leadership of our team here where David Sewell and our Head of Strategy, Bryan Young, are working with our leadership teams to really make sure that we\u2019re staying the course of our strategy. In times like this, people can lose their way a bit and just be out looking for sales or looking for opportunities. That\u2019s not us and we\u2019ve got a very deliberate strategy that we use that we stay true to and we\u2019re working that, and there are opportunities and we\u2019re hoping to continue to move through those aggressively. On the other side, to your point, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated if it be programs or products that are not fits, that do not fit in our company, that we take action. And I\u2019d say that we\u2019ve continued that same discipline of reviewing these programs, products, SKUs, stores, businesses, brands, everything, and you should expect that we continue to do that. When businesses fall short of the threshold that we have, to create shareholder value, we\u2019ll take action. Vincent Andrews : Thanks very much. John Morikis : But we\u2019ll talk to our teams and the businesses before we take that public. Vincent Andrews : Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks. I had two follow-ups: one is on gross margins; and then, the second is on the e-commerce and some of the learnings you\u2019ve gotten there. First on the gross margins, if I heard all this and pieced it together correctly, it sounds like the 330 bps expansion was roughly split between raw material price gap versus mix, and the reason the gross margins might be up less year-over-year in the second half is not raw materials per se, because you have the rest of the price increase, but it could be that some of the mix that\u2019s been extreme in the last few months starts to normalize. Am I taking that too far? John Morikis : No. I wouldn\u2019t. I think you\u2019re directionally accurate. I think in the third quarter, you wouldn\u2019t expect to see the DIY trends that we saw in the second quarter. The raw materials is a tailwind, but not as big of a tailwind in the second quarter. I guess, you know what, Greg, the way I would kind of gauge the DIY in the product mix is, if you look at our second and third quarters together between product and customer mix, I estimate a little bit below 1% of an impact, so you\u2019re directionally right there. Greg Melich : Got it. So, another way to think of it is the 330 bps was probably a little more than 1 point of mix, 100 bps of mix in the second quarter? John Morikis : That\u2019s approximately correct. Greg Melich : Yes. And then, on e-commerce, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, John, I think how the platform did well. I think last quarter you gave us some metrics on how many people used it and I know there\u2019s a lot of conversion to curbside and sort of all hands on deck. Any numbers you can give to us in terms of the number of customers, whether they be DIY\u2019ers or pros or contractors that started to use the platform, how engaged they are with it to help see how that could drive loyalty and growth? John Morikis : Yes. I\u2019d maybe characterize it this way, Greg. Our platform is certainly \u2013 we are witnessing strong utilization and increased metrics in all categories that we track. The idea here is pretty simple, it allows customers more efficiency in not only ordering products, but also in communicating with their reps and their store managers, and we want to build on this incredible relationship that we enjoy. These contractors as well as now a growing number of DIY customers are learning to rely on our people. On the professional side, these contractors would tell you that those reps and those store managers are part of their team, they\u2019re part of the contractor\u2019s team, and this is an extra step in helping our customers through our people. So, I might describe it as the last mile just got made that much easier, and we want the contractor feeling like they\u2019re part of our team and we\u2019re part of their team. And earlier, I talked about the complexity and the challenges that they\u2019re facing right now and the inability to absorb delays and run profitable efficient projects. I would tell you that this platform is helping our customers on the professional side to run much more efficiently and we absolutely see loyalty increasing. We ask a lot of questions and the most important one that I think we ask is who helps you make more money, and that gap is getting wider and we enjoy that. As it relates to the DIY side, we clearly have experienced a number of new customers using this platform on the DIY side. Our scores there are going up dramatically and it\u2019s working quite well. We\u2019re investing here heavily, because we believe this is another great opportunity for differentiation. Greg Melich : As a percentage of customers, is that more take up on the pro side or with DIY? John Morikis : Pro side. Greg Melich : Thanks. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thank you. RPM indicated that quarantining has brought out the inner DIY\u2019er in a number of people who maybe didn\u2019t think of themselves as DIY\u2019er before. I thought DIY versus pro in residential repaint was mostly demographics driven. So, if we go out a year from now or 18 months from now, do you think we normalize that\u2019s there or do you think we structurally kind of shift up a little bit here? John Morikis : I think we normalize. I think if you look in the past and compare to what\u2019s happened historically, John, we\u2019ve seen these shifts temporarily during unique times. But what we also have to take into consideration is an aging demographic, home price appreciation, aging housing starts. In the last recession to your point, the DIY grew, but not huge amounts and it wasn\u2019t protracted. So, we think that there are some shifts that occur during these times while people are home, as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s affordable, it\u2019s impactful, and you can make a difference. But overall, every time we\u2019ve seen this and we expect it going forward. And quite frankly, another stat that I didn\u2019t share earlier, I shared it maybe in the comments about the res repaint. The reason I say this with confidence, we \u2013 listening to our customers, they\u2019re telling us in June of 2020, they have more bids going out than they had in June of 2019. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the trend. John Roberts : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. First, congrats on a bang-up quarter. I wanted to dig in, this is year three for the big Lowe\u2019s switchover and last year you had talked a little bit, you weren\u2019t quite where you wanted to be operationally, now obviously this year, big year just macro from the market side. But is that system now set up where you like \u2013 where your reps are able to go in and help them sell and you\u2019re kind of hitting on all cylinders there or how long do you think that takes to get \u2013 you never get to the endpoint, but to kind of a cruising altitude I guess? John Morikis : Yes. You\u2019re right. There is no finish line in anything that we do, Duffy. So, I like the way you characterize that. Marvin and his team at Lowe\u2019s, Bill Boltz and Joe McFarland, these are wonderful leaders. They\u2019re driving for improvement and we want to help them. And they\u2019re giving us access, they\u2019re allowing our teams to work with their teams, and we believe that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity ahead of us. We\u2019re on a runway and we\u2019re screaming down it. But I think together, there\u2019s a lot more that we can do and we\u2019re looking forward to that. I think these are two wonderful organizations that work together can do a lot. And we like that for two reasons, both the DIY side, but also as a professional that prefers a home center experience that\u2019s typically, we call them the pro that paints. They might be a remodeler, they might be doing different professional projects, and they pick up paint as part of that experience, and they prefer the home center with the product choices. And so our ability to help them be more successful is an important part of our strategy and we look forward to that. So there\u2019s a lot more to be done. Duffy Fischer : Great. And then, you mentioned you\u2019re increasing CapEx in the back half by $100 million, which is a very large sum for you guys versus your historic CapEx. Is that new plants or what is that \u2013 new capacity that you need to bring online, what is it that we get with that extra $100 million? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Duffy, as I talked on our first quarter call, the reduction in CapEx was really pausing some of these architectural and packaging capacity expansions. As we saw the sales trends come through the second quarter, we restarted those expansion plans, just because they could take 12 months to 16 months to get an expansion of good \u2013 a sizable expansion in place and that takes our CapEx up to $280 million which is still about 1.5% of sales. So, as long as \u2013 I think we\u2019re trying to control CapEx below that 2%, we\u2019ve done that pretty much over the last few years and we\u2019ll continue to do that. But we need the capacity and we\u2019re going to start those projects back up. Duffy Fischer : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : Hi. Good afternoon, guys, and a great quarter. First, just wanted to follow up on a prior question, your resi repaint contractor, I believe you said in June that interior got back to flat. Could you just give an update for July? I\u2019m really trying to understand whether or not in the second wave areas of COVID that are having another flare-up, whether or not we\u2019re seeing that interior contractor business on the repaint side really get impacted and forward impacts us. Al Mistysyn : Yes. I don\u2019t know that we want to get into too much detail here. Let me just give you maybe some insight. I\u2019d say that in more rural areas I would describe it as there\u2019s more likely a business as usual than in more metro areas. We are experiencing more customers penetrating the home in the interior, but it\u2019s still spotty. And I would tell you that the bids that I mentioned earlier have a lot of people feeling really good on the contractor side, because they\u2019re not just exterior bids that they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re doing both bidding for interior and exterior. So, I think it\u2019s just a matter of time and it\u2019s starting to roll in and our customers are feeling good, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just going be a light switch that\u2019s going to come back online. John Morikis : Okay. What I\u2019d add to that Truman is just that, as we said, DIY continues to be a strong performer and the resi repaint and the new res continue to be the ones that are sort of leading the recovery while commercial and property maintenance are also improving, but resi and resi repaint continue to be sort of the leaders in the clubhouse. Truman Patterson : Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And then, next question on gross margin. You all are already at 48% in the second quarter. Just hoping you can give some updated thoughts on your long-term gross margin targets, because I think we\u2019re bumping up towards the high end of them. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Truman, as you know, our long-term gross margin target is at 45% to 48%. I would say over time, we\u2019ll continue to look at adjusting that, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to do that at this point. The demand surge and the trends that we\u2019re seeing and the product mix, customer mix, we talked about these being shorter term. We\u2019ll get through \u2013 we expect to get the positive trends through this quarter, but go back to some more normalized levels. And then, I think we\u2019ve got to see how the recovery in our Performance Coatings comes out to say \u2013 before we\u2019re ready to say we think we should move that long-term target up. I think we\u2019ve done a lot of work through our different segments, through our different divisions and regions to really drive complexity out of our supply chain and be more efficient, and those will pay off when demand and volume start to pick up again, but I\u2019m just not ready to raise that target just yet. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun, your line is live. You may proceed with your questions. Arun Viswanathan : Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Good morning. Apologies for that. Yes. I guess my first question is just on the guidance. So, the midpoint being $22.50 now, I guess excluding the amortization and charges, I guess, maybe you can just kind of lay out maybe some of the factors that maybe could drive you to the upper end of that range. Would it be kind of maybe a swifter recovery in performance or would it be maybe a longer tail on consumer? Yeah. Maybe just provide some details on maybe the upper end of the guidance. Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Arun, I think it starts with the sales volumes in our TAG organization. We, like I mentioned earlier, are going up against a tougher third quarter, but a tougher fourth quarter as well. But as TAG drives volume, we get a lot of operating leverage on that volume. And you mentioned it, if the DIY surge continues longer than we expect, again, we expect to get a nice operating leverage there. And then, our Performance Coatings Group, the trends that John talked about sequentially through the second quarter, if some of those pick up faster, whether it\u2019s auto refinish, GI, industrial wood, which are probably on the farther end of the scale of where we think \u2013 let me rephrase that, auto refinish more in the middle, GI and industrial wood at the longer end of the scale of recovery, if those do pick up back quicker, yes, I think we can see ourselves to the high end of that range. Arun Viswanathan : So, it sounds like it\u2019s mostly volume-driven. And then, just I guess maybe thinking longer-term, maybe you can just give us your perspective on your business. You benefited quite heavily from the shift to do-it-for-me over the last several years and now we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a shift back to DIY. I guess, A, do you think that\u2019s structural? And then, B, I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about your paint stores business longer term. You\u2019re often grown in the 1.5 to 2 times market rate, it seems like you\u2019re poised to increase that now maybe to 2 or 3 times the market rate. So, I guess maybe just stress those two issues and see if I\u2019m thinking about that the correct way. Thanks. John Morikis : Yes. On our stores, I think we\u2019re just getting started. I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity and we\u2019ve got a wonderful team that\u2019s executing well and we\u2019re excited about where we\u2019re going, and there\u2019s a lot of really good things in the pipeline that we\u2019re excited to talk to you about in the future. Regarding the do-it-yourself versus do-it-for-me, as I mentioned earlier, we think that we\u2019ve seen this movie before. There is a shift to do-it-yourself, it gradually shifts back, and those are based on fundamentals, an aging population, dual income, the pension or market wealth that\u2019s created, home values that are improving. And quite frankly, a general focus on life, the quality of life and people enjoy the benefit and the impact of a newly painted room or home, and not all of them enjoy doing it themselves, but it\u2019s a relatively inexpensive but impactful experience. And we don\u2019t quite frankly care how it\u2019s applied. We just want to make sure it\u2019s our product going on, and it could be a do-it-yourselfer or it could be a do-it-for-me, it could be \u2013 and we talked about remodel or new home. We just \u2013 we have teams focused on every square field, every corner of the room. We just want to be there when that gallon is sold and be the one that\u2019s providing that solution. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Thanks. Good luck on the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Petrie with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. This is P.J. Juvekar. Good morning or good afternoon. Just couple of quick ones on DIY. DIY did well across all big boxes. I was wondering if you and your partner there gained share. Do you feel you gained share and what happened to retail prices this year? Al Mistysyn : I think it\u2019s a little early to tell if we\u2019ve gained share. I\u2019d tell you we\u2019re not satisfied and I think you\u2019d be disappointed in us if we were. So, we\u2019re still working to improve regardless of if we\u2019re gaining share or not. There\u2019s still a lot of opportunity and we want to work with our retail partners to be able to capture that share. I\u2019m sorry, your second question, was what? P.J. Juvekar: On the pricing on the retail side, paint pricing? Al Mistysyn : Yes. I think that\u2019s a better answer coming from our customers themselves than us commenting on. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then, just one more on DIY. Are you trying to get some DIY customers in your stores through your digital app and any progress there or strategy there? Thank you. John Morikis : Yes. Again, as mentioned earlier, it\u2019s about 10% of our store business, so it\u2019s a relatively small percentage and there are customers that prefer a specialty store experience, and if they\u2019re going to make that decision, we\u2019d hope that they choose ours. But I know that you\u2019ve been in our stores and you\u2019ve seen how we\u2019re modeled and what we do, I think there\u2019s a large percentage of that contractor business that is out there for us to gain and that\u2019s mainly the focus of our stores. P.J. Juvekar: Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on cash flows. Normally your second half is always a much stronger quarter \u2013 or excuse me, half and you tend to see about 70% of your free cash at least in the last few years in the back half. I guess given the strength that you saw in the second quarter, should we still be assuming that or is it a little bit more of a wonky kind of year where maybe the front end has a little bit more than normal? How should we be thinking about that? Al Mistysyn : Yes. John, I think you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s kind of a wonky year with strength in DIY, certainly through our stores, they\u2019re not going on account. Our working capital is lower in our first half. As John talked about, we\u2019re going to start building inventory coming out of our third quarter into our fourth quarter and that will be a little bit of a headwind in our second half as far as cash is concerned. And then, the profitability that we saw in the first half, because of the tougher comp in the second half and some of the product and customer mix and things I talked about earlier, you just aren\u2019t going see a big of an improvement when you look at our full year guidance. But we\u2019re going to build inventory and that\u2019s going to be a little bit of a drag on our cash in the second half. It still should be positive year-over-year, but not quite as positive. John McNulty : Got it. Thanks very much for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good afternoon. Wanted to ask about your packaging coatings business, I think you mentioned it grew at a high-single-digit pace. In recent weeks, we\u2019ve been hearing about aluminum can shortages and I\u2019m curious as to whether you\u2019ve observed that and perhaps it would be a high-class problem if it\u2019s a problem at all. But can you \u2013 are there enough cans out there for you to continue to grow rapidly in the business? John Morikis : There is plenty of opportunity for us to grow. This is the strongest performer that we have in our industrial business. I mentioned the sales up high-single-digits. To your point, demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. We have a terrific and unique technology in our V70 coating that continues to win and convert new customers, new lines, and it\u2019s because of the flexibility, the speed, the ease of application, our customers are running more efficiently through the plans to be able to do that. So, yes, we expect this business to continue to grow, it\u2019s another area with wonderful leadership, great technology, great customers and we\u2019re putting a lot of fuel in this tank. Kevin McCarthy : Good to hear. And then secondly, wanted to follow up on e-commerce. Are your margins through the e-commerce channel today higher, lower or similar to the same sale through a traditional channel? And as you continue to grow rapidly from a smaller base, how might that evolve? Just trying to get a sense for if and when this could become a meaningful swing factor in margin analysis moving forward? John Morikis : Kevin, I think you should model in as basically the same margins. Kevin McCarthy : Easy enough. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Stevenson : Hey. This is Jeff Stevenson on for Garik. How are you? John Morikis : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Stevenson : Hey. My first question was just on the outlook for the auto refinish business. Are you seeing any improvement as lockdowns are eased, miles driven have improved, and maybe even a shift away from mass transit? John Morikis : We do see the improvement. We saw it sequentially as the quarter unfolded and we expect that to continue. Again, we\u2019ve spoke in the last couple of calls about the technology and our play here and the performance of this business and it\u2019s moving in the right direction, obviously, but miles driven and traffic congestion would help this business. This is a business that when you look at the drivers, given what we\u2019ve done with this business over the last 18 to 24 months, resumption of more normal travel routines will benefit us significantly. Jeff Stevenson : Okay, great. And then, in new residential, you mentioned the sequential improvement in June. But as we look at the back half, are you seeing an acceleration similar to what builders are seeing? And then, two, are you seeing any problem with contractor labor as housing starts start to accelerate? John Morikis : We are experiencing some contractor labor issues, not only in new residential, commercial, even res repaint and you wouldn\u2019t think that given the unemployment rate. But I\u2019ve spoken with a number of contractors who have mentioned that it\u2019s difficult for them to find people, qualified people that are willing to work, given the unemployment rates that they\u2019re receiving. So, it is an issue. I would say to your question about the trend, many of our builders \u2013 first, we do see it, largely because of our position in the market. We\u2019ve got a terrific position in the national homebuilders. We\u2019ve talked about having 18 of the top 20 national homebuilders in exclusive relationships and we\u2019ve been making very good penetration in the regional builders. And let me just take a slight detour and say our national account business, outside of just the builder, that our national account business in total across all our U.S. stores platform, the activity there is fantastic. So we\u2019re really leveraging our platform and really trying to drive the differentiation between us and others. That said, back on the builder, we are clearly enjoying this partnership with our builders. They are experiencing \u2013 many of them have said June was their best month ever. And so, we believe that the quarter bodes well for the future. The other point of differentiation I would make that we\u2019re hearing from our builders is that they continue to reference our ability to offer the services that we provide, both the reps and inventory, close to them as an important lever. Many of them have asked other suppliers to come visit us here in Cleveland to understand what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re doing it. And I think that when you look at our position, it\u2019s become more pronounced given some of the challenges that some builders have had with disruptions in other categories. For us, it\u2019s terrific business, it\u2019s 5 gallon bucket, so it\u2019s easy to serve us, it doesn\u2019t have an impact on the do-it-yourself business, it allows us to serve them well and we can execute for these national homebuilders across the country like no one else can. Jeff Stevenson : Thanks and congrats on the great quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard : Thank you. In terms of the interior business, John, I know that you talked briefly about it, but just curious in terms of the momentum on the interior side. I know you indicated that contractors are more bullish and that\u2019s looking at the business in total. But curious about what the trends are on in terms of interior? And then, also if you could remind us of the interior/exterior mix within the stores by 2Q, 3Q, 4Q? Thank you. John Morikis : So, let me point \u2013 I think Eric to reiterate again, my comments I think on the trends, I might point back to the bidding activity that we\u2019re experiencing with our customers, the fact that in June, there were more bids this year versus last year in a growing percentage now including the interior. So, the \u2013 I\u2019m trying to give you some color without getting into specific numbers to be truthful with you, but we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. The fact is, is that our customers are recognizing that it\u2019s not going be this afternoon if they\u2019re in someone\u2019s home, but they\u2019re using virtual tools to estimate. Their customers are interested in having their homes painted. There is a sense of wanting to almost get their place in line. And our customers enjoy that, because it allows them to tackle the exterior which is turning out to be an excellent exterior season for our contractors and they\u2019re enjoying the opportunity that many of these interior projects or these customers are getting in line with the expectation that those homes are going be painted by these same pros. Al Mistysyn : And Eric, on the interior-to-exterior ratio and the out-quarters, first quarter, fourth quarter, it\u2019s about 4 :1. As you get into the two middle quarters, as the weather improves in the Midwest and Eastern, it trend to that 3 :1, in a normal environment, it\u2019s probably a little less than that through these next second and third quarters because of the trends we\u2019re seeing. Eric Bosshard : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So, I\u2019d like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Jaye for any additional closing comments. Jim Jaye : Yes. Thank you, Jessie, and thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call today. Just one reminder, I\u2019d like to tell you that we\u2019ll be hosting our virtual Financial Community Presentation on Tuesday, September 29, so registration details will be coming out on that soon. Look for that. We hope you\u2019ll be able to join us for that. And as always, Eric Swanson and myself will be available for your follow-up questions the rest of this week and into next week. So, thank you so much. Have a great day and stay safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy during the pandemic. Let me begin with some high-level summary comments on the quarter. All comparisons are to the third quarter of 2019, unless otherwise stated. Sherwin-Williams delivered outstanding results in the third quarter. Total company consolidated sales were well above the original guidance we provided on July 28, and also slightly above the increased guidance we provided on September 29. We saw continued unprecedented demand in our DIY business during the quarter, double-digit growth in residential repaint, very solid demand in new residential and positive momentum across our industrial end markets. We delivered year-over-year improvement in gross margin and record profit before tax EBITDA, diluted net income per share and net operating cash. Third quarter 2020 consolidated sales increased 5.2% to $5.12 billion, inclusive of a negative currency impact of 0.9%. The estimated impact from COVID-19 on consolidated sales in the quarter was not material. Consolidated gross margin increased 220 basis points to 47.9%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $165.8 million or 23.4% to $875.6 million. Diluted net-net income per share increased 24.4% to $7.66 per share. The third quarter of 2020 included acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.63 per share. The third quarter of 2019 included acquisition-related amortization expense and other adjustments of $0.49 per share, as described in the Regulation G reconciliation table included in our press release. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 24.7% to $8.29 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $185.7 million to $1.11 billion, or 21.6% of sales. Net operating cash increased 54.3% year-to-date to $2.56 billion. From a segment perspective, sales in the Americas Group and Consumer Brands Group were in line with our updated guidance, while sales in Performance Coatings Group were slightly better than expected. All segment delivered very strong flow-through in the quarter. Segment margin in the Americas Group improved to 25.1% of sales, resulting from operating leverage on the topline growth, favorable mix, and lower input costs. Adjusted segment margin in Consumer Brands Group increased to 26.4% of sales, resulting from operating leverage on the strong double-digit topline growth, favorable product mix, lower input costs, and actions taken over the past year to improve our international operating margin. Adjusted segment margin in Performance Coatings Group increased to 16% of sales, driven by returning sales growth and lower input costs. Additional details on our segment performance are included in the slide deck provided with our press release and available on our IR website. Let me now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Morikis, for some additional commentary on the quarter and our outlook. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Let me begin by expressing my appreciation to the over 61,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams for their continued determination and their resilience. I could not be more proud of this incredible team as they delivered record results in a very challenging environment. Our leadership team and their many years of collective experience have been true differentiators throughout this entire year, enabling us to drive significant improvement across many measures, while serving our customers at a very high level. We generated very solid sales growth in the quarter, with all three operating segments growing year-over-year, exceeding the original guidance we provided at the end of July and improving sequentially. The gross margin expansion in the quarter was driven by sales growth, effective pricing, favorable mix, and lower input costs. The industry basket of raw materials was down by a mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter compared to the prior year, though a bit less than what we saw in the second quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales in the quarter decreased slightly year-over-year to 27.5%. SG&A increased on a dollar basis as we continue to make investments to drive long-term growth. Let me talk a bit more about trends we're seeing in each of our segments before moving on to our outlook. In the Americas Group, we saw a significant sequential improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter in all regions and all segments served. Most regions and segments also delivered growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We're especially encouraged by the return of double-digit growth in residential repaint, our largest segment. Interior work has picked up significantly. As a reminder, this segment has been our fastest growing over the last several years and continues to offer us the largest opportunity for share gain. Sales in new residential also gained momentum in the quarter, and were up by mid-single-digits. Our DIY business delivered the biggest year-over-year percentage increase in the quarter, with COVID-related stay-at-home projects driving robust consumer demand throughout the quarter. Our customers business slowly improved but remained down low single-digits in the quarter. Our customers are telling us that job site conditions are stabilizing, and the predominant theme remains that projects are being delayed rather than canceled. The property maintenance segment remains under pressure as turnover in multifamily remains slow. Protective and marine remains our most challenging segment from a demand perspective. Access to job sites remains an issue on some projects. Demand remains particularly depressed in oil and gas, which is the segment's largest single-end market. Other areas such as flooring and water and wastewater treatment are moving in a more positive direction. We believe this business is well-positioned to take advantage of future potential, infrastructure investments and comps will start to become more favorable heading into next year. From a product perspective, strength in exterior paint continued as we generated low double-digit percentage growth in the quarter. Encouragingly, we also saw a significant pickup in interior paint, where sales were up by a high single-digit percentage overall and by double digits in the residential repaint segment. Additionally, spray equipment sales were up strong double digits in the quarter. This is another very encouraging sign of recovery as contractors are unlikely to invest in this type of equipment unless they anticipate significant demand. Pricing came in as we expected and was approximately 2% in the third quarter. We expect a similar level of effectiveness in the fourth quarter. We opened 24 new stores in the third quarter and 40 year-to-date in the U.S. and Canada. We anticipate opening a total of approximately 55 new stores for the full year in the U.S. and Canada. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products and productivity enhancing services to drive additional growth. We're also pleased by a continuing uptick in the use of our e-commerce platform. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. DIY demand remained robust in the quarter, driven by consumers continuing to focus on home improvement projects while nesting at home during the pandemic. We generated strong double-digit growth by working closely with our retail customers to capture this demand, most notably with Lowe's. Our global supply chain organization continued to perform admirably in the quarter, working collaboratively with our customers to help meet unprecedented demand. Internationally, every region generated year-over-year growth. Sales increased by double-digit percentages in Europe and Australia, and by a mid- single-digit percentage in Asia. Similar to second quarter, we leveraged the strong sales growth and favorable product mix to drive significant operating margin improvement compared to the prior year. Our margin improvement also reflects the terrific work this team has done over the last two years to improve our portfolio, including rationalizing SKUs, exiting the ACE private label business, and reducing costs in Europe and Australia. We continue to reinvest in this business to drive long-term growth for our partners, especially in the Handyman remodeler or pros who paint category. Lastly, let me comment on the trends in the Performance Coatings Group. We're encouraged by this segment's return to growth in the quarter, inclusive of a 1.4% headwind related to currency translation rate changes. As in the Americas Group, Performance Coatings Groups generated significant sequential improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter in all regions, in nearly all divisions. The majority of regions and divisions also delivered growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. From a regional perspective, Asia grew fastest in the quarter, up by a high single-digit percentage. Europe and Latin America both grew by low single-digit percentages. Our largest region in PCG, North America, was down in the quarter by a low single-digit percentage, where a slower recovery in the General Industrial Division offset growth in the other divisions. From a divisional perspective, I'll start with our packaging business, where our team continues to deliver great results. Sales were up high single digits and positive in every region for the quarter. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust, and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction. And both we and our customers are investing in capacity expansion. In coil coatings, the resumption of selected commercial construction projects, albeit slow, along with growth in appliances and strong new business wins across all regions led to mid single-digit growth in the quarter. We're very encouraged by the improved performance in industrial wood, where sales were up by a mid-single-digit percentage in the quarter. We believe the momentum we are seeing in kitchen cabinetry, flooring and furniture correlates to similar positive trends in new residential construction. We also returned to growth in automotive refinish in the quarter, where sales were up a low single-digit percentage. This team has done a very nice job driving new account growth by offering better solutions than our competitors. We estimate miles driven are currently at about 75% of pre-COVID levels. And collision shop volume across the industry is off by approximately 25%. We expect continued improvement in these trends. In general industrial, we were down by a low single-digit percentage in the quarter. While we're never pleased with the quarter, where the top line is down, this was a very significant improvement from the high double-digit decline we saw in the second quarter. There are several reasons for optimism in this business. Regionally, Asia was up double digits, and Europe was up mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. Latin America was positive on a currency-neutral basis, and while North America remained under pressure, we did see very meaningful sequential improvement. Moving on to our guidance. I'll remind you that our fourth quarter is a seasonally smaller one. We expect to see our normal sequential seasonal slowdown in U.S. architectural demand in the fourth quarter, similar to previous years. We're expecting continued favorable product mix in the quarter with DIY, res repaint and new residential growth, while not expecting material improvement in the other architectural segments or Protective & Marine. We also expect our interior products to become a bigger part of the mix in the quarter as we return to a more typical interior/exterior ratio for this time of year. On the industrial side of the business, we're encouraged by many of the positive trends I described a few moments ago. At the same time, dynamics related to customers' replenishment of inventory and the true pace of end market demand will likely cause continued choppiness in the pace of recovery in some end markets. Against this backdrop, we anticipate fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net sales will increase by 3% to 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Looking at our operating segments for the fourth quarter. We anticipate the Americas Group to be up by 4% to 6%, Consumer Brands Group be up a mid-to high-teens percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up or down a low single-digit percentage. For the full year 2020, we are revising our sales guidance upward from flat to up slightly, to up by a low single-digit percentage based on our improved fourth quarter outlook. On an operating segment basis for the full year, we anticipate the Americas Group to be up by a low single-digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up by a mid-teens percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be down by low to mid single-digit percentage. We expect to see gross margin expansion in the quarter. On SG&A, we will be making incremental investments in our long-term growth opportunities, and we do not expect to see as much SG&A leverage as in our third quarter. We are, again, increasing our diluted net income per share guidance for 2020 to be in the range of $21.49 to $21.79 per share compared to our most recent guidance of $20.96 to $21.46 per share and compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings per share guidance, includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $2.51 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2020 earnings per share of $24 to $24.30, an increase of 14.3% at the midpoint over the $21.12 we delivered last year. Embedded within our outlook is the assumption that the raw material basket will be lower for the full year by a mid-single-digit percentage. Based on our current outlook, we expect the fourth quarter will have less of a benefit than the first three quarters of the year, given recent sequential inflation in some commodities, in comparisons to the deflation we saw the latter half of 2019. Let me close with some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Our CapEx guidance for the year remains $280 million. This CapEx guidance includes a very modest amount of spending related to our new headquarters and R&D facility projects. Earlier this month, the company's Board of Directors approved a dividend of $1.34 per share, an increase of 18.6% over the $1.13 per share dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2019. We resumed open market share purchases during the third quarter, investing $404 million, purchased 600,000 shares of company common stock. Absent significant M&A, we expect to continue purchasing shares in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have a remarkable team at Sherwin-Williams, and they delivered outstanding results in the quarter by focusing on meeting customer needs. I'm truly grateful for their passion and their commitment, which has put us on track to deliver sales and earnings growth in this most challenging of years. We believe the long-term fundamental strengths of our end markets remain intact. There is tremendous opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses and, in many ways, we're just getting started. We remained very confident about the future and our ability to create shareholder value over the long term. This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning everybody. John Morikis : Good morning, Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi : I guess, first off, within TAG, the commercial and property maintenance sub-verticals improved significantly, relative to what you saw in 2Q. How do you disaggregate that improvement between pent-up demand from the 2Q dislocations versus an improvement in underlying growth? And then what time line do you think for each vertical is it reasonable for volumes to inflect higher year-over-year? John Morikis : Well, thank you for that question, Ghansham. I think the -- if you start with commercial, as you've mentioned, jobs are coming back online. And as we mentioned, sequentially, we've seen some improvement. I think when you look at the ramp-up there, I think a lot of that's going to have to do with the progress our contractors make on getting more painters out on projects, social distancing and the restrictions that go along with those requirements have proven somewhat challenging to our customers. So I'd say that as we go into 2021, we expect more and more progress, if you will, in that segment. You asked about each of the segments, and maybe I'll make one overarching comment regarding all the professional segments. And that is, as I've mentioned before, no one hopes for any experience like this pandemic that we're experiencing. That said, our commercial contractors, as well as every other contractor we serve has found this market to be a challenge. It might be getting approval to go in to work into one area, and getting pulled out for that area and pushed into another, start exterior, have someone say they might be going out of town, can you do an interior project? All of these create conflict for our customers. And at the same time, it creates the opportunity that we look for, which is to be there with solutions for our customers. And so we're working hard. I mentioned earlier, how grateful I am for our teams. Our teams in the field are doing just a wonderful job in responding into each one of these professional segments in a way that very few people can. As it relates to the segments, I might, again, here, begin with the way that I'm looking at these segments. And these, to me, represent favorable comps as we go into next year. If you start with residential repaint, and I'll give you a little color as to why I feel each of these are favorable comps. We are talking about coming out of a quarter with double-digit gains, but we're not hitting on all cylinders yet. The interior, while improving dramatically, offers a terrific opportunity for us as well as the opportunity to continue to grow share. Our TAG team, the leadership team and those terrific employees in the field, are actually growing our new accounts year-over-year this year, on the year with a pandemic, faster than we have previous years. So our new account growth in this area has just been terrific. So we see our progress in res repaint as exciting. But we're not complacent here. This offers -- this is the largest segment we have, but it also offers the greatest opportunity for market share growth. We feel coming into 2021, the fact that we've been running a large part of the year with a much smaller interior market as well as the share gains that we're gaining, we're excited about entering into next year. In new residential, same thing, comps are favorable going into next year for us. We finished the year here -- I'm sorry, the fourth quarter mid-single-digits up. But again, these are businesses that are just starting to ramp up our position here, exclusive relationships with 18 of the top 20 builders, really making progress in the regional and custom homebuilder who's really been hit the least throughout this process. But our position here, as we go into 2021, is really a strong one, particularly given the fact that there still remains a shortage of supply of homes in the marketplace. And our new residential customers are excited about the progress as they're making coming out of 2020 going into 2021. Talking about commercial, property management is another one. Again, terrific comps for us as we go into next year. Clearly, this business has been impacted by turns. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the lack of turns has had an impact on our business here. If you'll recall, during our financial community presentation, I mentioned that our customers are starting to see, sense, and hear more from their tenants about more movement and again, terrific position here with exclusives with 18 of the top 20 here and our customers are starting to feel like this is starting to move. We'll tell you more about this likely at the end of the next quarter, but we're feeling better about the progress here as we enter into 2021. So that's -- those are the professional sides. You didn't ask about the DIY side? But maybe, Al, if I could lean on you for a second here. Why don't we talk about DIY from a company perspective? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Thanks, John. This is Allen Mistysyn. We know DIY demand is a question for -- on everybody's mind moving into next year. Let me try to put some color around it, and try to quantify the increase. If I look at the second in third quarters together, sales this year are just slightly below last year. The combined DIY increase for Consumer Brands and our Americas Group is up 23% and represents about a quarter of our total sales in those quarters. The remaining 75% of the businesses segments are down approximately 6% and are sequentially trending better in the third quarter versus the second quarter. John talked about TAG and our expectations for strong res repaint, new res sales, turn to growth, commercial, property maintenance and then P&M being less of a headwind when in 2021 versus 2020 due to the easier comps. In our Consumer Brands Group, investments and customer programs to drive volume are expected to drive incremental sales growth into next year, but unlikely able to offset a more normal return to DIY demand. And then Performance Coatings Group is seeing strong packaging demand, which is expected to continue in early part of next year, continued improvement in auto refinish, industrial wood, and coil, with general industrial gradually returning to sustainable growth in North America. And Ghansham, it's really the investments we've been making in our programs, our reps, our tools and services to provide solutions to these customers that give us great confidence in our ability to grow those other segments to help offset that DIY potential harder comp next year. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Thank you. And just for the second question, John, you mentioned that you expect demand to be choppy. That seems reasonable, given what we're seeing. You also have higher raw material costs that seem likely higher operating costs with freight, et cetera, and just cost to serve the customer, just given the omnichannel shift across your TAG store network. In that context, how should we think about pricing, as it relates to an early outlook for 2021? Thanks so much. John Morikis : Thanks, Ghansham. I'd say our response here is going to be pretty consistent with past discussions that we've had, Ghansham. As we look at all costs, the raw material baskets and everything that you laid out there from healthcare to energy, every aspect of the business, we look at that on a 30-day basis, every 30 days with our management team, we evaluate where we are. We make that decision. We immediately then proceed out with any increases that we've decided on, with a goal of talking to our cost customers first. Once we talk to the customers, then we bring it to the financial community. We've not announced any increases now, or we're not out with any right now. And should we, like I said, we'll be out in front of the customer first and then come to you. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. And, Ghansham, we're in the middle of our normal next year operating plan reviews with their divisions. And, as you know, we'll push back on our suppliers. We'll try to internalize and offset as much of the raw material and other increases as we can. And then, absent that, we'll have to look at a price increase. Ghansham Panjabi : Thanks so much, you guys. John Morikis : Thank you, Ghansham. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. John Morikis : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi. Good morning. Is DIY growth in the stores business very different than the rate of DIY growth in consumer brands in North America? John Morikis : No, they're very similar. Al Mistysyn : But, Jeff, as you know, DIY and our TAG organization is a much smaller percentage overall. Jeff Zekauskas : Yeah. And in your Performance Coatings Group, you had very, very good growth in coil, but negative growth in general industrial. What's the difference between those two markets, so that coil is growing and general industrial is down? John Morikis : So it's the market that we serve, Jeff. If you look at coil, we've had the benefits of appliances, as an example, in coil as the commercial projects have picked up extrusion and some of the applications into the commercial space have been positive. And the other thing I'd say about the coil, give this team great credit. They have been winning business across all regions. So we talk a lot about share of wallet in our TAG business. But if I were to use that kind of description for our coil business, I'd say, they've been doing very well in that space as well. General industrial, if you look at those applications for coatings in our GI space, again, choppy is a good description here. We did have growth, as we talked about in a few of the geographies : Asia, Europe, LatAm, I believe, in local \u2013 in same currency would have been slightly positive. It's mainly the U.S., and it's a choppy market here in the U.S. for GI. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Thank you so much. John Morikis : Thank you, Jeff Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. How would you characterize this COVID DIYer is being different from your legacy DIYer? Are they more inclined to buy higher quality paint? And are you \u2013 there's a couple of comments in your earnings release about product mix. And I was just curious whether you're seeing that in terms of whether it's in consumer or it's in TAG, are they buying higher quality paint? John Morikis : I'd say that we are seeing a positive mix shift, Steve. I would say that there is a difference between these customers. If you look at the DIY customer in a Sherwin store, they're typically looking for that specialty store experience. Al just mentioned, a small percentage of our business, 10%, roughly of our business. The expectations there are just that. They're looking for that specialty store service and expectations in areas that might include color, selection and so on. If you look at the overall, though, what I would say is that our experience this go around is that these are people that are, in general, home, as we've described, nesting, and in many cases, finding themselves looking at a wall that may not have been painted in the next decade. And I think I mentioned on one call that in some of our stores, they've kind of jokingly referred to these as what the heck projects, where they're sitting around, kind of bored out of their minds, and they're saying, 'What the heck. I might as well go ahead and paint this room.' The reason I share that with you is that we've often gotten a question about do we have a concern that we might be leveraging or mortgaging residential repaint customer sales to a DIY customer. We've not seen that. In fact, our residential repaint customers bidding activity is actually increasing not only sequentially but year-over-year. So our customers on the res repaint side are quoting more now this year than they were last year, and they are telling us that the success rate is actually increasing. So we have a DIY customer, who's home. They want a good experience. They are typically moving up and we have a res repaint customers backlog that's growing. Al Mistysyn : Steve, the only thing I would add to that is it's really by design in our Consumer Brands segment. The programs that they're putting in place, the training at store level, is really trying to drive to the higher-quality products because that \u2013 as we've talked about customer solutions, that helps them drive their top line and bottom line, and it also helps us drive our top line and bottom line. John Morikis : And overall, the customer ends up with the best experience. So it helps our brand position with our customers as well. Steve Byrne : And so you had what was a 3% same-store sales in TAG. Was that all priced, given there might have been a price/mix lift from this DIY initiative? Al Mistysyn : You could \u2013 price would have been a little bit below 2%. The rest is volume. The one thing I would point out, though, Steve, if you look at our North America stores at 3%, as you know, P&M has been a drag. If you backed out P&M, architectural would be up mid-single digits. So I put it in perspective to say if price is a little bit below 2% volume, would be more mid-single digits on architectural. Steve Byrne : Okay. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, Steve. Operator : The next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the great results. I just wanted to ask about your comment on margins and SG&A. Could you elaborate on maybe some of the increases in SG&A you're expecting in Q4? And then maybe even to next year, do you think you've entered a new gross margin level, just given the volume uplift here and some of the cost reductions you guys have undertaken? Maybe you can just elaborate on some of those issues? Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Arun, as you know, since we don't go down item by item on the P& L for our guidance, but let me try to give you some color around our fourth quarter in general. First off, we believe we have a pretty strong fourth quarter, with adjusted EPS about 10% increase over \u2013 at the midpoint over a really strong fourth quarter last year that was up over 20%, on top of a 12% increase in the fourth quarter of '18. That tells you our flow-through is in the mid-20% range at the midpoint, while investing back in our business. And let me start by saying what we talked about at the second quarter \u2013 in the second quarter. What we talked about, at FCP is that, these are the investments in products, services, customer programs that provide solutions to our customers, allow them to grow share and be more successful. These are investments in new store and reps. In our e-commerce platform, North American stores, I talked about the consumer brand, investments and expanded customer programs that will allow our customers to sell more of the right gallons through the department, which helps drive their profitability. And then also performance coatings investments in reps, services and programs that add value to our customers, allow them to be more productive. And you talk about what that means going forward. And we believe this cycle is very, very similar to 2008. We continue to invest and lean forward into our customer success and these are the right investments. And the 3, 5, and 10-year compounded average growth rate of our North America architectural sales were high single digits coming out of that period and we believe that was a multiple of our market demand over the same period. So we believe this similar environment. We expect these current investments across all our segments allow us to grow multiple of end market demand over the mid and long term. The only other comment I would make on gross margin, Arun is that, in the fourth quarter, we do expect to see a typical seasonal architectural slowdown in demand, which does impact our gross margin. Historically, our third quarter is a stronger gross margin performance than the fourth quarter. Part of why we had such a strong performance last year here we did see a sequential improvement in our gross margin last year from third quarter to fourth quarter. And as you know, we get to year end, it's a small quarter, we get into inventories, LIFO, a number of adjustments that kind of drove that improved margin in last year. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks for that detail. And then also just wanted to ask about your capital allocation. You spent over $400 million on buybacks in the quarter. So nice to see that. Is that generally how you're going to be running the balance sheet now that, obviously, not building cash? Maybe you could just also discuss the M&A market, if there's any opportunities that you can take advantage of in the near future? Thanks. John Morikis : Al will talk about capital first, and then I'll talk about M&A. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Let me just highlight the fact we did have bigger amount of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter than normal. I would not read anything into this. We've not changed our capital allocation policy. And to your point, we are not going to hold cash. We'll put that cash to work. And it was really a timing issue at the end of the quarter. We have stronger receipts in the second half of September. The strong teams are generating stronger operating margin and cash flow from outside the U.S. that we're certainly going to keep bringing back to the U.S. and putting to work, but it's just a timing issue there. I think you're right. You look at the strong cash generation, $2.6 billion in the first nine months. We've returned over $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. That's an increase of 86% to last year, and then we've invested $190 million in the form of CapEx. And we also took the opportunity to reduce our debt by just under 400 that got our \u2013 really got our debt to EBITDA leverage back to 2.5. Going forward and looking out into next year, you're going to see the same type of process from us. And I'll let John talk about M&A. John Morikis : Yeah. I'd say, first, Arun. I think it's important to acknowledge that in challenging times, I think you get a sense for how much discipline and conviction you have in your strategy. Things get tough, you can find your way to want to buy a book of business, or let's just buy sales or sales \u2013 that's not who we are. I'm really proud of our teams on an organic basis as well as in the M&A space. We've got a very defined strategy that we're working here. And we're very much determined to stay on that, and that great pride in the fact that our teams are doing just that. Now that said, I'm also very pleased with the progress that we're making in this area. We've got some very good discussions going on and feel good about the targets that we're pursuing. As a reminder, the targets that we pursue largely will be in the industrial space, targets that fill either a technology gap or strength in a region that would help us in accelerating our existing businesses and their goals or in establishing a position in a geography where we're underrepresented. Now that said, our goal is not to be everything to everyone, everywhere. So we talk a lot internally about our rights to win, and how we'll go about this and bring into the market a unique and differentiated value that would help us to create shareholder value. So I'm pleased with the progress, and I think the discussions have gone pretty well here. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Arun. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort : Thank you. John, just curious, to that end, in terms of \u2013 it sounds like mainly you're interested in bolt-ons. In the past, you've talked about maybe optimizing the portfolio. Are there also some assets you might look to invest? Are you pretty comfortable with the portfolio you have at today? John Morikis : Well, comfort is not a good word here at Sherwin-Williams. We don't like comfort, nor do we like complacency, Bob. I think you know that. So we're constantly reviewing programs, SKUs, brands, businesses. I think we owe that to our shareholders. So I think there's a very disciplined approach that we take. We're very blessed to have four terrific group Presidents that understand that, and lead that. It is not something that Al and I and David are pulling on. I think these are terrific leaders that understand how to make money, how to create shareholder value. So there's a constant review on all levels, from businesses, all the way down to the SKU, including programs. And those programs are sometimes difficult. If you're launching a program, it's your baby, you want to stay close to that. But I think these terrific leaders are demonstrating a willingness to look at every decision and ensure that it's creating value. Bob Koort : And most of your markets, we sort of come to expect the performance that you delivered. It's been very strong. I'd say, a wide outlier was how well you did in refinish. So can you contextualize this for that? Of a $5 billion sales quarter, how much is auto refinish, and what markets you're in? And how did you capture that market share, that dramatic market share, relative to what the industry was doing? Thanks. John Morikis : Yeah. So thank you, Bob, for that question, because it's an opportunity to talk about a wonderful team here there that's been working really hard. And it's been unfortunate because they've been gaining a lot of ground in the midst of a COVID experience that's not allowed those numbers to shine through. We don't quantify the size of the business itself, but I will tell you that it's been trending positive. To your question, or point, we believe that we're aggressively growing market share here. We think it's a combination of the technology. People have been asking about synergies with Valspar and Sherwin. This is an excellent example of some of those synergies that come through as we've combined the legacy Sherwin technology, along with the legacy Valspar technology, to come up with a system that's been -- well, been understatement to say, that's been well received. It's been terrific. I spent some time with these large customers who have converted many of those shops over to Sherwin. And I'd say it's a combination of the technology as well as the channel model that we have. Our own stores servicing these customers. We have the same mentality through our automotive stores as we do our own architectural stores. And it's working. And it's working aggressively, and it's a bit of a pun, but we plan on putting a lot of gas in this tank. Jim Jaye : And Bob, this is Jim. What I'd add to that is auto, we saw growth in every region. So it wasn't just one niche there, it was every region that we operate. Bob Koort : I like the gas on the tank. John Morikis : All right. Thanks, Bob. Operator : The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar:  Yes, good morning. Jim Jaye : Hi, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Your margins were up almost 600 basis points. Can you roughly break that down between what benefit you got from higher volumes versus lower input costs? And earlier, I think you mentioned the mix effect. Even if it's a rough breakdown, can you just give us an idea how that breaks down? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. P.J., I know you've heard me say this a bunch of times, but it always starts with volume. And I talked about the mid-single-digit volume growth in architectural and TAG, or North America paint stores, where they talk about the high 20%-plus growth in our Consumer Brands Group. And we started seeing a return to sales growth with our Performance Coatings Group. So that's always the biggest driver. We did talk about the favorable product mix, and it was a little bit less than what we saw in the second quarter. As you know, raw materials moderated some. And again, we talked about our third quarter being less of an impact than the second quarter. And then we also had pricing that we had put in earlier this year. So, if you wanted to force rank them, I'd start with volume being over -- well over half of the increase, and then the other three kind of bucket rest of it in fairly similar order or size. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And John, a question for you. I mean, your execution on so far during this pandemic has been excellent. But just in case of scenario planning, if we have another wave of COVID, and it seems like it's already beginning, how do you think about the different businesses? Do you think DIY consumer will continue to be strong? And maybe the contractor recovery is a bit slower? I'm sure you're doing internal planning with all this, so can you just walk us through your -- how you're thinking in your decision entry? John Morikis : Sure, P.J., you're right, we do a lot of what we call war gaming out. And again, I'll come back to the points that I made earlier about the leadership teams that we have. We don't know exactly how it will unfold. What we are blessed with is a lot of experience, maybe I might refer to it as scar tissue, by teams at all levels that understand and can execute. And if you don't mind, maybe I could just take a second just to talk about why I have so much confidence in our ability to respond to whatever it might be. Because yes, you're right, we have thoughts and ideas of different scenarios. All of them come back to execution, and all of the execution comes back to the people that we have -- the terrific people we have in the field every day. So, if I could just take a second and explain why I feel so bullish about that. I mentioned in our financial community presentation last month, about the fact that our MTP program in our stores was reaching 40 years, and this is 40 years of recruiting outstanding talent, training and developing talent and retaining talent. And so when you ask, why do we have confidence and why we are able to execute? We're recruiting 1,500 college grads annually. That means we've got 10,000 of these college graduates throughout the company right now. When I say throughout the company, I'm not just talking about in TAG, I literally mean throughout the company. These are people that have maybe entered in through TAG. They understand our culture. They understand our strategy. They understand our expectations. They understand our aggressiveness. And that helps us so much. In fact, the fact that people come in through that management training program. In fact, 80% of our reps in our TAG business started their career in a store and that means they understand products, they understand logistics, customer service, everything that we have. And this allows us to promote from within. And so when we look at the leadership team that's responding to what your question is, which is what ifs? Well, we've got 70% of our TAG leadership, they started in these MTP programs. So they've started and they understand everything that we're asking our people and our stores to do. If you can imagine, having 70% of our leadership team have had that experience, and they know what to do. And that 70% then feeds our leadership. And I mentioned, at the financial community presentation, that talent pool continues to push up. We've got 6 group and Division Presidents that were MTPs, 26 Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents, and I was blesses a CEO to come through this. And what all that does is, it provides a clear line of sight to a career path that others can follow, and that helps our retention. And I believe, to answer your question, I think how we're able to do this is, it's the retention of wonderful talented people that have the skills, the resources and drives to be able to win. And I think that's the critical component in our strategy. And we've got a long history of it. And we've also got a long history of very low turnover. In fact, our turnover \u2013 voluntary turnover is around 7% to 8% and that's with nearly 5,000 stores. I don't think there are many companies that could push that out as a statistic, but we're proud of that. And what that then does is it drives the retention of our overall workforce. 7,000 of our employees have more than 20 years of service, and that's about 15% of our full-time employees. We're blessed to have that talent. And I think when you look at then all the way back, starting from the beginning, what does this allow us to do? Well, 80% of our reps in TAG, they have 5 years or more service. They've come through the stores, same with our industrial reps, by the way. But what this all means is we've got wonderful talent that we can retain. They're in a culture where they want to be. And so when this terrific leadership team takes the front and says, follow me, our people follow, and they execute better than anyone. And I'm a proud member and a small part of that because we win on the streets, and I'm really proud of what our teams are doing. P.J. Juvekar: Great, fantastic. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, PJ. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you, good morning. John, just going back to the SG&A investments in Q4, is there any way to quantify what the increase is either versus the prior year or versus Q3 in terms of this increase or this added investment? John Morikis : Yes, David, we haven't quantified them because we're just trying to tell you what we've done versus tell you what we're going to do. I would kind of frame it this way. In the fourth quarter, you do see seasonal reduction in sales related to architectural. Our typical cadence is our SG&A spending tends to be flat from the third quarter to fourth quarter, if you go back and look at it over a period of time. So you delever a little bit on a sequential basis. It doesn't -- I said we'll potentially delever a little bit year-over-year and not see as much benefit in SG&A as we saw in the third quarter. That's really dependent on -- I gave you a pretty wide sales range because of some of the uncertainties around different segments, general, industrial and some others that we had talked about. So as we see the continued sales momentum into November and December, that will tell me the cadence of what we can put in as investment. So we're trying to do the pedal and clutch, as one of our group presidents likes to talk about. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we're also looking at it from the long term, and that will tell you where SG&A comes in as a percent. David Begleiter : Very helpful. And now just going back to what you said earlier, are DIY sales up 23% combined in Q2 and Q3 year-over-year? John Morikis : That would be pretty close. Yes. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks David. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. A couple of questions on the subject of inventory. If I look at your own balance sheet, inventories decline\u2019s about 8% year-over-year in the third quarter, despite sales growth. And I suspect that many of your customers have been trying to manage for cash and liberate working capital as well. And so in that context, I'm wondering, do you expect to run assets harder than normal over the winter? And would you expect your customers to do the same, such that we might see a slightly different seasonal pattern through the first quarter of 2020, 2021 relative to normal? John Morikis : Yes, Kevin, to your first point, you're right. With the impressive DIY demand we've seen, we've been not building inventory as much as just maintaining our -- keeping up with the sales out the door. We absolutely are going to run our supply chain harder this fourth quarter and going into the first quarter to build inventory ahead of the spring selling season. As far as how we work with our customers, we want to make sure we're building the right products and getting to them at the right time. We don't think it's about just loading up inventory at store level, whether it's our stores or our architectural and consumer customers, but we're working with them. And it's going to also depend on what the trend that we see in DIY demand out of -- coming into the winter here in November or December and the early part of next year, and then ramping up to the spring. So that's going to be a constant. And I would tell you, we are working with our customers on a daily, weekly, monthly basis to make sure we're getting them the right products that they need. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin, I'd echo the point, and I'd like to just emphasize as we look, particularly on the consumer side. Heidi Petz and her team are working closely with each of those customers. We're going to drive inventory to support those customers. And if it means putting a little more in working capital, we'll do that, but we're going to serve those customers. John Morikis : Yes, Kevin, I guess I'd be remiss if I didn't say on the other side, where we've been under a little bit of pressure on the Performance Coatings side. I think that team has done a really, really nice job controlling inventory, so we didn't build the wrong inventory. And they've got a lot of different programs in place to try to drive complexity out of that supply chain, whether it's SKU rationalizations, platform consolidations. And I give that team a lot of credit for maintaining a disciplined approach to inventory, whereas on the DIY side, we're just full out. We're making as much as we can possibly make. Kevin McCarthy : That's really helpful. And then, as a second question for Jim, perhaps. I was curious about raw materials. You referenced some recent cost inflation probably since June is my guess. But just curious, if we flat line raw materials from October, what do you think that would say for the basket in 2021 versus 2020? Jim Jaye : Yes, Kevin, what I would tell you in \u2013 just based on our commentary that we gave in our prepared remarks, I mean, third quarter was down a mid-single-digit range. And the third quarter was mainly driven, again, by lower costs on resins, monomer, solvents. Going into our fourth quarter, we think we're still going to see a benefit year-over-year, but maybe not as much. We've seen some sequential tick up in some of the feedstocks, propylene has ticked up here, ethylene has ticked up even HDPE on the packaging side has ticked up. So we're seeing that. I think we start to think about 2021. It's probably a little bit early to be thinking about 2021. We'll give you that view in January as we typically do. But again, what I would say from a directional perspective is a couple of things. We're seeing sequential increases. Certainly, we've seen a rise in oil prices, which are putting pressure on some of those feedstocks, they're not always totally connected, but there is some pressure there. We've seen the upstream capacity from refineries, crackers, PDH units, they're managing tighter through this pandemic. So we're seeing some tighter supply demand and scenarios there. And demand is picking up. So all of those could be factors that we're looking at. On the TiO2 side, again, we're watching that closely as well heading into next year. And it's all about, I think, what demand is going to do. To this point, North America and chloride been pretty stable. Chinese TiO2 players have been out with some increases here recently. So a lot of moving parts there, but still a benefit in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we just don't have a lot of clarity yet. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. Thank you very much. Jim Jaye : You bet. Operator : Your next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thanks very much. A quick one on interior paint, are you noticing any regional trends, whether it's a state level or just a section of the country level as it relates to interior, just thinking in terms of COVID virus trends, or is there any sort of differences between how fast interior is coming back to which part of the country you look at? John Morikis : Not really, Vincent. I'd say it was a bit slower in some of the more urban areas, but we are starting to see some pickup in those areas as well. So I can't just \u2013 I can't explain it. If people are just getting tired enough to the point where they're saying just come on in, or they're leaving, or what's happening, but we are \u2013 it's pretty well even across the country. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And then just one last question on your cost side of the equation. In the stores, now that we're a few quarters into this, has it become apparent that you have higher costs associated with servicing customers because of COVID that you might need to recover next year, or is that not the case? John Morikis : Not the case. Vincent Andrews : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, Vincent. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you and good morning, everyone. If we could go back to the consumer brands and, in particular, for the DIY business. Can you talk about the margins and growth expectations when DIY slows down to a more normal environment post-COVID? And can you give us an idea as to how much you lowered the breakeven point when you look at what you did this year versus nine months versus last year? Al Mistysyn : Yeah, Rosemarie. I would say, our expectations don't get any easier. We're expecting that the investments we're making in the programs across each of the customers are going to drive continued volume. And that could be on DIY. It could be on the Pro. We expect that, like we've done over this past year, is really focused on where we're not performing as well as we could be. And we talked about the improvements we've made in our international businesses. And just to kind of put that in perspective, I mean, our international sales for the quarter were up 26%. And flow-through is over 65%. So we're seeing the benefits of those actions as well as we had talked about the favorable product mix, and part of that was exiting the ACE private label business. We're looking at our cost structure on how we support that field organization and making those changes as we need to. So I wouldn't say, just because DIY slows, we should automatically expect to see our margins contract back to prior year levels. I think the high-teens to low 20s that we talked about. As you know, when we set a new high watermark, that is the new target, and we'll talk about what we expect on those operating margins going forward in the future here. Rosemarie Morbelli : And. following up on that, is there a difference? And I know you cannot talk about customers specifically, but nevertheless, is there a difference between the profitability level at the Lowe's versus all of the other smaller type of retail? John Morikis : You're exactly right, Rosemarie. We're not going to talk about that. Rosemarie Morbelli : Well, I said, I would try. John Morikis : You can repeat the question now. Rosemarie Morbelli : And then looking at the interest expense level, just quickly, is that 83.3 million, a new level, or should we expect it to go down because of the timing of your debt repayment? Al Mistysyn : I'm sorry, Rosemarie, I lost the first half of that question. Rosemarie Morbelli : Interest expense declined to $83.3 million in the third quarter. Is that a new level, or is it going to decline some more, depending on when we paid $400 million in this quarter? Al Mistysyn : Yeah, it's probably a good estimate going forward. We're looking at some things with next year and even into the 2022 tranches to do something with. But I think that's a good level right now. Rosemarie Morbelli : And at 2.5 times net leverage, it sounded based on previous comments that debt reduction is no longer a priority? Al Mistysyn : I would agree with that. We talked about not really looking to reduce debt coming into this year. But based on the circumstances, and what was happening, I thought it was prudent to take it down. So \u2013 but yeah, you are absolutely correct. Rosemarie Morbelli : All right. Thank you. Jim Jaye : Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Hi. Good morning. Jim Jaye : Good morning, Mike. Mike Harrison : I was wondering if you can talk about what you're seeing in the independent peak dealer channel within consumer? Are they seeing as robust of a DIY pickup as you guys have? I guess the question I'm trying to get to is, are they maintaining share, or are they continuing to see migration toward maybe your stores or other company-own stores as well as big box retailers? John Morikis : Hi, Mike, as you know, we don't get POS data from those independence. We do believe though that third quarter was strong across most of the independent dealers. It's an environment where they're probably doing pretty well. Hard to say that they're gaining or losing share right now, real time, but I would say that they are likely benefiting to some degree from the same nesting issue that most people in the paint business are in urgency right now as it relates to DIY. Al Mistysyn : I think, Mike, on the long-term, though, I think this channel will likely continue to lose share. The Pro DIY shift continues because we do believe it will go back. I know it's shifted a little bit to do-it-yourself in this cycle. But longer term, we expect this shift to go back to do-it-for-me, and the continued market share gains that we see in the home centers. Mike Harrison : All right. And then in terms of the packaging business, your results there, that seems to be another area where you're doing quite a bit better than the underlying market or where some of your competitors are it sounds like beverage can demand is really strong. Is that an area where you have relatively higher share? Can you maybe talk about differences in your mix that might be contributing to the strength in that packaging business? John Morikis : Mike, I would tell you that is an area of strength for us. But I would tell you, as it relates to packaging, we've got a terrific team there that's doing a wonderful job as well as wonderful technology. I think we're growing share pretty aggressively in both food and beverage. And we expect that to continue. Mike Harrison : All right. Thanks very much. John Morikis : Thank you, Mike. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty : Yeah, thanks for taking my question. So you made some compelling comments earlier in the Q&A around, I guess, you kind of called them, easy comps. And so it kind of sets the Stage 4 for what should be volume growth next year. I guess, with that in mind and the fact that volumes tend to be the biggest drivers of your margins, should we be assuming that there's room for updraft in the margins as we look to 2021, or are there some offtakes that we need to be considering, whether it's raw materials or temporary cost rollbacks or mix or what have you that maybe hampers that a little bit? How should we be thinking about that? John Morikis : Hey, John, I'm going to have Al answer that, but I want to make sure that I correct it. We never said, easy comps, we said, favorable comps. John McNulty : A fair point, a fair point. John Morikis : In that entire TAG leadership team down there, having their chests suggesting that nothing is easy down there. They're doing want to acknowledge that and say that they're favorable, not easy. Now, Al, you could answer that. Al Mistysyn : Yeah, John. We do expect to see a more normal demand environment as we go into next year. Some of the favorableness we saw in the two quarters that I talked about on favorable customer and product mix, some of the strength in DIY and volume that we're starting to see on performance coatings. So as a company, our mix of businesses is going to get to a more normal level is some of these businesses where we have opportunities start coming back. That being said, I mean, we're going through our planning process. We're going to continue to look at driving or operating margin leverage. And that's going to come from continued expansion in the gross margin and continued leverage on SG&A. And depending on what we see from a raw material environment, from a pricing environment, from a -- that will kind of tell me what we can continue to invest in or where we have to get more leverage on SG&A. But we're not that far along in that process yet. And as we have typically done, we'll come back to you at the end of the year with our 2021 guidance to give you more color around that. John McNulty : Got it. Fair enough. And I appreciate the color. And then the other question would just be on the capital deployment side. When you look at the M&A pipeline that you see right now, would you say the bid asks have started to narrow at this point or are they still relatively widen? And you kind of need to see things kind of further shrink down on that before pulling the trigger? How should we be thinking about that? John Morikis : John, I'd say they're beginning to narrow down. We're feeling as though some of what's happening in the marketplace right now as people looking hard at the mirror and asking how much further and how much harder they want to run. And others that are saying, I want to be a little more realistic. So, I'd say that the gap is narrowed. John McNulty : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Jim Jaye : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. Got two questions. Just on the pricing, has there been any pricing in Performance Coatings, especially considered in that there's a capacity increase that's now coming? And then I have a follow-up. John Morikis : On a targeted basis, there has been, Greg. Greg Melich : Okay. Could we say that overall that there was some help to the top line in Performance Coatings year-over-year? John Morikis : Yes. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Greg, I think the way I would look at that is because Performance Coatings businesses are so diverse and product quantities and the like, I mean, if you take FX out of it, in currency neutral, it'd be up 2.6. You probably could split that evenly between price and mix, because mix plays a part there and volume. Greg Melich : Got it. Thanks for that. And then on capital allocation, I just want to make sure I'm getting the pieces right here. Thanks for reminding us of how you're doing it with the dividends and the buybacks. CapEx, once you start working on the new headquarters and the R&D center and everything, should we expect that to go up to sort of sort of $400 million? I'm just trying to figure out, if the cash from ops are $2.5 billion that the balance sheet is de-levered? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Greg, we're going to have probably a couple -- two years here, where the facility projects are going to take us up over -- certainly, over $400 million. Depending on timing and where we're at in that construction process, it could approach $500 million for a year. So, it will be up about 2% for a couple of years. But long-term, we'll still trend it back below 2%. Greg Melich : Got it. And then it sounds like this $400 million run rate for the buyback then could become a run rate, not just a quarter? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Greg, you look at $600 million, we had sitting on our balance sheet in the third quarter. I do expect to have, again, strong cash generation here in the fourth quarter and we'll use that excess cash to buy back stock. Greg Melich : That's great. Good luck everyone. Operator : Next question is from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. Just question on China, because it's recovered much faster than other geographies, it's not a huge business for you. But can you go through kind of the end markets in coatings there? And how you see those coming out of this dip? And then second follow on to that would be, is China a fruitful area to look for M&A for you guys now that you've got more expertise there with the Valspar acquisition? John Morikis : Yes. Duffy, I'd say that if you look at our Performance Coatings business, 5 of the -- actually, all 6 of the industrial businesses, 5 of the businesses were positive in the third quarter in Asia. We feel there's some good momentum there. And our ability to bring solutions to those customers, we think, helps to differentiate us. So yes, we expect that to continue to grow. I'll add in the architectural piece as well, although I don't know that you were asking that as much as maybe the industrial side. But we've got, I think a terrific opportunity long-term there. So we're doing some work there and some, we believe, good groundwork that will help generations down the road, not next quarter, as we establish the brand and channel for the architectural side. But if you look at our industrial businesses there, they're all pretty strong. And as far as M&A in that market, yes, we're interested in the right businesses there that could help to accelerate our strategy. Again, I'll go back to the very disciplined approach that we take here, which is not just buying a book of business, but something that brings value to our shareholders. We find the right targets in there that can help us, yes, we'd be interested. Duffy Fischer : Terrific. Thank you, guys. John Morikis : Thanks Duffy. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Chris Parkinson : Good morning guys. So just taking a step back from COVID factors. How should investors think about the key long-term growth pillars in PC? I assume packaging is just one area of growth enthusiasm, given your consistent outperformance already. But how should we think about the other substrates and your positioning in order to outgrow the respective end markets? So just trying to get a sense of your normalized PC growth algorithm? Thank you. John Morikis : Yes, Chris, we do believe that we're growing faster than market right now. And you're right, packaging from a technical standpoint, approval process standpoint, nearly every aspect of packaging is pointing in our direction. So we're feeling really good about that. We talked about coil and the process that we've been going through and new wins or share of wallet, as we like to say, and we expect that to continue to grow. And so our expectations of that team are very high as well. I'd say, we didn't really talk all about it in great depth, but we're really proud of the industrial wood business and the performance. It wasn't long ago, that business was something like made your head hurt. But I'd say it's moving in the right direction here pretty aggressively, and that team is really demonstrating the fact that they've got their hands around this business moving in the right direction and got the lot of confidence, particularly when you look as I mentioned in the prepared remarks about the new residential business and the linkage between that industrial wood business and the growth there in industrial wood. Auto, we talked about the positioning that we've had and how we're growing there already, and it's just not been as visible as we would like because of we're only about 75% back on the road. So we often say, we don't want to be ambulance chasers, but the more roads on \u2013 the more cars on the road, the more refinished business there's going to be. And so we're feeling really good about this. Next, then come to areas GI that we've talked about. We love our position here. And to your point, or the question earlier, I believe, I think, Greg or Duffy asked about, our Asia position with leadership? And we look at that Valspar leadership that came with that acquisition. And we've often referred to that as the greatest infusion of talent in the company's history. And so when we look at the auto business and GI, we look at terrific technology and talent that has come here. And we expect to help \u2013 that to help up our business in this GI business. Aaron Erter, our Group President of this business, is really doing a wonderful job in a very challenging market, and we've got confidence that each one of these are going to drive. We talked earlier in the life cycle of this acquisition, about our goal to drive the operating margins here in the high teens, low 20s, and we have every bit of expectation and confidence that we're going to do that. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Chris, I'd just add to that point. I mean, you look at our third quarter small sales increase of 1.2% and a 110-point operating margin improvement. That just goes \u2013 and I got to highlight the team and give them credit, that goes to all the hard work. They've been putting in even the second half of last year as we saw things starting to slow outside of the U.S., they've done a really nice job of working on reducing complexity, reducing SKUs, improving their operations so that when they do get volume, they'll get more leverage on that volume coming out of this pandemic than when we went into it. Chris Parkinson : Very helpful. And just the follow-up would be, when we're sitting back and thinking about DIY trends, just drilling down a little bit more, can you just comment on the end market demand for stains and sealants versus interior paints? It seems the former, on the demand front, was very strong and you had to rise to the challenge in terms of reduction. But if we're parsing that out next year, are there any major considerations on the best way to think about that as we head into 2021? Thank you. Al Mistysyn : I think, Chris, it goes back to the DIY comment that I talked about the stain and sealants are in there, and it's part of that 25%. That's up \u2013 25% of our company, that's up over 20%. And I still think we have such great opportunities in the other 75% of our company to offset any declines in DIY that we see next year. John Morikis : We do. And we also have most powerful brands in those areas to build on as well. And a wonderful team that understands that, that we'll execute on that. So I think we will kind of be approaching this from both sides aggressively. Chris Parkinson : Thank you very much. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Chris Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. David Bellinger : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. So first on the Consumer Brands segment, you characterized DIY demand is elevated throughout the entire quarter. Can you walk us through what you were seeing towards the end of Q3? Was that business strengthening further, even as you move into a typically lower volume Q4 period from a seasonality standpoint? John Morikis : Yes. David, it's pretty flat. I mean, if you look at it on a same-day basis, it's pretty flat throughout the quarter. David Bellinger : Got it. Okay. And then just a follow up on an early earlier comment around the --? John Morikis : About what? I'm sorry? David Bellinger : The Pro business and the Pro contractor business. Can you just give us an update there in terms of project backlog and bids? Is there any way to quantify that trend? And you also mentioned an uptick in the sales of spray equipment. What has that told you about the business historically? And how long do the sales typically track higher after those type of purchases? John Morikis : Yes, I would say that we have seen and heard from our customers that the backlog has grown on the part of our contractors. That's evidenced by the fact that they are busy more and have more customers now allowing them in their homes, but still a long list of people that are hopeful that the projects would be coming in soon. I think some pace of that is going to increase with more allowing people in as they're going to be spending more time perhaps in their homes, preparing for the holidays, whatever it might be. So, I'd say that the backlog is good, strong and growing on the part of our residential repaying customers. So, as it relates to the spray equipment, I'd rather not give you any specifics on how long or what that means from a timing perspective. I will tell you that we see a direct correlation between the confidence of the spray equipment sales and the mentality of the contractor has before making that purchase. So, when they're plucking out a couple of thousand dollars or so on a piece of equipment, they're betting that these projects that they have coming up will allow them to pay for them. So, it's a good precursor for what's down the road. David Bellinger : That's fair. Appreciate the color here. Thanks guys. Jim Jaye : Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Garik Shmois : Hi thanks. Just a follow-up on the discussion of favorable comps in certain parts of TAG, thinking about commercial and property management, in particular, can these verticals be positive next year, just given some of the green shoots you're seeing right now? John Morikis : Yes. Very much. So we're excited about this. Yes. I mean, these are -- I use the term I was thoughtful in using that term favorable comps. Yes. You got commercial down low single-digits, property maintenance, mid-single-digits here in the quarter, and we have a wonderful position here, great people, great products, great relationships. Yes. We're going to -- yes. The answer is yes. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thanks. A follow-up question is just going back to a comment in the prepared remarks. If there's an infrastructure bill, say, in the first half of next year, how quickly could your wastewater business with Protective & Marine see the benefit? John Morikis : Well, so you're talking about how long before a bill is passed and paint is applied? I mean, it would vary, obviously, by project. But I'd say you could see that in a quarter or so, likely. That's a guess on my part. I'd say our position there is very strong, particularly on water and wastewater. It's been a good position and growing for us. But I'd say when you look at general \u2013 or I'm sorry, the protective and marine, and the contractors that typically do that type of work, those are typically areas that we do very well with. So as soon as it hits the Street, we would be right on top of that. Garik Shmois : Great. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, Garik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thank you. Is there an opportunity to further optimize your store's footprint, given all the changes going on in the commercial real estate market, malls closing down and so forth? I'm sure not all of your stores are in the most optimum location? John Morikis : Yeah, John, we look at that on a regular basis. And the opportunity for us as markets turns, change and develop. And so the beauty of our approach is how we structure those decisions are as close to the customer as possible with support. So those decisions and opportunities are something that we leverage figuratively. Al Mistysyn : Yeah, John, and I would just say, we have taken the opportunity to do that. We've closed. And when I say closed, it's a lease expiration that we then moved to a different location, about 16 stores in the U.S. and Canada. We did about six last year. So a little bit stronger pace this year than last year. But like John said, it's a regular process for us. John Roberts : All right. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard : Can you break out at all, within the pro business, the difference between interior and exterior growth on the res repaint side? I know that 4Q and 1Q are bigger interior quarters. Just trying to see what the momentum and the growth profile looks like between interior relative to exterior? John Morikis : Now, Eric, I would tell you that we've spoken about the double-digit growth that we've seen in exterior, the very strong high single-digit growth in interior. Obviously, the interior paint market is much larger than the exterior, but we're not going to provide any more detail on our sales of those products and help you understand that. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Eric, I think what I talked about in the -- either the second quarter, or at FCP, was the fact that in the out quarters are interior to exterior ratio is four to one, on the interior -- on the two biggest quarters, it's three to one. So it was a little bit less than that in our third quarter just because of the strength of exterior. Eric Bosshard : And then the momentum within interior, is that stable, or is that month-to-month improving? And it couldn't even be anecdotal, John, I understand sort of detail of this, but just trying to get a sense on the comfort of consumers and pros getting more active interior? John Morikis : Eric, I'd say that it is an area of comfort and confidence that we have. It's moving. And as I mentioned earlier, it's, for the most part across the country, and for the most part, nearly all of our residential repaint customers. You'll hear some pockets of concern. But for the most part, I'd say there's a strong excitement inside our building about the interior growth. Eric Bosshard : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : Yeah. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Hocevar : Everybody on the -- looking at Consumer Brands businesses, the Australia business, in particular. If we rerouted the clock, about year ago, this was an area of disappointment. But here we are, sales are growing strong double digits. I think you guys said total international up 26%. I don't know exactly what Australia is in there, but you guys said double digits. So curious it seems things have turned around. I'm curious how much of this is the product of the environment that everything is doing well versus the actions that you guys have taken to really improve the business? Curious of the progress that we've seen there? John Morikis : I'd say it's a little bit of both, Kevin. I'd say we've got a terrific leader. Brian Patton has done a very nice job of running all of those industrial -- I'm sorry, the international architectural businesses for us. This business, as you mentioned, delivered double-digit growth and it improved its profitability. And we think that we've definitely seen an increased effort to develop the right platform channels for distribution through our team. They've done a nice job of taking out costs and the actions associated with that are not always easy or fun, but this team did a really, really nice job of taking the right steps and right actions and a double-digit growth with reduced expenses, and you start to see an improved bottom line. Kevin Hocevar : And then in terms of the guidance for the performance segment in the fourth quarter of sales being flat, plus or minus low single digits, it seems like -- it seems to imply that we kind of stall from what we saw in the third quarter, but it seems like momentum is building in all the different subsegments within the segment. It looks like the comps are a little bit easier in the fourth quarter. And I would think that FX would be better sequentially. So that all seems to add up to some acceleration, but it seems like the guidance implies kind of similar results in 4Q versus 3Q? So curious your thoughts there. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin. I think one of the comments we made on GI is this an inventory build. Or are we going to be able to see sell-through on that inventory? And so -- and there's momentum. But outside some of these markets and some of these businesses, there's still choppiness that we're accounting for. John Morikis : I think yes, sequentially, we've seen improvement in -- the other thing they like to build on Al's point, even in these challenging times, the 5 global business units that sit in PCG all grew in all regions. So I mean, there's some pretty good momentum that we have coming along here. Kevin Hocevar : Okay. Thank you very much. A \u2013 Al Mistysyn : Thank you Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Justin Speer : Hey good afternoon. Thanks guys. I just had a couple of questions, one being the SG&A side of the ledger. And I apologize if this has already been addressed. But on the Analyst Day, you mentioned you're making incremental growth investments in the fourth quarter, and you weren't going to see as much leverage there. Maybe -- can you articulate maybe how much margin headwind is expected from that investment? Maybe can you speak to the nature of those growth investments? And maybe how we should think about that going forward as you make those important growth -- continue to invest in your business? A \u2013 Al Mistysyn : Yes. Justin, what I try to say is, we haven't laid out the amounts that we're investing. Some of them get into very specific customers, others we'd rather tell you what we've done versus what we're going to do. But part of the leverage will depend on the cadence of how we put in new stores and reps across each of our segments, how much in the e-commerce platform are investing relative to what our volume looks like in the fourth quarter. If we're at the higher end of the volume, we may be able to get more investments in, and still see an improvement and get SG&A leverage year-over-year. If we're at the lower end of that volume range, we're probably not going to see leverage on SG&A, because I think it's important that we stay the course. We're taking a disciplined approach to it. We know it's the right thing to do long term. I'm not trying to get to a perfect quarter in the fourth quarter. But, we're managing it as we go through the quarter. John Morikis : Yes. And Justin, it sounds like you mentioned that you may have missed the earlier response. I think it's important to build on the point Al made earlier, which is \u2013 this is very similar to the 2008 run that we experienced. We've got a long-tenured leadership here at Sherwin. It's been through many of these movies here before. And we know how to invest. While it hits the SG&A line. I would tell you, Al and the other control \u2013 the group controllers that work with Al, there's a very disciplined approach in this. So this is not money that we look at spending, these are investments. A very high level of discipline and expectations come along with those investments. Justin Speer : Makes a lot of sense. I\u2019ll just leave it there. Appreciate your time and attention. Thank you, guys. Jim Jaye : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Rob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Really appreciate your interest there entire leadership team. I hope you feel came through, we're very confident very optimistic about our fourth quarter prospects and where we're heading into 2021. I will be available along with my colleague Eric Swanson for your follow-ups today and the rest of the week. And please, contact Natalie Darr to get in the queue. So thanks again for your interest. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect your line lines at this time.

A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the Company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you, and good morning everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered outstanding results in the fourth quarter. The momentum with which we exited the third quarter continued in the fourth quarter, with the pace of growth accelerating across our Pro Architectural and Industrial Customer segments. We saw continued unprecedented growth in our DIY business during the quarter, a double-digit increase in residential repaint solid expansion in new residential, modest improvements in commercial and property management, and high single-digit growth in our industrial segment. Fourth quarter 2020 consolidated sales increased 9.1% to $4.49 billion dollars. Consolidated gross margin increased 140 basis points to 47.4%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $206.5 million to $503.9 million. The fourth quarter of 2020 included $77.4 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense. The fourth quarter of 2019 included $119.3 million of acquisition-related amortization expense and other acquisition costs, and $71.3 million of other adjustments, which included non-cash impairment charges related to indefinite lived trademarks partially offset by a Brazil indirect tax credit. Excluding these items, consolidated profit before tax increased 19.1% to $581.3 million, with flow-through of 25%. Diluted net income per share in the quarter increased to $4.46 per share, from $2.66 per share a year ago. The fourth quarter of 2020 included acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.63 per share. The fourth quarter of 2019 included acquisition-related amortization expense and other adjustments of $1.61 per share as described in our press release. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 19.2% to $5.09 per share, from $4.27 per share. EBITDA grew to $733.9 million in the quarter or 16.3% of sales. Net operating cash grew to $844.8 million in the quarter or 18.8% of sales. All three of our operating segments delivered excellent top-line growth, margin expansion and strong flow through in the quarter. Segment margin in the Americas Group improved 270 basis points to 21.7% of sales, resulting primarily from operating leverage on the top-line growth and favorable mix. Flow-through was 51.3%. Adjusted segment margin in Consumer Brands Group improved 280 basis points to 13.6% of sales, resulting primarily from operating leverage on the double-digit top line growth. Flow-through was 34.6%. Adjusted segment margin in Performance Coatings Group improved 100 basis points to 14.4% of sales, driven by operating leverage on the high-single digit sales growth and lower input costs. Flow-through was 28.1%. Let me now turn the call over to John Morikis for additional commentary on 2020 along with our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2021. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. The strong results in our fourth quarter led to another record year for Sherwin-Williams. My deepest appreciation and respect go out to all 61,000 members of our incredible global family and to our leadership team for everything they've done. While none of us anticipated the severity of this year's challenges, our people responded as they always do when facing adversity, with extraordinary effort, with determination and with resiliency. When it mattered most, this team delivered, and I'm incredibly grateful for all they do. To that end, our full-year 2020 results demonstrate the strength of our people, our business model and our solutions-based approach to meeting customer needs. We generated record sales despite the impacts of COVID-19. Cash from operations, net income and net income per diluted share also were in records and increased by double-digit percentages over 2019. I'd like to call out just a few full-year highlights in more detail. Sales increased 2.6%, including a negative impact of 1.1% related to currency translation, to a record $18.4 billion. Gross margin improved 240 basis points to 47.3%. EBITDA grew to a record $3.4 billion or 18.7% of sales. Segment margin expanded in all three business groups. Adjusted diluted net income per share, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and other items called out in our press release, increased 16.4% to $24.58 per share. Net operating cash for the year increased to a record $3.41 billion or 18.6% of sales. We returned approximately $2.93 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, an increase of 145% over the prior year. We invested $303.8 million in our business through capital expenditures. And we retired $400 million in debt, ending the year with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times. As Jim described, we achieved these record full-year results with a strong close to the year. Let me provide some more detail about our segment performance in the fourth quarter. In the Americas Group, fourth quarter sales increased by 9% over the same period a year ago, including just under 2 percentage points of price and a headwind of 1.2 percentage points related to unfavorable currency translation. Same-store sales in the US and Canada were up 9.3%. We saw consistent trends across the business in the quarter, and we significantly outpaced the rate of growth we delivered in our third quarter. In Residential Repaint, our largest segment, we delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Interior and exterior work were both strong. Existing home sales are robust, and contractors are reporting solid backlogs. I'm also pleased to report that once again we grew this segment by double-digits on a full-year basis. We continue to see great opportunities here for share gains going forward. Demand remained unprecedented in our DIY business where sales were up by a double-digit percentage for the fourth consecutive quarter. New residential also remained an area of strength for us with the rate of growth accelerating from mid-single digits in the third quarter-to-high single digits in the fourth quarter. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since summer, and customers are reporting solid order rates. We've not yet seen meaningful recovery in our commercial business, which was up slightly in the fourth quarter. The predominant theme remains that projects are being delayed rather than cancelled. Property maintenance was also up slightly in the quarter, though turnover in multifamily properties remains low. Protective and Marine was down by double-digit percentage where growth in our smaller customer segments such as Flooring, Bridge and Highway and Water and Wastewater treatment, was more than offset by softness in the Oil and Gas segment. We continue to aggressively pursue opportunities in all of these end markets. From a product perspective, sales in both Interior and Exterior paint were up by double-digit percentages, with Interior becoming a larger part of the mix than it was in the third quarter, as is normal for our fourth quarter. Heavy equipment sales also were up double digits in the quarter. Contractors typically invest in this type of equipment in anticipation of solid demand. In December we announced a 3% to 4% price increase to our US and Canada customers effective February 1. We would expect to realize approximately 1.5% from price in the first quarter and just under 2% in the following quarter. We opened 54 new stores for the full year in the US and Canada, partially offset by consolidation of underperforming stores, the majority of which were in Latin America. Along with these stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new product and productivity-enhancing services to drive additional growth. We're also pleased by a continuing uptick in the use of our e-commerce platform. Moving onto our Consumer Brands Group, we delivered sales growth of 13.6% in the quarter, including 1.4 percentage points of positive impact related to currency translation as DIY demand remained robust. Sales in North America increased in line with our mid-teens segment growth guidance. International demand was variable with Australia up low-double digits, Europe up low-single digits and Asia down mid-single digits, respectively. Our global supply chain organization continued to perform at a high level in the quarter, working collaboratively with our customers and businesses to help meet the strong demand. The strong sales growth, along with prior portfolio improvements and international cost reductions, drove this significant improvement in our margin performance. Last, let me comment on our fourth quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. Following an encouraging third quarter, we continued to build momentum across the business in the fourth quarter. Group sales increased by high single-digit percentage. The impact of currency translation was not material in the quarter. Price was positive in all regions, and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in Asia grew the fastest in the quarter, up by a strong double-digit percentage. Europe and Latin America also grew by double-digit percentages. North America sales were just slightly positive. From a divisional perspective, I'll start with our Coil Coatings business, where growth was up double digits in the quarter and positive in every region. This team continues to do a remarkable job at winning new accounts in all regions. We're also seeing the gradual resumption of selected commercial construction projects. Our Packaging Team also continues to deliver great results. Sales were up double digits in the quarter and positive in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust. Our non-BPA coating continued to gain traction, and both we and our customers are investing in capacity expansion. Sales in the Industrial Wood division were up by a double-digit percentage in the quarter. Positive trends in new residential construction are driving increased demand for kitchen cabinetry, flooring, and furniture. We're especially encouraged by the return to growth in our General Industrial division, where sales were up by a high-single digit percentage in the quarter. We saw a meaningful improvement in portions of our Heavy Equipment, Building Products and Container segments as well as more General Finishing. We believe the strong performance was a mix of inventory restocking by some of our customers and growing in demand. Sales were up in all regions except North America, which was down about 1% but improved significantly from the third quarter. Sales were also slightly positive in the Automotive Refinish division in the quarter. Heightened social restrictions and lower than normal holiday travel due to a resurgence in COVID pressured miles driven and collision shop volume. Turning to our 2021 outlook, we see an operating environment with very solid North American new residential and residential repaint demand. The trajectory of recovery in Commercial and Property Maintenance is likely to be choppy and comparisons in DIY will be challenging. We anticipate Industrial demand will continue to improve as the year progresses. The impact of variables such as the timing of the COVID vaccine, the incoming US administration and proposed stimulus and infrastructure spending are hard to gauge at this point. That said, our team is skilled at adapting to any number of conditions. And we have many opportunities to grow share in all of our businesses. We'll continue to target growing at a rate that outpaces the market through customer-driven solutions based on innovation, value-added service and differentiated distribution. For the first quarter of 2021, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a high-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2020. We expect the Americas Group to be up high-single digits. We expect Consumer Brands to be up by a mid-teens percentage, and we expect Performance Coatings Group be up by mid-to-high-single digits. For the full year 2021, we expect net sales to increase by a mid-to-high single digit percentage. First half growth is expected to be stronger than second half given the negative impact COVID had on our first half a year ago. We expect the Americas Group to be up a mid-to-high-single-digit percentage, Consumer Brands Group to be up or down by low-single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a mid-single-digit percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $23.87 to $24.67 per share compared to $22.08 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $2.53 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full-year 2021 earnings per share of $26.40 to $27.20, an increase of 9% at the midpoint over the $24.58 we delivered in 2020. One key assumption embedded in our outlook is that the market rate of inflation for our raw material basket will be up by a low-to-mid-single-digit percentage in 2021 compared to 2020, assuming no further escalation above our current outlook and no supply disruption. We expect to see year-over-year inflation in all four quarters, with the largest impact likely occurring in the middle two quarters. We expect the rate of inflation to be most significant on the petrochemical side of the basket. As we've demonstrated in the past, we will seek to offset these increased costs with pricing actions as appropriate. Let me close with some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Given volume growth, pricing actions and our ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, we expect full-year gross margin expansion. We expect to get SG&A leverage in 2021 by controlling costs tightly in non-customer facing functions. We'll continue to make investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to return to our normal cadence with around 80 new stores opening in the US and Canada in 2021. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, as well as systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform in the Home Center channel. These investments are embedded in our full-year guidance. We expect currency exchange will not have a material impact on sales for the full year. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. Our core CapEx guidance for the year is approximately $370 million. In addition to this core CapEx, we expect to make investments of approximately $100 million in 2021 related to our new headquarters and our new R&D facility project. Depreciation should be about $300 million, and amortization will be about $310 million. Interest expense should be about $340 million. We have $25 million of long-term debt due in 2021. Historically, we've targeted dividends at about 30% of our prior-year GAAP earnings. Next month, at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 23.5% to $6.62 per share, up from $5.36 last year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. 2020 was a very challenging year, and I'm incredibly proud of the way our team responded to deliver record sales and earnings. As 2021 begins, we're energized and more determined than ever to capitalize on the many opportunities we see in each one of our businesses. We believe the long-term fundamental strengths of our end markets remain intact. We're poised to thrive in 2021, and as I mentioned last quarter, we feel like we're just getting started in many ways. Our team is experienced, our goals are clear. Our solutions are many, and our confidence is high. We remain focused on delivering value for all of our stakeholders over the long term. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess, first off, on your fiscal year 2021 guidance, TAG up mid-to-high-single digits. Can you sort of walk us through your current view on the various subsegments in there? There has been some divergence thus far in Residential versus Commercial Construction in the US, how do you sort of expect that to evolve as the year unfolds? John Morikis : Ghansham, I'd say, first, we have great confidence in the market here. We've been working very hard as you know to position the company to strategically thrive whichever way the table tilts. So while there may be some shifts in the market, we believe we'll be able to capitalize on the opportunities regardless of which way the market may move. So let me just run through quickly to answer your question. I think from a New Residential standpoint, we think coming off a high-single digits in the fourth quarter, we believe that permits are strong, and our position in New Residential is very strong. As you know, we've got a terrific position with 18 of the top 20 homebuilders. And we expect that that momentum that they are experiencing will result in some nice gains for us. We're also very pleased with the gains that we've been making with the regional builders. So from a New Residential position, we're feeling really, really good. From a Residential Repaint position, I'd say that the strength that we mentioned earlier, double digits now for six consecutive years, give us a lot of confidence in the way that this business is moving. This is driven by both Interior/Exterior work as we talked about, and homeowners now beginning to let these painters back into their homes has us feeling really good, not only about the market itself but our growing position there. The backlog in this Residential Repaint business gives us additional confidence. There has been some question about any shift between do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me. And we believe that the do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me are both terrific opportunities. The do-it-yourself remains strong. Consumers are nesting and while there, they are choosing to jump on the opportunity to make an impactful difference in their home in a very reasonable project from an investment standpoint and time, so we're excited about the momentum that we have there as well. We're working hard. It's a relatively small percentage of our business overall, DIY, but our net promoter score even in these challenging times, both on the professional side and a DIY side are improving. So we're going to work hard to continue to retain those customers that have entered into our stores. Commercial improved significantly over the third quarter, down from double-digits to slightly positive. Still a recovery has been more muted here than the Residential Repaint and New Residential. Projects here are beginning to open back up, but with restrictions for distancing and number of people on the projects requiring PPE. So we're working closely with our contractors there. We navigate through these challenges, and we think it's a terrific opportunity for us to support our customers as they grow it in the new world here. And then finally in Property Maintenance, recovery in Property Maintenance as I mentioned earlier, remains slow but positive. Demographics here for apartments are favorable, it's just under pressure with turns. So maintenance in Property Management, in the area of apartments has been slow, but also in areas like hotels, restaurants, etc. We are seeing in the multifamily area investments - CapEx investments to upgrade properties. This has gained traction in areas somewhat influenced by the deurbanization. And this would be where you might have C-level properties going to B and B to A. Again we've got a terrific position here with relationships with 18 of the top 20 property management companies. So I'd say whichever - I walked through those kind of quickly, but whichever way these markets tilt we're, as I mentioned, feeling really good about that. So if homeowners, who now have been called back to work, end up back on the production line or traveling for their businesses or back in their offices, wherever those gallons are sold, we like the position that we are in to be able to capitalize on it. So we're really confident about that. And Jim, maybe you can take a moment just to talk about the macro data that supports our confidence. Jim Jaye : Yes, John, sure. And good morning, Ghansham. If you look at the New Residential piece, obviously John mentioned it, but permits starts have been very strong since the summer. You look at in December they were up mid-single digit. The last three months it's up double digits on starts. Single family has been a bit stronger obviously then multifamily. You look at some of the other indicators. The 30-year fixed mortgage, still very supportive around 2.7 or so in December. US consumer confidence, a little bit shaky at this point, and unemployment still about 6, but we think everything that we're seeing, hearing from our customers on the new res side is very solid. And we've got the long-term view which we've articulated in the past about household formations continuing to be strong. If you look at Resi Repaint, existing home sales increased for the sixth consecutive month in December. They were up 23% year-over-year. Month supply is still pretty low. Median home prices are continuing to rise, so people have equity in their homes and feel good about repainting. You look at LIRA, the leading indicator of remodeling activity, is modestly more positive next year, and The National Association of Homebuilder Remodeling Index is also near record levels. So feel very good on that. Maybe commercial, just to wrap up real quickly, I think commercial as John characterized it, that the recovery is a little bit choppy there. I'd go back to what we said at our Analyst Day in the fall. Strong starts at the end of 2019 and early 2020 before the pandemic hit, many of those starts are now as we get into 2020 going to start, we think and get to the painting phase. So we should see some improvement there. I think what's still less clear is the pace of new starts heading into later this year. I think there'll be a recovery, but we'll have to see how strong that is. Al Mistysyn : Hey, Ghansham, this is Al Mistysyn, only one other comment to add, because of the way 2020 unfolded with a weaker first half and a stronger second half, it's important that we get off to a good start. And as we've talked about in the past with our Paint Stores Group North America having a strong second half of 2020, up mid-single digits, and then especially with the fourth quarter being up high-single digits, that typically translates to growth in our first half and gives us confidence about the Paint Store and Architectural volume to start the year into our first half. We saw a similar result with a strong second half of 2019, which was up high-single digit, and leading to a strong first quarter of 2020, which was up high-single digits. So that's what gives us the confidence on Architectural going into the first half of the year. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, that's very thorough. Thank you so much. And then just real quick for my second question on the inflation side, I mean you're very specific in terms of raw materials, in terms of how that's going to sequence in 2021. You called out pricing in TAG. How should we think about performance pricing, like what have you announced so far? Three years ago we had an inflation cycle. The industry was distracted, including you guys closing up Valspar. How are you going to approach inflation differently in this particular inflation cycle? Thanks so much. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Ghansham. I think we're in a completely different spot than where we were when we closed Valspar in 2017. As you recall, there was not a lot of price out in the market relative to industrial as raw materials were increasing in '17. And then we collectively as an industry chased it for the following two years. I think we are ahead of it in the sense that we are out with price across different of our divisions. We have more price to go as Jim or as, John talked about. It's heavier on the petrochem side. And we are absolutely out in the market with price a little bit higher than what I would say you would see on our TAG Architectural business because of the higher increase we see on petrochem; so I think you're going to see a different environment. Plus, the other thing I would add is with our confidence in the growing volume, we expect volume to be stronger in this year relative to what it was back in 2017. And I think as we've talked about, that really is what the main driver of our margins are, and we'd expect a strong first half with volume in our Performance Coatings Group that will help offset some of the raw material impacts as well. Ghansham Panjabi : Perfect. Thanks so much. John Morikis : Thank you, Ghansham. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Hi, good morning. Your administrative costs in the quarter were up, I don't know $65 million. Maybe they were up $55 million for the year. Did something unusual happen in the fourth quarter? And what's your outlook for administrative costs in 2021? John Morikis : Yes, Jeff, if you look at the year-over-year in the fourth quarter, most of that increase was due to Brazilian tax credits and occurred in the fourth quarter. Aside from that, the remaining increases were due to higher comp and incentives, including stock-based compensation. We had a higher environmental expense in the quarter, and then we took the opportunity in the fourth quarter as we saw a stronger sales than what we had guided to - our guidance as you recalls was to be up three to seven. We ended up above the high end of that range at little bit over 9%. Some of the spending we delayed in IT infrastructure, and some of the digital initiatives across the enterprise we put some money back in there that drove that increase up a little bit. That was partially offset by a decrease in integration costs. If you look at our outlook for 2021, my expectation is interest expense will be pretty flat year-over-year. And then I would expect to be flat to down slightly on admin for the rest of the year. Jeff Zekauskas : And then - thank you for that. And then from a strategic point of view, I don't think you bid on Tikkurila. Can you talk about why you didn't or why that would have been a good fit or a bad fit? Can you - can you reflect on that asset as relates to Sherwin-Williams? John Morikis : Jeff, I don't know that I want to talk about any one particular asset. I might give you our thinking overall and let you drive your own thinking to that. Our pipeline as we see it is robust, and we continue to evaluate what we believe are strategic fits for our company. And to us, we look at very unique and differentiated solutions and solutions that allow us to drive our customer success. And I just want to take a moment on this because I think it's important, our view is that when our customers are successful, we're successful. And when we're driving value for them, it allows us to create value for our shareholders. So we're focused on targets that drive those unique solutions. Our strategy is not going to be defined by what comes up for sale. And we're not trying to be everything to everyone nor trying to be everyone - or everywhere for everyone. We look proactively for targets that are kind of fits for our strategy, that fit us in geographic areas that we feel that are a gap, that provide a technology that we can leverage or adds to our distribution that fits our strategy. We believe we're uniquely positioned not to require acquisitions to grow. Our focus is on right now a prioritization of opportunities that we have and turning them into shareholder value. You're likely, Jeff, going to see us more doing bolt-ons more likely in the industrial space with targets to support what we call our right-to-win, not just commodities or not just a book of business. We're really focused in on those high-value areas that allow us to differentiate. So, a great example would be - and there's a lot of talk now about infrastructure, and not to say that we're only focused on Protective and Marine, but I think it gives a good example. If I take Bridge and Highway, as an example, you're likely going to see us on the Bridge side or as we say the HVI, the high value infrastructure, not just chasing commodities. So our view is that those acquisitions that fit our ability to differentiate with unique solutions allow us to create value, not just trying to be everything to everyone everywhere. Al Mistysyn : Jeff, the only thing I would add to that is we don't have a gun to our head. We've talked about this in the past, we believe we can grow organically. And if you look at the last two years, '19 and '20, we grew sales a modest 2.3% CAGAR. That's over $800 million incremental dollars. And with that though, we grew adjusted PBT just under $640 million of flow through of 77%. I think that talks to the strength of the model and the strategy that we put in place, and then when you look at our 2021 sales guidance to be up mid-to-high-single digits, we expect to accelerate that growth in 2021. Jeff Zekauskas : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : The next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm just trying to contextualize the performance - the impressive performance in the fourth quarter and TAG north of 9% versus I think a 4.5% comp in the prior period. And I'm assuming, particularly in Residential Repaint, that your customers don't have complete access to their customers for COVID reason. So I'm just wondering if you can help us understand or if you know from your customers sort of what percentage of their book of business or their perspective book of business, they actually have complete access to sort of exiting the fourth quarter versus maybe where they were entering or in the third quarter, just so that we can get a sense of how the opportunities that's going to progress as we move through 2021. John Morikis : I think you should plan on the opportunities to be very solid. I don't have a number. I think it varies by customer and probably by geography, but as you would expect with over 3,000 sales reps and nearly 5,000 store managers out there every day working this customer, we have a very good feeling about what they're doing and through our CRM, we've got an understanding of the activity there, and I would tell you it's terrific. In a number of ways I would say the confidence that we have presents itself. The drive that we have in new account activity for further growth - there's an interesting fact. In 2020, we actually opened more new accounts, many of them in Residential Repaint in 2020 than we did in 2019. And so the visual I'd like for you to understand is that we've got this terrific customer base that's growing in their loyalty to us through the introduction of new products and innovative solutions, the digital platform. We've got a new living well introduction of products for our customers. I'd be happy to share with you in a moment here. We've got terrific service, the role that our reps play in helping these customers to be successful. So we've got homeowners who've been home that are anxious to have their homes painted after spending maybe a little more time in there than they appreciated earlier, a desire to maintain those, painting contractors whose loyalty to our company is growing, and a strong desire for us to not only take care of those that are doing business with us now, but to grow that. And I think we're hitting on a lot of those cylinders. So as I mentioned, six years of double-digit growth, and we expect that momentum to continue. Vincent Andrews : If I could just ask on the raws and price, the February one start date versus I think last year was a June one start date, I mean what - what were you waiting for to make the price increase announcement and how - what caused the percentage increase that you chose? There are a lot of folks that are worried about further inflation in the back half and the crude oil chain further into petrochemicals or in TiO2. So are you confident that you took enough or should we think that maybe possibly you'll need to take more during the year if necessary? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Vincent. I would say the timing was really a function of the rapid increase we saw as the fourth quarter - in raw materials as the fourth quarter progressed. So we hadn't planned on going even that early because of where we thought the raw material environment was. As you know, we look at this every month, try to project what we think the basket is going to move, both with Architectural and Industrial, and when we saw the rapid increase with propylene, we adjusted the schedule and went out with a price that we think was right on Architectural. On industrial, because we had some businesses that we're still working through that process, I think it allows us to adjust what the price increases is going to be versus what we thought it was going to be. So we'll probably have to --- we're going to go out with a higher increase than what we had in Architectural. And here's the - as you know, as the year goes on, if we see raw material costs increasing more than what we have planned or what we have in our guidance, you know us, we have discipline. And we'll go out with another price increase. You saw that '10, '11 and '12 when we had to go out with five price increases in the 18-month period. That discipline is still there, and if we're not covering our costs, we'll have to go out again. But right now we feel comfortable with the price increases that are going into the market. Vincent Andrews : Thanks for the detail and looking forward to a great 2021. John Morikis : Thank you, Vincent. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I had two questions. One was you mentioned digital investment with the home centers. Could you get a little more specific in terms of what that is and how we should think of that strategically? John Morikis : Yes, I think there is a digital investment and a home center digital investment. So I want to make sure that you're clear with our comments there, Greg. We are very excited about our relationship. We share our definition of success with our Consumer Brands customers that has us leaning forward and anxious on growing - this growing opportunity. We're interested in retention of the customers that our customers are experiencing. And we're working with them in ways to help them do that. Rather that the specifics of those details come from those customers, and the timing will be explained by those customers. Internally, ours, we're very excited about that as well. I'd splinter that out into both the do-it-yourself, again lesser part of our business. We're spending a little bit of time on to serve those customers, quite a bit of investment and attention going towards our professional digital platform, Greg. In fact, we're going to be introducing in this first quarter a new initiative called Pro's Plus which is one suite of tools that are designed to make our customers more successful. And it's unique, and we think unique in a way that only Sherwin can bring it to the market in that it brings all elements to our customers, the in-store, the online, the rep, all of these in a way that we think will help our customers be more successful in their endeavors. So as I mentioned, we're rolling that out in the first quarter, and we're very excited about the impact that will have as well. But digital across the board, internally and externally, is something that we're focused on. Greg Melich : That's great. And the follow-up for Al is on leverage. The 2.4 times now with the amount of cash you generated last year. Where are you comfortable with that? Does that need to get down to two or are we at a point now that free cash flow should really just be generally buying back stock or investment M&A, whatever? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Greg, as I've talked, the target leverage that we are looking at was 2 to 2.5. I'm very comfortable at 2.4, and I think you're absolutely right. We're not going to pay down debt in 2021, and we'll use the free cash flow for M&A. And absent M&A, we're going to buy our stock back. Greg Melich : That's great. Good luck, guys. John Morikis : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hey guys, nice end of the year there. So sort of taking a look at the sales growth that you guys put up in '19 and 2020, yet the '21 outlook is stronger. Yet the midpoint of your guidance for EPS is a little bit less, so just curious what - given that your sales growth is pretty good, but what's sort of holding back some of the EPS growth leverage relative to the last couple of years? Al Mistysyn : Mike, we did have a little bit of a tailwind in 2020 relative to raw materials. As we've talked about with raw materials going up low to mid - mid-to-high-single digits and the pricing that we have to put it to get on top of that, unfortunately that doesn't go to our bottom line as much. But I think we're excited about the 9% on top of a 16.4% increase to your point and expect segment operating margin improvement across all segments. We do expect to see modest gross margin expansion as we have the volume growth. We have the price increases to offset inflation, but then we also have this continuous improvement culture that we've talked about in the past. And I think the teams have done a really good job and have done a lot of hard work on different levers to keep driving our operating margin in particular, not just our gross margin. And you see that, I would say in our international businesses, even flat sales in our consumer businesses. And you see significant growth in our operating profit. You see that in our Performance Coatings Group with a 4% increase in our second half, and you see nice 40%-plus flow through on that. So I think depending on how the volumes flow through our second half, depending on how raw materials are in the high end and low end of that range will tell you if we in the midpoint, high end of our guidance. So, I think we're feeling really good about a 9% increase and including with a mid-to-high-single digit growth. John Morikis : Yes, with some very good investments for our future as well. Al Mistysyn : That's right. John Morikis : We're feeling good about it. Mike Sison : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on TAG, and I apologize if I missed this. Are you planning any new stores this year, and are there any particular areas in the country that you're going to focus on? And then just sort of a comment, I hope you have a lot of orange and brown paint readily available given the Browns are finally on its way. John Morikis : Well, we love that you just made that comment, well most of us. Our Pittsburgh fan here, Al Mistysyn, is a Steeler fan, but the rest of us are right there with you. Yes, we do plan on continuing to invest in our stores. We just mentioned investments, and stores and reps are an important part of that. And we're going to be back into that range likely in the 80 to 100 as we go into 2021. And a lot of that I'll have to do with how this pandemic flows, but it's an important investment that we continue to expect to put fuel in that tank for sure. Mike Sison : Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty : Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess two things, one on the - if we assume that the DIY markets really didn't eat much into the do-it-for-me side, I guess, how much - is there a way to think about how much pent-up demand there is just given the COVID situation in 2020? And is this, in your opinion, do we have a multi-year catch-up or is this - can a lot of it be really made up in 2021? John Morikis : I think it's likely a longer build up than most would realize. I mean when you think, to your point, the do-it-for-me I think is a growing population. There was a DIY surge, about 60% of the people saying that they undertook some home improvement projects. We believe that the fact that there's such a backlog right now given the surge that we've already seen in DIY. When you talk to our painting contractors, we believe that there is still quite a bit of pent-up demand, and there is underlying long-term demand drivers we think that support that, the aging population, the home price appreciation, aging housing stock, the stock market appreciation, dual-income families. All of those we think continue to feed the do-it-for-me. And we're working really hard to be the one that those contractors turn to. John McNulty : Got it. That's - that's helpful. And then maybe just kind of tied to that, you indicated equipment sales were up double digits. Is there - do you have line of sight as to who the buyers are? Is it tied more to the do-it-for-me side of the market? Is it tied more to the new residential kind of market? I guess is there a way to think about that in terms of who the buyers are and maybe where that kind of accelerated growth may be coming from? John Morikis : Yes, I'd say that it seems to be strong across most segments, and the technology there is moving and our relationship with those customers. We want to be that go-to-shop for the residential repaint contractor that may be looking at the fact that they are a little shorter on labor than they would appreciate, and they see the opportunity to go faster and pick-up projects. So we want to be the go-to-supplier that can help educate them on how spray equipment could help their productivity and quality, so that along with - and we are seeing this as well a positive mix shift in quality. So we see a movement up in our quality for the same reasons. These painting contractors in many cases are finding labor painters that might be less experienced, and so spray equipment opportunities are one area to help their productivity as is the increase in quality to help minimize any call-backs or disruptions to the employer - to the homeowner while improving their productivity. Al Mistysyn : And John, as you know, I mean strong spray equipment sales is a leading indicator, and we've talked about this in the past particularly on the contractor base. That is a positive sign as we go into the first half of 2021. John McNulty : For sure. Thanks very much for the color. John Morikis : Thank you, John. Operator : Next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the great performance in 2020. I guess maybe I'll ask the question on Consumer and Performance. Could you just walk us through how you see both of those segments kind of evolving through '21? Obviously, you got the tough comps in Consumer in '21. I think on your last call you may have indicated that maybe in those periods you showed negative growth in Consumer. Are you still thinking that way? And then similarly in performance, just given the weak Q2, do you think that the year would actually result in that segment being above your overall sales guidance? Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Arun, let me start with the consumer. And we've guided for the full year to be up or down low-single digits, and our expectation with DIY is that we'll see that strength certainly through the first quarter and most likely into the second quarter. And it just depends on whether that continues into our third quarter or not. And so, yes, we do have two - the middle quarters up over 20% in Consumer. But I think the team has done a lot of good work on helping our customers retain and/or gain a bigger share of the DIY sales. I think we'll see how results and the market share comes out, but we believe our customers are gaining share relative to their peers, in particular our largest customer in the home center channel. I think you're going to see the investments we made through the second half of 2020 across different programs, including the Pro, start paying dividends into 2021. Granted, it's a small base, but our expectations are high in that segment, the Pro segment, and I think we're doing a lot of the right things with driving that, and we'll see how that plays out as the year unfolds. When you look at Performance Coatings Group, a strong second half similar to what I talked about with our paints - North America Paint Stores, a strong - stronger second half, in particular a strong fourth quarter translates into strong performance in our first quarter. And as you mentioned going up against a soft second quarter, we're expecting that team to grow for the year mid-single digits. Could it be above our overall growth? Sure. It depends on what happens with infrastructure, what happens with the continued momentum we're seeing outside the US. And then really, we have a great opportunity and confidence in North America coming back. John talked about basically up low-single digits. That's about 50% of our Performance Coatings sales, and it's really encouraging to see General Industrial start picking up, which is our largest segment. Industrial Wood was up double digits, which is our second largest segment. So we feel like a lot of momentum and could it be higher than the overall company? Sure. But certainly strong first half. John Morikis : You know, Arun, I'd just add this result in the PCG business, Performance Coatings business, you got to give great credit to our team, our leadership there. When things were pretty dismal and things were looking pretty challenging, this team kept their chin up and leaning forward. I'm really proud of what they accomplished. I think everything - I agree with everything Al said. I'd also add that we're leaning forward with market share gains here as well, so we're not just simply we're not relying on the market to get better. There's been a lot of terrific work that's taken - been taken place in some of the most challenging times that many of us have been through. And they really positioned our Company well. I want to thank our leadership throughout PCG here. They've done a wonderful job, and we have high expectations of them going forward as a result of the great work they're doing. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks. And I guess just as a quick follow-up on the capital allocation side, the M&A activity in this sector seems to have picked up quite appreciably. Are you seeing interesting opportunities out there or devaluations look a little too stretched for you? And if you are seeing opportunities, are they in anything in the digital or EV space or electrification space that you'd want to pursue? Maybe you can just comment on the M&A environment. John Morikis : I'd say our - I mentioned earlier, I think our pipeline is very robust. We have a number of projects that we're working on, some of which we expect to complete this year. I want to reiterate and reemphasize on both sides here, one that we don't feel as though we have a gun on our head with an absolute need for acquisitions in order to grow. I think we've proven that, and we're excited about what we see in front of us in the windshield that gives us great confidence with or without them. Now that said, on the other side, I want to be very clear, we are excited about some of these projects. We are very deliberate in what it is that we're doing. We're confident that that many of these would be a terrific fit, and we're working towards them. So we feel really good about what we have and what's out there. Al Mistysyn : And Arun, as we just talked about, our leverage ratio is within the target we want it. We have a strong balance sheet, we generate a ton of cash. And we're not worried about valuations. The valuations, as John talked about, we'll take a disciplined approach to it where we can get a return for our shareholders. And I think that's key, and I think we can get to the valuation that makes that happen. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. John Morikis : Thank you, Arun. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. Just thinking about the various end markets you have in TAG. Is it reasonable to assume that the paint you sell for new - for commercial projects versus what goes into a contractors resi repaint, is a shift towards a much higher-quality paint potentially with a higher-unit price and higher margin, is that - is that mix shift towards the resi repaint, has that been a meaningful benefit to you and do you record that in the 2% price comment that you made, John, out of the 9% same-store sales or is that mix shift benefit in price not included in that 2%? John Morikis : So Steve, I might suggest that you look at it in a slightly different way. Let me - let me introduce this thinking, that the positive mix shift that we're experiencing is actually in nearly every segment in TAG. So within commercial, if I could just isolate on commercial for one second, if you could imagine a project that was bid where COVID wasn't in the mind of the project estimator and they put this together, and all of a sudden now there is starts and stops and restrictions on how many people can be on a project and all the challenges that we all know. Now, you start to realize when the cost of labor is only 80% to 90% of the project, that incremental investment in a higher-quality product will actually increase their cost of goods from a paint perspective. But overall when you think about labor and the choppiness they're experiencing, it will actually make them more efficient, more profitable on that project. And so across all segments now, going beyond just the Commercial, what we are experiencing is exactly what you said, a positive mix shift in Residential Repaint. We might have painters with a little less experience, and so they don't want to be disruptive to the homeowner and have touch-up issues. They want to maybe get away with one less coat so they can get out of the home quicker, all these - durability. All of these different areas are important aspects of product mix shift in a positive direction, same with Commercial. New Residential, you look at the number of painters on a new home and the delay getting pushed out. So they want people to be able to come in, paint the home, get off with little call back or touch up. So we are experiencing this positive shift throughout our architectural business. Steve Byrne : That's helpful. Thank you. And just wanted to ask you about that Huawei brand that you acquired with Valspar. I recall in years past there was this thinking that you can reinvigorate that paint in China, whether it's to modify that store model or change the way it's promoted or the outreach to contractors, whatever. What's your view and outlook on that brand in China? Is that still best owner for you guys or where do you think the outlook is for that brand? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Steve, I think you have to look at it in maybe two different ways, one on the Performance Coatings side and then one on the Architectural side. And I'll just comment, the small impairment we took was more on the Performance Coatings side as we continue to drive our customers and our products to Sherwin-Williams brand and Valspar. On the architectural side, I think it's part of our strategy, and I'll let John tell you about it. John Morikis : Steve, one thing I think we've proved in a year with the pandemic is not a year you should try to reposition our Architectural brand in China. So I think as we move forward, there's a lot of work that we're working on. I do think there are a number of opportunities there. It is a relatively fragmented market. And there are terrific opportunities, and you should expect that we're continuing our work in establishing the most solid brand strategy moving forward - in 2020. We have high expectations for the team, but I would tell you that in 2020, we had to be somewhat understanding in that the consumer marketplace in China, with everything going on with the pandemic, was not a year we were going to gain a lot of ground in this area; so we're ramping that back up. We'll be doing a lot of testing. I wouldn't think that in 2021 we're going to move the needle by our Architectural sales in China, but we certainly believe it's a seed that needs to be planted for our future. Steve Byrne : Very good. Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. David Begleiter : Thank you, John. On the large dividend increase, are you trying to target a certain yield, and if so, what is that yield? Al Mistysyn : Yes, David, you know, the 23.5% increase in the dividend to $6.62 represents 30% of our prior year EPS as reported. This has been a consistent policy of ours, and we've historically targeted that. I know you know we've gotten away from that briefly when we conserved cash through the integration of Valspar. But over the last couple of years last - this 2020, up 18.6, 2019 we're up over 31%, so we're back on that 30% of prior year EPS. David Begleiter : Got it. And, Al, just on the quarterly earnings progression, should it be typical this year in terms of percent of earnings in Q1 and Q2, etc., or should it be maybe a little bit different given the dynamics of the marketplace? Al Mistysyn : Yes, David, as I talked about with the stronger sales in the first half that I'd expect to see with our Performance Coatings Group and our TAG, in particular in North American Architectural, because of the somewhat easier comps that we have in the second quarter, you would expect to see a stronger first half on sales and EPS growth than you would see in our second half. But in the second half, we still expect positive sales and EPS, it's just not going to be a strong as our first half. David Begleiter : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, David. Operator : The next question is from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. PJ Juvekar : Yes, hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Hey, John, you mentioned that you've been growing double-digit for last six years, clearly you gained share either in Residential Repaint or New Housing Construction or both. Who do you think is losing share? Is it independent dealer channel that has lost share or could it be some of your larger competitors? Can you just talk about where you - who you were taking the share from? John Morikis : Yes, PJ, we don't discriminate when it comes to share gains. So we're working every market. That's what beautiful about our industry. Every market is its own independent market, and you have to win. And I would say this, that with our view, many people look at our stores because of the storefront and think we're mainly a retail store. That's not the case. We are not the company that unlocks our door and hopes that things - good things happen. Give the TAG leadership, Pete Ippolito and his entire leadership team great credit for the aggressive view that they take. We're not waiting for things to happen. And so in each market, to answer your question, there is a - there is a plan. The plan includes who are those customers that we might know and we might be doing business with that we could expand our share of wallet with. And there are some that, for whatever reason, we've not earned their trust or their business, and it's up to that local team to get to know those customers and build that relationship. So it's not one contributor. It's - I wish it were that easy. It's challenging, but we get out there every day, and this team has a wonderful mentality. This team thinks about you eat what you kill. So you need to get out there every day and hunt and provide for your family. I love the mentality they have. PJ Juvekar : Great. And quickly, I'll be brief here, but good to see industrial economy broadening out or Industrial Coatings, were you surprised to see Heavy Duty Equipment come back so quickly in the recovery? Thank you. John Morikis : I was pleased to see it come back. I don't know that I would say surprised. We have a terrific leadership team in this business that is doing a wonderful job. To your point, there's been seven quarters of tough sledding, but we have really good momentum right now in three of the four regions posting double-digit gains. North America, while just slightly lagging, is trending very well. The back half of the quarter here in North America was strong, and we believe that Heavy Equipment, as well as many of these other segments that we're focused on, are really somewhat - some of them are recovering. Some of them as they recover might be rebuilding inventory. So, we're taking that into account as well. But this is a team that's aggressively out there. As I mentioned just now with TAG as far as market share gains, this team Karl Jorgenrud and his team are really working hard to gain ground, and we've got a lot of respect for them and the job they're doing. PJ Juvekar : Great. Well, your aggressiveness is showing in the results. So, thank you. John Morikis : Wonderful team we have here. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. John Morikis : Might be on mute, Chris. We're not hearing you. Operator : Yes. He may be on mute at the moment. Let me check that out, gentlemen. Actually looks like we'll move on to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Tom Glinski : This is Tom Glinski on for Bob. So I was just wondering if you could give some color on the divergent trends between Australia and China in the Architectural markets. John Morikis : Yes, I'd say for us both are relatively small in what's happening for our business. Australia for us delivered flat growth for the year, significantly improved our profitability there. We've increased our efforts to develop the right platform for distribution there. And we're optimizing that platform; we've taken - I think, some really good steps in cost reduction and actions to improve the margins in Australia. And from a market standpoint, I think we're holding our own in China. As I just mentioned, I think there is the region for us in Architectural had a decline, but we believe going forward here, we have a lot of ground to be gained and a relatively small position to build on. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Tom, I would say it was a tale of two halves as well. As you know, the first half really got hit hard with COVID in China or in Asia in particular. So on a flat full year for Australia - Australia and Asia, you look at our second half both up double digits. So I think the focus of the teams and the opportunities that we have really showed in the second half, and we expect that to continue in the first half of 2021. Tom Glinski : That's helpful and then just on the Performance Coatings side, you've discussed in the past potentially getting to operating margins around the 20% level. It sounds like pricing next year is going to be in the 3% range. Could you just talk about the outlook for margins in that business in 2021? John Morikis : First - I'm going to give it to Al, but I'm going to tell you that the resolve and conviction we have on getting there has never been stronger. We got a lot of confidence in what we're doing and the teams that are delivering it. So we know we're going to get there. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Tom, I think we've made good progress in 2021. If you look at our second half operating margin, it was up 100 basis points to 15.2%. Flow through was strong. And I mentioned this earlier, over 40% on sales that were up 4%. And if you look at the volume strength, we expect in 2021 in that business, we talked about a mid-single-digit growth rate. You have price in there. The rest is going to be volume - as well as all of the hard work the team has done over the past few years right-sizing their footprint outside the US, reducing complexity by driving reduced SKUs, SKU levels, consolidating platforms to try to get scale on certain raw materials, and so a lot of hard work to drive their operating margins. We expect operating margin expansion in 2021 on that mid-single-digit growth rate even with the raw material increases that we're talking about. And on top of that, we haven't talked about it much this year, but we still have facility projects in the pipeline to rationalize in 2021. Unfortunately, or just the reality of it, we pushed those back. And so we're probably about six months delayed on those, but they're still on the table. We're committed to completing those to help continue to drive our cost down, and you'll see us as volume continues to go, and we'll make more progress on that operating margin here in the next couple of years. Tom Glinski : That's great, thanks guys. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thank you. I'm in the office, and apparently, I forgot how to use a headset. So just very quickly on the packaging front within PC you're beginning to see some long-term secular tailwinds emerge in beverage in particular, with many of your key customers expanding capacity in various geographies. There is this idea that this growth could accelerate to the mid-single digits in terms of volumes. Do you believe that's realistic, and also just on a global basis, how do you overall characterize your current competitive positioning? Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Chris. And I would say that we enjoy a good position, but we know that there are terrific opportunities out there from a market opportunity perspective. We do feel along with our customers that this is in fact a business that we want to invest in. Both our customers and Sherwin are continuing to invest both in technology and capacity. We are thrilled with this unique technology we have, our V70. It's the only epoxy non-BPA on the market. Others are acrylic or polyester, and this V70 is a game changer. It's more versatile. it doesn't require lines to be shut down for changeovers. The constant consistent mill thickness just gives more productivity to our customers. And so you're right, we're having discussions with them as they're asking us to be in different parts of the world to serve them. It's a unique solution for our customers. And when we talk about our ability to add value to our customers, this is exactly it. We've got 29 patents protecting this technology. It's unique, and it helps our customers in what they're trying to do. It's exactly where we want to be, help them to be successful. Christopher Parkinson : That's very helpful. And just returning to a previous question on new store openings, just as we get back into a more normalized environment, you've always been the first to stress that there still opportunities in some of your core markets in the Southeast, Midwest, etc., but just given the projected longevity of the health of US housing, what you're obviously hearing from your customers, is it perhaps still time to really focus in on some of the underpenetrated markets given the long tail? Any color would be appreciated. Thank you very much. John Morikis : The answer is yes, Chris. We absolutely - we love those opportunities, and you're exactly right. We're investing in the Southeast and Southwest areas where there is growth, and equally important to us is greater market share penetration in other parts of the country. And so we're not limiting ourselves on where we're going to grow. We are - we're married to success here. And so we're going to look for the right opportunities, and we're going to drill in and find them. And I've got confidence in that in our TAG leadership team to be able to do exactly that. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good afternoon. Just one question with three parts I guess on the subject of share repurchases. As I look at some of the information from your press release, it looks like you repurchased quite a bit in the fourth quarter. And so I was wondering if you could comment on the dollar amount that you bought back in the quarter? Secondly, what the diluted share count would have been exiting the quarter. And then third, John, you talked a little bit about a robust M&A pipeline and desire to make bolt-ons there. I know it's early in the year, but sitting here today, I'd be curious to hear your view on potential balance between repurchases and M&A for 2021 if you have a strong feeling about that. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin. Yes, we purchased 1.6 million shares in the fourth quarter for $1.15 billion, and as I talked about coming out of the third quarter, we had a little over $600 million of cash on our balance sheet. I talked about expecting to have a strong cash generation in our fourth quarter and putting that cash to work in M&A, and absent M&A, buying our stock back. So you can - you can extend that to the full year. We had such a strong cash generation, over $3.4 billion. We returned $2.9 billion to the shareholders as John talked about in his opening comments, a 145% increase. And that just goes to our disciplined approach to our capital allocation policy. We're not going to hold cash. We're going to invest in our business and Capex and our core below 2%, with our building and facility projects, that will be over 2% for a few years here. We're going to keep driving that dividend based on earnings growth and put 30% of prior year EPS. And then absent M&A, we're going to buy our stock back, and you saw that impact in our fourth quarter. That 1.6 million shares, Kevin, really because of the way the calc works, it might have impacted the fourth quarter a few hundred thousand shares for the year. It's probably not - not quite that much, just because of the math. But I'll let John go on the M&A. John Morikis : Yes, there's not much more to add. I think the point that Al made is an important one. Absent M&A, that we will be back in and buying stock. We don't - we feel we've got plenty of dry powder here, and we're excited about some of the targets that we're working on now, and we're continuing to fill that pipeline. But again, I want to be clear, while we're excited about it, we don't feel as though we have a gun pointed to our head. So we're not going to be out there just going to buy a book of business so that we can say that we're growing sales. There are going to be strategic fits and add value or we're really not interested. Kevin McCarthy : Perfect. Thank you, both. John Morikis : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zener : Good afternoon, John. Al, thanks for your time. Two questions, first the Industrial Wood, that's up nicely. Can you talk to the stability of the Asia business, which I know was affected by cabinet tariffs in the US versus perhaps the US shipments? And then the second question just so you have it. Your consumer margin framework, obviously this year at least you're discounting tough DIY comps, but you're also picking up a lot of volume in TAG, which is helping that business margin - that business's margin. What's your latest thinking on the longer-term margins there? Thank you very much. John Morikis : Okay. I'll take the Industrial Wood, and I'll have Al jump on the Consumer margin. First, you're right. This has been a terrific rebound by a strong team. Colin Davie and his team in Industrial Wood have really been driving hard. We had growth in all regions, with three of four of our regions in double digits. The strength here that we're seeing is driven mainly in areas of kitchen cabinets, also furniture, and so when you talk about the longevity, I would say that gives us great confidence here. The backlog of orders ahead for furniture is very long. I mean some of these are out six months or more, just because of how strong orders are. So, I think our position is terrific. It's a position of strength driven off of not only just wonderful service and availability, but a growing and unique technology portfolio that helps our customers reach their goals of again terrific leadership team doing a really good job here in the face of adversity. I think they are proving our stripes here. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Ken, on the consumer margin, and you called out TAG as well. So I'm going to talk to a combined kind of architectural margin, if you will in - as the Consumer Group, our expectation even on top of a strong 2020 to have margin expansion not quite near what we saw in 2020, but the continued strong DIY that I talked about expectation to go through the first half. We'll see how that goes as it goes into our third quarter, but really you look at the strength in our TAG. And we talked about full year being up mid-to-high-single digits, and I would say typically as we talked about, our Paint Stores Group North America would be at the higher end of that range. We have a higher ongoing margin, if you will, and that will help drive that combined margin higher. And our expectation is, as you know we, when we set a new high watermark, our expectations are that our teams are going to exceed that high watermark. John Morikis : I would just add, I think the volume piece is a terrific opportunity as Al mentioned. I think on both sides we're looking for that. And again, I know I'm calling out a few leaders here, but we have opportunities. When we talk about consumer while the DIY side's starting here very strong, and we feel good about it. We still believe that there are terrific opportunities for growth in our Pro side. We've got Brian Padden leading that organization. Heidi Petz was in there before, now over in our stores. These two leaders have done a terrific job positioning us we believe for continued run there. And we can go on and on about TAG. There is a lot of jet fuel in that tank. I really believe - I've said this before, we feel inside this boardroom, we feel like we're just getting started. There's a lot of opportunities, a lot of levers to pull here and we are going to be pulling them hard Ken Zener : Thank you very much. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Ken. Operator : The next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Edlain Rodriguez : Thank you, and good afternoon, guys. Just one quick one, I mean I know it's getting late, on M&A. You've talked about areas where you might want to add in the portfolio, such as Industrial or other value sectors, but are there parts of the current portfolio that are not the best fit for you, like even if you don't have to name them? Just trying to get a sense of how satisfied you are with the current portfolio. John Morikis : Yes so, just so we make sure I understand, are you suggesting - are you asking what areas are we not interested in? Edlain Rodriguez : No, what areas you might want to divest of the divestments. John Morikis : I'm sorry. You're right, we probably wouldn't talk about any specifics, but I would say that on a regular basis we are constantly evaluating every aspect of our business, everything from program - customer programs to brands to businesses, and we're always looking at how to drive that margin and success forward. And so even down to the stores, if we found stores in some Latin America or some outlying markets. We had some in Canada where we looked at the investments that we had and said, you know what, it's not going to get the return that the hurdle that we have for ourselves. So, I'm not going to call out any specific area, but I will tell you it's a it has to be a constant discussion that we have regularly. I think it's part of the discipline that we have here at Sherwin. Al Mistysyn : Edlain, I would tell you by our businesses, by our regions, we look at growth targets, we look at scale. We look at return on sales. We look at RONA, and we look at cash flow, and we set targets in the mid - medium-to-longer term. And if we don't think we are going to be able to achieve those targets, then we look to do something else with that business, and that's what's driving these decisions. Edlain Rodriguez : Okay, thank you very much. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Garik Shmois : Hi, thanks. Just given the recent surge in orders on the New Resi side and the builders are starting to talk again about labor constraints, just curious if you're starting to see that at all on the contractor side? And are you experiencing any extended lag in starts to when you start to also get payment? John Morikis : When we get payment did you say? Garik Shmois : Yes. John Morikis : So, no, we've not experienced that. As far as the, the project flow, I don't - I wouldn't say that we're experiencing anything that's unique. I mean there have been challenges with labor. I think it's been somewhat consistent. I think there is more interest, if you will, on the part of builders to find quality products that will help accelerate construction towards close. And so, if - if you take a look at products that hide imperfections and touch up well, those are of greater interest, and so we are seeing some positive mix shift in this area. Garik Shmois : Okay. And I guess a follow-up question, just on mix. It doesn't sound like it, but would there be any concern that mix starts to reverse as you start to pursue price increases in TAG to offset inflation? John Morikis : No, actually it actually supports it more. What does come back to the point that I made earlier when you consider that labor represents about 80% to 90% of the cost of goods for most contractors, a higher quality product actually helps their efficiency, so we continue to see a positive mix shift; and we expect that to continue. Garik Shmois : Got it. Thanks, again. Best of luck. John Morikis : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of just Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Justin Speer : Thanks, guys. I wanted to - I don't know if you will, but would it be possible for you to quantify the incremental growth investment in the fourth quarter and in 2020, particularly in Consumer Brands, and perhaps if any of that maybe is going to fall off in 2021? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Justin, I talked about on our third quarter call that you would - that historically, our fourth quarter SG&A tends to be flat with our third quarter, and you delever on a sequential basis. But I did expect to see year-over-year fourth quarter leverage, and we experienced that on a consolidated basis. I also highlighted that the level of investment we would make in the fourth quarter would be dependent on the amount of volume we are experiencing in the quarter. And as I talked about or as you see, our volume was higher in the quarter than our 3% to 7%. So, we took that opportunity to invest in our businesses, driven by Consumer and Performance Coatings, and there are some of those investments that were one-time, others that will be continuing. And the way I'd probably look at it is you're probably going to see - I'd go 50.5 on what may have been one-time versus ongoing. Some are just related quite honestly to the sales increase. But we have added head count in Consumer to go after the Pro and other investments that - in programs that we've made to help continue to retain the DIY sales that we've enjoyed this year. So - and that's - the other part of that is really looking to our first half, and the expectation - with the expectation that we have a strong first half on sales putting those investments in in the fourth quarter and really through the second half of the year are going to pay dividends for us looking out into the second half of 2021. Justin Speer : Excellent. And if you could, I just wanted to revisit Ken Zener's question on the Americas Group. Just wanted to better understand if maybe this is a shift in strategy because - or maybe the game has changed a little bit, but you've had a nice tailwind from commodities and maybe some temporal cost savings that - that's certainly helped swing profit higher this year for 2020, about basis points higher in the Americas Group. And now we're - you're telling us that 22% is the new normalized kind of run rate for TAG. I guess should - is that a difference because I know historically you kind of bumped up in that 20% range. And you used to maybe plow in a growth investment. Has the game or the market changed where this 22% is the right number for us to consider as a baseline? Al Mistysyn : Yes, in TAG I would say we're going to continue to push that operating margin higher regardless of the economic environment. I think the team has done a really good job of pulling the different levers. First, as you know, Justin, is always growth. And when you're looking at TAG for 2021 for the year at mid to high single-digit growth, that allows us even in an inflationary environment to continue to invest back in our business for future growth, as well as growing our operating margin in the current year. So I think you could expect us to continue to drive that operating margin higher. Justin Speer : Excellent, thank you guys. I appreciate you squeaking me in. John Morikis : Thanks, Justin. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. John Roberts : Yes, thanks. What's allowing you to grow in Auto Refinish? From everything we can see collision activity is down? John Morikis : Well, I think if you look at Auto, there's been a lot of really good work. And I would say this, that when we're looking at Auto, one of the things to recognize is this is a terrific example I think of the synergies that are out there as it relates to the acquisition. This Ultra 9K that we brought in brings in a terrific opportunity for us to bring solutions to our customers. I think if you look historically, John, I'd say Sherwin has been really well known for their primers and their clear coats. Ultra 9K brings a different application. It's a wet-on-wet application. It helps the technician get greater throughput, increasing productivity, and it actually helps considerably in their color matching capabilities. So I think the overall application, service and ability to help our customers increase their productivity is really what's driving it. And you're right, I mean we think this is a tough and tight market. Miles driven have been down about 75% of pre-COVID miles, and claims are down. This is a team that's not waiting, and they're out there moving aggressively with new technology. And we've been talking about this for a few quarters that we thought that this was a business that was kind of not getting the credit they deserve. A large part of it was the COVID miles and pressure hid some of that. I think you're starting to see what we've been expecting for some time, and we expect that momentum to continue. John Roberts : Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the floor back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Rob. And once again, just to close, a huge thank you to all of our employees around the world for a great 2020 performance. And I hope it came across in our call that we're excited about 2021 and the momentum we have across our business. One quick housekeeping item; we will be holding our Annual Financial Community Presentation on Tuesday, June 8, it will be a virtual event. Again, that date is Tuesday, June 8, and more details will be forthcoming. As always, I'll be available for your follow-up questions, as well my colleague, Eric Swanson. Look forward to speaking with all of you as we go forward in 2021. Thank you, again, for joining our call today. Have a great afternoon. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

With us on today's call are John Morikis, Chairman, President and CEO; Al Mistysyn, CFO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under the US federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered terrific results in the first quarter. The momentum with which we exited the fourth quarter continued in the first quarter. We entered the quarter with strong expectations and we finished stronger. We capitalized on extremely robust demand across both architectural and industrial markets, leading to sales in two of our segments that exceeded the guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We generated double-digit growth once again in residential repaint as well as in new residential and DIY. We also generated double-digit growth in our industrial business with improvement in every region. Before getting into some of the specific numbers, I'll remind you that in February our Board of Directors approved and declared a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend to make the stock more accessible to employees and a broader base of investors. Trading of our shares on a stock-split-adjusted basis began on April 1, 2021. All share and per-share amounts in today's press release and conference call commentary have been adjusted to reflect the 3-for-1 stock split. Additionally, all comparisons in our prepared commentary this morning are to the first quarter of 2020 unless otherwise specified. So starting with the top-line. First quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 12.3% to $4.66 billion. Consolidated gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 45.4% due to greater-than-anticipated raw material cost inflation. SG&A expense as a percent of sales decreased 300 basis points to 28.5%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $116.7 million or 29.8% to $509 million. The first quarter of 2021 included $75.6 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense and onetime costs of $111.9 million related to the divestiture of the Wattyl Australia business. The first quarter of 2020 included $75.6 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense. Excluding these items, consolidated profit before tax increased 48.8% to $696.5 million with flow-through of 44.9%. Diluted net income per share in the quarter increased to $1.51 per share from $1.15 per share a year ago. The first quarter of 2021, included acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.21 per share and onetime costs related to the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. The first quarter of 2020, included acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.21 per share. Excluding these items, first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 51.5% to $2.06 per share from $1.36 per share. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $848.7 million in the quarter or 18.2% of sales. Net operating cash grew to $195.7 million in the quarter. All three of our operating segments delivered excellent top-line growth, margin expansion and strong flow-through in the quarter. Segment margin in The Americas Group improved 240 basis points to 19.2% of sales, resulting primarily from operating leverage on a high single-digit top-line growth. Flow-through was 46.4%. Adjusted segment margin in Consumer Brands Group improved 440 basis points to 21.4% of sales resulting primarily from operating leverage on the double-digit top-line growth. Flow-through was 38.9%. And adjusted segment margin in Performance Coatings Group improved 60 basis points to 14.3% of sales driven by operating leverage on the double-digit sales growth, which was partially offset by higher raw material costs. Flow-through was 19.1%. Let me now turn the call over to John Morikis for additional commentary on the first quarter along with our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2021. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. We're off to a tremendous start in 2021. Credit goes to all 61,000 members of our team who are serving our customers at a high level, aggressively pursuing and capturing new business and managing through transitory disruptions in the supply chain. There is no better team in the industry. Demand was robust across both architectural and industrial businesses in the quarter, particularly in March where sales were well above our forecast. We're seeing very positive trends as economies continue to reopen. As we've often said, volume is the strongest driver of our results and we leveraged the strong growth to deliver improved profitability in every segment in the quarter. In The Americas Group first quarter sales increased by 8.6% over the same period a year ago, including about 1.7 percentage points of price. The impact of unfavorable currency translation was not material. Same-store sales in the US and Canada were up 8.2% against a high single-digit comparison. In residential repaint, our largest segment, we delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter against a double-digit comparison. We have grown this business by double-digits for five consecutive years. We expect this momentum to continue. Contractors are reporting solid backlogs and interior and exterior were both very strong. Demand remained unprecedented in our DIY business where sales were up by double-digit percentage for the fifth consecutive quarter. New residential also remained an area of strength for us with low double-digit growth in the quarter against a high single-digit comparison. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer and customers are reporting solid order rates. Momentum is gradually building in our commercial business where sales in the quarter were up low single-digits against a solid quarter a year ago. Projects continue to resume at varying paces and comparisons are favorable over the remainder of the year. Property maintenance was down slightly in the quarter, though turnover in multifamily properties is improving. The month of March was positive and we expect to see meaningful improvement as the year progresses. Protective & Marine was down by a mid single-digit percentage in the quarter, but improved sequentially and delivered strong growth in the month of March. Growth in smaller customer segments such as flooring, bridge and highway and pharmaceutical was more than offset by softness in the oil and gas segment. We continue to aggressively pursue opportunities in all these end markets and expect continued improvement as maintenance projects cannot be delayed indefinitely. From a product perspective, sales in both interior and exterior paint were up by double-digit percentages with interior being the larger part of the mix as is normal for our first quarter. Additionally, this is the third consecutive quarter spray equivalent sales increased by double-digits in the quarter. Contractors typically invest in this type of equipment in anticipation of solid demand. Our previously announced 3% to 4% price increase to US and Canadian customers became effective February 1, prior to the supply chain disruption the industry began experiencing later in the quarter. We realized approximately 1.7% from price in the first quarter and would expect 2% or better in the following quarters. We will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed. We opened 11 new stores in the quarter in the US and Canada. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services to drive additional growth. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales increased 25% in the quarter, including 2.7 percentage points of positive impact related to currency translation, as DIY demand remained robust. Sales in all regions were above our mid-teens segment growth guidance, led by Asia and followed by Europe, North America and Australia respectively. We exited the Australia business in the segment at the close of the quarter. As you know our global supply chain organization is managed within this segment. I want to thank this team for their incredible performance in navigating the industry-wide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri during the quarter. We are working collaboratively across our businesses to keep our customers in paint and on the job. Last, let me comment on first quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. The momentum we saw in the third and fourth quarters of last year continued and accelerated in our first quarter, group sales increased by double-digit percentage. Currency translation was a tailwind of 2% in the quarter. Price was positive and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in Asia grew fastest in the quarter, followed by Europe, both of which were up by strong double-digit percentages. Latin America grew by a high single-digit percentage. North America, the largest region in the Performance Coatings Group continues to gain momentum, where sales were up by low single-digit percentage. From a divisional perspective, I'll start with the Industrial Wood division which had the highest growth in the group. Sales were up by strong double-digit percentage in the quarter and were positive in every region. Strength in new residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring and furniture applications. In General Industrial, the largest division of the group, sales were up by a high-teens percentage and were positive in every region. Sales were strong within heavy equipment, building products, containers and general finishing. While there's likely an element of inventory restocking by our customers in these numbers, we believe growing end-market demand is the larger driver given recent PMI and industrial production reports. Our Packaging team also continues to deliver great results. Sales were up high single-digits against a nearly double-digit quarter a year ago and were positive in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction. This team has been remarkably consistent and has delivered solid growth in every quarter since Sherwin-Williams acquired the business as part of the Valspar acquisition in 2017. We and our customers continue to invest in this terrific business. Our Coil Coatings business has also been a remarkably consistent performer. Sales grew by high single-digit percentage in the quarter against a double-digit comparison a year ago. This team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions. We're also seeing the gradual resumption of selected commercial construction projects. Last, Automotive Refinish sales were up by mid single-digit percentage in the quarter. This level of growth is very encouraging given that miles driven and collision shop volume remains below pre-pandemic levels, particularly in North America. We're also pleased with new installations of our products and systems in North America which were very strong. This is a good indicator of future momentum in our business. Before moving on to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $930 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $775 million to purchase 3.3 million shares at an average price of $234.96. We distributed $151.8 million in dividends, an increase of 23.5%. We also invested $64.3 million in our business through capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. Turning to our outlook. We continue to see robust demand in North America residential repaint and new residential and continued recovery in commercial and property maintenance. Comparisons in DIY will be challenging over the remainder of the year, though we are excited by opportunities to work with our retail partners to grow sales in the pros who paint segment. We expect industrial demand will continue to improve as the year progresses. We'll continue to leverage our strengths in innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution, as we expect to grow at a rate that outpaces the market. On the cost side of the equation, we now expect raw material inflation for the year to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, a significant increase from the low to mid single-digit range we communicated in January. In an already challenged supply chain due to COVID-19, the February natural disaster in Texas further impacted the complex petrochemical network causing significant disruptions. These production disruptions, coupled with surging architectural and industrial demand have pressured supply and rapidly driven commodity prices upward. Recovery has been significant in recent weeks and is improving, but it's still far from complete.  At this time, we anticipate some moderation of costs in the back half of the year though they will still be elevated year-over-year. As we previously described, there is a lag of about a quarter from the time we see inflation in commodities to the time we see the impact in our results.  Given this timing, we expect to see significant raw material inflation in our second quarter, which will be the highest of the year. The pace at which capacity comes back online and supply becomes more robust remains uncertain. We have been highly proactive in managing the supply chain disruptions to minimize the impact on our customers. We expect to be in a similar mode throughout the summer months as reduced raw material availability resulted in lower-than-anticipated inventory build during our first quarter. Our close working relationships with customers and the strength of our global supply chain give us great confidence in managing through any challenges that may occur. We've also been highly proactive in our pricing actions to offset the raw material inflation we are seeing. We've issued price increases in both the Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings Group, in addition to the previously announced price increase in The Americas Group.  We likely will need to take further pricing actions if raw material costs remain at these elevated levels. While we are fully committed to combating rising raw material costs, we also recognize that the timing of price realization will likely result in some near-term margin pressure. Against this backdrop, we anticipate second quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will increase by a mid- to high teens percentage compared to the second quarter 2020.  We expect The Americas Group to be up by a mid to high teens percentage. We expect Consumer Brands to be down by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage including a negative impact of approximately four percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. And we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a high-20s percentage.  For the full year 2021, we plan to provide you with an update to our sales and EPS guidance at our virtual financial community presentation event scheduled for Tuesday June 8th. We expect to have greater clarity of raw material availability and cost inflation trends at that time as well as further confirmation of the strong demand trends we are currently seeing.  Our current sales and adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged at this time. We expect consolidated net sales to increase by a mid to high single-digit percentage. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a mid to high single-digit percentage; Consumer Brands Group to be up or down by a low single-digit percentage including a negative impact of approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture; and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a mid-single-digit percentage.  We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $7.66 to $7.93 per share compared to $7.36 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.80 per share and a loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2021 earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.07, an increase of 9% at the midpoint over the $8.19 we delivered in 2020.  Let me close with some additional data points that may be helpful for your modeling purposes. We expect to see some contraction in full year gross margin given the lag between price realization and the rapid and greater-than-expected increase in raw material costs. As we capture price and inflation abates, we expect to see gross margin recover and then expand over time just as it has in the previous cycles. We expect to see expansion of full year adjusted pre-tax margin as we leverage strong sales growth while controlling SG&A. We will continue making investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to return to our normal cadence with around 80 new store openings in the US and Canada in 2021.  We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel. These investments are embedded in our full year guidance. We expect foreign currency exchange will not have a material impact on sales for the full year.  We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. We expect full year depreciation to be approximately $280 million and amortization to be approximately $300 million. The CapEx and interest expense guidance we provided last quarter remains unchanged. We have $25 million of long-term debt due in 2021. We expect to increase the dividend by 23.5% for the full year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy.  We're off to a great start in 2021 with our excellent first quarter performance. Our team is operating with momentum and energized by the many opportunities in front of us as the recovery gains strength. We see demand remaining strong over the remainder of the year and nobody is better equipped to provide differentiated customer solutions than Sherwin-Williams.  We're confident in our ability to manage through transitory raw material availability and cost inflation issues and we expect to deliver another year of excellent results. That concludes our prepared remarks.  With that I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey, guys. Good morning. John Morikis : Good Morning. Ghansham Panjabi : I just want to think about 2021 at this point, John from a volume standpoint versus perhaps what your thoughts were coming into the year. Are there any outliers on the positive or negative side relative to your initial view as it relates to the various verticals across your three operating segments? I'm just asking because 1Q sales was above your initial guidance. 2Q is guided above us and The Street as well, but your full year guidance is -- for sales is still pretty much intact and I realize that Wattyl is part of that. But just curious on your thoughts on the various verticals? John Morikis : Yes. Let me take a run at it and I'll have Al jump in because we're getting a little bit into the forecast here, Ghansham. I'd say from a performance standpoint, we feel really good about the momentum that each of our segments are producing. I'd say the return if you will of the GI business and the Industrial Wood business at the pace that it's coming is a -- is pleasing to us. We expected that to occur, and it's coming in at a pretty robust pace. We've long spoken about how we've tried to position the business as both defensive and growth. In those markets impacted by COVID, we are we believe positioned very well to capture that. So to your point GI and Industrial Wood are growing. If you look at the segments in our TAG business, the residential, repaint, new res really doing quite well as well as DIY. I'd say, we are expecting continued traction in our commercial property management businesses. So I'd say, every element of the industrial business outside of the Protective and Marine business, which is showing sequential growth has been really improving well. And quite frankly every element of the architecture will sit on every cylinder. But let me ask Al to jump in regarding the forecast as well. Al Mistysyn : Hey, Ghansham, this is Al. And as I said on our January earnings call, we did have a weaker first half last year and a stronger second half. So it was important that we got off to a strong start in the first half. As you mentioned, we did start off the first quarter strong, and we're ahead of our guidance. Honestly, the second quarter sales guidance was closer to where we expected it to be based on the strong trends, we saw coming out of the fourth quarter into our first quarter those continued strong trends, especially in TAG and PCG. So those momentums carried and we're going against a weaker second quarter last year. But that being said, the first quarter is a small quarter for us. And as we typically do, we wait and get through the second quarter before we give an update on the full year. And as John mentioned in his opening remarks, which generally would be in July. So as John mentioned in his opening remarks, we're prepared to give an update on the full year sales and EPS guidance at our June 8 financial community presentation. So, not too far in the future, but gives us a good outlook and more data points to give you a better view of the year. John Morikis : Yes. It's a little earlier update than we -- as Al mentioned, we normally would do that coming out of the second quarter. So a little bit earlier in June, but it will give us an opportunity given some of the challenges that are in the market right now to give you an update at that time. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. And then just second question, I mean, on the pricing side for TAG. Obviously, you got a price increase through effective February 1. But your raw material guidance is basically more than 2x what it was three months ago for the year. So I guess what would you need to see to sort of adjust pricing in TAG as the year unfolds? And also remind us when was the last time TAG saw multiple price increases in one given -- in any given year? Thanks so much. John Morikis : I'd say, this Ghansham -- I'll take you back. We I believe have demonstrated that conviction and determination to put pricing in. Your point is a good one. As we entered the year, we put some pricing in and then this natural disaster came in in February. What would we see? Well, we continue to focus in on efficiencies through our own facilities, our own approach. Positive mix shift, which we're seeing right now at a pretty aggressive rate with customers moving up in quality helped to offset some of that. But I would say this that we're not taking additional pricing off the table. We'd prefer quite frankly not to go out in the midst of the painting season. We've got painting contractors that are out there quoting projects right now and we'd prefer to work through those prices -- those projects with them on those prices. But I think we've demonstrated in the past a willingness to do that if we need to. I'd say the other piece comes with the loyalty that we build and the way in which we handle these situations. We've often talked about, while we're not hoping for compression in margin as Al just mentioned, we accept a little margin compression. And it's part of the relationship that we've built we think it's unique. When our customers see us out with pricing, they know it's real. When we're out with pricing, we need it. If we find ourselves in this situation unable to offset it in pricing that -- raw material pricing that remains at an elevated level we'll be out with additional pricing. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Ghansham let me just add to that. As John talked about in his opening remarks, our focus is on operating margin expansion. And volume is the number one driver of that and you're seeing that in our first half. And our expectation is that we'll see that momentum going into our second half, but also selling price increases that have been planned. And I've brought in that to not just TAG, but across all the segments. And my expectation is that we will offset full year raw material increases dollar for dollar. We expect to get leverage on SG&A. That will more than offset that gross margin contraction. And that's typical. As you know gross margin -- short-term gross margin contraction is typical in an inflationary environment. We've shown our discipline to get pricing increases. To your question, you go back to 2010, 2011 and 2012 and we were out with six price increases in 22 months. And coming out of that you saw our gross margin not only recover, but expand from almost 600 basis points from 2013 through 2016. So the discipline is there and it's still there. And as John talked about we're providing solutions to our customers that they value. And this is why it's really important that we offset that raw material increases 85% of our cost of goods sold. And to provide those services and solutions at the high level our customers are expecting, we need to offset those raw materials. And as John said if raw materials inflation persists at these high levels, we will need to go out with another price increase later this year. And then we believe we're in that same environment. As raw materials moderate, we'll start to see our margins recover and then grow long-term, as we see our continuous improvement processes take effect and we're able to hold on to a majority of those price increases. John Morikis : Yes. Ghansham, I might add one additional point to that and that is that while we're not cavalier about it, we're very sensitive to pricing and what it means to our customers. It does represent a relatively small percentage of their total cost of goods. Al mentioned that raw materials represent 85% of our COGS. If you look at a painting contractor, it represents about the same percent of their cost of paint on the project. Majority of their costs are -- I'm sorry 85% labor, the remainder cost. So it's a relatively small percentage of their total cost of goods. So we're disciplined in it. We're sensitive to it. But we also know to Al's point, if we're doing our job providing solutions to our customers, helping them make more money, disciplined in our approach to their understanding and when we're out there with the need for it. Ghansham Panjabi : Very clear. Thanks so much. John Morikis : Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thank you. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort : Thank you very much. Good morning. I wanted to ask \u2013 you gave some moderation maybe in the rate of growth in TAG in the second half, and I think you sort of explained why a second ago. But I was wondering, if you could help me think about implications on the DIY component there. I think that's maybe what 15% or 20% of your sales through the stores. What do you see on that comparison as you get into the second half? And would it be any different than what you would report in the consumer group? Thanks. John Morikis : Thanks, Bob. I'd say, as you mentioned DIY was very strong. And as we've previously indicated, we do expect DIY eventually to revert back to a more normal low single-digit rate as stay-at-home orders \u2013 I'm sorry, yeah, stay-at-home orders begin to ease and people begin returning back. So comparisons will be more challenging beginning in the second quarter of this year. Our belief is that as a company, we've really been working hard to position the company strategically to be able to capitalize on whichever way the market tilts. So, if in fact DIY reverts back our position as it relates to the pro segments, our industrial business, we think that we're going to be the winner if you will as it shifts one way or the other. We've worked very hard to position the company to be able to capitalize on the market, whichever way it turns. On the DIY side through our stores then while we might see some of that revert back, the pros will be higher on the CBG side or Consumer Brands Group side. It's a largely driven DIY business, but we are working hard with many of our customers on the pro who paints in there as well as an initiative for the company. You've heard us speak about the commitment that we have there, the investments that we have there, and quite frankly, the determination that we have there. And so whichever way the table tilts Bill \u2013 Bob, we believe we're going to be on top of it. And we quite frankly, don't discriminate to which segment it comes from. We're just very determined to be the one leading in each of those segments. Al Mistysyn : Yeah, Bob. And I would expect, if you looked at those two businesses combined, so as John talked about moderating DIY and stronger in the other segments, we still expect our second half to be up mid- to high single digits in those combined architectural businesses if you will. John Morikis : And I think if you look at the comparison \u2013 maybe Al you can talk about the 2019 versus 2021. I think if you look Bob, not just at the comparison to the most recent year, if you look back to the previous year, we're still growing at a pretty impressive rate. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. I think you'd be looking close to a low double-digit increase over that second half period as well. John Morikis : So we're not giving it back. We're fighting along with our customers to keep it. Bob Koort : And a quick follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared slides growth \u2013 pretty impressive growth in the interior paint segments. Can you give us some characterization of willingness to have the do-it-for-me contractors back in homes? John Morikis : Yeah. Actually, it's a good observation you make because we did see strong double-digit growth, actually both in interior and exterior. But the interior is such a large percentage when that beast moves it's really terrific for us. In the res repaint, it's a second straight 20% quarter growth we've had. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, over five years of consecutive double-digit growth, this is a team that's just really focused in executing on a lot of the terrific efforts to be able to capitalize on that. We've got a new leader there in Heidi Petz, a very aggressive leader. And we're excited to see what she brings to this business as well, because I would tell you these contractors are bullish. They're returning back into this interior work with a greater pace and greater comfort by their customers. The macro data is strong, when you look at existing home sales up 12% year-over-year for March. The LIRA projecting mid-single-digit growth. Even the NAHB Remodel Index, I think it hit a record this period 86 greater than the record previously of 82. So contractors are clearly confident and bullish. We expect this is going to be another record year for us in residential repaint. There's good momentum, and you should expect us to be pushing that pedal all the way to the floor in this segment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. John Morikis : Hey, Steve. Steve Byrne : We're just looking at your \u2013 yes, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. If I look at your full year guide, it kind of implies second half in TAG being kind of mid-single-digit sales growth at best. Is it fair to assume that that's just stale? It would seem that you would \u2013 your pricing actions could approach that if you push more price and that wouldn't leave any room for volume growth. Is this just conservative and thus fairly stale? Al Mistysyn : Yeah, Steve. What I said to Ghansham, we're going to look at updating our full year sales and EPS guidance at the June 8th, FCP conference. So \u2013 and it didn't make sense to me to try to take a look at one segment adjust the sales and not the whole company. So we're going to give you an update for all the segments and the full year at that meeting. John Morikis : Let me be very direct though, Steve. We're feeling very good very strong about our architectural performance and we expect a very strong performance going forward here. Steve Byrne : Okay. And then help me better understand your thinking on taking more price actions. It seems that you're kind of waiting to see whether these raws remain at these levels. I'm not \u2013 I'm a bit surprised you wouldn't take advantage of this, clearly, inflationary situation and push price now given the comments you just made about your pro contractors, the cost of your paint is a relatively small fraction. It is the concern about maintaining that loyalty enough to really absorb this and not push price? Help me understand that, a little better. John Morikis : Yeah. Steve, I want to be clear on that as well. When you talk about absorb, I want you to really picture this, right? We've been out with pricing. We're working through that pricing. The effectiveness of that pricing is important to us right now. When you say absorb, I want to put that in context. We're talking about that we will as we have in the past temporarily accept some minor compression as we work and build through that loyalty and communicate to our customers our intentions and our plans. And so as Al mentioned, we expect to recover dollars this year. My view on this is very simple. I would give up a little press \u2013 I would say accept a little compression in the short term, when I know that in the long term, I'm going to come out of this with the customer and the price. And that's been our model in the past and it's worked very successfully. And it's a cadence that our customers have learned to expect and appreciate from us. And I challenge anyone to give any exception to the idea that not trying to run for a perfect quarter versus the years or decades that we've built this relationship with our customers shouldn't take priority over trying to go out immediately and adjust. We'll get it. We know we will. We'll work with our customers. And by the way we'll come out of it with a more loyal customer as a result of the way we handle it. Al Mistysyn : Yes. And Steve I'd just add to that where we could on the industrial side which really saw a rapid increase in the raw materials over the last 30, 60 days we just delayed the pricing maybe 30 days, so we can go out with a higher increase than we had planned. And so we saw some of our groups or businesses out April 1. But we are out across all businesses and all divisions. And we talked about expecting to see a kind of growth in the selling price realization from around 1.7% in our first quarter a little over 2% in our second quarter. And then we'll evaluate as we normally do month-to-month and take action where we need to. And certainly we would tell our customers first and then communicate to The Street. Steve Byrne : Okay, very good. Thank you for that. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. When I look at your SG&A costs sequentially, maybe they're down I don't know $145 million. And that seems unusual given your historical pattern. And you had very, very nice sales growth. What's keeping the SG&A costs so low? Is there something unusual in the first quarter? Al Mistysyn : Jeff I would say -- and our SG&A was actually consolidated all in up about 1.4%. And the costs are related to new stores reps continued investment in Consumer Brands and the customer programs and additional services and reps in our Performance Coatings Group and then the e-commerce initiative continued investments there. We do have a decrease -- a continued decrease in travel year-over-year. That hasn't -- we haven't really fully turned that back on. But as these economies start reopening we'll see some of that. I would say in the environment we're in we're going to focus on continuing to put investments in. And where we can offset non-value activities and/or some of our back-office functions we'll do the savings there to help offset those investments. But we're going to continue to invest in this environment. And you should expect to see increase in -- modest increase in our SG&A going forward. Jeff Zekauskas : Was there unusual management compensation last year? And if you think about management comp in 2020 related to -- relative to 2021 should it change much? Al Mistysyn : Yes, I think Jeff we set full year targets at the beginning of the year and the comp will be dependent on our achievement of those targets. If you look sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and -- fourth quarter last year to first quarter this year, we would have more comp in our fourth quarter last year. As we typically do we true-up our accrual towards the end of the year. And with the strong fourth quarter we had we did have more comp expense in our fourth quarter including stock comp. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Thank you very much. John Morikis : I might just add just because I think it's an important part of your first question. I understand you were asking kind of the decline or management of the SG&A. But I think it is important going back to the question that Steve asked earlier about pricing, the investments that Al mentioned we'll continue to make because we believe that's an important element in our strategy. So, while we're managing expenses in many areas we're also investing in many critical areas. And that's what in fact allows us to execute on the strategy and which allows us to stand in front of our customers having provided a solution that allows them to make more money and ask for more money when we need to. So, I think your question is a great one. But I want to be clear that while we're managing the expense we're also investing in critical areas as well. Jeff Zekauskas : Thank you so much. John Morikis : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi. Good morning. I had just a clarification question on the Consumer Brands. Sales were up 25% in the quarter, which was a large number. And a year ago sales were down 5%. So, was there something going on with inventories maybe last year as pandemic approach into 1Q that big boxes took inventories down and they're building it now, or is there something else going on like you had exited the Ace business? So, what are the puts and takes in this 25% growth number in Consumer Brands? Al Mistysyn : P.J. that's -- if you go back to the first quarter of 2020 that was certainly -- the Ace impact was part of it. Really we had a difficult because of COVID Asia-Pacific was down really big and impacted our first quarter and even some of the moderation we saw in our other international businesses. We really had a strong first quarter with our international businesses up. When I say strong double digits we're talking 50%-plus. We saw a nice flow-through there. And the sell-through on the DIY side was still strong with our retail partners both here and outside the US. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you for that clarification. And now with your net debt-to-EBITDA close to 2.5 times should we expect Sherwin to get more aggressive in M&A? Especially as the recovery continues, what kind of acquisitions would be at the top of your shopping list? John Morikis : Well, P.J., I'd say you should expect us to see a lot of activity, mainly in the industrial piece. And our pipeline looks very robust. So, we've got a number of projects that we're working we hope to have completed this year. I'd say that it's important to again understand our strategy. As a reminder we're very focused on unique and differentiated solutions and the solutions that can help our customers achieve their success at a greater rate. And when -- thinking about that is pretty simple. We believe that the greater success our customers have the more they view us as a valued partner. So, we're not focusing on trying to be everything to everyone, everywhere. We're not focused on commodities. We're focused on those elements of unique differentiation high value infrastructure is an example, areas that we can help expedite a production line lower, energy costs, improved color loss, whatever it might be as well as technologies that we can buy and broaden through our distribution. So, we are determined to do this. But we also believe, we're unique in this sense as well that we're positioned very well given the Valspar acquisition as well as just the positions that we've had and are growing not to require acquisitions for growth. Our focus right now is on prioritizing our growth opportunities. And so, it's an exciting time here at Sherwin-Williams, where you're looking at where do we invest, where do we go, and not because we don't know where to go. It's just, there's so many opportunities for us to grow. And that's what our PCG team, our Performance Coatings Group leaders, Justin Binn, our new group -- Justin Binns, our new Group President there and our leadership teams there are really focusing in on. So, we're excited about M&A as an important lever. We expect more activity going forward here, but a very disciplined approach, not only in the financial modeling but where we're going to go. We're not, like I say, just trying to buy a book of business. We're looking at good strategic values, and not what's necessarily available driving our strategy. It's what we see going on and pursuing it and making it happen. P.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, P.J. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. The first one would just be on the Consumer Brands Group. Can you speak to where you see the industry in terms of inventory? And is there any necessary catch-up just given the strength that you've been seeing in the markets, but also some of the supply chain disruptions? And maybe how that may flow through as we're looking through the rest of the say the next couple of quarters? John Morikis : Well, I'd say that there are some challenges, as you mentioned. I think there's a pretty good inventory level in the channel for the most part. But, I'd also say that this natural disaster is just that, it was a disaster. And I also believe that this is a way in which you respond to demonstrate your DNA to your customers. And in our 155th year of doing business, we still utilize these challenges such as this natural disaster to demonstrate why a relationship with Sherwin-Williams is valuable. And so in the face of adversity, we love that our teams are running into the center of the fire working to collaborate with our customers to position them for success, responding, and quite frankly, trying to minimize the disruptions. We think we're unique in our asset base. We think we're unique in our experience. We think we are unique in our ability to respond. And we're trying to utilize every aspect of our assets, our facilities, our people to be able to do that. And I really believe, John, that we'll exit this closer to our customers than ever. And we -- I say that because we're utilizing these assets. It could be -- we've got a very robust fleet of tractor trailers and delivery vehicles. And so, even on the home center front, when product becomes available we're not waiting for someone to come begging a transportation company to come pick up our products or to be responsive to ours. We own those. Those are ours. Those are our people our assets. We can dictate those same with our 4500 stores. I know you asked primarily about the home centers, but same stands true with our own stores, located in the communities they serve with well-trained highly qualified leaders in those stores with inventory close to the customers. We've got reps on both the store's front and the home center front. And so what we're trying to do is be as responsive as we can. And so, while there is some choppiness, if you will, from an inventory standpoint and we're working through those, it's getting better every day. We clearly see this as a transitory issue that we're dealing with. We believe we'll get on top of it. And our goal is to be on the other side, have customers point to Sherwin-Williams and say, we want the rest of you to be just like this. John McNulty : Got it. No, that makes sense. And then I guess maybe just as a follow-up on the cost side. I think there's obviously a lot of focus on the pet chem side of it. I guess can you speak to some of the other cost baskets, whether it's on the TiO2 and pigment front, or tinplate? It does seem like there's just a lot of general inflation. So, it may not just be the spike up and back down that we're seeing in pet chems, but there maybe more consistent inflation in some of the other buckets. Can you help us to quantify that or think about that as you're progressing throughout the year? Jim Jaye : Yes. John, I'm happy to take that one. Let me just begin by reiterating a little bit what John and Al have been saying. This whole area of raw material inflation is a transitory issue for us. It's not new for us. We've demonstrated an ability to manage through this many times in the past and we'll get through this as well. You're absolutely right. In our first quarter raws were up by mid-single-digits year-over-year. The biggest driver there was on the petrochem side : monomers resins, solvents, packaging materials. And as you would imagine that hit our Performance Coatings Group a little bit harder with their greater exposure to the pet chem side. That trend is continuing here into our second quarter. If you look at propylene, ethylene, epoxy, HDPE, all of those commodities, they're the highest we've seen in many years and some are at record levels. You take a look at what's driving that across the chemical industry, we've seen a number of things. It was already a challenging environment related to COVID-19. John mentioned Winter Storm Uri. We had 168 production facilities that were offline and disrupted production for an extended period. There's still 60-plus of those facilities offline. Refineries have been operating at below-average utilization rates due to depressed demand for transportation fuels. You've got the demand, as we've talked about screaming both on the architectural and industrial side. So, I mean that's the petrochem side. I know you asked about some of the others. We're seeing similar dynamics there as well. Steel is -- we're seeing increases, supply tightness due to unplanned mill shutdowns, coronavirus outages high demand. So, that's impacting our costs on steel pails and drums. On the TiO2 side, I would say the market's getting a little bit tighter there as well, driven by high demand. You've got the stimulus packages, construction demand, recovery of industrial demand. You've got low inventories and logistical constraints. So, I think TiO2 is moving as well. For all those reasons is why we took up our guide for the year there moving up to that high-single low-double-digit percentage for the full year. 2Q should be the peak. That's how we see it right now. That capacity will come back online. Some of these costs we think will start to moderate. But, as Al mentioned, we'll give you a better view of that at our June 8, FCP event. John McNulty : Thanks very much for the color and the detail. Appreciate it. John Morikis : You bet, John. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. John, Al, in Performance Coatings, it looks like in Q2, you'll be above 2019 levels, pretty meaningfully. Why \u2013 how is that being driven by? Al Mistysyn : Yes. David, you're absolutely right. We should be up high single-digits, low double-digits versus 2019. And I think it's all the things that John talked about in his opening remarks by division. I'll let him jump in on that. John Morikis : Yes. Love to, because I think we're really optimistic about our entire industrial business. All divisions in all regions delivered year-over-year growth in the first quarter. If you look at the market manufacturing, PMI is positive in every region, customer is positive. We do believe that the vaccines should drive stability and comparisons will be favorable moving forward. But this is a terrific leadership team that's leaning forward aggressively and should bode well for us the balance of 2021. As I run through the businesses and I talked about them briefly in my prepared remarks, but if you look at some of these that have really been terrific performers and I'd start with the strong double-digit gains in our industrial wood, we've got really good momentum here. If you look at furniture, kitchen cabinets, flooring, many of these correlate to new residential. We expect that momentum to continue through the first half. And note that the second half, while it may become a bit more challenging as the year goes, this is a team that's really planting a lot of really good seeds with our customers, growing not only through existing customers, we like to say share of wallet but also in new customers. And it's a really good leadership team here. We have high expectations. Talk about our GI business and coming in second with a high teens number is a good place to be. Every region here was up double-digits as well except North America, and North America was up mid-single digits and it continues to show momentum. Again, PMI here is very positive and we expect demand to improve. Good share gains here. We're driving the business in a very positive way. Packaging is another one where demand for food and beverage and cans remains very robust. I've spoken repeatedly about our non-BPA coating. That is continuing to gain traction. Both we and our customers in packaging are investing in additional capacity. We've got terrific partners, good partnership and we anticipate strong demand going forward here for quite some time. I'm really proud of what this team has accomplished. They've delivered for us every quarter since we've acquired Valspar. And between the packaging and coil, not only have we seen terrific growth but we've long been asked about diversifying our business. This really helped us to diversify our business both the packaging and coil. And in coil we see really nice growth. Resumption in commercial projects is picking up, growth in appliances. And again, I've talked about the \u2013 new business wins in this business have really been strong in all regions. So this is another terrific leadership team. And then our automotive refinishes I think has really been something that I've been talking about very positively for a number of quarters. And again this is another terrific quarter for this team. Like others in the market, we experienced significant growth in Asia and to a lesser degree but still significant in Europe. But our strength is here in the Americas. And we believe we're continuing to gain share here through our focus on new accounts and installations, innovation. I mentioned installations in my prepared remarks. We've got more systems and products going here in North America, more installs I believe than we've ever had. I think it's the highest rate we've ever had for this business. And that clearly bodes well for us going forward. And that's in the face of miles driven and collision shop volume that's still off pre-COVID levels. So this industrial business is proving to be everything that we had hoped to do and be. We still have some work obviously in the area of operating margins. Pleased with the momentum that the team has. But there's still a lot of upside. We still think there's upside in the operating margins as well as cash and got, as I mentioned a leadership team that will deliver that. So we're looking forward to it. David Begleiter : And John that sounds \u2013 that's very impressive and one of the reasons why you'll be raising your segment sales guidance I guess in June 8. But doesn't that imply that the full year guidance could be also conservative as you really \u2013 Performance Coatings itself should be up meaningfully versus current guidance? John Morikis : Well, like I said, we would normally give you an update at the end of the second quarter. We're going to move that up into early June and we'll give you an update then. But if you're sensing a little bit of bullishness or confidence in all of our voices, I'd say that's probably appropriate. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hey, guys. Nice quarter. John Morikis : Hey, Mike. Mike Sison : Just one quick one on Consumer Brands Group. If you were able to hit sort of the up part of the outlook for full year, you'd need third and fourth quarter to be flattish to up on really tough comps. So if that were to occur, is that really just driven by trends in DIY sustaining, or are there things that your team is doing there to create some growth and maybe have some \u2013 gain some shelf space so on and so forth? John Morikis : Yes. I'd say \u2013 I mentioned earlier, the PROs who paint is an important initiative one that we expect. Mike I feel really good. We had a terrific year and we continue to post some terrific numbers in our CBG business. We've got terrific partners here and they're committed to growing and we're committed to growing and investing in our businesses together. I think the way it exactly plays out from a timing perspective and kind of shifts in the market, that's yet to be seen. But we're committed to this business and we're committed to our customers. And one way or the other we're going to help them be better at what it is they're doing. And we're willing to execute on that, invest in it and deliver on it. And you can count on that leadership team, wonderful leadership. Already you could see some of that work as Al mentioned in different parts of the world. But got a leadership team here in Brian Patton and Todd Rea that are doing a wonderful job, getting close to our customers and really delivering for them. And we expect that to continue. We're holding them accountable to do that. Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to ask you maybe Al on the inventory level. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that it's down $100 million or so year-over-year, despite sales being up $500 million and raws are obviously up. So just curious about two things; one, is there any risk of any sort of supply constraints on your side that might curtail some volume upside? It sounds like maybe moat risk maybe in the second quarter or potentially later in the year particularly if they're -- we have another bad hurricane season or something like that? And then secondly, I'm just curious if you're seeing -- maybe this is more in The Americas Group, but I'll ask it for the rest of the segments as well whether some of your smaller competitors are at all volume-constrained as far as you can tell? And is that providing opportunities for you? John Morikis : Yes. Vincent why don't I take that? Because I think the raw material supply issue is something that I tried to touch on before. And I would say that, as Jim mentioned that 168 facilities in the petrochem industry going offline. It had an impact on not just the paint industry, but many industries. And as diversified as we are in supply base and geographically, when something like this happens it's a significant natural disaster. It's going to impact many industries. It has impacted us. And so, we're working hard with our suppliers. To be very clear we want to be the ones that stand out amongst our customers with the greatest supply, but there are challenges right now. And a natural disaster like this is going to be challenging. As I mentioned and we have mentioned repeatedly, we believe it's transitory. We think that we'll get on top of this. I think the fact that we have the tenure in our leadership team in our global supply chain, as well as procurement gives me great confidence the asset base that we have and the responsiveness and quite frankly the willingness to do whatever it is. Where we can get product in, we'll ship it from wherever we can make it the fastest to get it to our customers to serve them properly. And we're doing a lot of that right now. And so, it is a real issue. It's getting better, but it's one that we've dealt with. And as far as our competitors, yes, I'd say, as I mentioned all of our competitors are feeling the same pressures. What I'm really proud of and I've mentioned these leaders Heidi Petz, Justin Binns, Brian Patton every one of them when we talk, there's not one of them that are sitting there talking about, Boy there are challenges. The challenges that we're talking about are how quickly we can grow, how fast we can be in front of our customers, how fast we can be in front of our competitors' customers. And so while some might be in a similar situation from a raw material, very few have the ability to respond like Sherwin-Williams. And yes, we're trying to take advantage of that. We're trying to turn those into customers. So you should expect that we're aggressively in front of those customers right now talking about our products our services and how we can help our customers make money. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. I think in TAG you talked about property management being down. So maybe if you could just give us a little bit more color on how the trends are moving there both sequentially and year-over-year and what you expect for the rest of the year? John Morikis : Yes I'd say recovery would be choppy would be the best way that I would describe that. It's improved sequentially, but was down by mid-single digit in the quarter. As we went through the quarter, the results got better. Now some of that came from comparisons that were a little bit easier. But we believe that, there's a meaningful recovery underfoot in this business. I'd say that aligns with Dodge whose non-building starts are forecasted to rebound in the mid to high single digit range. We continue to gain good momentum here by diversifying this business. And I'd say that -- when you look at our property management I'd say, we're in a leadership position here. We've got great determination to continue to grow. But I'd say, also I think it's important is we're seeing more activity in our Southeast and Southwestern divisions where there are fewer, I'll call them governors -- or COVID governors compared to the Midwest and Eastern areas. I'd say that comps are more favorable over the rest of the year. But again, just as we've talked earlier we're not waiting for comps to get easier to be a way to demonstrate. We're on attack. We're attacking right now. And a lot of these customers, some of this might fall a little bit between property maintenance and a little bit of the commercial side. But if you look at the tourist industry, many are starting and expecting for that to pick up. And we expect some of those facilities as they start to get better utilization rates to again begin investing more in that business as well. So we're positioned really well. We're -- we've got I believe a good strong leadership position here great relationships and a lot of determination. Vincent Andrews : Thanks so much. Look forward to the event in June. John Morikis : Thanks Vincent. Operator : The next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good afternoon. Within the US would you speak to the regional trends that you saw in the quarter in your US architectural business and whether or not there was a topline impact from Uri? And then looking out maybe over the medium term, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on demographic trends? More people seem to be moving to Florida and Texas. Is that an issue that's hit your radar screen from the point of view of strategy or capital allocation as it relates to your store base for example? John Morikis : Yes. We love people moving regardless of where they move and we like them to paint and change their mind on the color a couple of times while they're doing that. So we're positioned very well. The Southeast and Southwestern divisions are terrific markets for us. The density of our stores is high there, but there's still plenty of opportunity. We talked about resuming our store count new stores up into the 80-plus range. We're excited about that. I think we have good coverage in the divisions that are the benefactors of some of that movement, but there's still opportunities and we love the shift that might be taking place if it be permanent or temporary. If you look at -- you talked about the demographic or the performance by area. The largest growth that we had was in our Canadian division. This team has been working really hard at executing up there over the last few years. We've been making a lot of investments. So quite frankly our expectations are high for this division, but they're delivering. I'd say as I mentioned the Southeastern division is another area a terrific leader in Todd Wipf down in that area that has been down there for quite some time and is doing a terrific job leading his team. Midwestern Southwestern and the Eastern divisions came in, in order and I'd say, all of them have terrific leaders and are executing. So I was trying to be cute there, Kevin about the move. But the reality is, is that as there's shift in demographics we think we're really well positioned. And we'll capitalize on it wherever it goes largely because of our relationships with the contractors that are going to be on the receiving end. Kevin McCarthy : Understood. And then just on the housekeeping side, how would you characterize the level of earnings dilution associated with your divestiture of Wattyl? Al Mistysyn : Yeah, Kevin, if you look at the remaining three quarters, the impact on consumer would be about close to 5%. And then the profit is immaterial. Hence the portfolio reviews that we complete on a regular basis looking at customer\u2019s brands, businesses we set midterm -- it's got to be not just sales targets but scale and growth targets. And we have to look at our operating margin, RONA, and cash flow. And we don't believe these businesses or programs can meet those targets, we decide they could be better served with somebody else. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yeah. Good morning fellows. John Morikis : Hey Duffy. Al Mistysyn : Hey Duffy. Duffy Fischer : Hi guys. Just one question for me. I just want to triangulate a couple of Al's comments. So you talked about volume being the biggest driver of margin expansion. But if you use your EBIT number and just look at the incremental margins, TAG came in at 46% year-over-year, consumer was 39%. But consumer grew a lot more than TAG did. So can you just talk about the puts and takes of why TAG was able to have meaningfully higher incremental margins than consumer even though it didn't have the volume growth? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. I would say Duffy the -- a couple of reasons. Strong volume in TAG, the high same-store sales increased 8.2% versus a strong 7.4% last year. And the product mix within TAG was favorable. Residential repaint was strong. DIY was strong. New res was strong. We saw double-digit growth in exterior. So -- and the price increase effectiveness was strong in our first quarter, all leading to that high flow-through of 46%. Consumer flow-through at 39%. I'll just say it happy -- really happy with that strong flow-through. And the team has been and we've talked about this investing in the Pro who paints in our home center channels, driving those investments. We also had a little bit of a mix shift as Asia Pacific and Europe grows faster than the U.S. Even though we're seeing nice improvement in the operating margins there, it does dilute our consolidated margins. So those are kind of the high-level factors that would impact that. And the last thing I would say is the consumer\u2019s price increase did come in a little bit -- on a little bit more of a lag in the first quarter -- towards the end of the first quarter to our second quarter. And then they also get the benefit of the Ace business being -- us walking away from the Ace business. Duffy Fischer : Perfect. Okay, thank you guys. John Morikis : Thanks Duffy. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thank you. I want to make sure we beat to death this raw material and inventory issue that's there. Did you have to shift your production mix at all due to any limited availability of raws? Did you maybe have to make more vinyl instead of acrylic or more urethane instead of epoxy? John Morikis : Yeah. I'd say, we're shifting all the time though John. The timing of arrivals of raw materials or the plants that is going to be manufactured \u2013 manufacturing, we might have seen a little bit more of that than usual here given the obvious situation. But I'd say that's something that we do. And when I mentioned earlier about the strength of doing business with Sherwin-Williams that's the benefit of a company like ours, the capacity that we have, the assets that we have, quite frankly the purchasing power that we have. There's a lot of opportunities on an everyday basis. Here now with this situation as products become available, we're able to utilize our assets the best ability -- to our best ability. John Roberts : And then are you still seeing strong spray equipment sales in the stores as a leading indicator consistent with some of the growth outlooks that you've projected? John Morikis : Yes we are. John Roberts : All right. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks John. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Edlain Rodriguez : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. John Morikis : Good afternoon. Edlain Rodriguez : One quick one. Like in terms of the businesses that are still under some pressure like commercial paint, Protective and Marine, and a little bit of auto refinish, like are you seeing any real fundamental improvement in those businesses? And when do you expect to start seeing maybe pre-COVID levels in some of those businesses? John Morikis : I would say that we're seeing sequential improvement in all of them and we expect that to continue. The timing on pre-COVID levels, we'd like to see that obviously sooner than later. We're working hard with our teams to be able to reach those levels. A little hard to give that projection by division in this format, but you should expect that that is absolutely our intent. Edlain Rodriguez : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : All right. Thanks for taking my question here guys. I guess, I just wanted to circle back at a lot of the strength that you've seen and your expectations maybe in future periods. So, obviously, you've seen double-digit growth in resi repaint for many periods. That seems like it's actually going to continue. But you've also seen a recovery on the new side. If you were to just think about those two dynamics, do you feel that paint stores will continue to grow next year at a say 1.5 to two times the market clip? John Morikis : Yes. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. That was easy. And then I guess maybe on the industrial side similarly, we have a nice recovery going on now. But you saw some nice strength in refinish. You've discussed packaging at length. What areas of that business are potentially still below normal that you may expect to see recovery in future periods as well? John Morikis : In the industrial business you're asking? Arun Viswanathan : Yes. John Morikis : Yeah. I would absolutely say that we're pleased with the momentum in our automotive refinish. There's a lot of seeds that are being planted. Our expectations for that business are very high. I think even with the growth that we are experiencing in GI and industrial wood, we expect that momentum to continue. I'd say coil is going to continue to grow. You know what, let me just save some time here. We have expectations for every one of those divisions to continue to grow. There's a lot of upside. Our position in the market there's -- we're not sitting here with an enormous amount of market share here where we can't grow. I mean, there's opportunities in every one of those businesses. We believe we have the product technology, the assets and most importantly the people to be able to execute on that. And so our expectations are very high for each one of those businesses, both on the sales and operating margin from both perspectives. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks, John. John Morikis : You bet. Jim Jaye : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Garik Shmois : Great. Thanks. Just one question for me. Just looking for some clarification on TAG pricing and just recognizing there could be some upside later this year. But of the -- you got 1.7% in the first quarter. You expect 2% or better the following quarters. Is that 2% total, or is that 2% on top of the 1.7% you just got? I'm assuming, it's the same as your last outlook but I just wanted to be sure. Al Mistysyn : Yes. That's 2% in total and it's maybe even a little bit better than the prior effectiveness of price increases that we've done. Garik Shmois : Great. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Hi, good afternoon. John Morikis : Hey Mike. Mike Harrison : I wanted to dig in a little bit on this opportunity with PROs who paint at Lowe's. And it sounds like they've talked about some success in bringing these people into the stores. Do you have any metrics that you can share on what kind of benefit you've seen in the paint aisle? And maybe talk about what specific product lines at Lowe's you're gearing toward the PRO market or how you're positioning to better serve them. John Morikis : Mike, we do have metrics, none that we can share. I mean, these would be our customers' metrics that we feel, it's very important in that relationship for them to discuss and to share. And I would also say, even from a product offering targeting those customers -- and I'll talk about our stores and maybe use that to reflect on the business that you're asking about. If you look at our high-end products, many of those are sold to the DIY customer, but many are also sold to the residential repaint contractors. So, I don't know that you would find customers in our stores that are professional, that are not buying some product at nearly every price point that we offer. And so the work that we're doing on the PROs that paint, targets the same type of breadth of product. There are customers that are maybe very high-end or upscale homes that want to use the very best. And there are others quite frankly that might be in different price points, but have also recognized that the largest cost of their goods -- cost of goods is in labor and they make more money using a higher-quality paint. So, we're not only designing products for PROs or DIY customers. We're designing products for the end application with the idea of the applicator in mind. So, we do build some PRO products, largely on the commercial side that are maybe more geared towards that application. But when you go into a home center, you're going to find those PROs typically shopping throughout the entire product line. Mike Harrison : All right. And also wanted to revisit the Wattyl divestiture. Just wondering kind of what this says about your international expansion plans or strategy on the architectural side. Maybe comment on why Wattyl wasn't a good fit. And it's been a little while since we talked about China on the architectural side. Any comments there? John Morikis : Yes. I'd say, Mike, it's a great question and one I'd like to touch on because, I think it demonstrates the discipline as well as strategy. So my message is -- to a shareholder would be, we are committed. We are committed to growth and we're making investments in those areas that we believe have the opportunity to reach the long-term targets that Al just walked through. We're not interested in just a book of business. We're not interested in practice. We know how to make paint. Our shareholders expect a return on their investment and that's what we're out to do. So we're looking at programs. We're looking at geographies. We're looking at customer programs themselves to understand, which ones are viable and meaningful to both our customers and our shareholders. And in those areas, where we can see the long-term investments paying off, we're going to invest. We're going to get in there and grind out, what needs to be done to win. But we're not going to be in some part of the world -- other part of the world, expending our time and our treasure in areas that doesn't offer the return that our shareholders deserve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll try and be quick because I know we're getting late. First question on TAG and Performance Coatings Group. Clearly different pricing dynamics, different raw material baskets and potential inflationary pressures. You all mentioned some gross margin compression near term. Is either segment at risk of just kind of greater compression over the next quarter? And then, either segment, will it take a little bit longer to recover all the inflationary pressures? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Truman, I would say just because of the size of the petrochem side of the basket moving higher than the others short term, we would see more of a compression on PCG. But as you know and as I talked about for the year, we're not focused on gross margin compression or expansion alone. It's a combination of things. We're focused on operating margin growth and that comes in many ways starting with volume. And we are showing strong volumes in Performance Coatings Group in TAG, the selling price increases and as I talked about PCG has incremental selling price increases coming into our second quarter and getting leverage on SG&A. And where we fall out on the operating margin improvement is really driven by that volume first. But you can have confidence in our discipline and resolve about getting price increases, if we need them later in the year to offset dollar for dollar the raw material increases across all businesses. Truman Patterson : Okay. Okay. That's really helpful. So in PCG, primarily a bit more compression just due to raw materials rather than an inability to dip pricing at least moving forward. Okay. And then just -- this has been asked a couple of different ways, but I just want to ask a bit more directly and make sure, I'm not missing anything. DIY in the US through April, you all aren't seeing any slowing whatsoever? And the reason that I'm asking is, it looks like in consumer, the second quarter sales guide looks a little soft, but I think that might include the Wattyl divestiture. So just wanting to understand that. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Truman, it does include about 4% in it for Wattyl. Truman Patterson : Okay. But you're not seeing any deceleration in DIY in April? Al Mistysyn : Let me say it this way. April sales are within our guidance. Truman Patterson : Certainly. John Morikis : You\u2019re a good man, Truman. It's within our guidance. Truman Patterson : All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck on the upcoming quarter. John Morikis : Thanks, Truman. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your questions. Justin Speer : Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Just a few questions here. One on, just following up that DIY paint, maybe not through your retail partners, but through your stores. How did the DIY point-of-sale trends look through the quarter to exit the quarter maybe even to April? And maybe, if you could help us maybe understand, in terms of its guidance for the second quarter, how much of that may be tied to managing your retail customers, managing inventories, or perhaps just the supply chain disruptions versus underlying demand slowing? John Morikis : No. I'd say that -- is it -- I'm not quite sure I understand your question. Is it -- Al Mistysyn : I would say, Justin, it's not demand slowing. I think we're showing a strong top line sales guidance. So, it's not related to anything restocking or inventory level holder pushes within the retail channel. But up mid to high teens on a consolidated basis and strong improvements across each of the segments or TAG and PCG in particular, that's driven by the underlying demand trends. That's not anything related to the inventory. CBG down low double digits to mid-teens. We have the Wattyl impact. But even with that guidance, we're still going to be up mid- to high teens relative to the second quarter of 2019. So we're not giving it all back and we're maintaining some momentum there. John Morikis : With an effort on trying to grow, as I mentioned earlier, on the -- through those retail customers with the PROs that paint as well. Justin Speer : For sure. Yes, I recognize there's just tremendous growth. And I know that you're looking at maybe toggling back to low single, but maybe there's some phasing and some timing where maybe we tilt negative and that's what you're guiding to. But it sounds like that's a view towards maybe end demand versus inventory situation, it's more of a view that end demand for whatever reason, the second quarter is going to be a little bit softer year-over-year for your business through retail, but not necessarily -- and then maybe, but I guess the question I have, is that a reflection of the actual end demand to the customer that you're expecting there? John Morikis : Well, what we are saying is that, as people go back to work, they're not going to be home painting. And if that occurs then there is a little less DIY business. We think Sherwin-Williams is uniquely positioned to capture it in other areas of the business. So if people are going back to work and more painters are coming to their homes while they're at work, we're going to pick that up. If the people are going back to work in their plants, the production of those plants are going to be up on -- and going online, we're going to pick it up there. So I can go through in great detail, Justin. But I know you know this business very well and we've had this discussion a number of times. Our view is that we've been working hard, quite frankly, for years for this moment. Whichever way the business tilts, we're there, and we're going to capitalize on it. And if it's in DIY, we're there. If it's in res repaint, we're there. If it's in new residential, property maintenance, commercial, property management, whatever it is, we're there and we're going to capitalize on it. Justin Speer : It makes sense. And, yes, you have a great portfolio to adapt to the dynamics. The last question I have is on the free cash flow margin expectation for this year. You had a very, very strong last year on that front. How are you thinking about the phasing of free cash flow margins this year? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Justin, we are expecting to be even a little bit above the 12.5%, 13% net operating cash targets we've set for ourselves. And then with our CapEx, our core CapEx below 2%, but we also have the building our future $100 million that we talked about. So if I look at net operating cash, less CapEx, we've talked about being above that 11.5%. And I think, we might be a little bit below that just because of the extra $100 million, but I do expect strong net operating cash for the year. Justin Speer : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it. John Morikis : Thanks, Justin. Operator : The next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. Rosemarie Morbelli : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for taking my question. I have just one quick question on the potential infrastructure bill. How much of your Performance Coatings would benefit from it? And what technologies do you need in order to have a bigger impact? John Morikis : Rosemarie, it's a great question. It's something that has us very excited. Our Protective & Marine business is a terrific business, positioned very well. I think a big part of it -- and I think, you know as well as most that have tried to follow what this infrastructure bill might look like, I think, we all recognize that there's a lot of variability in what might be coming down the pipe here. So maybe just the pieces and parts. If it's -- we have a terrific position in water and wastewater. We have a terrific position in -- we say, bridge and highway, but it's -- ours is on the high-value end of the bridge work. If you look at airport investments, virtually any infrastructure that goes in we'd be very well positioned to be there. And I say very well positioned and I might say, because it's -- you asked about technology. We do have very unique technologies from floor to ceiling. And our goal there is to ensure that the coatings that we provide, not only offer tremendous protection, but we have very unique systems that allow our coatings to have the assets put back in place quickly, a rapid return to service we refer to them. So polyaspartic coatings that can be coated/recoated quickly and put back in place, so that bridge lane closures down considerably or floors can be recoated and put back in place quickly. All of these are part of the product offering that we bring, that our customers have learned to expect and quite frankly we work very hard to get [Indiscernible]. So depending on what comes out in that bill, we think we're going to be very well positioned to capitalize on it. Rosemarie Morbelli : Can you quantify how much of your business could benefit? Let's pretend for a second that the whole thing goes through. John Morikis : I don't know how to quantify that until we see the reality of -- I can appreciate for your modeling, but that'd be purely speculation on our part right now. I will say this, Rosemarie we're very well positioned to capitalize on it. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. And do you need additional technologies? Obviously, it sounds as though this is what you are going to be looking for in terms of M&A. Can you share with us, the gaps in your technology portfolio? John Morikis : We would not do that publicly now. We do recognize that there are opportunities. We're out looking at some of those, but we wouldn't want to flag those areas that we're pursuing M&A targets right now. Rosemarie Morbelli : And \u2026 John Morikis : [Indiscernible] Rosemarie Morbelli : I am sorry. And still on the M&A, I presume that you are not looking at anything the size of a Valspar? We are talking more about bolt-on type of acquisitions? John Morikis : Yeah. I think there -- we've spoken openly about, how long we coveted that Valspar business. I don't think there's another Valspar out there. There are opportunities for us but not something like a Valspar. Rosemarie Morbelli : Okay. Thank you very much and good luck. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Hocevar : Hey. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in. Al, I just wanted to follow up on -- you mentioned the expectation of pricing offsetting raw material inflation this year. And if I did some back-of-the-envelope math raw is 85% of COGS; expected inflation 10% at the midpoint. That seems to imply something like 4% to 5% pricing for the total company for the full year. And assuming the pricing will ramp throughout the year that's probably higher than that in the back half of the year. And you've already addressed, TAG kind of 2% pricing plus going forward. And we'll see if when -- if or when you, do another price increase there. But can you kind of talk about pricing in the other segments? And how -- is that the type of pricing you're expecting based on the actions that you're taking there? And then, we'll kind of see what you guys end up doing with TAG? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Kevin, I think what you can expect is, we'll continue to monitor the raw material basket as we normally do. And if it persists at these levels then, yeah, typically if -- to offset the dollars you got to get about 50% of the raw material increase just because of the way the sales COGS dynamic works. So -- and to be fair, some businesses within industrial are going higher than others, just because of the dynamics within that specific business. So I would say that, my expectation is still that we'd offset the raw dollars -- dollar per dollar wood price. And to be clear, if we don't see that happening Kevin, we'll offset it with other internal savings and SG&A, and other levers that we have to pull. So, I don't want to leave here, thinking that, boy, if I don't give -- if they don't get price they're not going to offset the raw material increase. That's absolutely not the case. We'll look at all levers that we have available, because again our focus is growing operating margin. Kevin Hocevar : Yeah. Okay. And one other quick one on -- in the retail -- with the retail partners, I think last year there wasn't really much in the way of promotion. But now that we're entering the paint season and there tends to be, promotions around some of the holidays. Curious, if you're aware of what the promotion activity will look like this year. John Morikis : We are. But it's not something that we would discuss out of respect for our customers. Kevin Hocevar : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Well, thanks. I'll keep it to one. Surprised, I still have it. Just want to make sure that the raw material high single-digit, low double-digits, is that an industry forecast as opposed to a Sherwin forecast? And... Al Mistysyn : Yeah. John Morikis : Yeah, sir. Greg Melich : Yeah? And then, if that's the case, is this one of those odd years where just given the chasing of inventory to stay in stock for your customers, that your raw material bill might be up as much as the industry or even more? Jim Jaye : It's an industry forecast, Greg is what I would say. I don't know Al if you have any other, comments on that. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. I mean, Greg to your point, if you look, at -- because we're on a last-in first-out basis in North America is the largest portion of our sales. We -- I would say it this way we would be higher because of the rapid increase this year, than we might be in other years where it's maybe more muted. That would be the way I kind of frame that. Greg Melich : So it would be -- I mean obviously you guys are going to buy well. But we shouldn't assume that, you would be less than the industry this year, given just the uniqueness of it? Al Mistysyn : Okay. I wouldn't make any assumption around that. I don't know what our peers are buying and what prices they're at. I just -- I understand, where we're at and we're trying to explain hey if a year-over-year on a rapidly increasing like it is in this year versus a more stable, our costs are going to be up higher because of that last... John Morikis : We might be in the spot a little bit -- spot market a little bit more or doing those things that we need to keep our customers in business. And so, there might be a little more volatility this year than other years. Greg Melich : Makes total sense, thank you. And I guess, on volume, I just want to make sure, I got it right. You don't think there was any material volume impact from being out of stock. It sounds like there may have been some but it may have been 50bps of volume demand not hundreds of bps? John Morikis : Nothing material. Greg Melich : Okay. Thank you. Good luck. Great job. John Morikis : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session for today. I'll hand the call back to Jim Jaye, for closing remarks. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Jim before you jump in here let me just -- there were some really good questions. I just want to circle back on just a couple of points. One I think that -- I think it's important to understand how confident we are. We have a proven ability to grow in the most difficult markets I think top line and bottom-line. I believe we're executing our strategy and that's uniquely positioned us to outperform the market and we believe our peers. We had a couple of points here that I think are important to reemphasize and that's the commitment we have to making strategic investments in stores and innovation in reps both, technical rep, sales and specification reps as well and all driving towards solutions and those solutions that help our customers to be more successful. And those services and products we think are an important element, not only in the ability to help our customers be more successful, but in our building that relationship with those customers. And I think managing through these periods of times highlights, the proven record I think of the company and the leadership team, I think most importantly the terrific Sherwin-Williams team members that are closest to our customers every day. We've got great confidence in our position. And more importantly, I think great confidence in our future. I've said this before, I believe, we're just getting started. And I think that best frames the mentality of this leadership team. We're proud of what we've accomplished. We're not complacent. We think we're just getting started. And we're looking forward to the future. So Jim, I'll kick it over to you to talk about the FCP. Jim Jaye : Yeah, just a couple of housekeeping items on the virtual financial community presentation. That's going to be at 2 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, June 8. Again, that's Tuesday, June 8. Registration for that will be available on our Investor Relations website very shortly. As you heard multiple times today, we'll give you an update the full year. We'll also have some newer things this year with other members of our management team around technology and ESG. So that should be a great event. If you need more information, you can reach out to Natalie Darr and my team. And with that, I want to just thank everybody for joining our call. As always, myself, Eric Swanson, we'll be available to answer any other questions you might have. So, have a great day. And thanks for your interest in Sherwin. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.",

After the Company's prepared remarks, we will open this session to questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you. And good morning everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered very solid results in the second quarter. We continue to operate in a very dynamic environment where demand was robust across the majority of our business, raw material inflation remained persistently high and the effects of winter storm Uri continued to have an impact on the entire industry\u2019s supply chain and product inventories. Amid these challenges we raised our sales expectations at our June 8 Analyst Day, and we delivered on those targets. Our gross margins were under considerable pressure in the quarter, given the sustained, higher raw material costs. However, as we have demonstrated in past inflationary cycles, we are fully committed to offsetting these costs and we announced additional pricing actions in the quarter, which will be realized as the year goes on. Despite the near-term gross margin compression, adjusted diluted net income per share in the quarter, grew by a double-digit percentage and EBITDA expanded by a high single-digit percentage. Let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers. All comparisons in our prepared commentary this morning are to the second quarter of 2020, unless otherwise specified. Starting with the topline, second quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 16.9% to $5.38 billion. This is the single, largest revenue quarter in the company's history. Supply chain constraints negatively impacted sales by approximately 3.5 percentage points split evenly between The Americas Group and the Consumer Brands Group. Consolidated gross margin decreased 320 basis points to 44.8% driven by raw material cost inflation outpacing our price increases near-term and a return to a more normal mix. Gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019. SG&A expense, as a percent of sales, decreased 130 basis points to 26.7%. Consolidated profit before tax increased $71.8 million or 9.6% to $819.2 million. The second quarters of 2021 and 2020 included $78 million and $75.1 million of acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense respectively. Excluding these items, consolidated profit before tax increased 9.1% to $897.2 million. Diluted net income per share in the quarter increased to $2.42 cents per share from $2.16 per share a year ago. The second quarters of 2021 and 2020 included acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.23 per share and $0.21 per share respectively. Excluding these items, second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11.8% to $2.65 per share from $2.37 per share. EBITDA grew to $1.05 billion in the quarter or 19.5% of sales. Net operating cash grew to $1.2 billion in the first six months of 2021, an increase of 11.8% compared to the same period in 2020. Looking at our operating segments, sales came in much as we anticipated with very strong growth in our pro architectural and industrial businesses and as expected, a historically more normal DIY. Segment margin was under pressure in all three segments, primarily due to significantly higher year-over-year raw material costs. Our additional price increases, which are still being implemented, were not enough in the near term to offset the higher material costs. Sales in The Americas Group grew 22.6%. Segment margin decreased 30 basis points to 23.5% as operating leverage from the higher volume and selling price increases were offset by the higher raw material costs. Sales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 25.4%, including four percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. Adjusted segment margin decreased 680 basis points to 19.7% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and gross margin pressure related to higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases and good cost control. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group exceeded our expectations and increased 41.3%. Adjusted segment margin decreased 60 basis points to 13% of sales as operating leverage from the higher volume and selling price increases were offset by higher raw material costs. Let me now turn the call over to John Morikis for additional commentary on the second quarter and our first half, along with our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2021. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Let me begin by framing my comments with some key themes. First, demand is very strong across the majority of our business, and we are aggressively pursuing growth opportunities. Two, while industry supply chain constraints are continuing to impact production and sales nobody has more assets and capabilities than Sherwin-Williams to keep their customers in paint and on the job. Three, we are aggressively combating raw material inflation with significant price actions across each of our businesses. We will continue to do so as necessary. And last, we've seen this movie before, there is no better or more experienced team in the industry to manage through the current environment. We remain extremely confident, we will emerge from these current challenges, a stronger company with stronger customer relationships and with continued strong value creation for our shareholders. My deep thanks goes to all 61,000 members of our team who are doing an amazing job in some pretty challenging circumstances right now. Jim did a nice job of framing up the second quarter at a high level. In a moment, I'll get into some additional color for each of our segments. But first, I'd like to make a comment on our first half. Given the impact of the pandemic on our results in the second quarter, a year ago, 2021 first half consolidated sales increased 14.7% or $1.29 billion. Adjusted PBT increased 23.5% or $303.3 million. Adjusted PBT margin was up 120 basis points to 15.9% of sales. And adjusted diluted net income was $4.71 per share, an increase of 26.6%. This is a very strong performance, especially in light of the much higher than anticipated raw material inflation we've seen and the supply chain challenges we've described. Now we turn into the segment performance in the quarter. In the Americas Group, second quarter sales increased to 22.6%. The impact of unfavorable currency translation was not material. Same-store sales in the U.S. and Canada were up 19.3%. We generated strong double-digit growth across all of our pro end markets in TAG in the second quarter. Residential repaint, TAG's largest business was the fastest growing and we expect this momentum to continue. Contractors are reporting solid backlogs, and interior and exterior work were both strong. Our commercial business was the next fastest growing and as gaining momentum as we expected. Projects continue to resume at varying paces and comparisons are favorable over the remainder of the year. Property maintenance is also gaining momentum. Apartment turns or return to travel and office and a favorable comparison, all contributed to our growth. We expect to see continuing improvements as the year progresses. New residential remained another area of strength for us. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer, and customers are reporting solid order rates. We're also encouraged by growth in our protective and marine business. We saw a return to growth with oil and gas customers and continued strength in flooring, bridge and highway, and pharmaceutical applications. And finally, as expected, our DIY business was down significantly after five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Notably, all TAG architectural businesses delivered growth over the second quarter of 2019. From a product perspective, sales in both interior and exterior paint were up by double-digit percentages with interior being the larger part of the mix. Additionally, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of spray equipment sales increased by double digits. This continues to be a very healthy sign of recovery as contractors typically invest in this type of equipment in anticipation of solid demand. We realized nearly 2.5% of price in the second quarter resulting from our February 1 price increase. Given the persistent raw material inflation we are experiencing, TAG announced an additional 7% price increase last month, that will be effective August 1. We would expect the combination of these February and August price increases to result in a mid-single-digit percentage of price in the third quarter, and better than that in the fourth quarter, putting our full year price realization for TAG in the mid-single-digit range. We will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed. We opened 23 net new stores in the quarter and have opened 34 net new stores year-to-date. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity enhancing services to drive additional growth. To provide a fuller picture of how this business is performing, I'll close out my TAG discussion with a few comments on the first half. Sales are up 15.9% versus the first half of 2020 and segment margin is up 110 basis points, 21.6% of sales. A metric we pay very close attention to is the number of new accounts, which are up nearly 30% in the first half. This is a clear indicator of terrific opportunities ahead. On a two-year stack basis, sales are up 14% compared to the first half of 2019, or an average of 7% annually, well above market growth. Segment margin expanded 240 basis points over the same two-year period. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased 25% in the quarter, including a positive impact of 1.5 percentage points related to currency translation and negative impact of 4 percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. Pricing was positive. As expected, our DIY business returned to more normal levels driven by consumers returning to work and difficult comparisons to the prior year. We're encouraged by growth in our European and Asia-Pacific businesses, which were both up double digits in the quarter. And in our Pros Who Paint category, though these areas of strength were not enough to offset lower North America DIY demand. While it was a challenging quarter for sure, it's constructive to look at this business over the first half, given the unusual DIY dynamics related to the pandemic over the past year. Adjusting for the divestiture of Wattyl, the business is only down low-single digits compared to the first half of 2020. Encouragingly, the first half of 2021 is up mid-single digits compared to the first half of 2019, and adjusted segment margin is up 180 basis points over the same period. We think the comparison to the first half of 2019 better indicates the progress we're making in growing this business and improving its performance. As you know, our global supply chain organization is managed within this segment, this team continues to do incredible work in navigating the industry-wide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri. We are working collaboratively across our business to support our customers and keep them painting. Last, let me comment on second quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. The industrial recovery appears to be in full swing. The momentum we've seen since the third quarter of 2020 continued and accelerated in the year\u2019s second quarter. Group sales increased by more than 40%, including a currency translation tailwind of 6% in the quarter. Price was positive, and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in Europe, followed by Latin America, Asia-Pacific and North America. Every division in the group grew by a strong double-digit percentage driven by robust underlined demand, new customer wins, share wallet gains and favorable comparisons to last year\u2019s second quarter. I'll start with the industrial wood division, which again had the highest growth rate in the group. This is the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in this business and sales were positive in every region. New residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring and furniture applications. General industrial, the largest division of the group posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and sales were positive in every region. Our customers are reporting the growth they have seen as being driven by true and market demand rather than temporary inventory restocking. Sales were strong across our customer segments, including heavy equipment, building products, containers and general finishing. Automotive refinish sales increased by strong double-digit percentage. Miles driven and collision shop volume remained below pre-pandemic levels. New installations of our products and systems in North America remained very strong. This is a good indicator of further momentum in our business. Our coil coatings business remains a consistent performer. Sales grew by strong double-digit percentage and were positive in all regions. This team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions. Construction and appliances were to grow. Our packaging team generated double-digit growth against a high-single-digit comparison last year, and sales were positive in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction with existing and new customers. As I did in the other two segments, let me speak to Performance Coatings\u2019 first half performance, where sales were up 26.4% versus the first half of 2020. Adjusted segment profit increased $81.3 million or 25.7%. Adjusted segment margin was basically flat, which is encouraging given that this group has seen the highest level of raw material inflation in the company year-to-date. On a two-year stack basis, PCG first half 2021 sales were up 15% compared to the first half of 2019 or an average of 7.5% annually, again, well above market growth. Adjusted segment margin is down just 40 basis points over the same two-year period. Encouraging performance given this business has faced the most significant raw material inflation year-to-date. Before moving on to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation year-to-date. We have returned a little over $1.9 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We\u2019ve invested $1.6 billion to purchase 6.4 million shares at an average price of $257.12. We distributed $297.7 million in dividends, an increase of 21.2%. We also invested $151.4 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $17 million for our building our future project. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times. Turning to our outlook. We expect robust demand in all North American pro architectural end markets to continue through the second half, though comparisons become more challenging and continued tightness in the supply chain will remain a headwind. We expect DIY demand to continue to moderate as consumers return to work and comparisons will remain challenging into 2022. We expect industrial demand will remain strong over the rest of the year. As we described last quarter, we\u2019ve been highly proactive in managing the supply chain disruptions to provide product to our customers. We expect to be in a make and ship mode until the seasonally slower fourth quarter when we expect to begin building inventory. We see the current challenges as an opportunity to drive even greater engagement with our customers. We\u2019re leveraging all of our assets, including our store platform, our fleet, our distribution centers, and more to let us come up with unique and creative customer solutions that others simply can\u2019t. On the cost side of the equation, raw material inflation has not moderated driven by continued supply chain issues and surging demand. As a result, we are raising our raw material inflation expectations to be in the mid-teens for the year, an increase from our previous range. We anticipate year-over-year inflation in the third quarter to be higher than it was in the second quarter with only slight improvement in the fourth quarter, as demand remains high. We continue to have great confidence. We will offset these higher costs with the incremental price increases we announced in all businesses during the second quarter. We are prepared to implement additional increases should they be necessary. We recognized the timing of price realization will continue to put pressure on margins in the near term. Over the longer term, we expect margin expansion. Against this backdrop, we anticipate third quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will be up by mid to high single digit percentage compared to the third quarter of 2020. We expect The Americas Group sales to be up by a mid to high single digit percentage with pro sales at or above the high end of this range and DIY sales returning to a more historic level.  We expect Consumer Brands sales to be down by a mid to high teens percentage, including a negative impact of approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. And we expect performance coatings sales to be up by a high teens to low 20s percentage. We expect raw material availability to continue to improve throughout the quarter. Embedded in our guidance is a slightly smaller impact from raw material availability than we experienced in the second quarter. For the full year 2021, we expect consolidated net sales to be up by a high single to low double-digit percentage. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a low double digit to mid-teens percentage. Consumer Brands Group to be down by a mid to high single digit percentage, including the negative impact of approximately four percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low 20s percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $8.01 to $8.31 per share, compared to $7.36 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.80 per share and the loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2021 earnings per share of $9.15 to $9.45, an increase of 13.6% at the midpoint over the $8.19 we delivered in 2020. Let me close with some additional data points that may be helpful for modeling purposes. We expect to see slightly more gross margin contraction in our second half compared to our first half due to higher raw material costs, product and customer mix returning to more normal levels and a more difficult comparison year-over-year, partially offset by additional selling price increases implemented across all of our businesses in the second half of the year. We expect to see some contraction in full year gross margin, given the lag between pricing realization and the rapid and greater than expected increase in raw material costs. As we capture price and inflation abates, [ph] we expect to see gross margin recover and then expand over time just as it has in previous cycles. We expect to see some contraction in our second half operating margin due to the contraction in gross margin partially offset by leverage on SG&A due to the strong sales growth. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately flat with 2020 with a nice improvement compared to 2019. The level of our operating margin performance compared to last year will depend on where in the range our consolidated sales perform and where raw materials trend through the second half of the year. We will continue making investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to return to our normal cadence with around 80 new stores opening in the U.S. and Canada in 2021. We\u2019ll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform in the home center channel. These investments are embedded in our full year guidance. We expect foreign currency exchange to be a tailwind of approximately 2% for the full year. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. We expect full year depreciation to be approximately $280 million and amortization to be approximately $310 million. The CapEx and interest expense guidance we provided last quarter remains unchanged. We have $24 million of long-term debt due in 2021. We expect to increase the annual dividend per share by 23.5% per share for the full year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We\u2019ll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. We delivered an excellent first half and despite considerable supply chain and inflationary headwinds, we are maintaining our previous full year guidance and expect to deliver another very strong year. We remain highly focused on providing solutions to our customers. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Punjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Ghansham Punjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. John Morikis : Good morning, Ghansh. Ghansham Punjabi : Good morning. Revision higher for 2021 sales specific to TAG versus your most recent guidance, can you just take us through which end markets are driving that incremental upside? And I know you also said that [indiscernible] prices are not moderating, but have they started to stabilize or is that not the case at this point? John Morikis : Hey Ghansham let me take a swipe at the first part of your question and I'll ask Al to talk about the second. And it's going to be an easy swipe across the first piece because across the TAG business, if I understand your question, which segments are going to be driving that business, it's every one of our professional segments. We've got great confidence in the demand that we see in that business. We spoke last quarter, last couple quarters about our expectations as it relates to DIY that they would likely revert back to the mean or the norm. And that from a market perspective, that we would be in a terrific position to be able to capitalize on the business as it started to shift into these pro segments. We didn't expect that it'd be perfectly smooth, just waving in from one to another. But in fact, these pro businesses are showing terrific demand and we're excited to be in a position to be able to capitalize on those. We think the control distribution model that we have, we think the reps that we have, and even in these challenges \u2013 challenging times with some of the supply chain issues, that we're working closer with our customers and developing a level of loyalty that we've not seen before. Before throwing it to Al, I'll add just a couple of comments as to why I made those statements regarding the relationship with our customers. We stay very close to our customers, and right now we've just gotten some terrific feedback on the research, as it relates to our loyalty with our customers. As it speaks to the pro business, we've set records during these challenging times with our contractors highlighting our ability to respond and work with them during these challenging issues. And the fact that our reps and managers are there with them close to the customer has allowed us to be responsive to them, keep them in paint predominantly better than anyone else. And that combined with the demand we feel is going to position us to really come through this and exit this stronger than are today and got you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Ghansham this is Al. On the raw material basket side, we are now saying that our third quarter is going to be the highest year-over-year. And that coming into the second quarter, we thought the second quarter will be higher year-over-year. So, a slight moderation there. But we also think the fourth quarter, we should see some moderation in raw materials. The costs are higher and industrial, but significant across all of our businesses. And that is why we were out with price increases across all businesses. We announced August 1 price increase in TAG, but we're out across all our businesses in all our regions to recoup this significant raw material inflation. And as you recall, we're going to see some short-term contraction and gross margin, but as pricing catches up with those raw material increases, we'll start to see a recovery. And then as raw materials, moderate, we'll start getting gross margin expansion going forward. Ghansham Punjabi : Perfect. Thanks so much. John Morikis : Thanks, Ghansham. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi. Thanks very much. Al Mistysyn : Good morning. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi, good morning. I presume that there were raw material shortages that you endured in the quarter. Do you have an estimate of perhaps your lost sales because you didn't have sufficient raw materials? And when you think about your lost sales, how would you allocate it among the groups? John Morikis : Yes, Jeff on a consolidated basis, we think the raw material shortages were a headwind of about 3.4% on the consolidated, and that was split pretty evenly between our TAG and our Consumer Brands segments. There was an immaterial impact on our Performance Coatings segment. Jeff Zekauskas : Thank you for that. And in Consumer Brands is that the area where it's \u2013 where your raw material, your price raw material capture is likely to be slowest? John Morikis : Jeff, I think what \u2013 each of the consumer, each of the \u2013 we have a lot of different categories and businesses. I would say that the team has implemented pricing across all those categories, their price effectiveness is similar to where we're at in TAG, and there are more pricing that comes off that the additional raw material basket increases that we're seeing. Al Mistysyn : I'd say Jeff, from our perspective our actions are right in line. And in fact, our customers\u2019 response is pretty much in line with what we've expected. We've always said that we don't try to run for the perfect quarter. We're working with our customers on both the TAG consumer, while in the PCG side on how these price increases roll in. We will get the price increase and our goal is to do that in a way that allows us to retain the customers. And to do that we work with them, but we have absolute confidence in our ability to do both of those two to put the price in and keep the customers. John Morikis : Yes, the only other comment I would make on that, Jeff is on the lag, I think, if you look at the operating margin comparison versus last year, it's very difficult because of just the very high-volume strength we saw in the second quarter. But if you look at the first half our first half and consumer, our operating margin was still up almost 180 basis points versus the first half of 2019. So, I think because of the way the year rolled out, I think, a better comparison would be to the first half of 2019. And we've maintained that margin. And on a 3.5% sales increase in the first task versus first half of 2019. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Thank you so much. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty : Yes, thanks for taking my question. When we think about the various buckets for raw materials, whether it's resin, TiO2, or packaging, or what have you, I guess, as you look forward, are there ones where you expect to see relief? And can you speak to ones that you think look they are going to be sticky here for a while? Can you, can you help us to think about that? Jim Jaye : Yes, sure John. When we look at the basket, what we saw in the second quarter was really the inflation was being driven by higher cost per monomer, resins, solvents, and packaging materials. As John mentioned, the inflation was highest in the Performance Coatings Group, given their greater exposure to that side. We did guide here that we think the third quarter is going to be the highest year-over-year, raw material inflation and only, modest relief maybe in the fourth quarter. So, I think a lot of those, that I just mentioned, are going to remain sticky. I'd say on the TiO2 side, that's been largely stable for the most part, a little bit of inflation, but not \u2013 that's not where we are seeing the pressure. So, it's going to continue to be a challenging environment on the raws. But as John mentioned and Al mentioned in their remarks, we're very committed on this pricing initiatives that we have. We've been very aggressive, we're out across the businesses. We feel very good about our ability to offset those dollars during the year. Al Mistysyn : I think if you look at historically where we've seen going back in time where the industry took a little bit of a delay in 2016 and the experience that we gained there, we've got a lot of leadership in this company that's been through that experience as well as others. And the determination that we have to stay ahead of there, I think, is visible right now, but the performance in our operating margins in Performance Coatings, reflecting the already aggressive actions that have taken place to offset that we're very committed to this. We're going to stay very focused and we believe we'll stay ahead of the pricing here. John McNulty : Got it. Fair enough. And then maybe just as a follow-up, on the supply chain issues where either you lost some business, or couldn't meet the needs, or some of your competitors have, I guess, how should we think about the potential for share change? Is this something where you see it as temporary loss business or gain business, or is this something where it could be a little bit stickier? I guess, how should we be thinking about that as we look forward? John Morikis : I think you should look at it as we're going to win share gain during this time that there might have been some transactions, some projects or some element of a project that we might have lost, but as I mentioned just briefly a moment ago, our research is indicating the way in which we're handling this. And maybe I'll talk just briefly about that, the transparency in which we're working with our customers, the responsiveness that we're working with, our customers there have been, as Al mentioned, a little bit of a challenge in dealing with some of these customers. But we have great confidence in how we're responding and how we're dealing with our customers that lead us to believe in the customer stats scores that we're getting from our customers really indicate the fact that the way we're handling this is allowing us to come out of this with greater stickiness. The new account growth that we're experiencing right now. So, record year-to-date performance in new account activity. And we're stepping into this with customers. While we're opening new accounts with them, we're getting them at this point to try new products, and that trial in itself, down the road will lead to more projects with those customers. So, I've got great confidence that as we come out of this, you're going to see that same coiled spring that we've exited other challenging times uncoil. And we're going to accelerate that. You can see that not only in what I've talked about in the research, but as our competitors continue to close stores and close territories, and we continue to invest in a number of areas, we're going to take advantage of this market. And we actually, as difficult as these times are, these are the best times for our company. We expect to come out of this stronger. John McNulty : Great, thanks very much for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Bob Koort : Thank you. Good morning. John Morikis : Good morning Bob. Bob Koort : John, I was hoping you could help us figure out the math to get that mid-teens inflation cover. Could you tell us what your raw materials are as a percentage of your total cogs? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Bob raw materials are about 80% to 85% of our paint costs. I would tell you we need to get about a 50% price increase. 50% of the raw material increase to cover the dollars. And my expectation is that we will cover the raw material, increases dollar for dollar in the full year. A little bit behind in the first half, catch it up in the second half, but full year we'll offset, raw material increase dollar to dollar. Bob Koort : And then maybe dovetailing on John's question. I would guess as the largest paint company, certainly in North America, you did \u2013 were you able to leverage preferential supply relationships, so you had better availability, do you think than your competitors? John Morikis : Well, we work closely with our suppliers. And I think the approach that we're taking here is that many of them are in unique situations as well. We clearly have worked with our suppliers to put ourselves in a position to leverage our supply chain, working with them in a way that can accelerate our ability to serve our customers. So, on the one front from incoming raw materials, we're working closely with them. We're unique in the fact that we have our own fleet of vehicles. We have 860 tractors and 2,100 trailers that we use to expedite once we receive these raw materials into our plants. And in many cases right now, right from our plants to customer projects. So, it's the entire the entire supply chain Bob that we're working on to expedite, cut out as many days as possible and to serve our customers. And that transparency as we communicate to our customers is exactly why I mentioned earlier. We know that we're going to come out of this with share gains. Al Mistysyn : Hey, Bob. The only other thing I would add to that is really utilizing our global scale, our footprint, our global relationships to look for additional supply opportunities because, we're investing capital to have an additional 50 million gallons of capacity coming online over the next few quarters and where the demand environment is it's well above where our initial forecast for raw material supply would be coming into the season. So, as we can get additional raw materials, we'll convert those raw materials faster. And as we come out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter, you can expect we'll be building inventory. And going into the first quarter, also building additional inventory to get ready for the next selling season in 2020. Bob Koort : Great. Thanks for the help. John Morikis : Thanks Bob. Operator : The next question will be coming from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First on Performance Coatings, you all suggested that raw material inflation will be heaviest in this segment. Could you just help us gauge the magnitude of inflation in PCG versus your mid-teens company inflation guidance? And specifically in Performance Coatings, I know you're taking actions pricing actions, but when do you expect to get kind of price cost neutral on a dollar basis in that segment? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Truman, we talked about mid-teens, our industrial businesses, depending on the business would be in the high teens, maybe low 20s and then seeing some moderation in the fourth quarter. To talk about the price cost dynamic, I think, it's important to look at the first half operating margin, because it's a little bit of a goofy year last year. I think the team has done a tremendous job maintaining their first half operating margin in a significantly higher raw material cost environment in the first half. And it's the highest in the company as we've talked about. And they are working well with their customers to keep up with the strong demand while having to implement the selling price increases to offset that raw material inflation. And when you look at our first half adjusted operating margin, it's down just 10 basis points to the first half last year and down just a 40 basis points to the first half of 2019. And you put this in perspective if you look, go back to 2016, through 2018 in a raw material inflationary environment, that wasn't as significant as we're experiencing today. And our industrial operating margins declined significantly from 2016 through 2018 on a pro forma basis, including a full year of Valspar and Sherwin Williams. And then as we saw selling prices increase, and they caught up raw material inflation and raw materials, moderate, we finally started seeing operating margin expansion \u2013 in 2019. I think what's important, you asked this question at our financial community presentation and Justin answered it the right way. We have been more aggressive in getting priced into the market faster and at a higher pace than, as we've seen this raw material inflation. And we are getting leverage on a stronger volume. So along with our continuous improvement mindset and other actions that we're going to be taking, it gives us confidence in getting to the high teens to low 20s as we come out of this raw material inflation environment. So, how long this inflation lasts will dictate somewhat how long it's going to take us to get back our operating margins, but we are in a much better position today than we were in a few years ago. Truman Patterson : Okay. Okay, thanks for that. And then on the Consumer Brands Group especially, well in North America, I'm just hoping you can help us work through some of the moving parts there, the supply chain constraints which are impacting sales, you all have the divestiture, it seems like the pro side of the business is healthy in North America, consumer trying to understand how core DIY demand trended through the quarter and how it plays into your full year guide it seems like the, at least the deceleration in DIY should start to improve as we move through the quarter. Just trying to understand some of the moving parts there. John Morikis : Yes, Truman, let me just comment that we expect that DIY would return to more normal levels as the year progressed. And we were very confident in the other segments, particularly in TAG within commercial and property maintenance would more than offset that slowdown. So, yes, we took our Consumer Brands full year sales guidance down just to mid-to-high teens while taking the Americas Group up from low double digits to mid-teens. And you are absolutely right when you look at the comparison year-over-year, our second and third quarters are going to be the toughest. Our fourth quarter is going to get slightly better, but I think it's important to look at it from an architectural market perspective. I think if you look at the combined architectural business, we expected the first half to be low double digits. And we were right there with our Consumer and TAG businesses. We've said we expected our second half to be up mid-to-high single digits versus last year. And with our TAG and CBG sales guidance for the full year, second half is in that range. So, from an architectural perspective, we believe we positioned the company strategically to take advantage of the different shifts in the market to position us to capitalize on those shifts. And plus, when you look at the return of growth industrial, we're just really excited about our full year sales guidance to be up high single digits, to low double digit in a really turbulent market. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you, guys for the time and good luck in the upcoming quarter. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Truman. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. And yes, impressive results, I guess, in the face of the raw material inflation. So, I guess just, I wanted to ask about overall market growth. You continue to do really well in resi repaint and it's setting you up for, as you just noted, kind of high single to low double digits in TAG. So, I guess next year you will be facing a tougher comp there you will be facing potentially a slightly more achievable comp in DIY and consumer and performance as well. So how are you thinking about kind of ongoing sales growth in your business? I mean, are we still kind of thinking that Sherwin is in a position to grow one and a half to two times the market in TAG? And then maybe Performance is more in line with kind of industrial production and then consumer kind of settles back into kind of 3% to 4% DIY kind of range. How are you thinking about the different segments as far as growth kind of on a more midterm basis? John Morikis : Yes, Arun let me take a quick swipe here and then I'll throw it to Jim to give you some macro numbers. I would say that we absolutely agree with the projected growth rates to continue to exceed the market. And I'll remind you, you use res repaint as the tip of the spear in your conversation. We've had now five consecutive years of double-digit growth in residential repaint, we don't see that slowing down. In fact, our expectations of Heidi and our TAG organization is to continue to accelerate that growth. We're making, we believe, some terrific investments in that business stores, reps, products our digital platform a number of areas there that we continue to invest. Yes, in the face of adversity in some cases, but as I mentioned earlier, that's what we believe helps us to accelerate during these challenging times, particularly given some of the moves of our competitors. So, we're excited about the growth opportunities there to accelerate. And maybe I'll throw it to Jim to just talk about some of the macro numbers across the business. But when I look at the professional segments inside our TAG business, we're excited about each one of those. And before Jim kicks off, you also mentioned the PCG side. We have very high expectations for Justin Binns and his team. We've got some really good momentum there. Our focus here, we believe is unique. We try to bring differentiated products and solutions to our customers. And we believe that the combination of the Valspar, Sherwin technology portfolio is really starting to allow us to harvest some of the great work both companies had done individually in a way that's very unique and that's clearly visible throughout the different segments. Particularly if you look at automotive as an example, where we know that we're beating the market with the combined technology that the two companies have brought together. So, the idea of consumer reverting back into low single digits is probably a good model number to use. But we absolutely believe that our TAG and PCG businesses will be outpacing the market. Jim Jaye : Yes, to John's point about residential repaint, you think about that, I\u2019ll remind you again, that that's, while it's our largest segment and TAG, it's also the space where we have the most opportunity to gain share. So, we feel really good about residential repaint. I think if you look at some of the market data, that's out there, it's very supportive. For example, existing home sales continue to be very strong. We look at the leading indicator remodeling activity that's accelerating into 2022. The remodeling market index is all time highs right now. So resi repaint no reason for us to think that that's not going to continue to be strong. On the new residential side, you are hearing news about labor and materials being a little bit of a governor, but, I think, that could have the effect of extending that cycle. And if you just look at the raw numbers on starts, they are still a lot very significantly year-over-year, both on single family and multifamily. You\u2019ve got historically flattish mortgage rates and consumer confidence still strong in household formations that we always talk about. So, on the new resi side, very good. Commercial, just touching on that for a second, that was our second fastest growing market in the quarter. And as we\u2019ve come out of COVID, vaccines are in place, people returning to work. Commercial has a lot of momentum right now, and you\u2019re seeing other indicators like the architectural billing index, for example, that are very supportive. So, we feel very, very good there. Even property management, as people returning to travel, returning to offices, is up very nicely in the quarter. And then maybe to close out with the industrial business, we look at a lot of different indicators, as you know, there\u2019s a lot of different divisions in that segment, but the manufacturing, the PMI is up in every region. We feel very good about that. And we\u2019ve often said, in regions outside of the U.S. our opportunities are huge for market share gains. So, we feel very good about continuing to outgrow the market in TAG and in our PCG business. And as we\u2019ve said, consumers probably going to start to return to a more normal environment. John Morikis : But I would add, even on the consumer side, we are committed. We believe that we can help our customers outperform the market. So, while it might revert back more into a normalized run rate, we want, and we\u2019ll be working in and investing with our customers to help them outpace that market. And we believe that we\u2019ve aligned ourselves very well with our customers. They share that desire to continue to grow market share. And we\u2019re investing in that business and believe that we can help them outpace the market as well. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe I could ask on the capital deployment side. It sounds like you\u2019ve completed some buyback activity, but that\u2019s still going to be your main use of cash. Is that accurate outside of your internal investments? I.e., is the M&A environment still showing very high valuations that are not attractive, or maybe just comment on your uses of cash from here? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Arun. I think we\u2019ve been very consistent in our capital allocation policy. As John talked about, the strong cash generation in the first half and the return of $1.9 billion to our shareholders in dividends and buybacks. And I think I want to make a point that we don\u2019t need to make acquisitions. I think I talked about this on our financial community presentation. And you look at our growth from 2019 to 2020, we\u2019ve averaged, that\u2019s a 2.3% compounded average growth rate, or $800 million. And we grew adjusted PBT, $640 million, 77% flow-through. Our operating margin is up strong. And so, I would say, we don\u2019t have a gun to our head. We\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities, for M&A and that fits our strategy. But I think it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019ll continue to invest in our long-term organic growth opportunities. And I think that\u2019s a great way to deploy cash. We talked about the architectural capacity improvements. We have packaging capacity increases coming and others, but I think we get more leverage on the organic growth than this just purely M&A, but absent M&A, we will buy our stock back in the second half. John Morikis : And I think it\u2019s a great response. And I also do want to put a little color on the M&A strategy that Al referred to. While we don\u2019t feel as though we have a gun to our head, we do think that there are opportunities out there. And we think that there are several deals that we\u2019re working on that could be completed this year, but they\u2019re going to be disciplined deals that we can bring value to our shareholders. We\u2019re not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere. We\u2019re looking proactively for targets that as Al mentioned, fit our strategy, and those would be areas that would fill necessary geographic gaps. We\u2019re not just throwing a dart at a map here trying to figure out where we\u2019re not. We could bring technology that can be leveraged across the platform or could fill a void of other types to help us serve our customers. So, we absolutely believe that there are M&A targets out there that are a good fit that we can get at the proper value in fairness to the sellers and to our shareholders. And meanwhile, we don\u2019t feel as though we\u2019re out there just trying to buy a book of business so that we could demonstrate growth. We have growth opportunities and we\u2019re actively pursuing those organically. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks a lot. John Morikis : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning, fellas. John Morikis : Hey, Duffy. Duffy Fischer : First question is just around raw materials and this spikes a little bit different than just a straight supply demand tightening with the freeze in COVID. Is this doing anything to change your strategy on how you want to source raw materials, either integrating upstream more yourself to do more of the resins, diversifying producers, diversifying geographies? Should we expect to see any meaningful change structurally on that side? John Morikis : No, Duffy. We have a terrific and experienced team in both procurement and in technical, as well as our supply chain. And as you would expect with veterans that have 25-plus years of experience, we\u2019re looking at a lot of things differently. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s anything that we want to talk about right now. I don\u2019t think structurally you have to be concerned from a capital standpoint that we\u2019re changing the model of the business, but that you should expect and our customers should expect us to be thinking about how to protect them going forward, and we\u2019ll be taking those necessary steps. But I don\u2019t think that on a public call like this, we want to define what those steps are. Duffy Fischer : Fair enough. And then can you talk about both your ability and your customer\u2019s ability to attract new talent to hire people as we\u2019re growing into this, and then what you\u2019re seeing on labor inflation? John Morikis : Yes. I\u2019d say we have seen a slight uptick in some wage areas, some pressure, where we feel that pressure. We\u2019re taking the steps to secure what we believe to be our most important resource, our people. I\u2019ll remind you that we have a terrific turnover rate between 7% and 8% on average. So, we recruit and hire the right talent. We train them, we give them the resources to win, and then they become the reason for our success and we\u2019re very proud of our team. As a result of that and the fact that they have success in their career path, our people tend to stay. In fact, over a third of our employees have 10 or more years with the company and we think that\u2019s very important. So, while we\u2019re making some adjustments where necessary, we believe that they\u2019re the right investments to make. And we do believe that as a result of this retention, we\u2019re able to respond with experienced employees that can serve their customers. As far as the materiality of the moves that we\u2019re making to respond to this pressure, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s material in the sense from a modeling perspective, but we are taking the steps necessary. And in some cases, making the financial moves to recruit and retain the talent that we need. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thanks guys. John Morikis : Thank you, Duffy. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Mike Sison : Hey, guys. It sounds like the price of the paint can is going to be a lot higher this year and maybe the highest it\u2019s ever been. Just curious, given how high the inflationary environment has been, if our materials do fall, why do you feel? But it sounds like you feel pretty good that that you\u2019ll keep that pricing level and margins could expand really exponentially versus what we\u2019ve seen historically. And then any worries that that the price of the paint can is \u2013 could cause some demand destruction given? I know it\u2019s not the biggest part of a paint project, but just any thoughts there. John Morikis : Mike, I think what\u2019s important to remember is that the cost or the cost of the paint in a total project is a relatively small percentage, 80% to 85% of the painters\u2019 costs is in their labor. And so, we\u2019re moving and developing innovative products to help them offset that labor costs. And while many of them are able to hire and secure the talent that they need, many are bringing on new unskilled people in training them. And so, the cost of a good gallon of paint that can help them produce a nice finished product that their customers will enjoy, overall, it\u2019s relatively small percentage of their cost of goods. So, they are responding I think favorably to higher quality products. And just a moment ago, I talked about our labor and our willingness to hire, recruit and retain that talent and in some cases paying a little bit more. And we have to consider that as well as our labor as well as our customers. We look at that cost of the retention that I just described, and that gets factored into all the pricing decisions that we make. Our painting contractors are doing the same. And so, we\u2019re trying to offset some of their costs, the painters with higher efficient projects, through quality of products. And while we\u2019re trying to do the same to our customers, as we\u2019re experiencing some labor cost increases, we\u2019re trying to offset that with efficiencies in our plant, in our stores to minimize the impact of labor in price increases that we\u2019re out there seeking. Al Mistysyn : And Mike, we do believe we\u2019re in a similar environment that we were facing in 2010 through 2012, where we had to implement six price increases in a 22-month period that offset the significant raw material increases. But we continued to invest in our long-term growth opportunities, adding 160-plus new stores, adding over 260 reps in our North America paint stores over that three-year period as well as other customer solutions. And we did see the benefit in top line and bottom line as raw materials moderated from 2010 through 2016. North America paint stores grew volume high-single digits, which was a multiple of the market, and segment operating margin grew over \u2013 almost 700 basis points. And on a consolidated basis, we grew by a high-single-digit percentage and EBITDA margin increased almost 500 basis points. We expect to see similar types of results as we come out of this, but I think the key there is we continue to invest. So, we\u2019re willing to accept a little less leverage on SG&A, including in our second half this year. But I think it\u2019s important that we show our customers that in good and difficult times we\u2019re investing in their business to make them successful. Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. John Morikis : Mike, I\u2019m absolutely shocked that your first question wasn\u2019t about the Guardian name. You let me down there. Thanks for calling. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. David Begleiter : Thank you. John, Al, on our last question, if you just go back to that 2010-2012 time period, did we retain the entirety of those price increases when raw started coming off? Al Mistysyn : Let\u2019s say we retained the majority of them, David. As our customer base, especially you look at our largest segment, I\u2019ll use an example of residential repaint. Cost of a gallon of paint is 10% of their costs. And once they get those costs into their bids, they can pass that on. And especially, as John talked about moving customers up to higher quality products. And we do see a trend when we\u2019re in an inflationary environment that customers move to a higher quality product to get the benefits of the efficiencies, which way far outweighs the cost of that gallon of paint, even when you compare it to what they were using previously to the current product. So, we do expect to retain a majority of the price, not just on architectural, but also on industrial side of our business. John Morikis : But I think the important metric that we track closely is our ability to help our customers make more money. So, in that process, our entire focus \u2013 when you look at the investments that we\u2019re making, the services that we\u2019re providing, every gauge that we have, every resource that we do, it always ends up with are we helping you make more money. And that\u2019s an important metric in our decision-making. David Begleiter : Understood. And just on the price impact on the back half of the year, I think you gave us the expectation for TAG, but what are you expecting or how should we look at Consumer Brands\u2019 and Performance Coatings\u2019 price mix expectations in the back half of the year? John Morikis : As we\u2019ve talked about, David, it\u2019s a little harder to kind of look at the different businesses because even within the different categories within consumer, but you would expect to see a similar, right, you would expect to see a similar range within Consumer and a higher range in PCG just because of the raw material basket being higher on our industrial businesses. And it\u2019s just timing on industrial, as you know TAG is more uniformed and timing-wise when they go outprice, whereas in our industrial businesses by business by region are staggered across different timelines, but you could expect to see a higher cadence for our industrial businesses in the second half. David Begleiter : Got it. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. Unlike some of your peers when this inflationary environment really started escalate, you made the decision to basically send the message to your pro contractors that you weren\u2019t going to raise price for a few months. Was that decision to drive loyalty being that many of them had already won contracts and had a price assumption in those contracts and so forth? Was that part of that decision? And if so, do you think that it was successful? Do you think that you gained market share among that pro contractor customer base because of that decision? John Morikis : Yes, with great certainty. And I would do that 100% of the time. I do it again tomorrow. And if we have to in the future, we\u2019d likely take the same approach. Our loyalty and our ability to even execute the effective price increase with our customers increases dramatically as a result of that, so, without question. Steve Byrne : And John, you also made a comment earlier about backlog from your contractors was robust. Can you quantify that? Do you have data that would compare that backlog today versus say where it was a couple of years ago? Is it meaningfully different? John Morikis : We do. We have a CRM system that we use, proprietor we built and we do keep an eye on that. It is a very strong period in backlog and we\u2019re not going to share any more detail on the specifics, but I speak with great confidence in the backlog. Steve Byrne : Thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you. John, in your prepared remarks, you made a comment that new account activity is up nearly 30% in the first half of the year. Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to long-term historical averages, for example? And is there any way to translate that level, record level of new account activity into what it might mean for future volumes or future share gains, for example? John Morikis : I\u2019ll give you a little color. We\u2019re not going to get into any specifics on the metrics or conversion, but I would tell you that it is a very high, very high number in comparison. I would say that our teams, our TAG leadership all the way through to those that are closest to our customers are doing a fantastic job. And one of the questions has to be how are you doing this given some of the shortages in raw materials. And the fact is, is that we\u2019ve been very open with our approach compared to our competitors. And we were out early with transparency. I\u2019d think many of our competitors were in denial. At first some of our competitors were asking, why no one else is telling me that. In fact, some of them said it might be a week or two. And we were out with very truthful with our customers as to what we expect. And I give our procurement team and our supply chain team great credit for the courage that it took to come in to this boardroom that we\u2019re in today and explain how this was going to fall out and how quickly our commercial teams took that to the market, face-to-face with our customers with full transparency to help them run their business. And the reason that I say that and why I think that\u2019s important is that while many of our competitors were in this denial and may have felt that they were going to be at a competitive advantage for whatever reason, ultimately from a customer\u2019s perspective they lost credibility. And our teams now are out talking to customers who may in the past have had loyalty that kept them from using other suppliers. Suddenly we\u2019re getting \u2013 the phones getting answered and we\u2019re helping our people to be in front of those customers that offer that terrific opportunity. Now, as I mentioned, right now we might be just simply in the trial mode because the supply chain issues are real and we\u2019re taking care of our existing customers with great focus. And we\u2019re able to talk to these new customers about the alternate supply and the importance of that and getting them to try product. In some cases, it\u2019s simply in the back of our own stores, and some cases, it\u2019s one room on a project, but we know with great certainty that this is the most important step in the process. And this trial is an exciting step and we look forward to a greater conversion going forward. So earlier I was asked, do we feel as though we\u2019re going to come out of this with market share gains. And I hope everyone heard the confidence in which I answered that because I\u2019ve got terrific respect for our leadership team and all the way down to the part-timers that are in our store, that are in front of these customers, introducing new products and new solutions that are going to help these customers make more money. And we\u2019re determined to do just that. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you for that. My second question relates to Performance Coatings. If we look across the major categories there, packaging, wood, coil, refinish, general industrial, et cetera, can you give us a sense for which of those businesses have grown the most versus pre-pandemic levels and which might remain the most depressed, such that you have more potential for rebound going forward? John Morikis : That\u2019s a really interesting question. I\u2019d say that the way I might answer that is that we see terrific growth in all of them. If I may, I could just spin through those quickly. In the packaging business, we do believe that the unique technology that we\u2019ve brought to market will help us to continue to grow. Al mentioned the CapEx that we\u2019re putting into this business. We are investing along with our customers in additional capacity, and we think that our V70 is a very unique product. It\u2019s a plug and \u2013 a product with plug and play performance. It\u2019s easily adopted onto existing can-making equipment and helps our customers with speed. So, the efficiency of the application is terrific. It gives great flavor protection to products, both food and beverage, and it\u2019s really the next generation of the non-BPA technology. So, it\u2019s \u2013 and I\u2019m taking packaging first and getting into a little bit more depth because while it\u2019s easy to talk to that model, it\u2019s the same model that we\u2019re using in every segment to help differentiate our teams from our competitors. So, when you look at GI as an example or industrial wood, we\u2019re looking at not only the technology, but the supply chain, how do we take \u2013 the time that it takes to get product and whittle that down to what might have been weeks into days. And instead of thousands of gallons of required orders to 50 gallons or 100 gallons to put them in business faster with less working capital. Our coil businesses are doing a fantastic job of introducing technology and speed. Our automotive, I talked earlier about the combined technologies between the Sherwin and Valspar technology. That\u2019s helping throughput with each of their customers to be able to be more productive. In our protective and marine business to get assets more \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, to get assets back in play faster. So, when you asked that question, quite honestly, it\u2019s hard to answer which offers the greatest opportunities. If Justin Binns was in the room with me right now, I\u2019d look him in the eye and I\u2019d tell him I have expectations for every one of those businesses to grow and grow excessively and at the expense of our competitors. That\u2019s what I would tell them. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning or good afternoon, I should say. John Morikis : Hey, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: And I\u2019m looking at the industrial businesses so far of two of your competitors and their margins are much lower. Your margins kind of held up. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re presumably impacted by the same shortages of raw materials like epoxies and isocyanides. Is your impact likely to be delayed into 3Q or are there other factors that offset your raw material impact? John Morikis : I think I\u2019ll start and maybe turn it to Al if I miss anything. I think part of it is mix of business. We\u2019ve been very selective in our strategy on what we pursue. And we pursue businesses that are interested in coatings and solutions that will help them make more money, not necessarily just commodities. So, you\u2019re not going to see us in areas where it\u2019s just that commodities. So, we\u2019ve actually walked away from some of those businesses and we\u2019ve focused on areas that are more high value. So, we often talk about bridge and highway, you\u2019re going to see us on the high-value bridge area as an example as opposed to other areas that are just low-margin commodities. And I think that plays an important part in the alignment and our approach is just that. We want to be partners with our customers, help them to be more successful. And in return, they understand that our ability to serve them and make them successful comes at a cost to us and our shareholders and we\u2019re sharing that reward. Al, anything else you\u2019d like to add to that? Al Mistysyn : The only thing I would say, P.J., is we would expect to see sequential improvement in our Performance Coatings segment operating margin through the second half. Even though we\u2019re going to go up against a tougher comp second half versus the first half, it\u2019s still we\u2019re seeing strong volume as our sales return to a more \u2013 what I would say a more consistent or normal levels quarter-to-quarter. So, our full-year sales guidance of up low 20s percentage implies that back half in the high teens. We talked about the third quarter being up high teens to low 20s. So \u2013 and it\u2019s about the strong volume getting leverage on SG&A, but it\u2019s also the commitment that this team has made to getting price into the market timely and aggressively to offset those raw material \u2013 that raw material inflation. And like I said earlier, this is not \u2013 we learned a lot in 2016, 2017, 2018 that, that this team is now delivering on and executing from that learning. So, I think we\u2019re doing a great job. John Morikis : I\u2019m not going to revisit that. Al Mistysyn : No. P.J. Juvekar: Great. Great. And then my second question is, can you talk about your digital efforts that may have accelerated through the pandemic? How much of your contractor customers are ordering online and getting the paint delivered to the job site? Thank you. John Morikis : Yes, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re seeing strong utilization and I would say an increase in all the metrics in the categories that we track. And the platform, I\u2019d say, is providing a service option that makes our pros more efficient in utilizing all our resources. So unlike others who might be trying a digital platform as the model, ours is unique and that it brings everything to bear. So, we want our customers utilizing our stores, our reps, and the platform and we believe that the model that we have is very unique and how it encapsulates all of that into one offering. This platform that we \u2013 so we\u2019re not going to talk specifically about sales on platform \u2013 on the digital platform versus in the store or by phone or through the rep. Quite frankly, we don\u2019t discriminate against any of those orders. We\u2019ll take them all. We want them utilizing any resource every platform that they feel as comfortable. What we\u2019re trying to do is make it easier for them. So, this digital platform will allow them access to their pricing, their projects, their orders and they can conduct business with us 24/7 through the platform. And if they prefer to come into the store and have a cup coffee with their best friend behind the counter, we encourage that as well. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, P.J. Operator : The next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. John Roberts : Thank you. John, on the Guardians, I don\u2019t think Cloverdale/Rodda uses the Guardian brand at all in Ohio, so maybe there is an opportunity there. John Morikis : Yes. There might be. I don\u2019t know about that. Only that where do the Guardians go, John? Now, they came from John Roberts, not John Morikis, everyone. John Roberts : Okay. Is it unusual in the June quarter for interior to be larger than exterior? And was that a mix headwind in the quarter since exterior is typically more expensive than interior? John Morikis : No, John, I would say kind of that mix return to a more normal level. I think typically we start off interior and exterior maybe 4 to 1 in the out quarters, where the exterior in the Midwest and East are less prevalent. And then as you get to the two middle quarters, it trends to closer to 3 to 1 to 2.5 to 1. And I think we ended the quarter closer to 2.5 to 1 on volume. John Roberts : Okay. And then trucking constraints were cited as a big headwind by some of your competitors. Were you able to use the trucking fleet in many different ways here to help mitigate the shortage of that? I know you pick up some of your raw materials that you distribute, but I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re able to pick up other raw materials and somehow mitigate freight as an issue? John Morikis : Yes, we were. And we plan to continue to use them as creatively as possible, just as we do every asset. And John, this has given us an opportunity and we have a terrific leader in Joe Sladek that runs our Global Supply Chain, whose team has been really creative. So, it\u2019s not just the tractors and trailers, which is a great question that you\u2019re asking, but we\u2019re using our distribution centers or that manufacturing, our stores, everything in a very unique fashion. And some of this has been on the fly and we\u2019ve continued to improve in our ability to do that. And again, we\u2019ll come out of this better as a result that we\u2019re learning a lot about our supply chain and our ability is to be able to leverage it. And we\u2019ll will be better coming out of this as a result. John Roberts : Okay. Thank you. Nice quarter. John Morikis : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Mike Harrison : Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk about the consumer strength that you were seeing in Europe and Asia. Is that a product of DIY remaining stronger for longer in those regions or were the comps easier? I also know that you\u2019ve made some changes in your strategic approach to those international markets, but maybe comment on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of demand trends internationally in the consumer business. John Morikis : John \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Mike, I did say that it\u2019s a little bit of everything. Certainly, the region particularly in China, if you look at the double-digit decline in 2000 [ph] largely related to COVID, it had an impact on us. I will point out that we did improve profits, even in that kind of environment. So, in China, we continue to focus on the volume growth with the recovery further defining our operating model in that region. We had a strong half in 2021. We\u2019re not going to give guidance by business, but this is, as I\u2019ve said before, an area that we\u2019re looking long term. I wouldn\u2019t suspect that next quarter this business is going to move the needle one way or the other. But if you look next decade, it might. And so that\u2019s the way we\u2019re running this business and we have expectations for Brian Padden and his team to continue to really drive through the strategic decisions that we\u2019re making there. And we\u2019re looking long term there. In Europe, I\u2019d say we continue to build around our Kingfisher relationship. The team in Europe has delivered a double-digit increase in 2020, so comparisons are a little bit more challenging here in 2021. And we did have a very strong start in 2021. We have terrific leaders here in Europe, one of whom we just brought to the U.S. to take a very important role for us. He did such a wonderful job there and very strong leader. And again, speaks to the depth, we have a leader who is going to backfill him, that\u2019s very strong as well. So, I think both of these businesses are relatively small in nature, but good opportunities for us and we\u2019re managing accordingly. Mike Harrison : All right. Thanks. And then I also wanted to ask about inventory levels at big-box retailers. If we were able to look at the point-of-sale data, is that pretty similar to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the consumer business revenue decline? Are you seeing retailers still working to restock or is there actually some destocking happening as the DIY demand is normalizing? John Morikis : Mike, I\u2019d prefer that our customers talk to their plans as it relates to inventory. I will say that we are working hard and will be working hard to the balance of the year to continue to improve our ability to serve them. So, it\u2019s a very important focus of ours. Al mentioned the incremental investments that we\u2019ve made to bring on about 50 million gallons of capacity. That certainly will help this business as well. But as it relates to their inventory decisions and what they do, I don\u2019t know that, that\u2019s appropriate for us to comment on. But I would tell you that we\u2019re working hard to be able to continue to improve our position with them should they decide to pull in more inventory going forward. Mike Harrison : All right. Thanks very much. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Vincent Andrews : Hi, thanks. Just \u2013 point, in the past you\u2019ve talked about equipment sales in the stores business as a potential indicator of backlog. Is that trending in line with your expectations or is anything reflecting in that? John Morikis : Yes, it is double-digit growth. We speak \u2013 we think it speaks to the confidence that our painters have. So, we\u2019re excited about it. Yes. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And actually just \u2013 any issues with any customers coming to you about labor availability, the season just given kind of hearing that across the board, or anything with the painters? John Morikis : Yes, I\u2019d say labor continues to be a discussion in nearly every market that I\u2019ve been in. As Jim mentioned in one of his responses, we feel as though that is serving as a bit of a governor. And I\u2019ll point out that while labor is an issue, I believe every professional segment in TAG had a double-digit gain. So, they\u2019re finding a way to continue to grow but it is an issue. And again, all of these challenges, all of this adversity, we don\u2019t ask for this adversity, but it does play to our advantage. It does allow us to serve our customers in a way that helps them through these challenges. If they run short on people or have to move from one project to other \u2013 another, any of that turmoil on the part of our customer, please write to the rep that\u2019s there, working with that customer or the store manager locally that has the capability to serve that customer. So labor is an issue. It\u2019s one of many and we try to work with our customers in a way that can help them make more money working through it. Vincent Andrews : Appreciate it. Thanks very much. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. My question was on the comp sales trend. If you look at the deceleration, I think it was from 16% to your \u2013 to around 12% in the second quarter, is that really all just the supply availability of raws? Was that the main reason for the deceleration? Al Mistysyn : You\u2019re talking on TAG, Greg, correct? Greg Melich : Yes, talking on TAG, specifically, the two-year stack. Al Mistysyn : Yes, I think part of it is we\u2019ve had a tougher comp. If you look at our \u2013 if you look at the way our 2019 unfolded, we kind of had a better second quarter. And then when you look at the way we had 2020, we had headwinds in the second quarter. Yes, we talked about a 3.4% headwind in raw material availability in our second quarter that impacted us. So, it\u2019s kind of a \u2013 I hate to use the term wonky, but the way the two-year stack came out, it was kind of a little bit wonky. And you look at two-year \u2013 first half 2021 versus first half 2019 up 14%, and some prices for that, but it\u2019d be primarily volume. Greg Melich : Got it. So then maybe the second, the follow-on to that is if we look at your guidance, it looks like you\u2019re expecting that two-year trend to reaccelerate maybe not all the way back to 2016, but get back a couple of 100 basis points so then stocks get better and as pricing goes through, is that fair? Al Mistysyn : Yes, there is that and I think if you looked at it on the pro segment would even be a little bit better John Morikis : Yes, we expect to gain share. Greg Melich : Got it. That\u2019s great. Thanks. Good luck, guys. John Morikis : Thanks, Greg. Operator : The next question is from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your questions. Adam Baumgarten : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just one quick one from me. Just if you look at your commercial business in TAG, can you maybe walk through some of the kind of end market verticals and what was strongest, what was maybe still struggling, that would be helpful? John Morikis : Yes, I'd say we're seeing strength in quite a few areas. The hospitality area, schools, tilt-up, warehousing is really going well. Trying to think of areas that are really soft. Nothing comes to my mind, truly in areas that are really soft, I'd say, they're all growing in \u2013 lot of tilt-up, lot of warehousing, lot of expansion, medical, healthcare is expanding, some just more than others, Adam. Adam Baumgarten : Got it. Thanks. Appreciate it. John Morikis : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your questions. Garik Shmois : Great, thanks. Just one from me. Just, are you seeing any early signs of the impact of the Delta variant, any change in how homeowners are inviting in contractors or pro painters? John Morikis : No. Our res repaint business is \u2013 it\u2019s really hot and we\u2019ve not seen that at all. Garik Shmois : Thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your questions. Eric Bosshard : Thank you. Two things. First of all, that to your consumer growth improves in the second half somewhat notably relative to the second quarter, what\u2019s different in the second half in that business or what was more of a drag in 2Q that doesn\u2019t persist in the second half? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Eric. I think the raw material availability impacted us when I said evenly \u2013 3.4% on a consolidated, pretty evenly on a dollar that does impact consumer a little bit more. So, we\u2019d expect to see a little bit better progress or a little less headwind there. As they\u2019re chasing raw material cost pricing and higher pricing in their second half or our second quarter will be realized. And I think what we expect as we bring more capacity on and we get more raw materials, we\u2019ll be able to supply our customers in a better fashion. Eric Bosshard : Okay, thank you. And then secondly, John, you talked about price leadership in stores and great not surprising to see that. The question is in regards to realization. Seeing it\u2019s a unique period of inflation with raws, can there be a path to upside realization on these price increases relative to the historic amount of realization or does the realizations schedule look like it has in years past, even though it\u2019s a different period of time? John Morikis : Eric, it might. I mean, I\u2019d say, our approach to the pricing has been very well received by our customers and the response that I said earlier about 100% of the times I would do this exactly as we rolled it out. So, it could, but there is also a lot of pressure in the market right now. So, what we\u2019re trying to do is put our teams in a position to be able to serve their customers, to help facilitate that price effectiveness. And we\u2019ll see. I mean, we\u2019re going to work hard at it, but I can\u2019t with 100% certainty tell you that I could project that number. I could tell you that we\u2019re working very hard to work with our customers to help them to be successful and in turn, our shareholders are rewarded. That\u2019s our model. Eric Bosshard : Great. Thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your questions. Kevin Hocevar : Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. On the \u2013 Al, I wanted to revisit \u2013 I think you had mentioned that you have an expectation of price cost to be neutral for the full year with tailwinds in the back half offsetting the headwinds in the first half. Given the inflation you\u2019re expecting in 3Q and kind of the timing of pricing phasing in, is the third quarter still a drag on that or you\u2019d expect that to get to neutral and kind of basically all the benefits coming in the fourth quarter? Or how do you expect that to kind of phase in? And then I guess I just wanted to reconcile those comments with \u2013 I believe you guys also mentioned that gross margins in the back half of the year should be \u2013 you expect those to be weaker than the front half. So why would that be given if price cost should be a nice tailwind in the front half versus the headwind in the \u2013 sorry, nice tailwind in the back half versus the headwind in the front half? Al Mistysyn : Yes, I think, Kevin, you will start getting on top of it in the third quarter, not only in the TAG price increase that was announced, but across all the businesses in segments. We\u2019ll start getting on top of it and then pick up more ground in the fourth quarter. The comparison gets much more difficult in our second half, if you look at adjusted gross margin in our first half 2020 was 46.9%, it grows to 47.8% in the second half. So, you have that headwind. And also, you have our customer mix. As I talked about before, when we look at the combined architectural businesses, DIY starts returning to more normal levels, and a question last year I answered, that was about a basis \u2013 100-basis points impact on our last year numbers that we saw. More so starting in the second quarter, but more so in the second half that as that returns to more normal, that\u2019ll be a headwind. So that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see as much traction as you would think in our second half on gross margin. Kevin Hocevar : Okay. That make sense. And then the sales that are \u2013 you mentioned that we\u2019re lost to 3% \u2013 3.5 or so percent in the quarter, do you view those as deferred that could be made up in future periods or do you view those more as being lost? Al Mistysyn : Yes, believe they\u2019re deferred. I think the projects are there. John talked a lot about the demand and the strength we\u2019re seeing there across all the segments. So, I think the teams in the field are working very closely with our customers and moving products around, but I think that\u2019s deferred, not lost necessarily. Kevin Hocevar : Okay. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call over to John Morikis for closing remarks. John Morikis : Yes. Thank you. And first, let me just start by reminding everyone that Jim and Eric will be available for the rest of day and tomorrow if you have some questions. I did ask for the opportunity to close out today\u2019s call just to pull out a couple of really important points, at least in my mind. First, that we\u2019re really proud of the terrific first half that we\u2019ve had, but we\u2019re not complacent. This isn\u2019t an organization that pops corks over what\u2019s happened. We\u2019re more focused on what has to happen. So, we\u2019re determined to continue to get better, but we\u2019re really pleased with the first half. So, I want to thank our teams for the wonderful work that they\u2019re doing. We are in a strong market with terrific demand and our goal is to outpace that demand in the market with growth that exceeds the market\u2019s position. We do believe we\u2019re positioned to capitalize on this demand, wherever it presents itself. I mentioned earlier about the utilization of our assets, if it\u2019s our factories, our stores, our reps, our digital platform, the fleet that we talked about, we do believe we\u2019re uniquely positioned and very determined. We are experiencing these raw material cost increases from an industry-wide availability issue and we think that this team of leaders that we have who have been experienced with similar cycles, it may have been natural disasters or financial crisis, COVID, whatever it might be, now here with raw materials that this seasoned and experienced team knows what to do and have the conviction to do it and we\u2019re proud of them. All of this has us confident in our ability to come through this with greater market share, as I mentioned earlier, stronger relationships and better positioned for future growth. And so, we\u2019re excited. This is a challenging year, but we\u2019re excited about our position and our ability to leverage this challenging year in the shareholder value and growth for our company. Lot of determination to do it. So, thank you all for your interest in our company, know that where we\u2019re out here determined to do better and convinced that we can. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company 's review of third quarter 2021 results, and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2021. With us on today's call are John Morikis, Chairman, President and CEO, Al Mistysyn, CFO. Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller, and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President Investor Relations and Communications. This Conference Call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www. sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www. sherwin.com beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward looking statements as defined under U.S. Federal Securities Laws with respect to sales, earnings, and other matters. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the Company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the Company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Sherwin-Williams remained focused in the third quarter on solving customer challenges, combating rising costs with pricing and investing for future growth in a difficult and highly fluid environment that is impacting the entire coatings industry. Demand remained generally robust, but raw material inflation remained persistently high and raw material availability failed to improve. While these conditions challenged our quarterly results, we continue to strengthen our customer relationships and take actions that strongly positioned us for the long term. We're confident in the demand outlook and even more confident in our strategy, our people, and our position in the market. Let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers. All comparisons in our prepared commentary this morning are to the third quarter of 2020, unless otherwise specified. Starting with the top line, third quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 0.5% to $5.15 billion. Raw material availability negatively impacted sales by an estimated high single-digit percentage with about 75% of the impact in The Americas Group. The remaining impact was largely in the Consumer Brands Group with an immaterial impact to Performance Coatings Group. Consolidated gross margin decreased 630 basis points to 41.6% driven by lower sales volume. Raw material caused inflation outpacing our price increases near-term, and supply chain inefficiencies. SG&A expense decreased 2.7% in dollars and decreased 90 basis points to 26.6% as a percent of sales. Consolidated profit before tax decreased $264.1 million or 30.2% to $611.5 million. The third quarters of 2021 and 2020 included $70.3 million and $76.4 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense, respectively. Excluding these items, consolidated profit before tax decreased 28.4% to $681.8 million diluted net income per share in the quarter decreased to a $1.88 per share from $2.55 per share a year ago. The third quarters of 2021 and 2020, both included acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.21 per share. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 24.3% to $2.09 per share from $2.76 per share. EBITDA was $834.2 million in the quarter or 16.2% of sales. Net operating cash grew to $2.1 billion or 13.5% of sales in the first nine months of 2021. Moving on to our operating segments, Despite strong demand, sales in The Americas Group decreased 0.4% as volume and mid-single-digit selling price increases could not fully offset the decrease related to raw material availability. Segment margin decreased 3.8% points to 21.3% resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases. Segment SG&A remained basically flat year-over-year in dollars and as a percent of sales, as we continued investing in strategic growth initiatives. Sales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 22.8% against a very strong comparison a year ago. The decrease included approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture, lower volume, and the negative impact from raw material availability, partially offset by selling price increases. Adjusted segment margin decreased 11.7% points to 14.7% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume, higher raw material, and supply chain inefficiencies, partially offset by selling price increases, and good sales and marketing cost control. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 17.4% driven by volume, price increases, and favorable currency exchange. Adjusted segment margin decreased 5.5% points to 10. 5% of sales. As operating leverage from the higher volume, selling price increases and good cost control were more than offset by higher raw material costs, where inflation was the highest among the Company's three operating segments. Let me now turn the call over to John Morikis for additional commentary on the third quarter and our year-to-date, along with our guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Jim. And good morning everyone. Let me begin by reiterating the themes we provided on our September 29 update call. First, the demand environment remains robust across our pro-architectural and industrial end markets. Many external indicators and more importantly, our customers, remain highly positive. Demand is not the issue. Second, we're ready to meet this demand. We continue to invest in growth initiatives. We have significant production capacity available today, and we are bringing 50 million gallons of incremental architectural production capacity online over the next two quarters. Our capabilities are not the issue. The issue that impacted our third quarter and have persisted in October continue to be industry-wide raw material availability constraints and inflation. Let me be very clear on how we are responding. Nobody has more assets and capabilities and Sherwin-Williams. We're employing all of these to keep customers in paint and on-the-job, better than our competitors. We will continue to focus on customer solutions. We are aggressively combating raw material Inflation with significant pricing actions across each of our businesses. We implemented multiple price increases in the quarter. We will continue to do so as necessary. We continue to work closely with our suppliers on solutions to improve availability sooner rather than later. At the same time, we're exploring every avenue to better control our own destiny going forward, including our recent announcement to acquire Specialty Polymers Inc. There is no shortage of confidence on our team, which is deep and experienced. My deep thanks goes to all 61,000 members of our global family. We fully expect we will emerge from these current challenges a stronger Company with stronger customer relationships and with continued strong value creation for our shareholders. In just a moment, I'll add some color to Jim's third quarter results summary. But first, I'd like to make a comment on our results year-to-date. While events largely outside of our control have forced us to adjust our expectations, we have still delivered a solid performance. 2021 year-to-date consolidated sales were up 9.4% or $1.31 billion. Despite high-teens raw material inflation, adjusted PBT increased 1.5% or $33.1 million, and adjusted diluted net income per share increased 4.8% to $6.80 per share. Adjusted EBITDA is $2.73 billion or 18% of consolidated sales. Operator : Even in this unusual environment, we've continued to make investments that will drive our momentum over the long term. And we're confident we will see significant margin expansion, as availability and inflation headwinds eventually subside. Now, returning to segment performance in the third quarter. In the Americas Group, raw material availability challenges were a significant drag on sales. The good news is that underlying demand remains sound and reported backlogs are strong. We expect growth rates will improve significantly commensurate with the improvement in the industry supply chain. Sales growth in the third quarter was led by Protective and Marine, which was up by high-single-digit percentage. John Morikis : We're seeing good demand in this business from customers in oil and gas flooring and steel fabrication markets. Tag's largest business, residential repaint grew by a low single-digit percentage against a strong double-digit comparison. As industry supply chain issues are resolved, we would expect this business to return to its prior growth levels, where we've delivered double-digit growth for the last five-years. New residential sales increased by a low single-digit percentage. New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer. And our customers are reporting solid order rates. We're seeing a number of projects being pushed out as a variety of building materials beyond paint are in short supply. Property management was up slightly in the quarter. Improving apartment terms along with return to travel, the workplace, and school are tailwinds that should support higher growth when raw material availability improves. Our commercial business was down slightly in the quarter. Similar to new residential projects are taking longer to reach the painting phase due to short supply of multiple building materials. And finally, as expected, our DIY business was down double-digits versus an extremely difficult comparison, which was exacerbated by the raw material availability issues. From a product perspective, interior paint sales performed better than exterior sales with interior being a larger part of the mix. We realized a mid-single-digit increase in price in the third quarter resulting from our February 1 and August 1 price increases and our mid-September surcharge. would expect the combination of these pricing actions to result in a high single-digit percentage price realization,in the fourth quarter. Putting our full-year price realization for TAG in the mid-single-digit range. We will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed. We've opened 50 net new stores year-to-date. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce, and productivity enhancing services. We are not taken our foot off the gas on these growth initiatives. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group, sale decreased by a double-digit percentage driven by difficult comparisons to the prior year, consumers returning to the workplace, raw material availability issues, and the divestiture of the wild business. Overall, the out-wide demand continued to moderate to more normal levels compared to 2020. This was partially offset by growth in the North American pros who paint category, which was up strong double-digits in the quarter and year-to-date. While sales are down in all regions, sales were less impacted in North America, our largest region, compared to Europe and Asia, where COVID restrictions were more impactful. Pricing was positive in the quarter. Though below the level of the Americas Group. As you know, our global supply chain Organization has managed within this segment, this team continues to work with suppliers to navigate the industry-wide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by winter storm Uri and Hurricane Ida. We stand ready with ample capacity and are adding more to serve customers at a higher level as raw material availability improves. Last, let me comment on the third quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. We continue to see momentum as this is the fifth straight quarter of growth for this business. Group sales increased by more than 17% in the quarter, including a currency translation tailwind of 2%. Price was in the high single-digit range and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in Europe and Latin America, followed by North America and Asia. Every division in the group grew, the majority by double-digits, driven by robust underlying demand, new customer wins and share of wallet gains. I will start with packaging, which generated strong double-digit growth against a high single-digit comparison last year. Sales were up double-digits in every region. Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust, and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction within existing and new customers. Indexes general industrial, the largest division with the group, which posted its third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. Sales were up double-digits in every region. Sales were strong across most of our customer segments, led by heavy equipment, containers and general finishing. Our coil coatings business remains a consistent performer. Sales grew by a double-digit percentage for the second consecutive quarter and were positive in all regions. This team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions. Construction and appliances led the growth. Automotive refinish sales increased by mid-single digit percentage. Miles driven are nearing pre -pandemic levels. New installations of our products and systems in North America remained strong. Industrial would division generated low single-digit growth. Growth in North America, our largest region, was up strong double-digits. That was offset by Asia-Pacific, where COVID related shutdowns had a significant negative impact on sales. New residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring, and furniture applications. Before moving to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation year-to-date. We've returned a little over $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We have invested $2.1 billion to purchase 8.075 million shares at an average price of $265.88.We distributed $442.9 million in dividends, an increase of 20.4%. We also invested $248 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $36 million for our Building Our Future projects. We ended the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. We also announced that the Sica and Specialty Polymer acquisitions, which are expected to close in early 2022, if not sooner. Turning to our outlook, we expect robust demand to continue in North American pro architectural end markets. We expect DIY demand to continue normalizing as consumers return to the workplace. We expect industrial demand to remain strong. Raw material availability challenges will remain a headwind in the fourth quarter, but the situation is improving. We believe, we have weathered the worst of Hurricane Ida and supply should continue to come back online. We expect to be in a make-in-shift mode and do not anticipate building any inventory until the first quarter of 2022. On the cost side of the equation, our raw material inflation expectations for the year moved up to the low 20% range from the high teens, given additional pressure, we've seen since our last guidance. We'll not seeing any meaningful improvement until well into 2022. All businesses remain aggressive in implementing price increases as necessary to offset these costs. We recognize that the timing of price realization will continue to put pressure on margins in the near-term. And as we've said many times, we expect margin expansion over the long term and maintain our gross margin target in the 45% to 48% range. Against this backdrop, we anticipate fourth quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will be up by a mid to high single-digit percentage compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect the Americas Group sales to be up by a mid to high single-digit percentage. With pro sales at or above the high-end of this range and DIY sales, returning to a more historic level. We expect Consumer Brands sales to be down by a mid teens percentage, including a negative impact of approximately 7% points related to the Wattyl Divestiture. And we expect Performance Coatings sales to be up by a mid teens percentage. Embedded in our guidance is a similar impact to our architectural businesses as a percent to sales from raw material availability, as we experienced in the third quarter. For the full year 2021, we expect consolidated net sales to be up by a high single-digit percentage. We expect the Americas Group to be up by a high single-digit percentage. Consumer Brands Group to be down by a mid-teens percentage, including the negative impact of approximately 4% points related to the waddle divestiture and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low twenties percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $7.16 to $7.36 per share, compared to $7.36 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.85 per share, and a loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full-year 2021 earnings per share of $8.35 to $8.55. Let me close with some additional data points that may be helpful for your modeling purposes. We expect to see a slightly improved sequential gross margin in our fourth quarter as additional price increases are implemented in the quarter. We expect to see contraction in our fourth quarter operating margin, due to the contraction in gross margin, partially offset by leverage on SG&A, due to the strong sales growth. We will continue making investments across the enterprise that, will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to have around 80 new store openings in U.S. and Canada in 2021. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, as well as systems and product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform in the home center channel. These investments are all embedded in our full-year guidance. We expect foreign currency exchange to be a tailwind of approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be slightly below 20%. We expect full-year depreciation to be approximately $270 million and amortization to be approximately $310 million. We expect full-year capex to be approximately $370 million, including about $70 million for our Building, Our Future projects. The interest expense guidance we provided last quarter remains unchanged at approximately $340 million. We expect to increase the annual dividend per share by 23.5% per share for the full-year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. We are on track to deliver solid full-year results even with the considerable supply chain and inflationary headwinds, we are experiencing. I remain extremely proud of our team and their focus on providing solutions to our customers. Demand remains strong. Our customer relationships have strengthened. And we continue to invest in our capabilities. We expect to finish the year with significant momentum that will carry us forward in 2022. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And our first question is from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets, please proceed with your question. John Mc Nulty : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. When you look at the impact that you had in terms of raw materials holding back the ability to deliver in some cases, and in particular in the TAG business, I guess, can you speak to your confidence that that business comes back versus it moving into other channels, whether it's possibly even to your Consumer Brands Group or somewhere else? Al Mistysyn : Yeah, John. This is important area that we really do want to stress and feel very comfortable and confident about this. We have tremendous confidence in the line of sight quite frankly, in the view of the customer and the demand that they have, we have great confidence that as we are exiting this chapter that, the relationships that we have with our customers are growing deeper. And I would point to, how we're working through this experience with our customers as kind of the backbone of why we have such confidence. We're blessed to have a control distribution model that has our stores in the markets that our customers are living in and working in and reps that are partners in their business.  Through this experience, those relationships are growing deeper because we're working closer with our customers. The line of sight that we have on the projects that they are working, and the need that they have is only increased. And so you're right. There might be some shifting from here to there. And we've always said that. We've always expected the DIY to normalize and that the business would begin shifting into other segments of the business as people returned back to business. I'm sorry, back to work.  So we always expected that while DIY shifted down, other areas would go up and we expect that we've worked hard, very hard strategically to position the Company to be in position, to be able to capitalize, which ever segment grows and whichever segment the market might turn to. So when you look at residential repaint or DIY or new residential versus property management, we work very hard with products, services, and quite frankly the people in those markets to be able to capitalize on them. So I'd say our confidence is probably as high as it's ever been for me.  I see what's happening with our customers from a net promoter score at a record level, our new account activity at record level, our share of wallet activity record level, every metric that we look at I would describe as almost the coiled spring ready to expand. And so we're excited about this chapter as I referred to it, is ending because we believe we will be the ones that are really going to accelerate quickly to take advantage of that. Hey John. This is Al. The only other comment I would make is as John talked about is DIY normalized. If we look at our combined architectural businesses with TAG and consumer, we were up low double-digits in our first half to exclude the raw material availability issues due to the Hurricane Ida, due to the Winter Storm Uri, that we talked about being a high single-digit impact in our third and a similar impact on our fourth quarter. We'd be up high single-digits on that combined business. So to John's point, we're going to capture on either channel of where their customer falls. John Mc Nulty : That's helpful color. And then maybe just one follow-up question, in terms of inflation, I know there's been a lot of issues around labor scarcity issues and Sherwin's really never had a problem with that in the past. It's always been kind of a destination for a lot of employees, but I guess can you speak to the environment that you're seeing there. How to think about wage inflation for your professionals. And also some of the labor efficiency measures that you spoke to that maybe helping to offset some of that? John Morikis : John, I want to make sure I'm capturing your question that you're talking about wage pressure that we might be experiencing? John Mc Nulty : That's right, wage pressure and even the ability to get employees in the store. John Morikis : Terrific. And I'll start with that one. We have had to make some wage rate adjustments in some of our factories, distribution centers and fleet drivers to, I'd say, attract and retain some of our employees. I'd say, I'm really excited about this fact that point to all our employees as critically important. But I would say that those customer facing employees, the store manager, and the rep that I just spoke about, are absolutely critical. And both of those employees, the turnover rate is in the range between 6% to 8%. And I would say that most in our space or that operate in over 4700 stores would kill to have a ratio like that. So while we've experienced some pressure in other areas, those customer-facing employees we've been able to retain and we believe it speaks to the terrific culture that we have, our ability to recruit and retain employees comes down to a number of areas that we consider key to that culture. The ability to come in.  We hired 1400 college graduates a year. We bring people in, we give them a career opportunity that they can accelerate in. When you look at the opportunity to come in and run a business. Out of school within a couple of years and own a P&L, we think that's a terrific opportunity for these people that have worked hard to come in and really make a difference. When I look at the impact of that, the 14 to 1,500 college graduate that come in, and what that means to our Company over time, we have nearly 10,000 graduates of that MTP Program throughout our Company. And we think -- I want to spend a little bit of time on this, John, because I think it's such an important element. We call it our secret weapon.  And that is the fact that we've got these employees that have come into the organization, they understand our culture, our strategy, they understand our expectations. Importantly, they understood our aggressiveness. And when they stick with us, which is an important element of that strategy, Those employees move through the organization and they -- they grow in their experience, they grow in their understanding. And now when you look at, for example, our rep force, 80% of our reps in TAG, came through this program.  And so when you're looking at the opportunity to promote from within and what that means to retention is they're looking at -- they're looking up, if you will, into the organization, 70% of the TAG field leadership comes from our TAG -- I'm sorry, our MTP Program. And that drives more and more retention. We look at our employee turnover then and what it means to the broader organization 7,000 of our employees are great -- have greater than 20 years of experience with our Company. And so when we're in front of customers, we're talking about trying to bring solutions to them, to make them better.  These are experienced people that help us differentiate from our competition. And so when you look at the external recognition we've received from Forbes, the fact that we've been recognized in the area of diversity, and recruitment and internships and places to begin a career, all of those are really important to us. We don't fight for those awards. What we do is fight to make a wonderful culture that people want to be a part of. And as a result, we are better positioned to take care of our customers. So I'd say it's working really well and it's an area we'll continue to be focused on. John Mc Nulty : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciate it. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, John. Operator : Next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird, please proceed with your question. Ghansham Punjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. John, I mean, supply-chain chaos has been persistent along the supply chain, including -- obviously your customers, including on their report this morning on the home-building side. As you think about the various sub verticals within tag, how should we think about air pockets of demand? Just because even if you have from drug solubility, maybe there's other bottlenecks that your customers are cycling through. And I guess specifically referring to new [Indiscernible] and commercial. John Morikis : I'd say those are a couple of really interesting examples that you use in new residential and commercial. Because you're right, it's not just paint that those customers are dealing with. There's a lot of raw materials or materials that go into those projects that they're impacting the pace of those. Those two markets though, I would say remain very strong. Permits up in new residential, we're expanding in multi-family as well and I would add this, it's not just the raw material or the materials, Ghansham, it's also labor that's impacting that.  So there are some challenges there. But what I would encourage our shareholders to understand is the commitment that we have not only to grow with our existing customers to begin with, but I mentioned just a moment ago about the share of wallet and the new customer activity. So we look at this in a number of different fronts. We're excited about our penetration there, but there is terrific opportunity for growth in there.  And I'd say that as this market begins to recover, the position that we have, we think not only with those existing customers but with new customers will position us favorably in the market. So I feel as though when this customer that has been pushing projects back further and further as a result of some of the supplies. First, we will out supply. We believe our competition. But we're also looking at a broader net that we're casting than just our existing customers as well. Al Mistysyn : Hey, Ghansham, I just add to that. If you look at our working capital and where we're at today, were significantly below our planned quarter-end inventory to a gallon. So as raw material availability improves, you can count on us to keep our pedal -- our foot on the gas on building architectural inventory. We're going to be in a make and shift mode through the fourth quarter. And we plan on building inventory in our first quarter of 2022. If those jobs get pushed back with the additional 50 million gallons of architectural capacity, we have coming on by the end of the year, we'll convert every pound of raw material we can get to be in a better position to serve those customers when those jobs are ready. John Morikis : Let me just build on, because it's a great point that Al makes. It goes back to the point that I made earlier, Ghansham. We don't discriminate which segment drives our results. So if New Residential is moving, we're going to be there. And if it shifts into another segment, we'll take those raw materials, we'll make the product in there and we'll push it out. The fact that we have a leadership position in these segments as something that will leverage aggressively to be able to convert every precious ounce of raw material into sale and profitability for our shareholders. Ghansham Punjabi : Okay. And just for my second question. Can you give us a characterization of how raw material availability has evolved over the past few months and thus far into the fourth quarter, maybe as a measure of force majeurs, or however you want to define it supplier allocations, etc. I'm trying to get the cadence just because at the end of September versus now, which is just lying around four weeks later, you have raised your guidance. I am just curious as to how you're thinking about the velocity of rom curve.. Thanks. John Morikis : Yes. I'd say it's improving. We'd like it to come on faster and I'd say that we've had strategy for many years on not only working with our current suppliers and working to make them as productive as possible. When we bought Valspar, we said all along there were opportunities for consolidation in raw materials, working aggressively to accelerate that as that will help us become a, an efficient customer, if you will, for our suppliers.  I'd also say that the same strategy that we've had includes bringing on alternative suppliers and that's a goal of ours to ensure that we have the quality and consistency of our products for our customers through qualified suppliers. So I'd describe it as it's getting better, we expect it to continue to get better, and we're taking very proactive steps on our side to ensure that we're best in show in supplying our customers. Al Mistysyn : And Ghansham, I'd just add to that that we did take up our raw material cost outlook up from the high teens to low 20%. Back on September 29th, we expected certain things to happen. They didn't happen as you can imagine exactly the way we thought so pressured the raw material costs on our Performance Coatings business and our other businesses. And if you look at our second half, our second half increases in raw materials more than double our first half. I talked about on the September 29th call that, we were going to be chasing raw material cost through the end of this year and into the first half of next year. And I want to make sure you understand our commitment to doing that. Our teams are in third waves, fourth waves, TAG has been out just as a reminder, February 1st of this year with three to four. Came back out again August 1st with seven. And put a surcharge in September 20 at the 4% that we fully expect to convert to a full price increase early in 2022. I could say that about each of our groups in regions we're committed to offsetting these inflated raw material costs. And we're disciplined about our approach, as John talked about in the past, we're not losing customers over these discussions. so we may have to delay a little bit, but we are going to get the price increase to offset the rows and as they moderate, we'll start seeing our margin improve. And as we've done in the past, we will see expansion above where we came into this cycle when we come out of it. Ghansham Punjabi : Thanks so much. John Morikis : Thank you Ghansham. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. John Morikis : Morning, Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi. Your DIY volume we're down sharply year-over-year, is the consumer -- is the Consumer Brands and volumes today in the third quarter of 2021 pretty similar to what it was in the third quarter of '19? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Jeff, if you back out the impact of Wattyl, we'd be up low single-digits -- flattish to low single-digits. You'd expect a similar comparison in our fourth quarter. Jeff Zekauskas : All right? So if you can offset raw material cost inflation with price increase, which I think you say that you can, like order -- order of magnitude in the third quarter of 2022. Should you be earning roughly a $140 million in adjusted operating profit, even if you don't grow very much, because that's what your returns were like in the third quarter of 19 and you now will have offset the raw material inflation. Is that right? Jim Jaye : Yes. In the sense that consumer's in a lag. So if we're our expectation with our TAG group is to be up high single-digits in price in the fourth quarter, consumer is lagging that. And it's just timing, so they're going to come back and catch that up. The other part is, the supply chain efficiencies. We do expect to get better as we flowed through next year in raw material availability gets better. Because as you know, our global supply chain is embedded in our Consumer Brands Group results and that's having a negative pressure on our margins. John Morikis : Jeff if I'd add to the point that I made just a moment ago regarding price, it's certainly consistent across all groups and as well in Consumer Brands. We've gotten some price, we need more, it's coming, we will get it. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. John Morikis : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Mizuho, please proceed with your questions. Chris Parkinson : Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. So it's clear your pricing efforts are rolling through as the industry continues to navigate the inflationary environment. But can you quickly comment as to the overall competitive landscape per, perhaps by U.S. region as it stands today. And your ability to continue to gain share in pro and trades into '22 and even '23, just any comments on what you're hearing from your staffing customer base will be greatly appreciated. Thank you. John Morikis : Yeah. Chris, I'd say this. First, I want to reiterate the determination and confidence that we have in getting our price. We're not a commodity, we bring solutions to customers that help them make more money. We're determined to continue to do that across every business that we have. So we're not asking for something to get fatter or to take advantage of a situation. We're trying to stay consistent in our model which is solutions that help our customers to be profitable and successful. If you go back to 2016, I think from an industry perspective, when there's some different dynamics in the marketplace, and people didn't go out with price. At Sherwin, we felt the brunt of that as well and our people, John Mc Nulty : I would tell you we talk regularly about the experience and the scar tissue of this leadership team has a long lasting leadership team has been through a lot. And we learned from that. And I think -- I suspect others did as well. And what it means is that when the raw material price. bucket moves like it does, you have to get the pricing or it's brutal. And it's brutal for a long time. We've learned from that.  And so when you hear the conviction, determination, and confidence that I hope you hear from me and Al on this topic. It's exactly that we're going to get this price and we're not trying to be arrogant with it. We know we have a responsibility to our customers to help make them more money in the process. And we will do that. But our ability John Morikis : to do that, we think is very high. As far as, what our competitors are doing, yes we're hearing about pricing in the marketplace. But what we're really focused on is that value proposition to our customers. And as long as we're doing our job, we expect to continue to grow our business and to do it profitably. Chris Parkinson : That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, it's a little bit off the radar screen as it relates to some of the headwinds on today's release. But when you have taken a step back and thinking about PC margins, the 13 to 20 -- 20% basis, so to speak. Can you just quickly break down any updated thoughts on the progression back to that goal across perhaps, price costs, general OP improvements, and market mix. Just any color on, how you think that's going to evolve across the initial recovery and how to conceptualize the long-term opportunity will be greatly appreciated. Thank you once again. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Chris. We still are confident, and I'll let go what Justin said on September 29th call just some [Indiscernible] are PCG Group President. We made good progress in 2020. Second half operating margin was up 100 bips. The 15.2% flow-through was strong with sales up 4% and our flow-through was up over 40. So I was seeing stronger volume, but the rate of increase of our raw materials has been dramatic and I said it's 2 times in the second half versus the first half for raw material increases.  So we're out with third and fourth ways of raw material or price increases. On top of that, this team is continuing to look for efficiencies on platform consolidations, SKU rationalizations. And they also have a lot of projects to improve our profitability outside the US. And what I would say is depending on the timing of the raw material moderates and our pricing catches up and we'll get the operating margin moving positively again. the one piece that we talked about is we still have facility rationalizations in the pipeline.  We're not going to comment on those until our employees know and we get those public, but there's opportunities there and I talked about maybe a $100 million incremental margin improvement from facility rationalizations, SKU rationalizations, platform consolidations. COVID set us back a year, no doubt, and we're fighting through it. But in the mid-term, we expect to see short-term improvement, mid-term, longer-term get to that high teens, low 20s. John Morikis : But I think Chris adversity brings out the best. I will just mention the facilities and some of the opportunities there. But the other point that you mentioned about the platforms and the point that I made earlier, about the raw material consolidation. There are opportunities there that we've identified all along. The strong proliferation of resins through our organization, the opportunity to consolidate those to be more efficient.  All of those will have a significant impact on this March to 20% range of operating margins for this industrial business. We're confident in our ability to be able to get there. We're going to do it the right way though. We're going to get there with our customers and by bringing them value. Chris Parkinson : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets, please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on demand. It's up skipping a lot of different dynamics in the market the last couple of years with COVID and DIY resurgence, and now with potentially lost sales because of lack of raw material availability. Maybe if you could help us, maybe in TAG and PCG. Is there a way to kind of quantify what your backlog has kind of grown to, or do you have visibility on that and knew when you do not make the sale because of lack of raw material availability. Does it go into that backlog or is it just we've potentially lost? Maybe you can just comment on that. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Arun, I'd say we're again, not to beat the drum here too hard. But the fact that we've got this control distribution model gives us insight into a CRM system that gives us confidence in insight as to what's happening with our customers. And what I would tell you is that, across nearly every one of these professional segments that you mentioned about in TAG, there is a growing backlog. The confidence that our customers are working with us and how we approach their business, the collaboration that we have gives us insight. I mentioned earlier about the fact that, our teams are working closer, far closer than we ever have, ever experienced and understanding what they have going and when it's going to be.  So yes, we have great confidence. We're not going to lay out any numbers with specifics as to what that looks like, but I would tell you that if you talk to any painter right now, they would probably tell you that the bidding that they're doing is further out now than they probably have ever had and their winning jobs, that people are understanding and comfortable with getting in line for next spring, next summer. And so there is an absolute understanding of what's going on. People are turning on the TV and listening to the news and understanding that there are some issues. Ours is unique from a supply chain perspective. When you think about our architectural products, since you asked about TAG, John Morikis : The supply chain issues that we're facing, primarily go back to the points that we made earlier about the Winter Storm Uri and the Hurricane Ida in February and September, those two issues that impacted us the most and our confidence in getting on top of that as the year progresses and as we begin next year is high. And our customers are learning that the fact that they do business with us are people can scramble and get product from different stores or different distribution center keep them in pace better than most of our competitors. So we'll come out of this stronger and with more loyalty and yes, there's quite a bit of backlog that we're going to enjoy filling for our customers. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks. And then if I could just get your thoughts potentially on 22, so it looks like you will have some demand recovery here and assuming raw material availability improves especially by the second half of next year, you'll have full-year or so Specialty Polymer. But you also may see some stability in DIY. Is there any kind of initial markers you can give us for '22 on how to think about each segment's growth. John Morikis : Well, I think I'd just point back at this point, Arun, that we're very comfortable, very confident that there is a growing backlog. We're not going to give you any kind of data points right now other than when we're talking with our customers, that backlog is longer than -- longer deeper, and probably growing faster than at any rate than they've seen. But I don't think we want to share any kind of numbers yet. We will provide that information at a later date. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your questions. Steve Byrne : Stephen Byrne for Vincent. I guess just back to your comment about having to build some inventory in the first quarter. And maybe just pairing that with the overall amount of deferred volume that you have? I mean, how do we think about this phasing of actually playing catch-up on some of that deferred volume? Can it happen in the first half or what are some of the key watch-outs there? Al Mistysyn : I think Steven, we have to keep an eye on the availability, not just our existing suppliers but we're looking on every rock we can find alternate suppliers to help us meet the significant demand expectations that John talked about. So our ability to build that inventory in the first half is going to be somewhat dependent on the increase in raw materials to get to the true forecasted demand, which is a lot higher than where it was entering the season this year. Like John talked about, we have the capacity to make the gallons.  We kept our factories fully staffed. That's an investment on our customers to make sure we can convert every raw material as quickly as possible to get it in the field in the fourth quarter and then build inventory both on the TAG side and the consumer side to make sure we can meet the demand head-on. John Morikis : And I think that's an important point that Al just made : the fact that we made that conscious decision on -- and did impact our gross margins, keeping the labor in our manufacturing distribution centers, so that we could respond. When we're talking about why is it that we have confidence in our price, that's a great example. Our customers, we talk openly about t that. The fact that we're making investments here so that we can supply. And as Al mentioned, as the raw material become available, we'll convert those quickly. Vincent Andrews : Thank you -- thank you, Steven. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research, please proceed with your questions. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and John, I'm sure you were excited that Johnson looked like Nick Chubb out there last week. So great performance. So it sounds like the supply chain is improving modestly recently but you all mentioned that some petrochemical facilities were still shutdown from a winter storm in Texas on your prior update call. Could you just compare and contrast Hurricane Ida? Are there any major differences that would allow the Ida facilities to recover relatively quicker? Or on the flip side, maybe they take a little bit longer to come online than the Texas Storm.? Al Mistysyn : Well I think the Ida situation is a little bit different. Why don't I have Jim talk about that briefly and then I'll come in if there's any gaps. John Morikis : Yeah, good morning, Truman. As we've talked about throughout the year here, if you look at Texas, that was more, I would say, physical damage to facilities based on the freezing of pipes and just all the damage that we've talked about at length. I think Ida, what was more at play. There was a lack of power to facilities which has recovered significantly. You also had other utilities that were offline, for example, water supply, steam, things like that that are really important in production. And even we saw a lack of nitrogen in some of these facilities, which nitrogen is a key element to preventing explosions. People that produce that nitrogen had diverted to producing oxygen to help out with the COVID pandemic. So a little bit different dynamics in the two. I'd say we're still not fully recovered in either of those, Texas or Louisiana, but making progress as we go forward. Yeah, I think you're exactly right, gentlemen. The key point here is that there were a couple of key facilities in the paint and coatings space, particularly resin manufacturing, and other thickeners, and realogy products that ended up impacting the ability to make paint. Again, not for just the Sherwin-Williams Company, but for the industry. Truman Patterson : Okay. And then in TAG, you all had sales growth, I believe in Canada, in the Southeast divisions, but you all had sales declines in the Southwest, East, and Midwest divisions. I'm just trying to unpack this a little bit. Was it due to regional supply chain differences, directing product to more profitable areas? I'm just trying to understand the dynamics there. Al Mistysyn : I would say Truman, that it's just the availability issues are across the chain. I think what you see going on in Canada is a determined team with the right focus on the right segments. And really doing a great job of increasing new account activity, gaining share of wallet, and having a focus on growth. And you can say, well, didn't you have a focus on growth in the past? Yes, we did. But I think this team is executing at a higher level than we have in the past.  And I -- I would argue the same thing in Southeast to Marine, different mix of customers impact availability as well. But our Southeast division has performed well through all cycles and I'll take a shot at our Southwest division. They will outpace the Southwest division and we'll see if the Southwest division can come pick it up and get back at Southeast and outgain them. Truman Patterson : Fair enough. Thanks, guys. John Morikis : Thanks, Truman. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Mike Sison : Hey, guys, good morning. If I did the math right, for the sales shortage from raw materials that's coming in, there maybe somewhere a little over 900 million and if you actually were able to get all the raw materials you need heading into 22, would you be able to or would your customers be able to do all that work and given how strong demand is in other areas? Al Mistysyn : Mike, just to be clear, you're quoting a full-year impact on the 900 -- Mike Sison : For the full year. Yeah. I agree with that. John Morikis : Well, as it relates to -- your question it's really a labor question. And I would say this, that there are some challenges there for sure. Again, I keep coming back to this control distribution model and our strategy, but Mike, I think these challenges work to our advantage. When our customers are challenged with where to be, what to do and we're the ones having the stores in the marketplace so that we can be responsive and serve them, the fact that we're developing products to help their productivity.  What we're experiencing right now is a positive mix shift where customers who may have used a middle-grade product are stepping up into higher grade available products. And what they're finding out, is that they are more productive and their learning more -- and they are earning more. I'm sorry. So I'd say that there'll be some challenge, but I also think that we're uniquely positioned to be able to capitalize on that.  And again, we mentioned new accounts and share-of-wallet. So we're not just -- going to be very clear, we're not just a retailer that opens doors and hopes people come in. I mean, we're out aggressively pursuing people every day. We're trying to help those customers that are doing business with us to be more productive, make more money and we're out attacking other people's hills. We're not just trying to protect ours.  And so the programs that we have, everything from the customer programs, incentive programs, everything we have is about growing. And that's what we're committed to. And we have great confidence as these raw materials become more available, and they will, add they're converted through capacity that we have, which is available, will grow our business. And we'll grow it faster than our competitors. Mike Sison : Got it. And just a quick follow-up. Just curious how excited you are for a big lit on Sunday. That's not for Al. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks. Mike. John Morikis : Steeler fan amongst us. I don't know how we let anyone from Pittsburgh in here. Thank you, Mike. Next question. Operator : Next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: On your Protective and Marine business was up high-single-digits. Oil prices are approaching what, $85 today. What do you expect from the energy business? How strongly do you think that comes back in terms of coatings demand? John Morikis : We think it will be an important part of our future, P.J. We enjoy a very strong position there. Demand is picking up there. We do believe though that it's not just oil and gas. We've been working very hard and we've been very transparent about the need for that business to further diversify beyond oil and gas. So we've been focusing on some of these other key segments. And when you look at the infrastructure opportunities that might be coming down the pipe, as well as our penetration into other areas, such as flooring, such as water waste water.  There's a lot of key areas that we have been really working hard on. So our position in oil and gas, we expect to continue to penetrate. But you can rest assure that, these adjacent markets, other markets in Protective and Marine business, we're focused very hard and we're having very good success there as well. P.J. Juvekar: Great, great. And then different paint companies are expecting to catch up fully with raw materials at different times based on their product mix or raw materials. If oil and raw materials were to remain here and not go up from here, when do you think you will fully catch up? Would it be like early 2022 or would it be by mid-2022? Al Mistysyn : Yes. P.J. I talked about on our September 29th call with the increases we've seen in plus the additional increase we just updated our guidance with on raw materials that we'd be chasing it through the end of the year earlier in the year, I thought we'd offset a dollar for dollar. I think what we like or plan to do is go out early in 2022, with the idea that if nothing, if we saw no other increases, we'd get on top of it in 2022 early. That means you can offset the dollars. It's going to take some moderation in raw materials before you start seeing material change in our -- improvement in our gross margin, but our expectation is early 2022. P.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks. P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Bob Koort : Hi guys. Thanks for the question here. I'm going to -- I'm curious about you guys had the short some customers or didn't have product available. Similarly, your suppliers on the raw material side, I'm wondering in both cases, do you make that up at the pricing that was there at the time of the order, or do you get to sell in the future to where you might actually have a richer mix on those deferred sales or deferred purchases? Jim Jaye : Probably some of both, Bob. I think we try to do the best we can to honor quotes that we have in the pipeline. It's such a wonky year though that it's hard to completely do that in this environment. So we're trying to be as transparent as we can with our customers, understanding that some jobs get moved. But not just because of the paint side of it, but because of the other supply chain issue that some of our customers are having. So I would say we're transparent, we work closely with our customers to figure out what that pricing looks like. Bob Koort : You noted the backlog is quite healthy, you're going to build into that. Is there any anxiety that, the labor pool of your customer base won't be there to be able to handle that surge? Do you fear maybe you're going to have some missed sales because of that? John Morikis : Well, we're going to work with our customers and that's why I think, Bob, it's important to understand that, it's not just our existing customers when we talk about working with our customers. So it absolutely is incumbent upon us to help them be as efficient as possible. That's not just the way in which we run our business, its helping them to run a more efficient business, and the products that we sell them to make them more efficient. And at the same time, we are out there growing the number of accounts that we do business with and growing the share of wallet with new customers.  So I think we are uniquely positioned in the market, and I call it the stickiness, if you will, these customers that realize that we're working really hard for them right now. That's why this Net Promoter Score, not just on the DIY side, but we do a wholesale look at that as well to understand the view from the customer. Its actually growing in this market. And I think many people might be surprised by that. But the loyalty that we have during these challenging times is actually increasing with these customers.  So they have a lot of customers that we're doing business with Some that we're growing and those that were touching, in fact, for the first time, or maybe we've had a little bit of their business and we're the ones working with them to get through this. We expect that that's going to play favorably to our future. And we're going to take every step possible to make sure that happens. Bob Koort : Terrific. And I'm not sure what sport people are talking about. I'm looking over to a baseball stadium where the world series is starting tonight. So we are ready for those Astro's. Al Mistysyn : Fair enough. Bob Koort : Thanks. John Morikis : Thank you, Bob. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Afternoon Sorry. John Nippon just bought chronology in France. Could that be any interest for you guys? John Morikis : No. David Begleiter : Very clear. And just on Q4, would you expect tag earnings to be down again or maybe or flat or up in Q4. Al Mistysyn : When you look at Q4, it's really dependent on the availability issues. We are experiencing more of those issues as the quarter starts off, we certainly are going up against a tougher comp. And our fourth-quarter last year was up 9%. But based on the current outlook, fourth quarter have a similar impact availability. We'll have more price in the fourth quarter. So I think what -- it's going to be hard to get on top of last year's number from a margin standpoint. The dollars of probably been close to flat, if not up slightly, but from a margin percent, it's going to be hard to get on top of last year. David Begleiter : Understood. Thank you very much. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America, please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. I wanted to drill in a little bit on how you drive share gains within TAG. It would seem that several of those end markets, like commercial developers, new residential developers, property managers, These are not customers that are walking into your stores. You have commercial relationships that are much higher than that. And John, you talked about driving stickiness with your pro - contractor s. It seems you do a lot of things to make the lives easier for those pro contractor, so they don't have to go in your stores to get product.  So my question for you is, one on the value proposition of your stores, is it primarily for your homeowners to be able to have a store nearby to maybe select product s. And then secondly, what is the key driver for driving market share gains into these end markets that you really have higher level commercial relationships with. Jim Jaye : Yeah, Steve, I think maybe a healthy way to look at this is an ecosystem. I might take exception to the idea that the stores are simply there for do it yourself. They play a very important role in commercial, new residential, every aspect of our business. We've leveraged that location and we do believe it's a competitive advantage in the marketplace. And so let me just give you a little bit of a highlight there and then I'll talk about the drivers of the market share gains beyond that.  I'll give you some of that, but I will tell you that there are a lot more than I'm willing to talk about here. So let's talk, first of all, about the stores. When you look at any given market, you have a store locally there. And if you remember that cost of labor represents roughly 85% of the cost of goods for painting contractor. We have a rep in a store, in a market that's responsive to that customer in that market.  And particularly right now as you look at something like COVID, where you might have used commercial as an example, you might have a commercial painting contractor on a project whose directed by the general contractor to move from one floor to another because of the number of people in a given area or because of some delays. there might not be the product that the substrate to paint. Because whatever dry wall taping wasn't done on time or whatever it might be. That that painting contractor's turning to our rep and our store manager, and he realizes right now he's got men or painters on the project that he is paying considerable amount of money to. And without that local store and the responsiveness, that day might be lost. A couple of days might be lost.  Whatever situation that they face, our store and our people are there to be able to respond. And so when a customer calls and says, I need something right now and our store's 10, 15 minutes away and we can respond, that's a significant advantage that we try to leverage with our customers and we try to help them to be more efficient. And that goes across every segment and anyone that would believe that you could accomplish what we do with the stickiness and loyalty that we worked so hard to gain, without those stores probably doesn't understand what we do yet.  And when you speak to these customers and the role that we play, it goes well beyond just a van showing up with products that are in our stores, there\u2019s relationships that are built, there's questions that are asked, theirs training that takes place, and that I think a big part of who we are. I go back to the secret sauce that I talked about. We're recruiting college graduates in many cases to be assistant managers and managers to come in to run these facilities. So they can talk intelligently about what it is that these contractors are facing and how to help them through that That local representation is absolutely a key part in our being a part of that customer's business, not just a supplier. And when we talk about our ability to work with our customers in areas such as the compression of margin short-term. That's a demonstration of our partnership and how we work with them. And as a result of that, we do believe that we're blessed to earn more and more loyalty from our customers. As it relates to the commercial contractor, New Residential that you mentioned and how we grow that you're right, this ecosystem that I talked about is very broad, very broad. It's everything from architectural reps, color reps as specifying. It's having technical people that can be in the field to help in situations like this. One product may not be available, but another one is. Do we have the technical people close to the customer to be able to help them with the application start-ups so that the project goes smoothly. We do very few people, if anyone else does in any given market. And so when we're talking with a customer, we're not just talking about can we deliver a gallon of paint? It's is an entire ecosystem. And when I say we just don't open a door and hope people come in. We're very aggressive in getting all the way through the decision-making process from owner to architect, to specify our designer, applicator all the way through. And we're covering each one of those basis in a variety of ways to make sure that those customers know and understand the value that we bring. Steve Byrne : John, you mentioned this example of store being 10 to 15 minutes away. I'm sure you've analyzed in excruciating detail whether, there is a value to it being five minutes away, or versus 30. And thus, the question is, when you look at your footprint of stores, how much -- how many more do you think that you could put in North America and still drive revenue growth before that starts to plateau. John Morikis : So we've, Yeah, you're right. We've looked at that in great depth and I would tell you this, we've not reached saturation in any market yet and these large markets where we have considerable representation, if it's Cleveland or in Atlanta, or Dallas, or some of these markets where we might have a 100 stores. We're still looking at more and more facilities there. And what happens to these visit is that when we grow these stores, and the volume goes through the stores, we look at adjacent markets. We'll add a store in those markets. We'll grow that new market, but will also take some of those customers out of the existing store.  And we'll move it over into the new store. And as a result, the comp store grows faster as well as the new store. So when you look at store count we can see the next mile-marker that I talk about frequently is 5,000, but that's not to signal that we think we hit 5,000 stores. When we hit by 5,000 stores we'll -- the next mile marker for us will be 5,500 and then 6,000. And we will continue to add them as long as it makes sense. But we're decades away from a point of saturation that we're concerned about. Steve Byrne : Thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Kevin Mc Carthy : Yes. Good afternoon. Just to peel the onion, maybe one more layer on raw materials. I'd be interested to hear for seeing examples of cost relief here in October across your basket. And on the flip side, which inputs might be getting worse sequentially into year-end. And then related to that I was curious as to whether or not you're seeing tightness in specialty chemicals. It seems in the wake of Uri and Ida you had a lot of disruption upstream among commodity chemicals. But lately we've been hearing more examples of specialty categories that have been disrupted. And I was curious to know whether you're dealing with That as well. John Morikis : Yeah Kevin, I'll take a shot at that. So I'll begin maybe with the third quarter and what we talked about on the third quarter was raws were up over 20%. That was a sequential -- got worse in the third quarter versus the second quarter was really monomer, resins, solvents, packaging materials, all of those moved. If I fast forward some of the more recent data that we have in terms of prices that have settled, If you look through September, all the major categories that we look at are still highly elevated year-over-year.  If you look at whether it's propylene, ethylene, Appoxee, HDPE, all these feedstocks well, elevated year-over-year and not a lot of improvement, so to speak, sequentially. I think propylene may have ticked down a penny or two, but most of these have not moved. sequentially a whole lot. We're also seeing steel and TiO2 have increased a bit as well. I think Al might have said earlier, in October, we've seen -- in terms of the availability we've seen some improvement there, but still probably not enough to let us build inventory in the fourth quarter. You look to the fourth quarter around inflation again, it's going to be a similar type of level of 20% plus in the fourth quarter. And I don't really see a whole lot of meaningful improvement until we're into '22 first couple of months of '22. Kevin Mc Carthy : Okay. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciate it. John Morikis : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Jefferies, please proceed with your question. Edlain Rodriguez : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I am just wondering, can you talk about the visibility you have for the fourth quarter, like you gave the guidance. So how much visibility do you have? Are you more or less set? based on your auto book or is volumes still in flux and can change depending on what happens over the next two months, especially in November. John Morikis : Edlain, I think it's dependent on how [Indiscernible] the quarter and quarter and there's no other disruptions as John -- and we've talked about, we have the capacity, we have the people in place so our capabilities are there. demand is there. So we believe every gallon we make will shift to the customer and get it so just about availability right now. Edlain Rodriguez : Thank you. That's all I have. John Morikis : Thanks, Edlain. Operator : The next question is from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Hi. Good afternoon. You noted some sales and marketing cost controls that you put in. place in your consumer business. Could you elaborate on that? I'm assuming that it does not make sense to spend money on advertising when you don't have enough product to sell, but maybe help us think about how much higher those sales and marketing costs could be next year if we're assuming normalized products availability. John Morikis : Yes. We consistently look to be more efficient on non-customer-facing items. We did get leverage in the quarter on -- I should say we have reduced spending in the quarter, but much of it is volume-driven in what our outlook is. And you're right, if we can't get products doing more advertising, marketing and things of that nature, you don't have -- I think just giving you a one-off on SG&A for 2022 would send a mixed message. I think we got to look at the totality of the group, how sales and margins progress. That really gives us a better idea how we're going to approach our SG&A spend for [Indiscernible]. Jim Jaye : Yeah, we'll invest as it grows and then position of the market. And we will work closely with our customers to do that. John Morikis : That being said, Mike, as even though our dollars were down, we continued to invest in the pros paint at some of our retail partners to make sure that opportunity is getting off the ground as quickly as we want and needed to. Mike Harrison : And then my other question's on mix John, you mentioned that you are seeing some positive mix shift from some of your pro customers, shifting the higher grade products to improve productivity. But at the same time, lower DIY, probably hurts mix. So is -- as we think about the margin right now, and the effect of mix within your TAG business, is it pretty neutral is or is there a little bit of a headwind from the DIY decline? John Morikis : I'd say it's neutral, Mike. The takeaway for you on that one should be that, you've got professional contractors that are learning that they can make more money with higher-quality products and they're likely to continue to do that. And quite honestly, that helps -- we believe the relationship between Sherwin-Williams with these customers, because they're more successful, more profitable, and we're playing a part in it. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Good afternoon. Raw materials had a bigger impact on TAG in consumer than PC. Is that because of specific raw materials that go into those types of paints? And if so, which ones? Or is it because you prioritize scarce raw materials to go into PC and made a structural decision to grow that business faster. John Morikis : Yeah. It's not because we're prioritizing TAG over other customers. It's related to the specific raw material that were impacted by Hurricane Ida that impacted TAG more than consumer and PCG. I don't think getting into the specific of what raw materials and what products is appropriate, but it did impact us more on tech. Duffy Fischer : Fair enough. And then on the 50 million gallons of new capacity, you've got coming up. Does that do 1 or 2 or maybe 1 or 3 things. 1, are you short capacity today, so you'll get a nice volume bump as soon as that's running or B does it displace third-party product where you'll get a better margin on that, or is that really just kind of a multi-year grow wind to project? John Morikis : We're growing into and want to fill that as quickly as possible. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you, guys. John Morikis : Thanks, Duffy. Operator : The next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI, please proceed with your questions. Greg Melich : Thanks. I just had a follow-up as to the progression of the guidance on the raws availability. So it sounds like the headwinds you expect in the fourth quarter will be similar to the third quarter from a volume standpoint on raws. Did I get that right? High single-digits? Al Mistysyn : That's correct. Greg Melich : And so if I back into the guidance that looks like it could be four or 500 bip acceleration in sales on the fourth quarter year-over-year. So is it fair to say that that's all more of the realized price, or a mixture of price and mixed combined? John Morikis : Yeah. Craig, I'd say it's a mix of price and volume combined. TAG will have a full quarter of the surcharge as well as the August 1st price increase, availability, impacts are flattish. But I do think it's a combination of both. Greg Melich : Great. And then I guess if we think about the acquisitions you've made, and I know they don't help this year, but is this a key part to really getting the capacity or some of the bottlenecks fixed early next year. How important, I guess, are they to getting back to that not having a headwind from [Indiscernible] availability? John Morikis : No, I don't think it's going to be the magic key to the door here. I mean, it's going to help us. We'll bring some best practice if you will, to the acquired companies. But we're working with our suppliers and we expect that we'll look at this as I mentioned, Greg during the call, it's a holistic view that we have on this. We're looking at this specialty polymers as well as the current supply base and it'll allow us to ensure that we can be as productive as possible while improving the productivity of some of our suppliers that will help us get more raw materials as well.  We'll add capacity to the Specialty Polymers asset base that will allow us on the one side to continue to supply the external customers that they have, while continuing to ramp up our supply as well. Edlain Rodriguez : Would it be fair to characterize it as it is less about getting the capacity per se and more about de -risking, maybe next spring, that you have, that you need? John Morikis : I think in the shorter term it maybe a little bit de -risking, but in the longer term, with the capacity expansion that we have, it'll be relatively inexpensive investment to give us more flexibility and capacity going forward. Greg Melich : Well, thanks. Good luck and have a good time, guys. John Morikis : Jeff, thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Craig. Operator : The next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. John Roberts : Thank you. In TAG, commercial construction is a longer cycle business that usually can see out a lot further there. Do you think this is the beginning of at least four quarters of down results until we anniversary the drop in new starts in commercial that's at the depth of the pandemic? John Morikis : Well, actually if you look at the architectural billing index, John, it's been positive for 8 straight months. You're right. That project started in late 2019 or early 2020 or reaching the opinion phase now. But what we're hearing from our customers is that these projects that were pushed back are starting to see daylight and we have confidence that first we have a terrific position in the commercial front.  The relationships that we have with our customers and it was a question earlier about our stores are in the right place. So we're in the right markets where a great deal of the commercial activity is taking place. We think that this will be an area of growth for us and we're excited about capitalizing on that. John Roberts : Okay. And then in consumer was pros who pay, was that up similar to TAG s residential repaint. And should we think about those tracking together or will Pros Who Paint within consumer grow faster since it's growing from a smaller base? John Morikis : It grow faster as it's a smaller base. And we're excited about that. There are some terrific partners that we're working with on that segment that we've been able to ticket that a little bit through our stores. But there are customers that prefer that setting, a home center setting, if you will, that has a broader offering of products that actually just prefer that setting. And we want to make sure are customers are positioned very well to capitalize on those opportunities.  They have number of customers in their stores right now, maybe for the first time, as customers might be looking for product or availability, we want to make sure that that experience is a good one and the quality of the product and the services they receive. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital, proceed with your question. Garik Shmois : Great. Thanks for having me. My question's on Pro and new growth is expected to be at, or above the high-end of the TAG guidance as the growth more of a function of the COVID half a year ago, are you seeing accelerated return here? Al Mistysyn : Our comp last year in our North America Paint Stores was 9.7. Third quarter was 3.5, so I think it's more around just better availability. Even though the impacts are the same, but smaller from a dollar standpoint, just because the quarter is smaller. And I would say this, we typically see a seasonal slowdown in architectural in our fourth quarter coming out of our third quarter, I would say, based on what we're seeing, you won't see it -- we're not seeing as big of a seasonal slowdown, if you will. So that's kind of why you see a nice uptake in TAG. Garik Shmois : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research, please proceed with your questions. Eric Bosshard : Two things first of all, John, you commented about loyalty increasing for your Company during this period of time. I'm curious, as you're putting through these price increases at a period of time where service levels are below your standard. How are the price increases being received? Is the uptake -- or are these taking longer to stick or is it probably in the historic normal path? John Morikis : Now I'd say either historic or maybe even a little bit faster right now. Eric, it does -- it is odd. I could understand a question about the loyalty increasing while prices are going up and availability is challenged. But I think it does speak to the point I made earlier. There was a question about our store locations and I got a marvel at that question because it does get hard of what we have, which is this unique point of differentiation, where if we didn't have the stores and you're trying to put pricing through and trying to build loyalty and you don't have product, I get it.  But the fact that you're walking into a store and in many cases, these are your friends that you've now built a terrific relationship where they are working with you. I need this product, I needed as soon as possible and the person on the other side of the counter is in it with you and we're trying to empower our people to make decisions. We're trying to give them product as quickly as possible. And as a result, the customers are understanding the efforts that our people are putting in, and the pricing is the pricing.  We're again, we're under a lot of pressure from a raw material standpoint. We're helping our customers improve their profitability and we need to stay healthy. And that's the discussion that we're having. And that healthiness includes a price increase for the products that we're getting. And as a result, in the metrics in the numbers are all right there, I mentioned a net Promoter, Promoter score, and people are familiar with that. There are a number of other metrics that we look at internally. They are all pointing in the right direction. So it gives me great confidence that what we're doing is working. Eric Bosshard : Great. That's helpful. And then secondly, Al, you commented about catching up on raws in early '22. Based on where you are now and you've obviously, within that saving, you've got some visibility on cost and pricing into '22. Is it reasonable from where the world sits now that next year is a year where raws are up? 10 and prices up 5, is that the right initial way to think about '22, linked to that statement that you made on '22? Al Mistysyn : Yes. That'd be all else being equal, Eric, and we don't see additional increases that would obviously make us go out again like we did this year. But you're directionally accurate. Eric Bosshard : That's helpful. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Eric. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Our final question today comes from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question. Christopher Perrella : Good afternoon. A quick question on China with the energy issues that are going on over there are also issues on the property market have the risk on up, and have you seen any issues getting raw material supply, or even on the demand side over in China. Jim Jaye : Well, I would say China has been a challenge. You're right. So let's talk first on the demand side, on the architectural side, a decent performance last year. And there's a lot of pressure this year. It's obviously a very, very small percentage of the overall Consumer Brands Group results. So it's under pressure but not meaningful in the sense of what it does to our results, on the industrial side we've had some challenges there, and not just China, but Malaysia And Vietnam is our customers as well as our plans have been under pressure as a result of COVID. We believe work we're beginning to work through that locally and we're in a position we think to be able to capitalize on that. But if you look at our businesses in China specifically, we've had some really strong performances. We've said strong performance in our packaging, John Morikis : and we mentioned, that strong double-digit growth in every region. We continue to grow market share there. We're proud of that. I think if our president of our General Industrial Business was in the room, we'd want to point out the performance they had there. So it's a good strong performance. Our coil business, in fact, just about every industrial business we have is doing well in China, but there's pressure in that market. And again, our focus on solution is what we believe will be the differentiating factors. Christopher Perrella : And John, real quick, the wood coatings business, Southeast Asia reopens and moves through the lock down, should we expect a sharp uptick in that business in the fourth quarter or is that seasonality how would that work out? John Morikis : We would expect an uptick there. Our plants in Malaysia were shut down to only the people that were there. They had to be quarantined in a hotel and shipped into the plant in and out. There's a lot of -- many of our customers were shutdown completely. Vietnam, very similar challenges. So it is -- it has been -- there has been a lot of pressure there and we would expect that to ramp back up and we're in position to be able to do that. We've been utilizing inventory, having it shipped in from other plants -- nearby plants into Malaysia and Vietnam to try to make sure that we had the inventory as they ramp up. So we've been thinking ahead about. No, how to best position our customers as they reemerge. But it should be good for us. Christopher Perrella : All right. Thank you, John. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session, I will turn the floor back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Jim Jaye : Yes. Thank you, everybody for joining our call today. If I had to summarize the key takeaways that I hope you walk away with today is that we remain very confident in our demand environment. Our pricing initiatives are very well in place and continuing to move forward. Our overall in strategy and our people, we feel very confident about that as well. So we appreciate your interest in Sherwin. As always, we'll be available for your follow-ups later today and throughout the week. And I hope you have a great rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the Company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the Company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you and good morning, everyone. While our fourth quarter sales were within our guidance, earnings results fell short of our expectations, ending our year on a disappointing note. As we described on our January 14 call, raw material availability did not improve as meaningfully as anticipated in the quarter and the Omicron variant put additional pressure on our company, particularly in the Americas Group and our global supply chain organization, as well as on our suppliers and our customers. We also faced the highest inflation of the year in the fourth quarter, which we are combating with continued pricing actions. These are near-term headwinds. The good news is that demand remains strong across our end markets. We are seeing raw material supply issues improve sequentially. We also continue to strengthen our customer relationships and take actions during the quarter that strongly position us for the long term. And we remain very confident in our strategy and, above all, our people. Let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers before turning to John Morikis, who will provide commentary on the full year and our outlook for 2022. Starting with the top line, fourth quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 6.1% to $4.76 billion. Raw material availability negatively impacted sales by an estimated high single-digit percentage, with about 65% of the impact in the Americas Group. The remaining impact was largely in the Consumer Brands Group, with an immaterial impact to Performance Coatings Group. Pricing in the quarter was in the high single-digit percentage range. Consolidated gross margin decreased to 39.5%, driven by lower sales volume, raw material cost inflation outpacing our price increases near term and supply chain inefficiencies. SG&A expense decreased to 30.2% of sales. Consolidated profit before tax decreased to $308.9 million. The quarter included $70.1 million of acquisition-related amortization expense. Diluted net income per share in the quarter decreased to $1.15 per share. The quarter included acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.19 per share. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.34 per share. Moving on to our operating segments. Sales in the Americas Group increased 3%, as high single-digit pricing offset lower volume related to raw material availability. Segment margin decreased to 15.1%, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases. Segment SG&A was up slightly as a percent of sales, as we continued investing in strategic growth initiatives. Sales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 7.8% against a double-digit comparison a year ago. Sales were flat excluding the impact of the Wattyl divestiture. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 6.3% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs and supply chain inefficiencies, which were partially offset by selling price increases and good cost control. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 18.7%, driven by price and volume increases. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 8.9% of sales, as operating leverage from the higher volume, selling price increases and good cost control were more than offset by higher raw material costs, where inflation was the highest among the company's three operating segments. Let me turn the call over to John now for additional commentary on 2021 along with our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2022. John Morikis : Thank you Jim, and good morning everyone. I'll provide some additional color on the fourth quarter in a moment, but first I'd like to summarize our full year. For the second year in a row, we faced a series of challenges that no one could have predicted. The natural disasters of winter storm Uri and hurricane Ida crippled the industry's raw material supply chain for most of the year. The lack of raw material availability coupled with strong demand led to a rapid and unprecedented raw material cost inflation. Labor and transportation costs also escalated throughout the year. And through it all, we continue to battle various complications brought on by the continuation of the pandemic, especially in the fourth quarter. The 610,00 dedicated employees of Sherwin-Williams our greatest asset responded with determination. We did not use any of these challenges as an excuse, but as an opportunity to get even closer to our customers. We focused on supporting our customers' businesses through innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution. This solutions-based approach resulted in our customer loyalty metrics and new account activity growing significantly during the year. These trends bode well for years to come. While we focused on meeting customers' needs, we also attacked rising costs with aggressive pricing actions in all businesses. Near-term pressure on our margins was significant, but we remain highly confident, they will recover just as they have in past cycles, as we grow the business and see commodity costs moderate over time. We also continue to invest in multiple long-term growth initiatives during the year. I'll mention just a few full year metrics. Consolidated sales increased 8.6%, including a mid single-digit headwind related to raw material availability to a record $19.9 billion. It was the 11th consecutive year we have grown the business. Pricing for the year was in the mid single-digit range. On a segment basis, the Americas Group delivered 8% sales growth and 20% PBT margin for the full year, solid performance given the challenging operating environment. Pricing was in the mid single-digit range. Our largest customer segment residential repaint grew by a double-digit percentage for the sixth year in a row. Sales in all other customer segments, with the exception of DIY grew mid-to-high single-digits in the year. We also opened 85 net new stores during the year. Consumer Brands sales were down 10.9% for the year, including a four percentage point impact from the divested Wattyl business. This was against a mid-teens comparison that was driven by DIY projects related to consumers nesting during the pandemic. Pricing was a little less than what we saw in TAG. Performance Coatings sales were up 22% for the year. Every region and every business unit increased by a double-digit percentage. Price realization was in the mid single-digit range. Amidst the highest cost inflation in the company, this segment preserved the vast majority of adjusted profit before tax dollars, which decreased $18.1 million, or 2.5% from the prior year. Even with the increase in consolidated sales, we were not able to fully overcome the impacts of raw material and other cost inflation, raw material availability and the Omicron variant in the year. As a result, net income and diluted net income per share were below last year's levels. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $3.27 billion, or 16.4% of sales. Net operating cash for the year was $2.2 billion, or 11.3% of sales. We put our cash to work, returning a little over $3.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $2.8 billion to purchase 10.1 million shares at an average price of $273.18. We distributed $587 million in dividends, an increase of 20.3%. We also invested $372 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $56 million for our Building our Future project. We ended the year with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times. Additionally, we announced three acquisitions that will add to our capabilities : the coatings business of the Tennant Company, the European industrial coatings business of Sika AG and Specialty Polymers Inc. Total return to shareholders in 2021 was 44.9%, which outpaced the S&P 500 and our peer group. Finally, I'd also like to mention our ESG efforts. We announced and made good progress on our next-generation targets this year. We were recognized for various aspects of our program this year by Newsweek, Forbes and Investor's Business Daily. Given the volatility of the macroeconomic environment over the past two years, our combined results over the period are perhaps a better illustration of the underlying strength of our business. Since the end of 2019, consolidated net sales grew $2 billion, or 11.4%. Gross profit increased $507 million, or 6.3%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $211 million, or 6.9%. GAAP diluted net income per share increased 26.9% to $6.98 per share. And adjusted diluted net income per share increased 15.8% to $8.15 per share. Over the two-year period we've returned approximately $6.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. As far as our fourth quarter, I'll keep my comments brief in order to get to our 2022 outlook. The key themes remain the same as in our third quarter. Demand was strong in nearly all of our end markets. Raw material availability remained a challenge. There was some improvement, but recovery was not as quick as we would have liked. Commodity and other costs remained elevated and we continue to implement price increases. The new wrinkle was the impact of the Omicron variant, which was meaningful as we discussed on our call earlier this month. In the Americas Group sales growth in the fourth quarter was led by Protective and Marine which was up by a double-digit percentage. New residential and property management were up in the mid-single-digit range. Res repaint and commercial were up in the low single-digit range. DIY was down double digits against an extremely strong double-digit comparison. From a product perspective, exterior paint sales performed better than interior sales, with interior being the larger part of the mix. We realized a high single-digit increase in price in the fourth quarter resulting from our February 1 and August 1, 2021 price increases in our mid-September 2021 surcharge. As we mentioned a new 12% price increase is effective February 1 of this year. We opened 35 net new stores in the fourth quarter. Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Fourth quarter sales were basically flat to last year, excluding the impact of the Wattyl divestiture. Sales were up low single digits in North America. That was offset by a softer sales in Europe and Asia, where COVID restrictions were more pronounced. Pricing was positive in the quarter and in the high single-digit range. Last, let me comment on the fourth quarter trends in our Performance Coatings Group. We continue to see momentum, as this is the sixth straight quarter of growth for this business. Group sales increased by a high-teens percentage in the quarter. Price realization was in the low double-digit range and all regions and all divisions generated growth. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in North America, followed by Europe, Latin America and Asia. Every division in the group grew with nearly all by double digits driven by robust underlying demand, new customer wins, share of wallet gains, and pricing. Packaging was strongest followed by Coil, General Industrial, Industrial Wood and Auto Refinish respectively. Turning to our 2022 outlook. We see an operating environment with strong demand across architectural and industrial end markets. Customer labor will likely continue to be a governor on growth in some areas. We expect raw material availability to continue improving sequentially so the trajectory remains uneven. As supply improves, we stand ready with ample capacity to quickly convert those raw materials to paint. We believe the impact of the Omicron variant on the supply chain should moderate through the first quarter. Any additional impacts from COVID over the remainder of 2022 are hard to predict. What's not hard to predict is our determination. Our role is to influence results not to simply report them. Looking ahead, we expect to bend the curve in our favor through the very deliberate steps we've been taking. These include arrangements and agreements with existing and new suppliers, prioritizing our product offering to our customer's, investments in additional capacity, the acquisition of a resin supplier, and actions to retain employees to produce and distribute products. As the year goes on, we expect to be talking less and less about raw material availability and supply chain issues and more and more about volume growth, sequential gross margin improvement, and sequential margin improvement in each of our operating segments. Our outlook also assumes that, the market rate of inflation for our raw material basket will be up by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage in 2022 compared to 2021. We expect to see year-over-year inflation in all four quarters, with the largest impact likely occurring in the first quarter, and gradual reductions each quarter as the year progresses. We expect all commodity categories to be meaningfully elevated. We expect other costs, including wages and transportation to be up in the mid-to-high single-digit range. We are currently implementing additional price increases in all businesses, and will continue to do so as necessary. For the first quarter of 2022, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2021, inclusive of a low double-digit price increase, partially offset by ongoing raw material availability issues. We expect the Americas Group to be up low to mid-single digits with North America paint stores at or above the high end of that range. We expect Consumer Brands to be down by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage and we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a mid- to high-teens percentage. Our full year guidance is heavily second half-weighted due to a stronger volume, the impact of pricing action and weaker second half 2021 comparison. As you'll recall, we began 2021 with great momentum, including first half sales growth of 14.7% and adjusted EPS growth of 26.4%, before the natural disasters supply chain and COVID issues derailed the second half of the year. For the full year 2022, we expect net sales to increase by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect the Americas Group to be up a mid-to high single-digit percentage, again, with North American paint stores at or above the high end of the range. We expect Consumer Brands to be up a low to mid-single-digit percentage, and Performance Coatings Group to be up a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2022 to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.80 per share compared to $6.98 per share earned in 2021. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance, includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share of $9.25 to $9.65, an increase of 16% at the midpoint over the $8.15 we delivered in 2021. Let me close with some additional data points and an update on our capital allocation priorities. Given volume growth, pricing actions and our ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, we would expect full year gross margin expansion. We expect to see SG&A leverage in 2022 by controlling costs tightly in noncustomer-facing functions. We will continue to make investments across the enterprise. It will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We expect to open between 80 and 100 new stores in the US and in Canada in 2022. We'll be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems as well as product innovation. We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel. These investments are embedded in our full year guidance. We expect currency exchange will be a headwind of about 1.5% on consolidated sales. We expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. Our core CapEx guidance for the year is approximately $415 million. In addition to this core CapEx, we expect to make investments of approximately $450 million in '22 related to our new headquarters and our R&D facility project. Both depreciation and amortization should be about $300 million each. Interest expense should be about $330 million. We have $260 million of long-term debt due in 2022. Historically, we've targeted dividends at about 30% of prior year GAAP earnings. Next month at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 9.1% to $2.40 per share, up from $2.20 last year. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. As we begin 2022, we remain confident in our strategy, our capabilities and the differentiated product and service solutions we bring to customers. Above all, my confidence in our people has never been higher. Our business remains extremely well positioned and we're emerging as an even stronger Sherwin-Williams following the challenges that we have faced in the last two years. We remain steadfast in our focus on creating shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Parkinson perhaps your line is mute. You are live for question. Chris Parkinson : Sorry about that. So it seems there can be multiple steps to rebuild your margin structure and strive towards -- back towards your long-term goals, especially in consumer performance. Just given near-term raw material shortages, hopefully getting better on a sequential basis, raw material inflation, logistics costs etcetera, et cetera all hopefully to be offset by pricing. How should we think about what's actually embedded in your '22 guidance on margins based on those factors? And then perhaps more importantly, how should investors recalibrate expectations for the cadence of improvement in '23 and back towards your long-term goals? Any color would be appreciated. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Sure Chris. This is Al Mistysyn. And as the 2021 unfolded with a strong -- very strong first half and a softer second half, I would say, our 2022 budget is exactly the opposite. We expect continued headwinds as John mentioned in raw materials heavily weighted to the first half. But incremental pricing. We talked about TAG going out with a February 1 12% increase. And we're going out across all divisions and groups with pricing. So when you look -- let me start with when you look at our gross margin, our first half you'd expect to see a slight contraction with sequential improvement as the quarter goes on. And then you start seeing gross margin recovery in our second half and that expectation is across each of the segments. And it's really volume-driven on the architectural side continued pricing catch-up on the Performance Coatings side along with the continued strong demand in volume. And what I would expect to see is some contraction in the first half on operating margins among the segments. But I would expect to see recovery starting in our second half on the operating margins and all segments growing operating margins year-over-year in our second half. And even including -- if our -- even including TAG even has the potential to get on top of previous years. And as you know in an inflationary environment that is our -- and you look back at our history, as we see raw material increases, we implement price to offset those raw material increases. And as the price effectiveness continues to improve, we start to see recovery. And then as raw materials moderate and roll over, we see gross margin expansion and I can point back as I have in the past 2010 2011 2012, we saw that big run-up in titanium dioxide. We saw our margins get -- contract. And then we saw growth from 2013 to 2016 of almost 600 basis points. We expect to see a similar environment today. Chris Parkinson : That's very helpful. And just as a quick follow-up just in terms of 2022 demand there's -- let's say more recently there's been a little bit of skepticism just given rates, housing affordability just essentially the broader inflationary environment. Just from the Sherwin-specific angle and what you're hearing specifically from your stores, what really truly underscores your volume confidence on the macro for TAG and as well as your ability to further win share on both Pro and big boxes, just any additional insights will be very helpful? Thank you. John Morikis : Chris, I think you hit on two very important points there. One is the market and our position in that market, it would be the second point. So we believe and the first indicator would be the close relationship that we have with our customers. I'll ask Jim to talk to the macro indicators that give us confidence in a moment. But I'd say what gives me the most confidence is the nearly 3500 sales reps and over 4000 store managers that we have out there every day feeding our CRM system with data that plays back to incredible confidence that our customers have in this market. We've had we believe a pretty strong run here in a challenging market. But our customers are telling us that as they look forward, demand continues to grow. And if you look across the segments in every one of those architectural segments, the feedback that we're getting is exactly that. This is going to be a terrific year. Many of our customers would say their pipeline is pretty much full right now and they're looking out into the second, third quarter taking bids right now. So it's very solid. But let me ask Jim to give you a little bit on the macro numbers that reinforce what we're hearing from our customers. Jim Jaye : Yeah. Thank you, John. And good morning, Chris. As you look across the various indicators that we've always talked about for years now, they're all pointing in a very positive direction Chris. And I won't go through all of them, but on the residential repaint side, we look at LIRA the leading indicator of remodeling activity that was up high single-digits in the fourth quarter and they see strong double-digit growth throughout 2022. The remodeling market index also is at near record levels going forward. Think on the new rev side when you look there in addition to John's comments about what our customers are saying permits and trends -- or permits and starts have been trending very well, since the summer. There's still a big backlog of homes that need to be built, both at the entry level and at the luxury level as well. Mortgage rates while maybe ticking up a little bit still are largely supportive, I think. On the commercial construction side, you've got other indicators the Dodge Momentum Index, the Architectural Billing Index, all of those pointing in really strong directions. In property maintenance we're seeing good activity there. So no matter where you look on our TAG business it feels very strong. John Morikis : Yeah, our TAG and we believe also our Consumer Brands business as well there's lot of opportunity there for pricing in the market as well. But one point that I'd make in addition to the pricing availability on the Consumer Brands is what we're seeing from our contractors. We talk about gross margins and our ability to push that pricing through. This is a market where our customers have confidence in their ability to put pricing in because of the supply/demand dynamics. So we're up putting price in to customers who have confidence in their ability to put price into the market. I've often said we typically don't receive thank you notes for putting price increases through. And I don't expect to receive any on this round. But I will tell you our teams are very confident that our customers are almost in the mindset of okay I need to know what the price increase is going to be so I could push it through. And at the same time they're deciding, which projects they're going to take, and which ones they're not. So the dynamics are very powerful. Chris Parkinson : It\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks Chris. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning everybody. I guess somewhat of a follow-up. I know it's very early in the year and there's a lot going on seemingly every week. But can you break out for us what you're assuming in terms of raw material availability for 2022 as it relates to your specific earnings guidance? And I guess I'm referring to volume catch-up and then your own inventory levels as the year unfolds? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. So Ghansham, the availability expectation is that -- we may see some in our first quarter. We talked about our first quarter being a little bit of choppiness -- seeing a little bit of choppiness in our availability, it could be low single to mid-single digits. But the commitment that we've gotten across our existing supplier base and our new supplier base really gives us great confidence that we'll have the raw material available to us to meet the stronger demand we expect in our first quarter and I should say stronger production in our first quarter. So with the prioritized product line that John mentioned, we are going to build in a significantly more inventory to the end of our first quarter compared to year-end 2021 and versus last year but not to what I would say more historic levels. So the additional inventory for TAG that we put in at the end of the year because of the sales shortfall will help us early on but you're talking 10 to 15 days of inventory. The real growth is because of the excess capacity that we have put in and that being filled up with raw material supply and really getting ourselves in a better inventory position. John Morikis : Ghansham, if I could add I think that's a terrific response by Al. I think looking long-term there's some choppiness here short-term. We understand that. But when we look long-term and why we feel our company is going to really outperform and we often talk about this coiled spring. I look at the points that Al just mentioned and I'd like to just add a couple if I could. There certainly are opportunities to his point about the additional capacity that we've just brought on. We've got more that's coming on that is important. The other thing that I think is important to understand that we're not complacent. You look at how we get more efficiency and more productivity out of our plants. There's work to be done here, but we're well underway in a simplification process of our products to ensure that our responsiveness and I think this would be a question some shareholders might have. As we've come through this, how do we ensure that if anything like this were to happen again that we're the horse to bet on? And we're not sitting here waiting just trying to get out of the current situation. And we are looking at how do we build in the response as a result of this experience to ensure that we avoid these types of issues going forward. So it does include the resin company that we bought. It does include the capacity that we just bought. But an equally important one is the simplification of many of our product lines to allow us to be more responsive, more adaptive to the situation if it be from raw material suppliers or raw material products or to be able to move different resins around to be able to supply our customers. So, there's a lot of really good work heavy lifting that's taking place that we're not going to see today, but it's going to help us. It's going to help us not only in situations like this in the future, but to be more responsive to our customers' needs and more reactive to opportunities going forward. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. That's very helpful. And then realizing this is a difficult question to answer, but all the various nodes in the supply chain, there's so many different issues that your customers cite in their earnings calls and so on and so forth. I'm just trying to gauge, if you were able to produce more paint, and you just wave your magic wand, and you're able to get what you need from a raw material standpoint, is there still going to be a fair amount of choppiness you think in terms of volumes on a quarterly basis, because of the other constraints that customers are citing, including appliances, labor, et cetera? John Morikis : Well, I think, we're going to have raw material -- our raw material position is going to improve. It's improving now. And as Al mentioned, between our current and new suppliers, we've got confidence that this is going to improve. That's why I made the comments earlier. I'd say it this way. We've always hated talking about weather. I would associate our feelings with what we're talking about regarding raw materials to feel like weather. We want to get this behind us, and start talking about growing our business and talking about the incredible results we're going to post, and we're going to have the raws to be able to do that. Now are there other issues that we're going to face like transportation and the fact that we're going to be in a race to build product through the first quarter, but we're not going to be able to build the inventory that we typically build in the first quarter to be as responsive as we like. So there is going to be some hand-to-hand combat if you will, as we get through the year. It's going to get better, but we're going to be racing to fill the pipeline here. And we would have liked if possible to have built more inventory in the fourth and first quarter, but we're going to be in a position to have more raw materials and more capacity to be able to respond. We'll build some inventory coming out of the first quarter, but it won't be to the traditional level that we would like going into a paint season. Al Mistysyn : Yes. Ghansham, the other thing I'd add there. I think when you look at the past two years have been really challenging, and because we've got a long tenured and experienced management team, we've been able to meet those challenges and produced solid results. We believe we are paid to influence results and not simply report them. And I believe our management team is doing that. If you look at the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS that yields a 10% three-year compounded average growth rate. And while doing that we continue to invest in the future growth of the company, and returning a significant portion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. So I think what you're going to see is our volume. And I'll look at it maybe architectural volume in our first half, my expectation is because we had such a strong first half of 2021 that our architectural volume will be flat to down low single-digits. It's really our second half. And the expectation is all the things that our global supply chain team is doing to get past -- and procurement teams get past raw material supply, get more consistent transportation and logistics set up. Our second half we're expecting to be up mid-to-high single digits in volume. And that's really what's going to drive the operating margin improvement across our architectural businesses TAG and consumer. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Thanks so much. John Morikis : Thanks, Ghansham. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort : Thank you very much. Maybe following on that last response, I just want to make sure I understood it properly. I think you said maybe your architectural business will be down in the first half, I think, you're implying revenues. And I'm wondering given the pricing cadence through 2021 and then again the February price hike coming, why it would be so weak? And then even more broadly for all of 2022, I think the guidance you gave on TAG revenues seems to match almost what you would expect in pricing. So it seems like there's maybe not a whole lot of net volume. Maybe you can give us a little more color on why that would be. Thinking of giving few range for production this year. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Bob to clarify, I was highlighting architectural volume in our first half to be flat to down. And it's because we had such a strong start to our first half last year. If you look at our first quarter, Consumer was up 25, the North America paint stores were up high single-digits and TAG was up high single-digits in our first quarter. So I was referring to volume. And our full year TAG being up mid- to high single-digits, with the comment being that, our North America paint stores would be at or above the high end of that range. If you annualize the price increases, you're going to get to a mid-to-high single-digits. So volume I would expect to be up and our North America paint stores to be low to mid. Does that make sense? Bob Koort : Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then I'm just curious, if you guys have any insight on, trying to figure out, if there was double ordering, if there were maybe some false bookings throughout 2021 as your customers were scrambling in a scarcity mode is there any risk, or how do you \u2013 do you have confidence that there wasn't some of that and maybe the underlying demand is slightly weaker than you'd expect? And how do you get that comfort? John Morikis : Bob, that's not a concern for me at all. And we've got tremendous comfort and confidence that the demand is real. And as we look at the bidding activity that's taking place, the job requests that are taking place, we can verify that. So the demand is real. We've got great confidence in that. Bob Koort : That\u2019s clear. Thank you, John. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First, look I understand raw material inflation is kind of a moving target. But if we took a snapshot as we sit today in January, I'm hoping you can discuss by fourth quarter 2022, whether raw material inflation embedded in guidance is still up year-over-year or down? And then for your full year 2022, low double-digit to mid-teens inflation could you just break out expectations by your segments? Jim Jaye : Yes, Truman. What I would say is for the full year, we're expecting as we said that low double-digit to mid-teens inflation. It should be the highest in the first quarter and I would expect it to sequentially improve as the year goes on and the comparisons get a little bit easier. But I think even in our fourth quarter, you're likely to see us up low and mid-singles in the fourth quarter. I think the strong demand that's out there is helping to support the inflation that's out there. I would again expect by segment probably to still see pretty highest inflation in our Performance Coatings Group. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Truman. The only other comment I would make on that just to reiterate, still we talked about last year the increase in raw materials was heavily weighted to our Performance Coatings. When I say that about 60%. We expect to see a little bit less than that this year. But also just you said, it our line of sight on raw material inflation is probably at best two quarters out. So looking at third or second half of this year, we'll continue to monitor the basket as we have throughout 2021. And if we see any change or increase in inflation will react with pricing quickly like we did last year. Truman Patterson : Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And then in the fourth quarter TAG, margins fell 660 bps year-over-year. And I know that leverage is a \u2013 volume leverage is a key component to your operating model. I'm hoping you can help us parse out how much of this was due to volumes declining, we'll call it high single digits versus this price/cost dynamic that's going on? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Truman, as I've said in the past, volume is the single biggest driver of operating margin improvement and that is especially the case in our TAG organization. And I would say that is almost 100% driven by the volume decline. And if I may, I'd just like to recap the fourth quarter across each of the segments just to kind of talk about this year level set and move on to 2022. But if you look at TAG, as I mentioned, it's all volume-driven that margin. If we look at consumer, it was better than our sales guidance but primarily due to non-paint sales increasing. And if you look at the paint gallons being less than what we expected, that again, that volume really impacts our operating margin. But we also had because global supply chain is embedded in our Consumer Brands Group because of availability we didn't meet the production plans that we had planned. So, the supply chain inefficiency and higher raw material costs probably equally impacted the Consumer segment. So, volume is the number one driver of that impact but then the other two are probably equally weighted. And then you get into our Performance Coatings Group, nice sales gain. But again the raw material increase quarter-to-quarter that we saw and for the full year was really about 60%-plus of the sequential increase. So, we took the front of the incremental increase in raw materials and that really drove what the impact on margins. And as we've said this is the one segment that has more work to do on pricing to chase the increase in raw materials. They're out as I mentioned earlier with additional pricing in our first quarter and our expectation is that we will get on top of raw materials this year and see segment -- operating segment margin improvement in our second half. Truman Patterson : Hey Al for clarity. I lost you a little bit on the TAG segment commentary for clarity. The overwhelming majority almost all of it was entirely due to the margin decline not dollar decline was due to that lost volume leverage? Al Mistysyn : That's right. That's right Truman. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Truman. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Still want to pursue the TAG guidance for 2022 of up mid to high single-digit percentage. I think you said earlier that your volume might be up low to mid-single-digits. I mean if your prices are going to be up some high single-digit number, I realize there's a slight bit of negative currency. I don't see how your TAG range should be mid to high single-digits unless you expect flat or negative volume growth? Al Mistysyn : Yes. What we talked about is our North America stores being up at the high end or above the high end of that range. And if you look at so you're thinking 8% to 13% -- 12% -- or 8% to 12%. If you look at the paint stores price increase the cadence of the increases if you think about how we annualize the price increases in paint stores we're going to be up low double-digit in our first quarter high single-digit in our first half. And that will moderate as we go through the second half to get to a mid to high single-digits. So, that's how I get to kind of the low to mid volume. Jeff Zekauskas : Yes, I don't see why it would moderate really in the third quarter maybe -- I mean to that level. But to put that aside your SG&A costs I think were up 2% for the year. So, was it that there was a lagging effect to whatever inflation you're experiencing in SG&A and you expect it to be up much more, or can you talk about your SG&A inflationary expectations in a little bit more detail? Al Mistysyn : Sure. We look at -- although we don't really provide the full guidance by line, but to give you some direction we do expect to get leverage on our SG&A as the year progresses. We'll continue to invest as John mentioned in 80 to 100 new stores in TAG plus in our digital platform. We'll continue to look for opportunities to invest in the Pro paints within our consumer segment and other key initiatives there. And then servicing programs through our Performance Coatings Group, but we're still going to be very focused on controlling our non-customer-facing SG&A. And I would say if you look at how our volume unfolds throughout the year, the first half will be slower than our second half like I mentioned. So we expect to see more leverage in our second half on SG&A than we see in our first half. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Thank you so much. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hi, guys. Good morning. Just curious in TAG, given you don't have as much volume or gallons as you want. How are you sort of allocating those amongst customers? And are there particularly areas in the country are more profitable? Can you maximize mix and profitability as you think about where to put your limited volume at this point? John Morikis : I think there's a lot of really good work that's taking place, Mike, and it's a pretty good observation of you -- on your part, because we've had to make some decisions. And some of those decisions include paring down the product line to ensure that we have the products that were needed. We've really, I think, done a terrific job in utilizing the resources or the raw materials that have become available and we treat those precious raw materials just as that. So we're manufacturing products that could best fit the needs of our customers. And there are times when we're giving customers a product that will fit their needs, but it may not have been the product that they came in to get. And so we're working with them. And I would say this, that as we exit this, the line of sight that we've established and the relationships that we've built with our customers is one of the reasons that we're so excited about how do you turn something bad into something good. The relationships are stronger, because our teams are working with our customers in a very unique way. They may come in talking about wanting a product and our teams work with them to understand what is the project? What are you doing? Let me get this product for you and we're keeping our customers in paint. And that's been a big mantra within the TAG organization, is keeping our customers. And that responsiveness, particularly at the store and rep level is a point of differentiation. We've got a number of stores out there and we're leveraging the inventory and availability in those stores in a way that, quite frankly, most companies couldn't do. And I'm really proud. We talk a lot about One Sherwin, a mentality of doing what's best for the company. And so, there's a sharing of inventory as close to the customer as possible to be as responsive as possible. So we're not -- we're trying not to get to the decision point that you make about which customer to serve. What we're trying to do is, get to the point where we're answering the question of what product can we get this customer to keep them moving, keep them making paint and keep them providing for their families. And as a result of that, our view of their projects has improved. They are sharing more information with us. And that's why when we asked -- we were asked earlier about the confidence that we have in the demand, why we think it's as solid as we believe is our customers, as we've worked through this are sharing more with us than they ever have before. They trust us. We're working with them and we're partners. And so, we're giving them products to get them off their projects on to the next ones, the next project and they're making money doing it. Mike Sison : Got it. And as a quick follow-up, given that our cash have surprised to the upside, one game out of first place, but if you were to see upside or where you think you guys could surprise to the upside in 2022, where do you think you can do that? And particularly what's in your control to do that? John Morikis : Well, we're going to surprise. I would tell you this. If you look back over the last two years, while we've generated over $5.6 billion in net operating cash and we've returned $6.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, we've also been investing in this business, Mike. So in our North America paint stores we've opened 133 new stores, net new stores, 180 new reps. We've added probably over 2,800 management trainees to make sure that we have a really strong future pipeline. We've invested in our pros who paints with our Consumer Brands partners on the Performance Coating side, we're adding services and solutions that we really believe our customers are willing to pay for, because it's helping them make more money and that's what we're focused on. We've not talked about this yet, but we've been investing in innovation. And some might say, well, how can you invest in innovation. To your first question, when we're sitting here with raw materials, having to make tough decisions about which products we're going to make, would you be investing in innovation? And the answer is yes. We are investing in innovation. In fact, if you look over the last 10 years, we've averaged probably over 20 new products per year and that's really important. It's an important part of our strategy. And I know that firsthand, because I can remember when I was a store manager, and just learning to sell a product. And those new products made a pretty average salesperson a much better salesperson. I would tell you, it helped me a lot. And I think it gave me confidence, and it gives our people confidence. And most importantly, I think it gives our customers confidence. And so we're investing in these products. And these products are solutions that our customers use to help their business. And we think we're uniquely positioned to be responsive to those customers' needs in both \u2013 the needs they have that they can articulate and sometimes the unarticulated the things that they may not know. And so it should be no surprise that, one of the surprises that we have coming down the pipe, include breakthrough technologies in areas of durability, scuff resistance, mar resistance. And it's clear with the surge in COVID variants, a key emphasis in the market right now is keeping surfaces clean. And so you'll be hearing about some of these surprises as you say of our self-cleaning technology platforms as we move forward. But right now, naturally we're focused on the precious raw material allocation and servicing our customers. But rest assured that that's an important part of what we're doing. I think the other areas that you should expect that might surprise is the output of the capital expenditures that we're making. We talked about capacity utilization and the incremental capacity that we've added. We've added $670 million over the last two years. We're going to get every ounce of money out of those. We're going to put those assets to work and we're going to use them hard. I also think the \u2013 and this is a bit longer term, but as you're asking about surprises I think people will be surprised as we've invested in our new R&D facility and I just mentioned innovation. While that's not going to be in the short term, it's going to be an important part of what helps drive our company forward, because I think the collaboration that we're going to get from our wonderful technology people that's really going to be exciting. And then I guess just thinking off the top of my head, the last thing that I would add would be the utilization of this Specialty Polymers asset that we acquired. I think our ability to respond and our ability to really outperform the market and really de-risk some of what comes inherent from the Gulf Coast is we believe going to be a differentiator as well. So those are things Mike I want to talk about. There's a lot more that we have up our sleeves. We're pretty excited over here about what we're working on. We could talk about themes like what's coming down the pipe and digital and some of the other areas. But I've got a lot of confidence that, while we're excited about what we've accomplished and this quarter we would like to have a better fourth quarter but I'm really excited about where we're headed. And I really do believe that, the best is ahead. We're just getting started. Mike Sison : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Steve Byrne : John, you just mentioned this Pros Who Paint. What exactly is that initiative? How can you help Lowe's capture more paint contractor business? And do you see any risk from a recent initiative at Home Depot to do something similar? John Morikis : Well, we respect all our competitors Steve. So we don't just stick our head in the sand and say nothing is a risk. In fact, we often talk about a healthy paranoid life, which means we take everything as serious and nothing for granted. But what the Pros Who Paint is an initiative that really drives effort towards these contractors, who paint as a part of a project. So our stores are focused on the painting contractor those that wake up every day with a goal of applying paint. There's a whole host of contractors out there that could be remodelers or could \u2013 in fact, I would say, nearly every project out there, nearly every project, ends with paint on the project. And so there are customers that prefer a different shopping environment than a paint store. And the reason is they might want to pick up drywall, they might want to pick up cabinets. They might want to pick up plumbing, whatever it might be. And so they choose their preference to be a home center platform. We've got a terrific relationship with a number of our Consumer Brands customers to focus in on this Pros Who Paints. And we believe that there's a terrific opportunity in many cases to apply what we've learned through our TAG business both in services and actions as well as product technology to bring and to help our customers better penetrate those customers that prefer that format. And while we have had some very limited success in that through our stores, I'd say that the terrific opportunity for us is to have much greater penetration through our home center partners just as they may have had some success with painters. We think by looking at the market and finding these opportunities and really putting the effort in product services, all the different unique nuances on helping those customers make more money will ultimately benefit everyone. Steve Byrne : And then just one more on this year-over-year issue with respect to TAG. You noted the year-ago volumes were very strong and you have that year-over-year headwind. Is there a component of that year-over-year volume drag that is also has a mix shift impact on price? If the year-ago volumes were more DIY than TAG, did that result in a price benefit that is a year-over-year drag that is also something that's being reflected in the guide? John Morikis : No, I wouldn't say that's the case Steve. But when you bring up mix shift where I jump to is wanting to clarify that what we are experiencing is a very positive mix shift. Our highest quality products are the ones in greatest demand. And you could talk about a lot of issues. One we've not talked about yet is labor, and when you talk about painting contractors trying to get as much done as possible. They are all very well aware that getting the most out of a project, getting in and out with less callbacks being able to go back and touch up if you will, getting the lowest price gallon of paint is not the answer, in fact just the opposite. And we do believe that part of this specialty store experience and quite frankly in many cases what we are either now or will be bringing to our home center partners allows our contractors to be more productive. So again we're looking at helping our contractors make their labor some of whom may not be as experienced as they would like we're helping to make those laborers much more productive and more professional in their output or their finished products than they would in a lower quality you want to pay. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. See the only thing I would add is just as a reminder DIY related to -- relative to paint stores is probably about 10%. When I was talking about architectural volume in our first half versus a difficult comp that included both TAG and Consumer and Consumer had a\u2026 Jim Jaye : 25%. Al Mistysyn : 25% growth in their first quarter last year. Steve Byrne : Okay. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Thank you Steve. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. A lot of the questions I guess have been asked. So maybe I'll just ask a couple of questions on a particular couple of verticals. So could you update us on what you're seeing in commercial construction and MRO? I know those are markets that had, kind of, lagged during the pandemic. Has there been any improvement there? I imagine not just given the lingering effects but maybe you can just address that first? John Morikis : Underlying demand I'd say in commercial is solid. Sales we've been challenged in some of these areas as we've been pumping through availability, but of product but I'd say it feels pretty good. And the reason I say that Arun is that these projects are beginning to come back online and reaching the paint stage in many cases. Our customers in this space have reported some of the labor constraints that we've talked about they're not only impacting the paint business. So these guys are waiting for drywallers who may be fighting for more labor to get the drywall done sooner and you keep moving up the food chain. So it's having an impact on the entire flow of the project. But as Jim mentioned, if you look at the Dodge Momentum Index it's strong. And we have a lot of confidence that it will continue. I'm sorry the other segment you asked about was -- MRO from a -- well, I'd say maybe on a broader sense, we could answer MRO because I think it also fits this, but maybe I could help you with Protective & Marine because it fits underneath that very well. Our business here was up and very strong. We're up double-digits. And there's a lot of really good work here. We have spoken about our strength in petrochem and the opportunities there. The work that we've been doing in the adjacent markets is beginning to pay off. We're excited about that. And as government spending on infrastructure continues to work its way through. While it may not be immediate, if you look longer term, we're really well positioned for that and working hard to capture that as well. So really, really, good. If you look at the professional side of every TAG segment that we have, we've got tremendous confidence. It's a very strong market from a demand standpoint and as I mentioned, I know that from my years of experience, you know that when pricing is flowing through from our customer -- from us to our customers as well as it is. And from them to their customers, because their customers simply want the projects done and they're willing to pay to get it. It's an indicator for us of the strength of the market. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. And just as a follow-up, maybe I can just ask about free cash flow and uses there. So it appears that maybe working capital could be a drag as you kind of sell higher-priced inventory and raws, is that right, or is it building inventory that would actually maybe benefit working capital as you move through 2022. And so, could you just help us understand free cash flow growth in 2022 expectations, and then uses thereof, I mean have you seen valuation multiples remain elevated and thus most excess cash will be used for buybacks? Is that how we should think about free cash flow and its use here? Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Yeah, Arun. I think what we're expecting that we'll generate a slightly higher net operating cash in 2022 with the improvement in net income to your point partially offset by the increase in working capital. We expect to end of the year with significantly more architectural inventory gallons than we ended in 2021. Plus, you're correct, there's some inflation there. As far as CapEx, as John talked about, we expect that to be about 1.9% or $415 million plus another $450 million for the Building Our Future projects. That does not include incentives. So we'll see some cash out less than that $450 million. Dividends we expect the net 9% increase to 240. That's about a $630 million number, up 8%. So your free cash flow is going to go backwards. But as far as M&A is concerned when you look at our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio it was up 2.9% at the end of this year, our forecast is really for the debt-to-EBITDA approach the high-end of our range. So at two to 2.5 times, we expect debt to be flat and really what's driving that leverage ratio down is the increase in EBITDA. So from a balance sheet standpoint, we're going to have capacity to acquire and we're going to continue to pursue acquisitions that fit our strategy and we do expect to close the previously announced Sica acquisition in our first quarter. But -- and then you're right, absent additional M&A, we're going to buy our stock back. We're going to be continue to be very consistent in our capital allocation philosophy and we're not going to hold cash. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question. Mike Harrison : Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you can break down the raw material situation a little bit further for us. How do you see some of these specific raw material baskets behaving this year? As you look at resins, pigments solvents, additives and packaging, are you still seeing some of those go up significantly, while others are stable or maybe moderating? Jim Jaye : Yes Mike, a couple of comments there. I would say in '22, I think the biggest increase is you'll -- we're still expecting will be monomers, resins, solvents and packaging. We look at propylene as we've often talked about, and that really is critical to about 60% or so of our raw material basket. Been a little bit of a disconnect here recently. We've seen propylene ticking down, but we haven't necessarily seen it in the things that we're buying that come from that feedstock. I think part of that is because of the strong demand environment that we're in. I think that also on the TiO2 side, we're seeing that tick up as well. Inventories remain tight, given the strong demand but we feel very good about our supply of TiO2, given the really strong relationships that we have with our suppliers. Mike Harrison : All right. And then my other question is on the COVID situation. It seems like two weeks ago that was kind of dominating the conversation. Maybe just give us an update on, how you're seeing the Omicron impact playing out relative to where you were two weeks ago? John Morikis : Well, I'd say it's improving. We're no different than what you would see in the marketplace itself. So, we saw the same spike and kind of decline that the rest of the country saw. So we are excited to try to get this behind us. As we mentioned earlier Mike, we're tired of talking about this stuff. I don't want to talk about COVID. I don't want to talk about raw materials. I want to talk about growing sales and growing profits. So we can try to give you a forecast and what's happening, but we're just going to do what we do. We've got a lot of determination on this side and backed up with a lot of skill in scar tissue. And I'd rather really not even answer this and just tell you we're going to fight through this. That's what we do. Mike Harrison : All right. Fair enough. Thanks very much. John Morikis : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good afternoon. John, Al just looking at Q1, how should we think about the improvement or the growth in TAG earnings versus Q4? Al Mistysyn : Yes. So David, if you look at our fourth quarter in TAG, I talked about the volumes and the impact there. When you look at it coming into our first quarter, we're still going to see elevated raw material costs really the highest in our -- highest cost quarter for the year is our expectation. We do expect our TAG sales to be up by a low-to-mid single digit which tells you with the higher price that our volumes are going to be backwards which again is going to put pressure on our margins. But when you look at it sequentially, we do expect to see improvement in our dollars and in our margin. It's a small quarter, so any driver of volume, specifically when we look -- talk about the first quarter and fourth quarter, we talked about exterior sales in the Southeast and Southwest, driving the performance and assuming those hit the forecast we need to hit and expect them to hit, we should be ahead of our fourth quarter TAG EBIT margin and profit dollars. David Begleiter : Great. And just briefly John, looking at price realization on announced price increases this cycle versus prior cycles seem to be doing a little bit better. Why is that? And is it sustainable going forward? John Morikis : Well, I think for all the reasons David that we just talked about. But actually, maybe a little more. I'd say, it's certainly a market where supply and demand is such that our customers have the confidence that speaks to the demand. But I would also say that, our teams, if it's in our consumer business with Todd Ray and his team working really hard to help our customers be more successful or in our TAG business with Heidi Petz and her team aligning to make sure that our customers, I talked earlier about keep our customers in paint, working hard to develop products and services that have them at the right place at the right time to be able to do that or Justin Binns on our Performance Coatings side. I mean, we're not just simply reporting. We're not just responding. Customer wants this, we don't have it. That's not who we are. What we're trying to do is influence as greatly as possible. So, we're aligning closely with our customers, where we often talk about running to the center of the fire. We're running to our customers. We're trying to understand what is it that they need, how do we respond the best as we can. Yes, there's challenges. What do we do to keep you in paint to keep you moving. And as a result of that, I think, while we're trying to help our customers to be successful and if it's a public company helping them to reach their goals, their numbers or a private company, who's just trying to feed their family, our goals are aligned with their goals. And when we do our jobs, we don't have to get fat and crazy with money. We ask for our fair share, for our shareholders, while we're helping them. And that's the focus that we have. And because I think we're working really hard to do that and focusing on their success, we're adding more success in executing the price increases. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. John last year many projects got delayed with rising lumber and steel prices. In lumber after declining in second half of last year, the prices are on the move again and have gone up this year. So do you think that's a concern for construction remodeling as project costs have gone up significantly? John Morikis : No, I don't. If you look at the LIRA as an example, and other indicators that we look at P.J., there's a very strong demand, it's a strong backlog. And I've actually heard people, including one of them on my staff named my CFO, who bought an item that was going to be a slight delay in getting it, and the price was variable. Now not everyone may have that patience or ability to just say, okay, I want it, I'll pay whatever the market is at that time. But there are a lot of people out there that have been pushing off the remodel of their home, or the addition that they need, or an area that requires remodeling, because it's either aging in place or the home itself needs to be fixed. And many of them quite frankly are looking at it with the idea that prices are going up, I want to get this done and get the best price as I can right now, because it looks like this may continue. But I would tell you that I think the question that you're asking once again going back to demand. Demand is very strong. P.J. Juvekar: Great. In light of time, I\u2019ll pass it along. Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you, P.J. Al Mistysyn : Thank you, P.J. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Al, I think you addressed sequential earnings in TAG already, but I'm tempted to ask about Performance Coatings in that regard, so 4Q into 1Q. If we look at history, I think, there are examples of that segment trending flat up and down in 1Q versus 4Q. Do you have a strong feeling of directional sequential trend in performance for 1Q 2022? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin, I do believe we're going to see sequential improvement. I think that team -- for a couple of reasons. First, the team has done a terrific job of putting in price increases aggressively throughout 2021 and the need to go again in 2022. There's no backing off on that team, the discipline around knowing they need to get the price and getting it, they are. Along with the volumes that we're seeing, we talked about our first quarter being up mid to high teens, with a high or low double-digit increase in price in our first quarter that tells you volume should be low to mid. And I think that's going to help drive that improvement as well. Kevin McCarthy : Excellent. And then I wanted to follow-up on the three acquisitions that you referenced. Can you talk through the financial impact of those deals recognizing that they're in various stages of closing? For example, what is the contribution to sales that you're thinking about that's embedded in your guidance for the first quarter? Al Mistysyn : Yes. For the first quarter, you know what, I would look at it net. If you look at the ANZ divestiture net of acquisitions, it\u2019d be an immaterial headwind. Sika we don't have in our first quarter, we expect to have in our first quarter. So you're really talking about Tenant and SPI and net of ANZ, it's immaterial. John Morikis : Tenant was more of a technology buy. We're going to -- we acquired that to try to take that technology and grow it throughout the company. It's a pretty small acquisition, but it does give us an opportunity. And to Al's point, the Specialty Polymers is more internal manufacturing. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich : Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the impact of volume in raws on the gross margin. If we look at last year holistically, would you say that raws were half of the 450 bps pressure and volume was the other half? Al Mistysyn : Yes. I think, it may be a little more viewed on the raw material side. And here's why I would say that, Greg, we saw raw materials really ramp up in the second half of the year and not having pricing really built in to cover that until we got into August 1. We got into a September 30 on TAG and then it was heavier on our petrochem basket and really impacted Performance Coatings. So I think raws really impacted a little bit more, because the dollar -- we couldn't offset dollar for dollar. We're close booked, couldn\u2019t offset it. And as that impacts us you really see a margin decline. In the specific though to like the fourth quarter, the TAG volume miss and TAG being down high single digits, really would have been the heavier driver in our fourth quarter. Greg Melich : Got it. Al Mistysyn : But I think if you look at it across the year it's a little heavier raws. Greg Melich : Raws would still be the driver. And I guess, the follow-up is sort of looking back at history and sort of how we get back to the margins we had in 2020. I think when you impact the last cycle in 2011 and 2012 it took two years to get back to where you were. Do you -- has the business or the company changed enough for the world that, you would expect that to happen faster or slower, the cadence of recovery? Al Mistysyn : I do think, we're different makeup of a company than we were back then, because of the Valspar acquisition. But I don't think the -- you look at the businesses within our Performance Coatings Group and the strategy around that and where we can differentiate and get paid for that. I still think that that two-year cadence is applicable. And the other thing I'd highlight is, TAG is still over 50% of our sales. And you look at the strong volume that we expect in our second half and with the pricing activities that have taken place and what we have going in, we have a real opportunity, not only to surpass. We certainly feel like the second half of this year will surpass 2020 or 2021, but really approach the 2020 operating margin. So I think at TAG, we could be there. I think the other two segments have more work to do. John Morikis : But, Greg, I would add this that we learned an awful lot. And I would say, with that learning came incredible conviction is, when there were some of those delays and it took a little bit longer, it becomes tougher to get it as time goes out. So I agree with Al and I think that's -- those are good guidelines. But I'd also say that, there's a lot of determination and conviction. We're going to push that as hard as we can. Greg Melich : That's great. Good luck guys. John Morikis : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Just a quick one here guys. New commercial construction paint has been pretty far in advance of when the buildings are completed and painted. Have you been able to go back and re-price that, or does that just have to roll through over time? John Morikis : There's not a single answer for that, John. In some cases, there are opportunities to adjust in many of them. But in some cases there's not. And so it's a case-by-case basis. John Roberts : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, John. Operator : The next question is from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Please proceed with your question. Adam Baumgarten : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Do you expect to bring back some of the SKUs you rationalized as the raw material supply improves in the back half? And if that's the case, do you expect that to have a negative impact on margins? John Morikis : Well, what I would say is that, it's not just going to be going back to business as usual. They'll go through a very disciplined approach. And the question is going to be, if we survive this long without it why do we need to bring it back? So we want to manage our inventory and our working capital very closely. So my answer would be that there's a disciplined approach. And if in fact you see a working capital investment it's because there's the proper return that comes along with that. Adam Baumgarten : Got it. And then just thinking about CapEx maybe beyond 2022, do you anticipate any additional headquarter-related CapEx in 2023? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. I think you look at what we're spending so far we are going to see another similar amount in 2023 and then have it drop off into 2024. Adam Baumgarten : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Garik Shmois : Hi. Thanks. Just one question for me. Just to be clear on the full year guidance and pricing. Are you assuming any additional pricing is needed beyond what you've announced for the first quarter? Al Mistysyn : I'd say in TAG, the assumption is that, there's no additional, I think has been consumer that will roll in, but I don't expect there's not in our guidance additional. Performance Coatings is a little different just because of the way they rolled pricing in 2021. They may have some in the first quarter they may have some rolling into the second quarter. But we're not certainly planning today to have second half price increases go in. John Morikis : I think our approach is this that we try to keep the increase to a minimum. And when you approach it that way, there can be a little more volatility. We don't want to be out in front of our customers asking for more than what we really absolutely can see with the hopes of covering what might be a future price increase. And so that introduces a little more volatility, if in fact the numbers move or the prices move we've got to respond to that. But we think it's the best approach to our customers to try to keep the pricing to a minimum and have an open discussion with them about the volatile environment that we're in. Garik Shmois : Got it. Thanks so much. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Garik. Operator : Our final question is from the line of Jaideep Pandya with On Field Research. Please proceed with your question. Jaideep Pandya : Thank you. It's really just around M&A actually. I mean, considering what has happened in the raw materials industry, and if you want to sort of look at it from a point of view of bulking up and increasing your size, do you think a large ticket consolidation on an interregional basis is an answer to this, or is this really how you're going about in-housing some of the resin capacity and verifying or rather putting more suppliers on your list is the way to go about sort of different way of asking but do you see large ticket consolidation in this industry? Because generally raw material crisis have brought coating consolidations. Thank you. John Morikis : Well, if I may just start with your first point about our desires to bulk up. I'd say that what is really the driver for our M&A strategy is our \u2013 is in fact our strategy. So it's not to be the biggest just not to do anything other than to put ourselves in a position to be able to best serve our customers. And we prefer to do that in a very unique and differentiated way, bringing them solutions that help them to be successful and profitable. And so the litmus test if you will is business by business, looking at what is it that we need to be in position to be able to serve our customers. We don't have a desire to be everything to everyone, everywhere. We're not chasing commodities. We're not it's not just about size. To us it's about driving value for our customers and shareholder value for our shareholders. And we do that by staying true to a very precise strategy. You're not going to see us jumping all over the world. Something is for sale so we're chasing it. It's \u2013 we've got a very defined strategy. And if it bounces up against our strategy and all handsets to do it we're interested. If not we're not. Jaideep Pandya : All right. Thank you so much. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Thank you. At this time I'll turn the call back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Rob. I hope you heard today how excited we are as we enter fiscal 2022, a lot of opportunity ahead of us and we're after it. I tell you that demand is strong as you heard across all of our businesses and just a lot of confidence in our people and our capabilities. So thank you for joining us today. As always, we'll be available for your follow-up calls and follow-up e-mails. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company\u2019s earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered first quarter results in line with our expectations in an environment characterized by strong demand, ongoing cost inflation and choppy raw material availability, which began improving meaningfully in the final weeks of the quarter. Sales in the quarter grew by a high single-digit percentage against a double-digit comparison a year ago, and we delivered sequential improvement and consolidated gross margin and segment margins in all of our businesses. Our margins remained under pressure on a year-over-year basis, a significant pricing actions previously announced in all businesses have not yet fully caught up to highly elevated raw material costs near-term. This remains an area of volatility. Our team is operating with confidence and momentum, as we begin to enter the painting season. Our strategy is clear and we remain focused on delivering solutions that help our customers succeed. Let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers before turning to John Morikis, who will provide some additional commentary on the quarter and our outlook. Comparisons in my comments are to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Starting with the topline, first quarter 2022 consolidated sales increased 7.4% to $5 billion. Pricing was in the low double-digit range. Volume was lower in the Consumer Brands Group and The Americas Group, primarily due to challenging prior year comparisons, along with anticipated raw material availability challenges, which are largely behind us now. Consolidated gross margin decreased to 41.1%, driven by lower sales volume, primarily due to raw material availability issues and cost inflation outpacing our price increases near-term. Our gross margin improved each month during the quarter and compared to last year. On a sequential basis, gross margin improved by 160 basis points, due primarily to additional pricing actions taken in the first quarter. SG&A expense decreased to 28.2% of sales. Our SG&A expense was 2.3% below fourth quarter 2021 and on a sequential basis was 200 basis points better. Consolidated profit before tax decreased 9.4% to $461.1 million. Sequentially, profit before tax improved by $152.2 million, or 49.3%. The quarter included $70 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense, compared to $75.6 million a year ago. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $1.41 per share versus $1.51 per share a year ago. Excluding acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense and the Wattyl divestiture first quarter adjusted diluted net income per share was $1.61 per share versus $2.06 per share a year ago. On a sequential basis, adjusted diluted net income per share increased 20.1%. EBITDA in the quarter was $693 million or 13.9% of sales. Moving on to our operating segments, sales in The Americas Group increased 5.6% against a high single-digit comparison, as low double-digit pricing offset lower volume related to challenging comparisons into raw material availability, which improved significantly over the last few weeks of the quarter and has continued to improve as we enter the second quarter. DIY volume was impacted the most, as we prioritize serving the professional contractors, which make up the largest part of our business. Segment margin decreased to 16.8%, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases and good cost control. Segment margin improved 170 basis points sequentially. Sales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 10.1%, due primarily to lower sales outside of North America and an impact of 6 percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture. This was in comparison to an extremely strong quarter a year ago, where sales were up 25%. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 12.1% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, and supply chain inefficiencies, partially offset by selling price increases. Segment margin improved 580 basis points sequentially. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 20.4%, against a double-digit comparison and were driven by volume and price increases. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 11.8% of sales, as operating leverage from the higher volume, selling price increases and good cost control were more than offset by higher raw material costs, where inflation was the highest among the company\u2019s three operating segments. Adjusted segment margin improved 290 basis points sequentially. Let me now turn the call over to John for some additional commentary on the first quarter along with our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2022. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone listening. Before getting into some color on our three segments, I\u2019d like to frame today\u2019s call with some themes we are seeing across the business. First, demand remains very strong across most of the business. Our teams are highly engaged and focused on growing volume through new accounts and share of wallet, as well as reactivating customers that may have shopped elsewhere to meet the needs of a specific project over the past year due to product availability challenges. Second, raw material availability improved meaningfully late in the quarter and this has continued into the second quarter. We do not expect lack of raw materials to have a material impact on sales going forward. To be clear, the supply chain has not completely recovered, as the bottleneck has now largely moved from suppliers\u2019 production to their transportation and logistics. In the near-term, we are speeding this recovery by employing our own fleet and tank wagons to supplement suppliers\u2019 delivery capabilities. Our ability in this area is unique among our competitors. We are also focusing on SKU prioritization and formulations to make the most of the raw materials that are available to us. Additionally, the Specialty Polymers acquisition is meaningfully contributing to our resin needs. Third, inventory in our stores and distribution centers is in a markedly better place than it was at the end of December. The 50 million gallons of incremental architectural capacity we brought on in the fourth quarter is up and running. As the supply of raw materials improves, we are quickly converting those materials to paint. In fact, we made more architectural paint gallons in March than in any previous month in our company\u2019s history. We expect to run this additional capacity at a high rate to keep up with demand through the painting season and then begin building inventory in our fourth quarter as we typically would. And looking to the future, we announced a $300 million investment to begin expanding production and distribution at our Statesville, North Carolina architectural facility that serves both TAG and CBG, which will be completed in 2024. Finally, inflation remains significant and is trending toward the high end of the guidance we previously provided. In addition to raw materials, we have seen increases in other elements of the cost basket including freight, energy and labor. As we have said in the past, our continuous improvement efforts are focused on offsetting these increased costs. Additionally, we have been aggressive with pricing actions in all of our businesses to offset these costs and we will continue to do so as necessary. As far as our first quarter, I will keep my comments brief in order to get to our outlook. The Americans Group, sales growth in the first quarter was led by Protective and Marine and Property Management, both of which were up by a double-digit percentage. New residential, residential repaint and commercial were up by a mid single-digit percentage. DIY was down double digits, as we faced a strong double-digit comparison and prioritize sales to professional contractors. We have also begun to see margin recovery in the business as segment margin expanded sequentially. From a product perspective, exterior paint sales performed better than interior sales, with interior being the larger part of the mix. We realized a low double-digit increase in price in the first quarter, with volume remaining under pressure. The 12% price increase we announced February 1st is going in as planned. We opened for net new stores in the first quarter and still plan 80 to 100 for the year. We also continued our growth investments and sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, ecommerce and productivity enhancing services. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. While this business faced a very challenging comparison, we are encouraged by our sales in North America, which were nearly flat as we continue to focus on supporting key strategic retail partners and growing our pros who paint initiative. Sales were softer in Europe and China, as we faced double-digit comparisons and COVID-related lockdowns. Note that we have now anniversary the Wattyl divestiture, which was a drag on Group sales of about 6 percentage points in the quarter. Pricing was positive in the quarter and in the high single-digit range. Segment margin expanded significantly on a sequential basis benefiting from increased volume, leverage on SG&A and incremental pricing. Last let me comment on first quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. Group sales increased by 20.4% in the quarter, including high single-digit volume growth against a double-digit comparison. Price realization was in the low teens range, and all regions and all divisions generated growth. As in the other groups, we saw meaningful sequential margin improvement during the quarter. Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in North America, followed by Latin America, Asia and Europe. Every division in the Group grew, with nearly all by double digits, driven by robust underlying demand, new customer wins, share of wallet gains and pricing. Packaging was strongest, followed by coil, general industrial, auto refinish and industrial wood, respectively. Before moving to our outlets, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $558 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $407 million to purchase 1.45 million shares at an average price of $280.77. We distributed $150.9 million in dividends. We also invested $106.3 million in our business through capital expenditures, including $77 million in core CapEx and $29 million for our building our futures project. Additionally, the acquisition of Sika European Industrial Coatings business closed on April 1. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBIT ratio of 3.3 times, as we increased short-term borrowing to fund our share repurchases and the Sika acquisition. We expect to be closer to the high end of our 2 times to 2.5 times range by the end of the year. Turning to our outlook, as I referenced earlier, we continue to see very strong demand in North America, Pro architectural end markets, though we are facing a comparison to a strong double-digit growth quarter that was driven by very robust post-pandemic recovery. Comparisons will ease in the back half of the year. Rising mortgage rates have not made an appreciable dent in the demand for our new residential customers to this point. Should the residential demand slow, we remain extremely well-positioned in multiple architectural segments, including residential repaint and property management, which have proven to be more defensive in nature. We expect industrial demand will remain strong as the year progresses based on the outlook our customers have shared with us. Comparisons will be challenging over the remainder of the year. Demand remains strongest in North America, our largest region. European demand also remains strong, although we continue to closely monitor for potential impacts from the war in Ukraine. For the record, our sales in Russia and Belarus are well below 1% of the total company sales and we are suspending operations in these regions. In Asia and in China particular, demand has been dampened near-term by the latest COVID-19 wave. On the architectural and industrial sides, we will continue to leverage our strengths in innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution, as we expect to grow at a rate that outpaces the market. From a supply chain perspective, we believe we are through the most challenging aspects. As I described in my earlier comments, we expect this to continue improving and to have a minimal impact on sales going forward. On the cost side of the equation, we are maintaining our low double-digit to mid-teens raw material inflation guidance. Though, we are trending toward the high end of the range, driven primarily by Performance Coatings Group. There is considerable short-term volatility in the market and our visibility beyond the quarter or two is limited. We do expect the level of year-over-year inflation to remain elevated, but to moderate in the back half of the year. Our pricing actions remain on track and we are prepared for additional increases if necessary. For the second quarter of 2022, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage compared to the second quarter of 2021, inclusive of a low double-digit price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect Consumer Brands to be up by the high-teens to a low 20 percentage. And we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage. Our full year guidance is heavily second half weighted due to stronger volume, the impact of pricing actions and weaker second half 2021 comparisons. I will remind you we began 2021 with great momentum, including first half sales growth of 14.7% and adjusted EPS growth of 26.6%, before the natural disasters, supply chain and COVID issues derail the second half of the year. For the full year 2022, our guidance remains unchanged. We expect consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect The Americas group to be up a mid-to-high single-digit percentage, with North American paint stores at or above the high end of the range. We expect Consumer Brands Group to be up a low-to-mid single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a high single to low double-digit percentage. We expect diluted net income per share for 2022 to be in the range of $8.40 per share to $8.80 per share, compared to $6.98 per share, earn in 2021. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share $9.25 and $9.65, an increase of 16% at the midpoint over the $8.15 we delivered in 2021. The additional data points we provided last quarter on full year currency exchange, tax rate, CapEx, interest expense, depreciation and amortization are unchanged. As we enter the heart of the painting season, we remain confident our strategy, our capabilities, and the differentiated product and service solutions we bring to customers. The 61,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams are focused on the tasks at hand and there is no better team in the industry. Our business remains extremely well-positioned and we are emerging as an even stronger Sherwin-Williams following the challenges we faced the last two years. I am excited by the momentum we are gaining as we progress towards what we expect will be a very strong second half of the year. In addition to today\u2019s call, I will remind you, we will provide additional commentary on the market and our business at our upcoming Financial Community Presentation event scheduled for Wednesday, June 8th in New York City. Details are available on our website and we are very much looking forward to seeing many of you in person. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am wondering if you could just talk about your volume possibilities in TAG in the second quarter. If I sort of back out the price we think you are going to get in the second quarter to sort of imply some volume. I am just wondering how much better you might be able to do versus that and if you are concerned that maybe just I know you had big volume production in March. But is there any limit at all for the amount of volume you could flow through the stores in the second quarter? John Morikis : Yeah. Vincent, maybe the way I will go out this is, just to take a quick run through the different segments and give you a little bit of color on the demand, because I think that speaks to what you are asking here. So let me start with raspberry paint and tell you that our customers are experiencing really strong backlogs. There\u2019s a positive mix shift in quality that\u2019s also taking place and we believe that plays really well to our advantage. So when you talk about volume, our ability to grow our volume faster than market also includes the ability to drive greater productivity through for our contractors is this quality that we are providing them helps to provide the finished product that a more experienced painter applicator might be able to apply and so we are helping them do that with through product. If you look at this area, you would clearly see home appreciation driving demand. LIRA their forecasting for the growth in 2022 is in double digits. If you look at the NHAB -- NAHB Remodeling Index is strong well above 50. And existing home sales have slowed year-over-year against a very strong comp in lack of inventory, but overall it\u2019s a very strong market for us. So we expect to continue to see a good strong demand market in residential repaint our contractors are telling us. I mentioned many of them are looking through the end of the year with a pretty solid backlog of projects and we are going to grow with those customers. But this is an area that we absolutely expect to continue to grow our market share pretty aggressive rate. Property Maintenance is -- really underlying demand is solid here as well. There\u2019s been delayed maintenance that\u2019s now being addressed and we see improved areas and apartment turns along with the return to travel, office, even school that\u2019s driving demand. And I\u2019d say, in this area as well there\u2019s an increased awareness of the need to keep these assets fresh, current and clean, and as you know, paint is inexpensive, yet impactful solution in this area. Commercial, I would say, the underlying demand here is also solid. Projects are resuming albeit at varying paces, but the starts are positive. Customers are reporting labor constraints and material shortages on these projects are acting as governors of growth. So any aspect of this project that could be anything from drywall to roofing project -- products, anything could have an impact here that\u2019s could be significant. Dodge Momentum Index here is strong, as is the Architectural Building Index, which has been positive for straight months, and as you know, that tracks the current building by architects, which generally leads to the commercial construction spending nine months to 12 months out. And the other area, obviously, that we are really focused on is new residential, we got a great position here and growing by the way, starts and permits remain strong year-over-year with multifamily stronger than single, but both really terrific markets for us. Completions are softer due to material availability here, in some cases, labor as well. We have not seen a meaningful slowdown, as I mentioned earlier from rising mortgage rates, which are still low in comparison to other periods. In this area, we have gotten a lot of questions about throughout the quarter and I thought I\u2019d just highlight one area, this article by USA today that I think captures kind of the sentiment that we have in new residential. They talked about the housing unit shortfall ranging between 5.5 million and 6.8 million, despite an annual average of 1.5 million new housing units completed and a 1.7 million spike in 2020 alone, a new construction would need to accelerate to a pace that\u2019s well above this current trend to more than 2 million housing units per year to close this gap. Even if building were to continue at the current level, the most rapid pace in more than a decade, it still take more than 20 years to close the 5.5 million unit gap. So as I mentioned, we have got a strong position here. We are determined to get stronger here. And I will tell you that, regardless of what happens in these professional areas, way that we have been driving this company for years now with our strategy development and strategy deployment is to be in position to capitalize on it whichever way it tilts. So if any one of these areas should for some reason slow down, we have worked really hard to position ourselves to be able to capitalize on whichever way the market might shift to and we believe that we would be able to capitalize on it. I am going to touch on one more area then I am going to ask Al to talk on the volume a little bit further as DIY. We did talk about the fact that DIY behaved as we expected. As demand continued to return to more normal level and this was against, as I mentioned earlier, difficult comp. But we also prioritized our professional contractors and our key strategic customers in our Consumer Brands business that impacted this DIY business. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. As I -- just as a level set on our January call, we talked about our expectation for the first half architectural volume, which includes Consumer and TAG to be flat to down low-single digits primarily because of the difficult comps that John talked about. In our second quarter with our TAG sales projected be up high low, high single to low-double digits with price up low-double digits and volume flat to down slightly. That\u2019s a sequential improvement for the first quarter. So we talked about the first quarter being down mid-single, flat to down slightly in the second quarter. That leads you to the momentum on an easier comp in the second half. We talked about the full year TAG sales of mid-to-high single digits with North America paint stores at or above the high end of that range. When you look at price low-double digit in our first half, as you analyze the price increases we took in in the second half of last year, our price in the second half will trend for the year to be at mid-to-high which gets you a low-to-mid single-digit volume growth in TAG and North America paint stores and I fully expect that to be the case. Vincent Andrews : Thanks so much. John Morikis : Thank you, Vincent. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Can you comment on the effects of raw material shortages on volumes in the first quarter? And can you talk about your volumes in the first quarter in residential repaint and new residential, commercial, what was the business like excluding the volume contraction in DIY? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Jeff, on raw material availability, what I would say is, we talked about on our year end call that we thought it might be a low single-digit to mid headwind. The way the quarter rolled out with availability, we saw some choppiness in January, improved in February. As John talked about, it was significantly better into March and into -- and it continues to improve in April. And in the data points that I have to show that, as John talked about, March was a single largest architectural production volume on -- in the history of the company. We significantly improved architectural gallons from December year end through the end of March. It\u2019s not our historic levels, but it is a significant improvement 20 plus million gallon increase. So, I think, to pinpoint exactly how much availability had on the quarter, it\u2019s really tough, because I look at how much of that would have been in sales versus how much we could have put in inventory. The fact is, the availability behind us, we have a lot of confidence to fill our 50 million gallons of additional capacity, along with the help of SPI. And the other data point I would highlight is, our expectation for architectural inventory through our seasonally highest second quarter and third quarter sales quarters to be flattish from the first quarter. As you know, Jeff, historically, our inventory would decline through the summer quarters, because you can\u2019t keep up with the volume. Because of the capacity we put in, we are going to be able to keep up with the sales volumes and increased buying inventory in our fourth quarter similar -- getting back similar to where we were back in 2019 and significantly higher than the last two years. John Morikis : Yeah. The only thing I would add to those great responses. I think the trend of manufacturing will continue to your point all the way through till probably this time next year, we will run our assets hard to build that inventory back up. And maybe clarifying point that I think is important is that to your question about volume on each of those segments, Jeff, I don\u2019t need to break them all down, because they were all very similar. They all improved as the quarter improved, quarter went on. Jeff Zekauskas : Were they higher for the quarter or lower? John Morikis : Year-over-year they were lower? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Jeff, they would be lower, primarily because of the more difficult comps that we had. Whereas repaint was up -- raspberry paint, new res, DIY roll up strong double digits and new res and commercial were up as well. So tougher comp in our first quarter. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And for my second question, the -- are you done with price increases in The Americas Group, you have commented in your slides that you have more pricing actions to go in Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings. But I didn\u2019t see that in America. So are we done in Americas for this year? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Jeff, I wouldn\u2019t say we are done. I would say, when we look at the visibility and the volatility we have in the market around, not just raw materials, but other input costs. That visibility is out one quarter at best. I think what you will see us do is like we have in the past. We will monitor those input costs very closely and if we see a meaningful or if we see a meaningful change in them, we are prepared and discipline to go out with additional price. Similar to what we did last year, we went out August 1st 8% and we went out in September with a surcharge. So we have to monitor these situations closely and really react to what we anticipate. Jeff Zekauskas : Great. Thank you so much. John Morikis : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is live. Josh Spector : Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just on the consumer side, I mean, kind of goes to some of your prior points on The Americas Group. Just wondering how much of the 20% growth would you say as volume refill versus pricing moving up from the high single-digit level? John Morikis : The -- if I look at the -- you say the 20% growth in our first quarter. Josh, are you talking about our second\u2026 Josh Spector : Sorry. In your second quarter guide? John Morikis : Sorry. Thank you. When you look at high-teens, low 20%, expect price to be up a similar amount. As TAG, we have significantly easier comps, which was down strong double-digit. I think when you look at our inventory build. We had an inventory built in the first quarter through our strategic partners. As you would expect, we were in a similar situation that we talked about as the third quarter and fourth quarter went on, we drove our inventories down across the chain, both the TAG, Consumer and our retail partner. So we did have to build some inventory at store level with these partners. But really the -- we did have a weak comp, we expect North America to be strong, we do expect with Asia and Europe to be softer in our second quarter. That\u2019s about 15% of our sales and pretty strong comps outside the U.S. and Europe and Asia. So, I don\u2019t have an exact number to say, how much was building versus sell-through, but rest assured, we had to build inventory in our first quarter in our retail partners. Josh Spector : Thanks. And I guess just as a follow up, are you seeing any change in the Consumer channel or -- and the DIY channel, either your own stores or in your Consumer Brands group? I guess as pricing goes up, is there any trade down or any things generally pretty stable? John Morikis : No. I\u2019d say they are pretty stable. I\u2019d say in -- as it relates to the Consumer side of our stores and in our Consumer Brands customers. I\u2019d say in our Professional side, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing more of a positive mix shift moving into higher quality rather than shift down. Josh Spector : Thank you. John Morikis : Again, that\u2019s driven mainly off of labor and the design of the painting contractor has to be as productive as they can, so they can attack the backlog that they are facing. Thank you, Josh. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Parkinson from Mizuho. Your line is live. Chris Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much. So you had a little on the raw material shortages? Can you hit on your own, as well as probably the industry\u2019s efforts to further backward integrate into certain resins and also some additives? Just where do we stand with that and when should the investment community see the effects from those efforts? Thank you. John Morikis : Well, importantly, our customers are starting to see the effects as we purchased this SPI with the idea of really trying to leverage that asset, Chris, I think, it\u2019s doing that and it\u2019s only going to get better for us. I don\u2019t think you should expect us to continue further upstream. We believe -- we have always had a resin strategy and we have always manufactured resin. SPI was a top producer for us, terrific people, terrific assets and an opportunity to get in there and get the most out of that that set of assets. It also, as you mentioned, as we mentioned, when we announced this, it helped us to deleverage, if you will, a little bit of the dependence on the Gulf Coast, these manufacturing facilities are on Each Coast and to get a little bit away from some of the hurricane risk that, while they are on the coast or inland and terrific assets. We are already starting to see more productivity out of these assets. We expect that to continue. There will be some investments in there, but very reasonable with great return. We don\u2019t expect us to get into the additives, TiO2 business, that\u2019s not where we belong. Chris Parkinson : Got it. There\u2019s also been a lot of chatter just in the investment community, at least in the past quarter to just regarding market share shifts, potential market share shifts, in some part due to finish product shortages. Now that you have the opportunity to speak to all of us, what\u2019s your public response to those debates and what confidence level can you convey to us regarding your ability to maintain or likely build market share, once everything normalizes in the supply chain? Thank you so much. John Morikis : Yeah. Chris, I appreciate that question, and I\u2019d tell you that, our confidence level is very high. We can always speak to our strategy. And I will tell you that we are blessed with a control distribution model that serves us well. And we leverage this model, and that includes a strong and very consistent brand strategy. We think that branding strategy and the consistency of it is equally important. We have an innovation program designed to develop segments specific product. So because we have a control model, we are able to talk to each of these segments to understand what are the needs of these customers, what are the challenges and we develop probably products that are specific for these segments. And we do the same with our services, so that we have a very good understanding of what the needs are of these painting contractors and we build the services to help them make more money. And finally, the reason I have probably the most confidence is our people. I believe we have the best people in the industry and I am not apologetic about making that claim. We hire around 1,400 to 1,500 college graduates a year to enter our Management Trainee Program and we recruit outstanding talent. We train and develop this talent and we retain this talent. These are the people that serve our customers. And for nearly 40 years, we have been investing in this program. This training program is 40 years old. We now have thousands of graduates from our Management Training Program throughout the company. In just our TAG business, as an example, four of our five division Presidents were management trainees, our Group President was a trainee and throughout the company, we have over 26 Vice Presidents that were management trainees. And by the way, one CEO that was a training. We think this is important. Our customers, they are buying more than a gallon of paint, that -- we tell our people constantly that, companies don\u2019t compete, people do. 70% of our field leaders are graduates of our Management Training Program and they provide the leadership and direction to our tenured organization, they know what to do, they know how to win. And I say tenure, because over 7,000 of our employees are -- have greater than 20 years service. That\u2019s nearly 15% of our workforce has 20 years or more of paint experience. And these leaders created an environment where people win and they want to stay. One half of our rep force has over 10 years of service. Turnover of our customer facing reps and managers is still in single digits. In this environment still in single digits, we are hanging out of the most important assets we have and that\u2019s our people. Our people wake up every day, they focus on two things, paint and making painting contractor successful. So this specialty store format, it works for painting contractors. We have always talked about avoiding complacency in our company. In fact, we often say that complacency kills. We are working to get better every day. We were working to make our painting contractors better every day. But I will say this, I do believe this will come down to our people versus others. We have a 40-year head start, a lot of drive, a lot of determination. We are not going to win by a little bit. I am looking forward to competing against any model. Chris Parkinson : Great color. Thank you so much. John Morikis : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is live. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess just going back to your earnings guidance through iteration for 2022. The macroeconomic backdrop seems a bit less certain, especially in Europe and China, along with any potential supply disruptions in these regions as well. Now understanding that you have a wide earnings range still for the year, what would you call it as sort of incremental positives relative to initial view that are offsets to some of the risks on the global macro? Is it as simple as just better raw material access visibility or what else would you have to think about? John Morikis : Well, I\u2019d say first, we just talked a lot about people. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a third advantage. But I\u2019d also say that if you look at the assets, we have talked about that we have deployed, the responsiveness that we have. And I will say this, our Chief Procurement Officer, Colin Davie and his team are working really well with our customers and I have learned to appreciate the demonstration of rewarding suppliers who have stepped up to serve us and the suppliers have been creative in responding to our needs. The assurance of supply to your point continues to be an important element in this market and once you have that supply, I think, we demonstrated in the month of March, we had a record month in the company\u2019s history of producing product. And so, what I\u2019d say is that, it\u2019s not one thing. It\u2019s the entire ecosystem. It\u2019s everything we are doing. Everything that we bring and it\u2019s all focused and starts with one thing, the customer. So we are looking through that lens we are working back and this large 156-year-old company is learning to be nimble and quick and respond. And so I\u2019d say that, if I am looking at it from the outside in, I am looking at a lot of assets that are really positioned well to be able to respond to a high demand market. Al Mistysyn : Ghansham, I would just add to that. You look at our sequential gross margin and operating segment improvement -- sequential improvement across each of the operating segments and all the hard work that those teams have done. Ad I will highlight one in particular, Performance Coatings Group that took the really the brunt of the raw material increases in the second half have been out with price on multiple occasions. You look at our first quarter operating -- adjusted operating margin about flat year-over-year. And if you recall, the increase -- significant increases we took for raw materials for that segment were primarily in the second half. So that team has done just an absolutely terrific job getting price, holding price and its showing and we are going to see that continued improvement in our gross margin in the second quarter. We expect to see sequential improvement in our gross margin and across each of the operating segments, albeit Consumer from a historic low operating margin and adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter, but the pricing actions, the volume and all the continuous improvement efforts across each of the segments that are helping to drive our bottomline faster than our topline. So that\u2019s what gives me confidence that we are going to continue to see improvements as the year goes on. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Thanks for that. And then if we have just switched to Performance Coatings, several businesses in their packaging, coil, et cetera, have had a very, very good run volumetrically. There\u2019s lots of evidence of kind of mean reversion of consumer habits that have occurred post-COVID as mobility sort of normalizes. So as you kind of think about these various individual businesses within PCG, how do you expect the volume trend line to unfold over the next few quarters? John Morikis : Well, we are really excited to your point. We have got a lot of momentum in these businesses and there\u2019s no expectation for less if that\u2019s the question. We sit in this room, this boardroom and we talk with our teams regularly about the competence that we have. And maybe I could walk through quickly, if you would like each of these segments, just to give you a little bit of color, because there is a lot of strength, but boy, there\u2019s so much opportunity. If you look at our packaging, we had a strong double-digit growth in the quarter. In fact, each of the last three quarters we have had record quarters in this business, packaging sales, with sales of around 30% per quarter for the last three. So if you look at this business, the demand is very robust and food and beverage, our non-BPA coatings continues to gain traction. Both we and our customers are investing in capacity expansions in anticipation of a strong demand year here in 2022 and beyond. So we are thrilled about that business. The differentiation that we have in the technology and the people we have, it is just phenomenal. This is a nugget that came obviously with the Valspar acquisition as this coil. We had a double-digit growth quarter in coil. That\u2019s the fourth straight quarter we have had sales of double-digit growth here and double-digit in every region, led here by extrusion and metal buildings. So we are excited about this business going forward. Our general industrial, again double-digit growth in the first quarter. That\u2019s the fifth straight quarter with double-digit growth in GI. Every region was positive led by North America and our LatAm business, transportation and general finishing were strongest here. Our auto refinish had double-digit growth. Miles driven here are below, but nearing pre-pandemic levels and continue to leveraging our technology as a key here. We brought in some wonderful technology from Valspar that works terrifically with our Sherwin tech technology and we are growing share here pretty aggressively. And in industrial wood, we had a high single-digit quarter. We have got very good momentum here, furniture, kitchen cabinetry, cabinetry and flooring, which obviously correlate to similar positive trends in new res construction. So we saw increases in all end markets, most by double digits and clearly really pleased with packaging and coil, but all of them were strong and by region, North America, our largest region grew the fastest and LatAm, Asia and Europe right behind. So expectations of this team remain really strong. We got a terrific leader here as well. Karl Jorgenrud came to us from Valspar. Got a lot of division presidents beneath Karl that are really experienced as well. We talk a lot about our TAG organization and the retention of people and the importance of that in TAG. But the same stands true in PCG. Our average division presidents average 29 years between Sherwin-Williams and Valspar. And again, when you look back, we talked openly about this greatest infusion of talent, when Valspar and Sherwin came together and we have been terrific in the retention of those people. Our turnover still and this is years after the integration is below 7%. And so, on the architectural side, I think if you look at the legacy Sherwin and the talent we had on the architectural side, we are pretty -- we like to think we are pretty strong, always could get better. They brought, obviously, some talent came in from the architectural side of Valspar. In fact, our new Chief Operating Officer came through the architectural side of Valspar. But when I look at the PCG side and the benefits we have had on the talent that\u2019s come in from Valspar and our ability to retain it, yeah, it gives us terrific confidence going forward. So fundamentals, we have got great assets. We have got great technology. We have got great people. And we have great customers and we are going to leverage that for everything we get. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks. I want to follow-up a little more detail on the gross margin progression in the quarter. I think you mentioned that gross margins were down year-over-year, more due to volume than the gross price. Could you give us the number on that and do you think that continues that mix of gross margin pressure in the second quarter? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Greg, it -- the volume, as you know, and what we have always talked about is the single biggest driver of not just gross margin but operating margin and that clearly is a higher impact. If you look at year-over-year in our -- if you look at price cost in our first quarter, we are still chasing a little bit. I think we get on top of that as we get towards the end of the second quarter. So it will be less of a drag. And also in our second quarter, you see a seasonal increase in our architectural volume as you normally would. That\u2019s going to help drive our gross margin, it is going to help drive our operating margin, and Greg, it\u2019s still tough comps against TAGs, but you look at the volume down mid-single digits, it\u2019s a significant drag in our first quarter. And to be down flat to down slightly in our second quarter is going to be a positive mix shift as well in our second quarter that\u2019s going to help grow the margin. Greg Melich : Got it. And when we look at the back half, if price is on top of raws by the end of the second quarter, for the back half, do we need another round of pricing to stay on top of the costs, given what we have seen year-to-date with, I guess, raws at the higher end of the range? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Greg, I think, what you -- what we are looking at is more on the industrial side right now. I think when we talk about the basket moving to the high end of the range. It\u2019s more on industrial. As you know, industrial price increases aren\u2019t as uniform. So there may be -- I talked about on our year end call, some in the first quarter, some that roll into the second quarter. I think the timing of those are pretty much the same. It\u2019s just the -- that the amount or the percent increase that may have had to get adjusted. But like we talked about earlier, I think, our visibility is one quarter out at best, a lot of volatility and we will continue to monitor that, based on the last year and a half, I am not going to say, we don\u2019t need more, we are just going to have to monitor it and go out and react accordingly. John Morikis : Yeah. What we will say is that if we need to, we will. It\u2019s not a hesitation. Greg Melich : And maybe, John, just a follow-up on that, given the volume shortfalls, especially in the back half last year, are you a little more resident to hike prices again within a quarter. I am just thinking in the past, I think, you have waited about four months, now as you are trying to rebuild that volume and share. Do you think, obviously, you will get the pricing, but is there a tendency to want to wait an extra month or two just to be sure? John Morikis : I think we have, you are right, Greg. Good for you, because I know you know our company well, we have done that. And I think what\u2019s different now is that we are a little bit further into the volatility portion of this cycle and we have been communicating to our customers with greater clarity about the volatility. So I don\u2019t know that we need to wait as we have had in the past, because we have been communicating to the customers, that our intent is to try to keep the price increase to a minimum. But with that, we are not building a buffer to be able to absorb the volatility and if there is more volatility, then we will need to be out quicker with additional price. So, I think, we would be moving quicker, and to your point, it\u2019s nothing we would prefer to do or enjoy doing. We have yet to get a thank you note from any of our customers for it. But if the need be, we are going to do it, we will do it quickly. Greg Melich : Great. Thanks and good luck. John Morikis : Yeah. You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO. Your line is live. John McNulty : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. You had mentioned early in the call that you were using your own fleet and the flexibility that you have with that to help your customers from a logistics perspective. Can you help us to understand, one, is that something you actually incrementally charge or is it just kind of part of the service that your customers are appreciative of? And I guess, on top of that, how should we think about -- if it is just more of a, hey, it\u2019s part of our service, then how should we think about the cost of that and how that might decline once the -- all the big logistic issues kind of get put in the rearview mirror for us all? John Morikis : Yeah. John, let me first go back to your question and the comment that we made earlier. What we were speaking to specifically there was suppliers not customers. And we do work with our suppliers, mainly to bridge gaps to ensure that we have the product when we need it, where we need it. It\u2019s not our intent to do their jobs, but we are in this together with them, trying to work with them, and as you would expect, when that happens, there\u2019s a discussion about what it cost that goes along with the fact that we are going to do that. So right now and you know our company, our focus is on taking care of the customer and the fact that we have got our fleet and it is a point of differentiation. We do leverage those and there are times when we are less efficient doing that. For example, one of our largest customers on the Consumer Brand side was very adamant about a South to North recovery approach that was a little less efficient than we would have liked to have seen, but important to our customers. And so we took that undertaking and served our customers in a way that allowed us to respond to their needs, not what -- not which was most or least expensive to us and that\u2019s our DNA. And so, if it\u2019s to use our fleet of trucks to help in the pinch to be able to get raw materials to a plant, or in some cases, right now, we are producing where we can get the raw materials and we are shipping it in some cases across the country to ensure that we have supply where we need it and if we were less efficient than what we would like and we have this terrific footprint. We want to optimize our supply chain to its fullest. But when it comes down to it, we are going to choose serving our customers. And over time, that the efficiency will work its way back in, we are not just waiting for that to happen. You should expect that, as a leadership team, we are very focused on it. Our teams understand that, but we also understand that servicing our customers is the highest priority we have. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. John\u2026 John McNulty : Got it. Thanks very much. Yeah. Go ahead. Al Mistysyn : The only anything I would add to that is, we did call out that supply chain comment that John talked about in our Consumer Brand Group being a little bit of a drag in our first quarter. But clearly -- and that\u2019s -- to John\u2019s point, that\u2019s an investment we are willing to make in servicing our customers better. That drag, if you look at the operating margins and what they were down, volume is still number one in consumer is driving that operating margin lower year-over-year, and then, let -- probably a third is the supply chain efficiencies, just to make that clear. John McNulty : Got it. Thanks. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. John Morikis : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is live. Steve Byrne : Yeah. Thank you. The inventory build at the end of the quarter is noteworthy. Is that largely driven by the raw material costs or do you really have much more volume than previously you might have been low going into the quarter, but you commented that March was a big volume production month for you. So is that -- if that\u2019s volume driven, is that a reflection of what you are seeing your Pro contractors have as backlog and is that what is giving you this confidence in such a strong second half? John Morikis : Well, Steve, let me be very clear. We have incredible confidence in the second half, hard stop. We are growing inventory sequentially each month of the first quarter, because raw materials became more available. We added 50 million gallons of capacity. It\u2019s online. It\u2019s supporting the demand, and we are building inventory. We don\u2019t have the inventory that we normally would have had coming out of the first quarter, but given the additional capacity that we have, we are able to serve our customers and we are going to utilize that additional capacity in everything we have between now and likely this time next year to run full speed, all out, building inventory to be able to continue to serve our customers. And if we have to put a little more in working capital to be able to serve our customers, we are going to do that. Steve Byrne : And perhaps, relative to historical splits between first half and second half sales, how much stronger do you think second half this year could be? John Morikis : It\u2019s going to be a much stronger part of our success this year, partially because of the comparisons that we have, for sure. And second, as I -- we have just talked, the ability to make a record year -- a record month of production in March, says that, we have product, we have raw materials. And so, the demand is strong. We have raw materials. We have capacity. We are going to have a good time in the back half. Steve Byrne : Maybe just one quick one, what fraction of your consumer sales are Pros that pain and how do you get that data? Is that from your partner? John Morikis : Yeah. We are not going to comment about our customers\u2019 mix of business. I will tell you that it\u2019s overall a relatively small, but is a very important and growing area. We have been talking for a number of quarters about the investments that we are making here, the commitments that we are making here. In fact, even the fact that we just came through a pretty challenging time and we were prioritizing that business with raw materials. I think it should speak volumes. We love this controlled distribution model through our own stores, but we are very excited about this Pro who paints model. And we have, through our own stores had, if you look at it, marginal success, because there are customers that prefer a home centre channel. They want to be able to get in and they want to be able to buy a full array of products that are only available at a home centre. In the marketplace, there\u2019s been a limited amount of competition in this space for too long and we believe, along with our strategic partners that there\u2019s a terrific opportunity and we are determined to help our strategic partners win in this space. Steve Byrne : Thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is live. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, John. You talked about raw material shortages and supply chain issues for a while. Do you think adding 80 new stores is going to add to that complexity or do you think you have this new capacity and excess inventory that you can load in these new stores? And also, what\u2019s the cadence of new stores? I think you opened, you said, only four new stores in the first quarter, so what\u2019s the cadence of that? John Morikis : Well, let me finish -- start with your finishing portion. We are going to be between 80 and 100 stores this year. And the answer as to why perhaps in a market like this to add stores is, we believe in the model. And we play a long game here and we didn\u2019t predict that the world was coming to an end because we couldn\u2019t get the raw materials. We knew we would and we continue to invest in every aspect of our business. Including, if you look at it in our manufacturing, we invested in labor to have people in our facilities, so that when raw materials became available, we could convert them. We did that and I think Mark demonstrated that. So now you follow the pipeline a little bit further, and you say, okay, now we are producing products. I am not going to be sitting here saying, oh, I wish we would have had the courage to invest in stores when things got a little bit tight. Maybe it comes with the 37 years of scar tissue that I have in the 30-plus years that all have and our other employee. We have seen this movie before. We know how it works. And we have got confidence. And when you have confidence, you look at adversity in the eye and you say we are going to run right at this. And during these tough times, we knew that others would do exactly what they do, close stores, close territories, get in their bunker and we are going after. We are bunker hunting right now and we are going to continue to do that. P.J. Juvekar: Great. And also about the cadence of the new stores? John Morikis : Yeah. Four in the -- net four, I think it was in the first quarter, we would like to see a little bit more than that. But it\u2019s going to ramp up here between now and the end of the year. We will be in the 80 to 100 before the end of the year. P.J. Juvekar: Great. And one of your competitors has a new partnership at Home Depot to target Pros at the big boxes. Have you seen any impact of that on your business? John Morikis : Well, as I mentioned earlier, we have a model that we believe is the right model in the market. It certainly is for us. We believe painting contractors thrive in a specialty store format with the -- with people behind the counter that have 10 years, 20 years and 30 years of experience with products that were built for them in their specific areas and services that are focused on making them as productive as possible and as profitable as possible. So, I would just say, we welcome with no arrogance the competition. Competition makes you better. I am going to bet really big on Sherwin. P.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you and good to see your confidence. Thank you. John Morikis : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Leithead from Barclays. Your line is live. Mike Leithead : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. John Morikis : Good morning, Mike. Mike Leithead : Maybe to start with John, in the release, you talked about the worst the supply chain challenges being behind us, was that mostly a U.S. architectural comment or I guess when you look at your international operations or maybe the legacy Valspar businesses are you seeing conditions there meaningfully improve as well? John Morikis : Yeah. I want to give -- earlier, I mentioned Colin Davie, our CPO and also Heidi Petz, our Chief Operating Officer. I want to give her credit as well and she started in her role on March 1 and I don\u2019t think she came up for air throughout the balance of the quarter out of this area. I mean terrific work by the entire team of really ensuring that we have the raw materials we need, and importantly, where we had it. When we look at what\u2019s been happening, I don\u2019t -- the impact on our architectural business outside of the U.S. is, obviously, a very small part of our business, not significantly impacted by this. The confidence that we have by working with our suppliers and in a partnership way, I think, is why we have this confidence. And again, the talent that we have in procurement and another fellow has to get the attention here. Joe Sladek, our President of our Global Supply Chain is the one that takes all these products and quickly is turning those in to finished goods and getting them to our stores and to our customers in a very nimble and quick way. It\u2019s amazing behind the scenes the things that are happening to be able to convert quickly and take advantage of these opportunities and we expect that to continue going forward. Mike Leithead : Great. Super helpful. And then, second, I was just hoping to drill a bit more into the raw materials basket. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of focus on oil-based inputs, but just curious what you are seeing on the inorganic side both in TiO2 with color payments? Thank you. Jim Jaye : Yeah, Mike, this is Jim. What I\u2019d say on the oil prices, we talked about probably going to be at the higher end of our guidance this year and part of that is because of the oil prices that we have seen. I think it remains to be seen how long those oil prices are going to stay sustained and I\u2019d remind you really that propylene is more meaningful as an input for us for our resins and solvent than this oil. So oil and propylene are connected over the long-term, but in the short-term, we have seen disconnects in the past. So think as Al said earlier, we will continue to monitor all of these things if we need to go out with more there in terms of price, we will. Your question on the TiO2 side, we have seen inflationary pressures there given the strong demand, there\u2019s tight inventories, and certainly, rising energy costs, which are used to convert the ore into TiO2. We haven\u2019t had any availability issues really there. We are in a good place with our suppliers, I think. So really on the supply chain, we will continue to monitor it. We will get pricing as necessary and we expect it to -- from an availability perspective, that\u2019s really behind us. Mike Leithead : Great. Thank you so much. Jim Jaye : You are welcome, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. David Begleiter : Thank you. John, there have been some reports that Sherwin is discounting paint prices in the U.S. Are those reports just inaccurate? John Morikis : Yes. David Begleiter : Very good. And the same trend of the 12% pricing you announced for February 1st, how much are you getting and how is it compared to historical levels? John Morikis : Yeah. David, the price increase has been actually a little bit better than the price increases we went out with last year. So the effectiveness has been maintained and improved as the months have gone on, has it been -- it has been filtered through the market and we feel very good about where that is at right now. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Your line is live. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions on Performance Coatings, if I may. First, on the margin side, John, it looks like you made some nice sequential improvement there of 290 basis points. At one time, though, I think, you had a goal of high teens or low 20s, is that still the case for PCG margins, and if so, it looks like volumes are running pretty nicely nowadays. What do you think the path is to get there over the medium-term? John Morikis : Yeah. Kevin, it absolutely is and we have great confidence in our ability to do that. I think you are going to continue to see that with volume. We have obviously seen the pickup in raw material cost has had an impact on it. So the price that has been announced rolls through. That\u2019s going to have an impact. We have also talked publicly about some of the other that are available to us that we are continuing to emphasize and attack. And some of that includes the simplification of our product lines, our raw materials, less complexity going through our plants. I want to be very clear in our confidence and our ability to reach those metrics that we have been talking about. We were gaining some ground on it unfortunately, with the raw material spike. We gave up a little bit of ground in this, but we have got -- this isn\u2019t just Bravado, we are going to do it. We are going to take the -- we have got confidence, we have got plans and we are executing on those. So we are going to deliver on this. Kevin McCarthy : And then, secondly, you acquired Sika\u2019s Industrial Coatings business just recently on April 1st, I believe. I realize it\u2019s not a huge deal. But can you speak to what the opportunity is there and why you chose to do that? John Morikis : Yeah. It\u2019s a -- I think a great example of our M&A strategy, which we have always said, we are not trying to be everything to everyone, everywhere and that we don\u2019t need practice. We are creating shareholder value. And so, when you look at the opportunity to acquire a strong position and protection in Germany with local production, Sherwin-Williams is strong in fire protection in the U.K. also with local production. And our ability to leverage the strength of each and production capabilities in each of the primary markets and drive new corrosion protection and fire protection sales together and then really connect the dot is a terrific opportunity for us. And I think it\u2019s a great example of our ability to identify assets, work with owners and to really capture the best of both. The leadership team, just as we have talked about with Valspar, the leadership team of Sika has also joined us. Thomas Hasler [ph] is a very strong leader in the Sika business that\u2019s joined and we believe that the combination of the legacy Sherwin and the new Sika assets and people is going to provide a great platform for growth. Kevin McCarthy : Great. I appreciate the thoughts. John Morikis : Yeah. You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Really quickly, so I guess, just curious when you think about that mid-to-high single-digit sales growth for the year. You said TAG would be at the upper end or even above that. I think you already covered this. But is there a possibility that you could -- so that should be more weighted towards price, I imagine. So when we look at same-store sales, should you expect that to remain in that $3.8 million and above level as we go through the year? Al Mistysyn : Yes. It will improve as the year goes on. Arun? Arun, you are still there? Operator : Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Your line is live. Garik Shmois : Oh! Hi. Thanks. A couple of big picture questions for me. You talked about a number of positive leading indicators for TAG and you are sounding obviously pretty bullish about the outlook. But just curious if you are anticipating any impact from the increase in interest rates and how you could see TAG volumes evolving beyond existing contracted backlog. John Morikis : Well, I am sure that you are all getting tired talking about leadership. But I would say, I am going to start here with, we have got a terrific leader in our Group President, Justin Benshere, that has this team really positioned very well. So I am going to take your answer slightly differently than what you have asked and start with the fact that our team is positioned to be able to capture market share in any situation. So new residential slows down, we are going to capture it on residential repaint and property maintenance or any other way that it tilts. That said, given my comments earlier about just the shortage in new residential housing and the demand, we expect that there\u2019s going to be a strong demand and it\u2019s going to continue. The homebuilders that we are working with, they have described this as a bump in the road here, but they are driving through it. And I suspect that as demand continues, there\u2019s going to be more and more starts and we are going to be there. But if it does tilt another way, we are okay. We are going to be right on top of whatever way itself. Al Mistysyn : Just to put some perspective on that, Garik, just to remind you. I mean, new residential is sort of a mid-teens type percentage of our TAG business. So while it\u2019s meaningful to us, as John points out, we are strongly positioned in all these other segments as well. Garik Shmois : Yeah. Got it. Makes sense. I guess the follow-up question is, just with respect to the 50 million gallons capacity increase. And just to be clear, is that fully ramped at this point just going the surge in production, particularly in March or is there more capacity to be able to get out of that project. John Morikis : Well, it\u2019s up and running. But to say is there more capacity to be captured. The answer is, yes. Joe Sladek, as I mentioned, the Global Supply Chain President. He and his team are constantly working on debottlenecking and finding more capacity in every asset that we have. But the 50 million gallons that we spoke to is up and running, I also mentioned the $300 million we are investing in Statesville in that facility to add additional capacity. That will be coming up I believe in 2024. It will be coming online. So we are looking ahead. We expect to continue to drive volume and we are ahead of the curve. Again, speaking with the confidence and determination we have, we are not going to look back and wish we would have and we have great determination and confidence in the execution of our strategy. We are going to have the capacity to be able to take care of it. Garik Shmois : Great. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman. Your line is live. Adam Baumgarten : Thanks for taking my question. I think you said you expect input costs to decline or moderate at least in the second half. Is that the case? John Morikis : I think what we have talked about for input costs, yes, we said the first quarter would probably be the highest inflation of the year, second quarter, we expect it to moderate and then come down a little bit further in the back half based on what we see now. As Al mentioned, we have got the best visibility is maybe about a quarter or so. But, yes, that\u2019s correct. Our current outlook shows moderation in the back half. Adam Baumgarten : Okay. Got it. And then just on the positive mix shift in quality. How much of that is related to simply more higher quality product availability, given the SKU rationalization and then maybe some weaker DIY demand versus a true mix up in the business. John Morikis : Well, I would say, it\u2019s a very good question, except that we have been witnessing this for some time now and it\u2019s only continued. And I would attribute it largely to more of a labor issue than availability. These paint contractors, when you recognize that labor represents 80% to 85%, sometimes 90% of their cost. If you can make that per man hour more productive, you have more projects that you can complete, less callbacks, the opportunity cost issues resolve and so more and more people are moving up in quality. We have a full breadth -- we have the full breadth of products. And I would tell you, even going back to when I was in a store. Rarely did you see people that would stay in that lower price. Typically, what they -- what you would find is people that would be very price conscious would get in there and there are some applications for it. The ceilings of a closet or so, okay, I get that. But what you find is people quickly are learning -- they learn that I can spend a little bit more on a higher quality product and get more productivity, better touch up, get off the project with no callbacks and go on, it\u2019s well worth it. When you look at the cost, if it\u2019s a high cost market, the per man hour expense, it\u2019s not a big investment to pay a little bit more for a higher quality product and get on to the next project for sure. And our people are trained in that. They understand how to do that. And again, it speaks to the tenure of our people. Again, Justin and his team, all our division presidents, they -- this is a program. We don\u2019t just wait for this to happen. We don\u2019t open doors and hope people walk in. We don\u2019t hope that they just move up the food chain and quality by themselves. These are programs that we execute and it\u2019s working very well. Adam Baumgarten : Got it. Thanks a lot. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is live. Eric Bosshard : Thank you. Two things, first of all, on raw materials, inflation broadly seems like it\u2019s worse versus 90 days ago. You talked about energy and oil and TiO2. Is the paper read from today you are still comfortable with that original guidance for raws and is there something incremental you are doing to manage to stay within that original range and the environment, it seems a bit more difficult than 90 days ago? John Morikis : Yeah. Eric, as we said on that range, we are trending towards the higher end of that low double-digit to mid-teens range. But we feel right now, as I mentioned on my previous answer related to oil and propylene and some of the other things, we are comfortable in that range right now. If it moves beyond that, I think, you have heard multiple times today, we will be ready to react with more pricing as needed. Al Mistysyn : Eric, I would just add to that. You talk about what are we doing in response to it\u2019s not in response to any short-term tweaks that we see in our raw material basket, our labs, whether it\u2019s industrial, working with marketing, working with procurement or architectural working with marketing, working with procurement, really driving platform consolidation, simplification, so that we can drive more volume through a smaller base of raw materials. That\u2019s an ongoing effort and not response to the current environment. Eric Bosshard : Okay. And then, secondly, John, you talked about reactivating customers in the architectural business. And in this environment, that\u2019s I don\u2019t know if I have heard you talk about that before. So if you could just give us a little bit of color of what that looks like, that would be helpful? John Morikis : Yeah. I might give you more of a description of what we are doing and what it looks like for obvious reasons. We will tell you about it after we have done it and show you the scoreboard on how we have achieved it. But I want to be very clear on, Eric, is that it\u2019s not through price. We bring solutions and we bring profitability to our customers and we do it in a way that people are willing to stay for. Earlier there was a question about, we -- there was rumors about are we discounting to be able to do that and I want to be very clear and very direct that, that is not the case. But what we are doing though is leveraging what I just spoke to, the quality of people, the products and services that we have [Technical Difficulty] booked. And they have a strong desire to complete as many projects as they can and protect their reputation. And so if you could imagine all the activities you would do, if you were a store manager or a sales rep of Sherwin-Williams and building relationships, building trust, the connectivity and consistency is important. Every day over 3,000 sales reps wake up -- Sherwin-Williams reps determined to go be a better partner for their customers. And our ability to reengage with those customers and be responsive to their needs, have the products they need anticipate what challenges they might have shifts in weather to project delays, whatever it might be, all aligned in helping us to reengage. And while we don\u2019t think we lost customers through these challenging times. We do feel as though we have lost some sales and we take great pride in our controlled model of anticipating what products they are going to need and having them there. But there were times where it may have gotten their late or we couldn\u2019t get it there when they needed it and they might have had to go somewhere else. Well, you could rest assure of one thing here. We are not going to just assume they are coming back and so we are going to be very deliberate, very active and engaged with these customers to ensure that they are back in our stores, start with a cup of coffee, make a friend, use our paint. We are going to be after it pretty regularly. Eric Bosshard : Okay. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Richard [ph]. Thanks for taking my question. Just one point on The Americas Group, when you look at volumes, which were down largely due to raw material availability, now that you have that easing and you have more capacity that you can bring on, do you expect to increase production on the DIY side or are you going to focus majority of your production on building inventories on the architectural side? John Morikis : Well, we are going to be converting these precious raw materials into finished goods and pursuing all segments of our business and so I think at this point, that\u2019s the extent that we want to talk about. We will talk about what we did next quarter, but we see a terrific opportunity to utilize the capacity that we have. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just related on that, in terms of SKUs in your stores, I know in the past, you talked about potentially limiting the number of SKUs in order to get more production out. Is that still happening or -- and is there any SKUs that are getting increased demand that you want to focus on [Technical Difficulty] John Morikis : This was a challenging time. It did give us an opportunity to look at our SKUs and rationalize some of those down that will never return. There will be simplification opportunities in what we come out as a product line with. And I would suspect that what you will see in the very near future is a little bit of expansion beyond what we had coming through last year. But we are not going to just jump back to where we were. We are going to be a better company, more efficient with our working capital. We will have the inventory we need, but it may not be spread out as wide as it has in the past, but we will have what our customers need. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Research. Your line is live. Jaideep Pandya : Thanks a lot. I guess it\u2019s sort of a two-part question to the same topic. This cycle, you yourself and a lot of your peers have done a phenomenal job on pricing, increasing prices very dynamically in the last sort of four, five quarters. And in the previous cycle, whenever you have sort of had inflation, the gross margin progression in the subsequent two years increases quite dynamically in the region of sort of 4%, 5%. So, do you expect in this cycle, when you catch up with raw materials with your pricing and other inflation with your pricing, we should sort of see gross margin expansion in year 2023, 2024, the same magnitude or do you think that because pricing went up so dynamically in this cycle, you will have to give back some of the price increases as raw materials stabilize and potentially go down if demand weakens in Asia and Europe? Thanks a lot. John Morikis : So I\u2019d say this. You are right. If you look historically, there\u2019s been an opportunity there, but there\u2019s also been the opportunity to invest back in the business. And so I would answer your question this way, our determination is to make our [Technical Difficulty] and help them make more money. There are other costs that go into this, labor, transportation, all of these things that we are doing, it might not necessarily hit the gross margin line, but our investments that we invest in to help our customers in their profitability. So I\u2019d say that each one of these, we take a very in-depth view and very thoughtful view in how we can continue to ensure that what happens as a result of all these investments, all the pricing, everything that goes into it is that our customers win and when they win, we win. And if for whatever reason, we got piggish and tried to put pricing in that didn\u2019t help our customers to achieve their goals and be more profitable, then we don\u2019t deserve that business and you are not going to see us do that. And so our investments, our commitments and the ability to help customers be successful will be the drivers. Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Jaideep, I\u2019d just add to that. We do believe we are in a similar environment where as raw material costs go up and we put pricing in and pricing starts to catch up with the raw material costs and we see a short-term margin contraction, then you start seeing recovery and you saw sequential improvement in our gross margin in our first quarter. Our expectation is that we will see sequential improvement in our second quarter. And then as I talked about on our year end call, we expect to start seeing a recovery in the second half with -- at the midpoint, adjusted EPS of 16%. We talked about we need to see gross margin expansion for the year. And then going out, you would expect to start getting back to that long-term gross margin target of 45% to 48%, which we are not coming off. Jaideep Pandya : Thanks a lot. And just one follow-up on Valspar really, I appreciate there has been so much that has changed. But if you go back to your original plan, it\u2019s been sort of five-ish years since you did the deal. What are the areas where you are running well ahead and what are the areas which in hindsight, you could have done better, and actually, there\u2019s still more room for us to be positively surprised on this deal? John Morikis : Well, I\u2019d say we are well ahead, I think, as the leverage of talent is number one. I mentioned starting at the top with our new COO, Heidi Petz, all the way through to Group President and Performance Coatings and throughout the company, I\u2019d say there\u2019s a terrific infusion of talent. I\u2019d say the assets and the technology and the leveraging of the customers has been exciting. I mentioned earlier, automotive, the combination of some technology there is -- I was with one of our larger automotive refinish customers who asked, if that\u2019s why we bought auto -- or bought Valspar for the automotive finish, it was that good. So I\u2019d say there are terrific opportunities there. The brand itself is a very strong brand and growing in relevance and importance. And I think that\u2019s terrific opportunity and one that I think were to add. I\u2019d say if I look back and say, what we could have done differently or faster or better. I do think that coming out of 2016 when there was some hesitation on the previous leadership of Valspar to put pricing in. It took us years to recover that. And I think we learned from that and I think it\u2019s a big part of why you see the determination always I hear -- I hope you hear the determination that we have not to allow that happen. And part of that is so that we can remain healthy and serve our customers so we can continue to invest in our business. I think the working capital is another area. I think we have gotten to it. I think there\u2019s still more opportunities as are the asset utilization of the plants. So we are proud of what we have accomplished there. But I would tell you, just as we mentioned earlier, complacency kills, we are not done. There\u2019s still plenty of opportunities, and we find ourselves still prioritizing and that speaks to, I think, the quality of the company that we acquired and the quality of the people that came along with it. But we are just getting started. There\u2019s still a lot of work to be done there. Jaideep Pandya : Thanks a lot. Al Mistysyn : You bet. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Matthew, and thanks everybody for joining the call. I hope you heard today that we are operating here with a lot of momentum, a lot of confidence and we are really focused on driving results. And before we sign off, I will just remind you about our upcoming financial community presentation, that will be June 8th in New York City and we look forward to seeing many of you there. So thank you once again, and as always, I will be available along with Eric Swanson for your follow-up calls. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

With us on today's call are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; Al Mistysyn, CFO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. James Jaye : Thank you and good morning to everyone. Our second quarter results came in below our expectations and conclude what we knew would be a challenging first half to the year. On the top line, the quarter was characterized by strong demand in pro architectural and North American industrial end markets, partially offset by softness in the North American DIY channel, which we first described at our Investor Day on June 8; and tight supply of certain resins, particularly alkyd resins, which impacted our North American nonpaint sales, namely aerosols and stains. Internationally, demand deteriorated faster than anticipated in Europe, and we saw no real recovery in China following the lifting of COVID lockdowns, both of which meaningfully impacted Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings Group sales. Our earnings per share were impacted by multiple factors, including no meaningful improvement in raw material costs, supply chain inefficiencies incurred in serving our customers, the sales shortfall at North American DIY, slowing European and Asian demand, and higher other and interest expense.  I'll go through just a few of the numbers at a high level and then turn it over to John, who will talk about the demand and cost trends we are seeing, how we're responding and our revised outlook for the year, including what we expect will be significant earnings per share growth in the second half. Comparisons in my comments are to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Starting with the top line. Second quarter 2022 consolidated sales increased 9.2%, slightly below the low end of our guidance and driven by the shortfall in Consumer Brands Group. Pricing was in the low double-digit range. Consolidated gross margin decreased to 41.7% driven by cost inflation. On a sequential basis, gross margin improved by 60 basis points, reflecting our pricing actions. SG&A expense decreased to 25.9% of sales. Consolidated profit before tax decreased 9.7% to $739.9 million. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $2.21 per share versus $2.42 per share a year ago. Excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense, second quarter adjusted diluted net income per share was $2.41 per share versus $2.65 a share a year ago. EBITDA in the quarter was $976.1 million or 16.6% of sales. Moving on to our operating segments. Sales in The Americas Group increased 8.1% against a 22.6% comparison. High single-digit pricing and higher professional architectural sales volume was partially offset by lower volume in Protective & Marine and DIY. Segment margin decreased to 21%, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases and good cost control. Sales in the Consumer Brands Group increased 0.9%, inclusive of a high single-digit price increase. Demand was soft in all regions, particularly outside of North America. And tightness in alkyd resins impacted North America nonpaint sales. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 11.2% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume, higher raw material costs and supply chain inefficiencies, partially offset by selling price increases. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 15.2% against a 41.3% comparison and were driven by double-digit price increases and low single-digit sales from acquisitions, partially offset by a low single-digit FX impact. Adjusted segment margin increased 80 basis points to 13.8% of sales due primarily to higher selling price increases and good cost control. Additionally, I'll point out the admin segment this quarter, where we had a headwind of $45.1 million year-over-year or about $0.13 per share. This was driven primarily by investment losses and gains, higher interest expense, a gain on disposition of assets last year and higher SG&A expenses, partially offset by lower compensation expense. Let me now turn the call over to John for additional commentary on the second quarter, along with our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2022. John? John Morikis : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me be clear that we are not satisfied with our results in the quarter. Our job is not to just report results but to influence results. We fell short of our expectations this quarter as we continue to operate in a highly inflationary cost environment coupled with ongoing regional challenges impacting demand. Saying that, we continue to see positive trends in much of the business, and we expect to deliver a strong second half of the year. We have confidence in our strategy, we have confidence in our business model, and we have incredible confidence in our people. Let me start by describing how the quarter played out following our June 8 Investor Day event. Pro architectural demand remains strong. Encouragingly, sales have been particularly strong month to date in July, and contractors are reporting strong backlogs, which bodes very well for our second half. The lower demand for DIY that we described continued, and tight alkyd resin supply negatively impacted North America nonpaint categories. Europe has significantly softened further, and there was no meaningful recovery in China post the lifting of the COVID lockdown. This impacted Consumer Brands and portions of Performance Coatings. There was no improvement in raw material costs. While some key feedstocks have come down sequentially, the issue is timing as resins, solvents and other key inputs are taking longer to reflect this trend than anticipated. Additionally, the rest of the cost basket remained highly elevated, including labor, transportation, fuel and other costs.  While the supply chain for raw materials continue to improve, it remains tight and subject to shots. Notably, certain specialty resins crucial to several of our industrial coatings products were in short supply. With the tightness in the supply chain, we continue to have inefficiencies in our operations but have chosen to continue serving our customers, albeit at higher costs.  While the cost and regional pressures we are seeing are real, there is no sense of panic amongst our team, which is deep and experienced. We continue to operate with urgency and great determination, and we're taking the following actions. We've announced and are implementing a 10% price increase in The Americas Group effective September 6. Significant pricing actions are also being taken in our other 2 groups. We remain highly focused on capturing demand and gaining share. We're managing our expenses tightly across all our businesses. These are focused on general and administrative spending rather than growth. Before moving on to our outlook, let me provide some additional color on our second quarter. In The Americas Group, sales growth was strong and volumes were positive in pro architectural market segments. Excluding DIY and Protective & Marine, sales were up 8.7% in North America paint stores. Against very difficult comparisons and as we expected, sales gains for the group were driven by price as total volume was down slightly. The sales growth was led by property management and New Residential, both of which increased by a double-digit percentage. Residential repaint was up high single digits, and commercial was up by a mid-single-digit percentage. DIY was down low single digits. Limited availability of certain resins impacted us in Protective & Marine, which was up by mid-single-digit percentage. We've also begun to see margin recovery in the business as segment margin expanded sequentially. From a products perspective, exterior paint sales grew faster than interior sales with interior being the larger part of the mix. We opened 19 net new stores over the first half of the year and still plan 80 to 100 for the year. We also added sales reps and territories in the quarter, along with ongoing growth investments in management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services. Our Consumer Brands Group had a very difficult quarter. Sales in North America were up by a high single-digit percentage but well below our expectations given a favorable comparison. The slowing demand we cited at our Investor Day did not improve over the remainder of the month, so we experienced tight supply in certain resins, particularly alkyd resins, that significantly impacted our North American nonpaint sales. On a positive note, the Pros Who Paint segment, while small, again grew by a strong double-digit percentage. Sales in China were down by a very high double-digit percentage due to COVID-related lockdowns and a challenging comparison. Europe was also down high double digits due to the slowing macroeconomic environment and a challenging comparison. Pricing was positive in the quarter and in the high single-digit range. Segment margin decreased significantly due to lower sales volume, increased raw material costs and supply chain inefficiencies. In contrast, our Performance Coatings Group had a very nice quarter. Sales were up mid-teens, including mid-teens pricing. Low single-digit sales from acquisitions were more than offset by FX headwinds. Adjusted segment margin improved 80 basis points year-over-year and 200 basis points sequentially, indicative of executed pricing actions. Regionally, sales increased strong double digits in North America and Latin America against difficult comparisons. Sales in Europe were up low single digits. Sales were backward in Asia, largely related to COVID lockdowns. Nearly every division in the group grew, led by coil and packaging, both of which were up strong double digits against double-digit comparisons. We are clearly gaining share in these businesses. Sales in general industrial and auto refinish increased high single digits against very strong double-digit comparisons. Industrial wood sales decreased low single digits, mainly related to Asia and COVID lockdowns and a slowdown in Europe. Before moving to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $453 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $296 million to purchase 1.1 million shares at an average price of $269.46. We distributed $156.2 million in dividend. We also invested $129 million in our business through capital expenditures, including $89 million in core CapEx and $40 million for Building Our Future projects.  Additionally, the acquisition of Gross & Perthun and Dur-A-Flex closed on July 1. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.4x as we increased short-term borrowings to fund our recent acquisitions. We expect to end the year around 3x and will drive the ratio to our long-term target of 2 to 2.5x range in 2023. We will use cash in the second half of 2022 to manage debt, and share buybacks will be done to offset option dilution. Turning to our outlook. As we've communicated multiple times going back to January of this year, we expected 2022 would be a year of 2 contrasting halves with difficult first half comparisons easing in the back half. We expect to deliver a strong second half with sales up low double digits to mid-teens percentage and diluted earnings per share up by 35% at the midpoint of our guidance. Within The Americas Group, we continue to see extremely strong demand across all of our pro-architectural markets, including New Residential despite higher interest rates with customers reporting strong backlogs that will take them through the end of the year and likely longer. We also see a unique opportunity to win new business as competitors transition their pro contractor business models. Within the Consumer Brands Group, we expect more modest growth as the North American DIY consumer faces inflationary pressures and Europe and China remain challenging. Within Performance Coatings Group, demand remained strongest in North America, our largest region. European demand has slowed in the second quarter, and we do not expect meaningful improvement in the second half of the year. In Asia, the pace of recovery from prior COVID lockdowns in China and prospects for additional lockdowns make it difficult to assess demand trajectory. From an industry supply chain perspective, we're getting the raw materials we need with some exceptions such as alkyd resins, which remain choppy. At the same time, it's not optimal. In our own operations, we expect inefficiencies to continue near term as we've decided to take the necessary steps required to overcome these challenges and ensure that we are serving our customers with product where and when they need it. Exiting this era with our customers will prove beneficial to our shareholders. On the cost side of the equation, we're raising our mid-teens raw material inflation guidance to high teens as expected cost moderation did not materialize in the second quarter and appears to be pushed out a quarter or 2. To be clear, while the timing is not precise, we do expect raw material costs to moderate. We do expect to hold on to our pricing based on the value we deliver and the customer-facing investments we've continued to make, and we do expect margins to expand. There's considerable short-term volatility in the market, and our visibility beyond a quarter or 2 is limited. Our pricing actions remain on track. Additionally, the highest rate of inflation we've seen in 40 years is affecting the other elements of our cost basket, including labor, transportation, fuel and other costs. We're combating these increases with additional selling price increases in all 3 segments in our second half of the year. So specifically for the third quarter of 2022, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by a low to mid-teens percentage inclusive of a low double-digit price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a high teen's percentage. We expect Consumer Brands to be up by a low single-digit percentage. And we expect Performance Coatings to be up by a high single to low double-digit percentage. For the full year 2022, we are maintaining our consolidated net sales guidance based on the momentum we're seeing in pro architectural and North American industrial. We continue to expect consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage. We expect The Americas Group to be up by a low double-digit to mid-teens percentage.  We expect Consumer Brands Group to be down by a low single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low double digits to mid-teens percentage. We are decreasing our earnings guidance for the full year based primarily on the headwinds we described previously. The incremental pricing actions and general and administrative cost reductions I described earlier will not fully offset these headwinds immediately.  We now expect diluted net income per share for 2022 to be in the range of $7.65 to $7.95 per share compared to $6.98 per share earned in 2021. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance includes Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share of $8.50 to $8.80, an increase of 6.1% at the midpoint, over the $8.15 we delivered in 2021.  This implies a second half adjusted diluted net income per share of $4.63 per share at the midpoint, an increase of 35% over the same time last year. In addition, we provided updated guidance on several of our full year data points in our slide deck, including our expectations for FX, CapEx, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. We expect our full year tax rate will remain in the low-20% range. While we continue to operate in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in our strategy. We expect to deliver a strong second half of the year, and more importantly, create shareholder value over the long term through the following actions. We will continue leveraging strong pro architectural volume demand in North America paint stores while investing in future growth with incremental new stores and sales reps. We will continue implementing appropriate pricing actions across the company to offset persistently higher input costs with a focus on regaining our gross margins back to our long-term target range of 45% to 48%. We'll continue to invest in the Pros Who Paint initiative in Consumer Brands Group and in products and services that customers value in the Performance Coatings Group. We will continue investing in acquisitions that accelerate our long-term strategic plan, add top line growth and expand our operating margins as we've demonstrated recently through the Specialty Polymers, Sika, Gross & Perthun and Dur-A-Flex acquisitions.  We will continue appropriately managing our general and administrative costs while investing in future growth initiatives. We will continue to review our portfolio of businesses, brands and customer programs to ensure they are adding above-market growth and long-term shareholder value. We will maintain our disciplined capital allocation philosophy. We will not hold cash while investing appropriately in CapEx, paying the dividend, targeting acquisitions that accelerate our strategy, and absent M&A, buying back our stock. Our leadership team is experienced. Our 61,000 employees are focused on the task at hand. And we expect to win. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question for today is coming from Ghansham Panjabi. Ghansham Panjabi : Robert W. Baird. I guess, first off, I mean, obviously, John, a lot has changed over the past few months given the increase in interest rates and concerns over construction end markets here in North America. Can you first just update us with your view, if it has changed, as it relates to the various subsegments within TAG? John Morikis : Well, Ghansham, I'd say our confidence in TAG remains as strong as it has always been. If you look at what's happening within those segments, maybe I could just run through them briefly here. If you look at New Residential, our position there is strong and getting stronger. As a matter of fact, we've been very transparent in sharing that we've had these exclusive relationships with 18 of the top 20 national homebuilders. In fact, we've gotten a few inquiries because of some specific wording in the financial community presentation slide and if we've been able to maintain those relationships. The fact is that we've actually grown them. Proud of our team for hanging on to the 18 of the top 20, but we've actually now grown that to exclusive relationship with the top 23 of the top 25, and we're selling the majority of the remaining 2 in the top 25. So customers in this space are telling us they are confident in the balance of the year. Demand is strong based on just the simple supply and demand. And so as we work with our national and regional homebuilders, the creativity that they are displaying to ensure that they keep building is high. But market demand here is high. Supply is below the demand space, and we think it's pretty visible to those of us in the industry that there is a strong level of demand. If I look at residential repaint, here is an area where the job itself is growing in size and value. Part of that is a continued positive mix shift into higher-quality products. These higher-quality products help our customers with productivity, with their appearance, touchup, just the whole ease of application. Our customers here, again, are very confident through the balance of the year with demand, and our position here is growing. And I do think that it might be interesting to point out that if you go back to the 2008 period where we -- last we really faced these significant challenges in residential, that was really the catalyst for our residential repaint business that we have now.  So it is a uniquely different position and I think much more favorable position for our company right now. Because if there is a slowdown in New Residential, we have a much stronger residential repaint business now than we did during the last slowdown. So it's an area of focus that we've had strategically to offset any puts and takes in the market. And we think that the stronger position in res repaint that we have now will be a strong position going forward. The other area, if you're following New Residential with concern would be, well, what happens if people are not buying new homes.  Again, we still think there's demand -- strong demand there. But property maintenance would be the other area that we would expect to benefit. And here again, we've spoken about the relationships that we have. In the past, we've talked about the 18 of the top 20 that we have exclusive relationships. We now have exclusive relationships with 21 of the top 25.  In fact, in the top 350, we have solid agreements with 70% of them exclusive relationships with 45%. So at 45% exclusive of the top 350, while we're pleased with that, it still offers a terrific opportunity, and again, room for growth for us. In property management CapEx, our teams would describe that as an area that's off the charts right now. There's considerable amount of investment taking place as well as in the turns, which is very robust and almost acts as a bit of an annuity in the business in many ways. In commercial, I would describe it, Ghansham, as historic backlog. The pipeline here is strong. We're seeing a lot of activity here in tilta, in distribution, data centers and some might even include multifamily in the commercial space as well. We run a good part of our business -- Protective & Marine business, as you know, through our TAG business. This is a business where demand has been strong, particularly in petrochem, water and wastewater, also high -- other value area of infrastructure, as I mentioned, data centers.  Also battery plants is another area. This is an area that we were impacted negatively. We talked in our prepared remarks about the alkyd resins. We felt a lot of pressure here. We could have really sold a lot more product if we could have gotten more of the alkyd resin that was in short supply. But our position here is very good and one that we believe has a tremendous runway ahead of us. Allen Mistysyn : Ghansham, this is Al Mistysyn. And building on that confidence in the strong demand, this is what gives us confidence in our second half adjusted EPS guidance to be up 35% with strong volume in TAG. Plus we announced, as John mentioned in his opening remarks, a 10% price increase effective September 6, along with the pricing actions we're taking across the rest of the groups.  Our expectation is that we're going to see nice gross margin improvement year-over-year, starting in our third quarter and trending through our fourth quarter. And I'd like to highlight another -- a couple of other points just to reiterate that confidence. If you look at our operating margin in TAG at 21% in the second quarter, yes, it was down year-over-year, but I think the strong volume and the pricing actions that we're taking are going to help us get into a strong improvement in our second half. As it is, our second quarter was sequentially better by 420 basis points and better by 500 basis -- 90 basis points versus the fourth quarter. And I got to talk about Performance Coatings Group because, as you know, that has historically been our lowest operating margin business to date. And we have a lot of confidence in attaining our target operating margin of high teens to low 20%, and I think that will move the needle on our overall results, and we're making good progress. Our second quarter operating margin improved 80 basis points year-over-year and increased 400 -- and improved 200 basis points sequentially and improved 490 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. And this came on gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. And even with the macro challenges that we're facing in Europe and Asia that we can expect to continue in our second half, the pricing actions, the market share gains that we're experiencing in packaging and coil, in particular, gives us great confidence that we'll be able to expand our margins in the second half in that business.  And that's including the acquisitions that we made that John talked about, which are going to give us modest tailwind in our second half on operating profit. But as we integrate and realize synergies next year, and we'll talk more about this on our second -- our year-end call, we expect margin accretion with those acquisitions. And then finally, I'll talk about our Consumer Brands Group, which we absolutely understand and agree, we're under pressure in our second quarter. Still sequentially down but better than 490 basis points than our fourth quarter. Even though the volumes are down, our expectation is that business returns to 20% operating margins as we improve our operating efficiencies, as we focus on our continuous improvement initiatives and we drive shareholder value and generate cash flow, and that's going to be part of this portfolio review that we do. And we look at, as you know, profitable gallon growth, operating margin expansion, RONA and cash flow. And we're committed to driving the businesses within consumer to the targets that we set. And as you know, if we haven't and don't believe we have a path to hitting those targets, we are committed to making those changes. And that includes, as you recall, the ANZ divestiture and the Ace private label business that we walked away from. Operator : Your next question is coming from Christopher Parkinson. Christopher Parkinson : Mizuho. Gentlemen, just going in -- and so let's take a look at TAG. I know there's some optimism on the pent-up demand on the resi repaint side, likely commercial, even some stuff in multifamily, I imagine. Price-cost, we know where your pricing is. We're all taking a stab at where we think the raw material basket is going to go over the next couple of quarters. Al and John, when we take a step back from everything, I mean, where do you ultimately think the TAG margins can go? I mean there's been a lot of focus on the 13 by 24 CB and PC. Obviously, it's going to take a little bit to get there. But on the TAG side of it, just how should we think about your business? How should we think about in terms of like how they're falling into place in the back half of the year and into '23 and even '24? Are there any updated thoughts there? John Morikis : Yes. Chris, this is going to be a little bit of a diversion from what you talked about. And let me just highlight that we're probably not going to be talking about '24 yet. So bear with us here. Christopher Parkinson : Fair enough. John Morikis : But I do want to mention, and I'll ask Al to get into the details. But I do think -- as maybe as a preface to your question, I think it's important to understand why we have the confidence that the margins improve the way that we're projecting. And I think highlighted is it's specifically focused on our ability to make our customers more successful is through products, is through service, is through our people.  It's the adversity that's in the market right now that we feed on. This is actually when we're at our best in servicing those customers. And I think you can see that right now. As we come through this second quarter -- and while TAG hit the number. It was on the lower end of the sales expectations, the fact is that we probably missed by less than a couple of weeks what we were projecting because we're experiencing that now.  As June went on, sales continued to grow, the momentum continued to increase. In fact, we don't normally show this level of color, but I would tell you that coming out of June with a double-digit gain in nearly every segment. Now as we enter into and finish up July, our average day in TAG right now is averaging high teens, low 20s.  So the momentum that we projected is in fact there, and we believe it's because of the value that we're helping create on the part of our customers to help them to be more successful in what it is that they're doing. They've got a lot of challenges in labor. They've got challenges in projects starting and stopping. And our people, our stores, our products are helping them to do that better than anyone else. And as I mentioned on numerous calls, what we evaluate the most is the research that we do who helps you make more money. And by a wide margin, we have a great distance between us and our competition here on the professional side. Let me let Al walk you through our projections on margins. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Chris, I mean we saw a nice sequential improvement in our margins. Our raw -- our pricing that we put in place to date did actually -- was over what the raw material cost increases were plus other input costs but just not up to the expectations we had. And with the outlook that we have on raw material costs being in the -- above the high end of our range, the cost to serve our customers, as we talked about, the supply chain is not ideal. So we're moving product around this platform, if you will, to make sure we have the right products in the right place where our customers need them. And that's really is what's driving this additional 10% price increase September 6, which we do believe will have a similar effectiveness to previous price increases.  And as you recall and know, you go back to '10, '11 and '12, and we were out with 6 price increases in 22 months. Our margins in TAG were under pressure. And coming out of that, as raw materials moderated, our gross margins grew almost 600 basis points from '13 to '16. And we believe we're in a similar environment, and it's because we can hold on to that price, because we continue to make investments even though we're experiencing these headwinds. And if you go back full year 2022 -- or 2020, we're at 22.1, second half was 23.5. I don't believe we quite get to those levels, but we're starting on a much better base than we were in 2010. So we have a lot of confidence that as the market turns and raws start to moderate, we'll hang on to that price and we'll see a nice snapback to our gross margins and operating margins in the TAG going forward. John Morikis : And let me just top that off with the key driver behind that, we believe and we'll always believe that it's our people. The message on our differentiation here, I think, is probably as strong or stronger, particularly given the environment that we're finding ourselves in. We're going to war with store managers that average 10 years of experience, sales reps that average 12 years, our district managers averaging 22 years, our vice presidents averaging 24 years. So there's a lot of experience that we're leading with. And the fact that we've got this training and the experience that we have allows us a customer engagement. We feel that's a clear differentiation point between us and our competitors. And the fact that we are now able to get back into in-person training as opposed to virtual training and the way we're engaging with our people, we think, is just an outstanding element to our -- what we call our secret weapon, our people.  And our ability to right now attract talent is probably as strong as ever. We have been open about our management training program, which is entering its 40th year. We're recruiting anywhere from 1,400 to 1,500 college graduates. And this high-caliber, talented employee joining our family helps us to do exactly what Al laid out as far as the financials. It's the people that set us apart. Christopher Parkinson : Just a -- and then just a real quick follow-up as a corollary of Al's comment on the price increase. It seems as though in the past -- understanding it's a small part of TAG, we all thought of the price increases of the DIY crowd, once again small, short-term contractors, long-term contractors and kind of the progression to getting that.  And typically, the realization was 60%, 70%-plus of initial price increase. Could you just give us a real quick comment on how we should be thinking about that as it will ultimately pertain to '23 of -- do you think you'll get the expeditious pace of what you're realizing recently or kind of going back in the past? And is my assumption on the actual net realization a fair one? So just pace and realization would be very helpful. John Morikis : Yes. Chris, I'd say that we expect that momentum to continue, I think for all the reasons -- I don't want to be labor the services and everything that we believe we bring and the value creation for our customers. But I'd say that it's a market where people are probably more understanding.  I mean they go to the gas pump and see what's happening. And so our execution on these prices are nothing that we -- we're not arrogant with it. We're determined because we want to keep our organization healthy so that we can help our customers remain healthy. And so the balance is important there. We continue to invest in products and services, innovation, programs that will help our customers on every part of our business. And it's easy to point to the TAG business and might recite that 85% roughly of their cost of goods is labor, and everything that we can do to help make that labor more efficient helps their profitability.  So the cost of the gallon of p is a lower percentage there. And they are in themselves deciding to move up in quality because they see that a higher-priced, high-quality product helps drive their success. But that logic actually carries through to every element of our business.  We're driving our customers' success. That's how we gauge our success. When our customers are successful, then we know that we're going to be a better part of their programs and their success. And that's what we're focused on, and we believe we'll be able to execute on these prices accordingly. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Greg Melich. Gregory Melich : I'm with Evercore ISI. My question was a follow on, I think, Al, some of your points there in terms of the margin inflection. It sounds like now you are on top of raws just not as much as you would have thought. And remind us, last year of that 450 or 500 bp margin decline at TAG, how much of that was raws versus price as opposed to the volume declines that you saw? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. It would be the majority of the raws, but there's other input costs that are coming through, Greg. But that would be the majority. As you know, volume is always -- when our volume is backwards, it's always the biggest driver of operating margin. It's always the -- when it's positive and as we expected to be strong in our second half, it's going to be the driver of operating margin. But even if you offset raw material cost increases with selling price increases, your margin takes a hit. And it takes moderation -- a little bit of moderation on raws and increasing that last price increase effectiveness to start seeing the recovery, and we believe we're going to start seeing that in our third quarter. Gregory Melich : And so maybe the backup question of that then is if you look at the third quarter guide, if sales are going to be up low to mid-teens and that presumably probably has price that's also low to mid-teens, are you assuming flat volume year-on-year in your third quarter guidance? Allen Mistysyn : On our third quarter, I think when we look at the second -- the September price increase, I probably have high single digits. You have to annualize the August price increase last year. You start annualizing the surcharge. So I have volume up high single digit, and then that would tell you volume would be up in that high single-digit range. I'm not as heavy on price as you've got in your -- as what you're saying. John Morikis : Greg, for the company on the back half, architectural gallons, I could give you a little color there. We're expecting low to mid-single-digit gain for the company with TAG up in the high single digits. Gregory Melich : Got it. On volume? John Morikis : Right. Gregory Melich : Got it. And then the rest is price. Great. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Maybe just following up a bit on the Consumer Brands piece. Obviously, we've seen what your volume was in the quarter. Can you talk about whether you think that is indicative of what the retail takeaway is, in line with it or worse? And where do you think your retail partners are in terms of their own inventories or sort of doing the destocking that seems to be going on?  And I guess really what I'm asking is just sort of -- you just mentioned you're expecting TAG gallons to be up more than -- total architecture gallons, but you're obviously expecting consumer gallons to be up it would sound like then. So what gives you the confidence that the consumer gallons can actually be up in the back half of the year? John Morikis : Yes. Vincent, I think it's that careful line here that we are always cautious in crossing and talking about too much of our customers' business. I will say this, as it relates to our customers' inventory, we made great progress in filling our customers' shelves in the second quarter, and there are still opportunities for additional channel fill.  We're going in full speed to put everything we have behind this. We mentioned specifically some of the key areas of the oil stains, Minwax and Krylon, that have been impacted by the alkyd resins. That's going to impact the ability to fill inventory. But as it relates to our customers and their inventory levels, I think it's only appropriate that, that come from them, not us. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Vincent, just to clarify what John said is our second half architectural gallons are going to be up low to mid-single digits. TAG would be up high single digits. That tells you that consumer is actually going to be backwards probably by a mid-single-digit percentage, and it's driven by the continued trends we talked about with softer North America DIY. And I would say we did not see a significant destocking, and our second quarter remains to be seen going out, but we didn't see it in our second quarter. And then Europe and Asia, we expect to see continued softness in Europe and really choppiness in China as the rolling lockdowns continue. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : John, I'm just going back to Slide 7, looking at what changed since June 8. I don't see FX on the slide. Was that a headwind versus what you were expecting earlier? Or is it embedded in these numbers? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. It is going to be a little bit of a bigger headwind. But David, 80% percent of our sales and profit are in North America. So we're not as impacted. But we do expect it to be a slightly bigger headwind than our second half. David Begleiter : Got it. And John, just on North American DIY. Did it -- did demand soften versus your June expectation or just not get better versus that expectation? John Morikis : Can you repeat that? I'm sorry. David Begleiter : Looking at North American DIY, you called out softer demand versus maybe the earlier expectation. Is that -- did it get worse versus June 8 or just not improve? Or how should we think about that? John Morikis : Yes. I'd say that it did get worse, and we were expecting some improvement as we went into the holiday 4th of July season. We were expecting more improvement than we saw. And maybe it'd be good if I could -- I think I'm sure there's a lot of questions here regarding this topic. And I want to just make sure that we cover this completely and openly. Again, as Jim opened his prepared remarks, we were disappointed with the way that everything came together. But I would think that it's helpful for everyone if I put it in perspective. 2 of the 3 businesses performed within the range that we expected. And I'm going to jump to CBG in a moment, but I do think that it's worthy of just taking a couple of seconds to talk about the other 2 and then spend a little bit of time on CBG or Consumer Brands. I'll start very quickly with Performance Coatings. A pretty nice quarter. Sales were up mid-teens, expanded margins year-over-year, which reflects our pricing actions taking hold, as Al mentioned. And the cost environment remains a challenge. And again, we're responding with additional pricing actions accordingly. TAG, we talked briefly about here. And as I mentioned, we hit our guidance, albeit at the lower end. Demand here remains very strong. I mentioned very pleased with our sales trends right now, averaging in the high teens to low 20s per day. In this space, DIY is an area that remains softer. And I talked about the Protective & Marine. That remains strong, the demand. And areas -- only areas that we're feeling softness is in our ability to supply mainly in the alkyd resin area. Here again, as Al mentioned, we're putting price in through TAG. But getting to the heart of your question on CBG on our Analyst Day, that business was trending softer. It did further deteriorate as the quarter went on. And the deterioration mainly focused on 4 areas that I briefly talked about in our prepared remarks. The DIY demand was disappointing. You asked about it. We'd like to see a stronger performance there. There was no improvement in China. Al mentioned the COVID lockdowns as they were lifted. We saw virtually no improvement after those lockdowns were lifted. The European deterioration was further and faster as the quarter progressed than we expected.  And as -- again, not to overplay it, but there was virtually no improvement in the alkyd resin availability, and that had a significant impact on our ability to serve areas that are underserved right now, which is the ability to supply our stains and aerosols to the market. And as I mentioned in the other 2, pricing actions in CBG is going to be an important piece as well as we're responding to the cost issues in this business just as we are in TAG and the other businesses. The largest parts of our business, they deliver. We're executing on our strategy going forward. This second half of the year, we're going to drive earnings up by 35% at the midpoint of our guidance. Every business, we believe, has the leadership, the people to do it. Our group presidents are outstanding Justin Binns, our Todd Rea in Consumer Brands, he's carrying a heavy load right now, but he's -- we believe in delivering.  Karl Jorgenrud, who's running our Performance Coatings Group; and our COO, Heidi Petz, each one of them are out there every day driving doing what's right. And while this was a softer quarter than what we expected, and we don't take it lightly, we've got a lot of condition, a lot of determination but mostly confidence in what it is that we're doing. And we're going to deliver it. We've got it. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : I guess I wanted to drill down into North American housing dynamics a little bit. So we have seen many of the builders start to report slowdown in sales and potential cancellations as well, permits also. Even though the housing reports are okay, the actual numbers from the builders aren't as great. So could you just elaborate on how you see kind of TAG playing out over the next little while and maybe even the DIY side? I guess my specific questions are, you noted strength in R&R and residential repaint, but it seems like architectural gallons are still kind of 80% correlated to existing home sales. So if we do see a big slowdown there, how does TAG really kind of manage through that? And is it through share gains? Or what do you expect kind of for positive growth as we move forward just given the housing backdrop? John Morikis : Let me take a run at it, and then I'll have Jim get through some of the metrics on the housing that you mentioned, but it absolutely focuses on share gains. We've got great confidence in this team. I will highlight that the majority of the homebuilders that are out there, even a few that have lowered their numbers, their numbers have been lowered, but there's still an increase over the prior year. So it may not be as robust as expected initially, but there's still good growth there. And the reason that I highlighted the fact that we're expanding our exclusivity rate, it wasn't upon my chest is to demonstrate exactly the fact that we know that if it's slowing down, we've got to have more customers we're doing business with to offset that demand.  And so we're continuing to push hard in New Residential, in residential repaint and property management. Commercial is very strong. It's -- we've got a great position there, and the momentum is very strong behind that. But our view is that the work that we're doing right now in establishing ourselves with these customers is what's going to pay off. Let me give you a little bit of background on that. So let's just talk in our TAG business. Our outreach effort right now executed by our TAG team is as strong as it's ever been. Our face-to-face call activity was at an all-time high last quarter. We've never made more sales calls in a quarter than we did last year. So it should be no surprise that the number of active accounts in our stores also hit an all-time high. We've never had more active accounts in our stores than we do right now. Second quarter, new account activity is very strong. These are the seeds that we're planting for the future. So clearly, our people are focused on the productivity of our customers, and this is how and when we're at our best. So we're capitalizing on the choppiness in the market by offering this consistent, reliable solution through the very best team that we have.  And we believe that the products, the store managers that I've mentioned, the reps, the services, the innovation that we're bringing, the whole specialty store format, we think, is very unique. And we believe that controlled distribution model allows us to respond to the variables in the market. Whichever way this market tilts, we're going to be there, and we're going to do whatever we have to do with the lead in each of those segments that are benefiting. And we'll gain share in those areas that might experience some softness. Let me turn it over to Jim to walk through his thoughts on the New Residential question that you had. James Jaye : Yes. Arun, this is Jim. I'd agree with what John just said there. And what we always do, first and foremost, is in front of our customers. And recently, Al and I were traveling and we visited with several of our national homebuilders. And while the pace may be slowing a little bit, there's still a lot of confidence out there that I think takes them through the end of the year and well into next year. The completions right now are up year-over-year. And whether you look if it's single-family or multifamily, maybe multifamily is trending a little bit stronger now, but wherever it may be, we're there and ready to capitalize on that. You talk about mortgage rates, maybe a little bit of impact there, but they're still low in comparison to other periods.  And again, we're still seeing very strong demand there. And I think it's underpinned by what we've talked about for a couple of years now, this overall shortfall between houses being built and household formation. So I think that feels good. On the repaint side, as you mentioned, customers are telling us strong backlogs. Home price appreciation continues to be really strong. You look at some of the third-party metrics, LIRA, the NAHB remodeling index, all those are pointing in the right direction. And I'll remind you that res repaint, while it's our largest segment, it's our biggest opportunity. So feel good about that. We made comments about property management and commercial as well. I think our teams are primed and ready and the demand is out there, and we're going after it. Arun Viswanathan : Great. I appreciate all the detail, guys. And then if I could just quickly on DIY. So we've been kind of weak here, and it looks like you guys are expecting that to continue. What would it take for DIY to turn around? In the past, I guess, you guys have seen some improvement there with unemployment when it goes higher. Is that what we should be thinking about? Or what else are we expecting for either a bottoming and maybe a turnaround in DIY? John Morikis : I think if your question is how do we see DIY or what -- would we see DIY driving. Is that... Arun Viswanathan : Yes. How does DIY turn around from here, I guess, just given the weakness that we've seen here recently? John Morikis : Well, I think, first and foremost, I think it's fair to say that our focus to our stores is the professional painting contractor with 85% of our business focused on the contractor. We're focused on a very isolated DIY customer, those that are -- prefer a specialty store format.  Our outreach there is through various methods of advertising through social media, a few levers that we pull to drive that business. It's a good business for us, but our focus primarily is on the professional side through our stores. Arun Viswanathan : No. I understand. I guess I was asking more about the Consumer Brands DIY piece. Sorry, John. John Morikis : Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about the DIY through our stores. Through our Consumer Brands, I think the focus there, obviously, is on helping our customers to win. Here, you look at making sure that we have the right product, the right product assortment, ensuring that we have it at the right price.  We participate in helping to drive traffic through activities, including, as I mentioned, brand advertising, the training in the store, as an example, so that we want to help our customers convert shoppers into buyers. The innovation that we're bringing there will help to do that. And the training that we have inside the company and the centers of excellence that we have, we want to share that with all of our customers. There's a great deal of effort right now in the rep activity through this Pro Who Paints initiative. We want to continue to invest in that as well. We believe that, that customer going through a home center is a customer that we have been really not focused on through our own stores.  And those are the customers that kind of balance between DIY and Pro Who Paints. And Pro Who Paints, by definition, in our world is a contractor who's doing remodeling or some element of construction that's also painting at the completion of that project. We're supporting our customers' efforts there as well as various loyalty programs that our customers are initiating. We want to support those initiatives there. So there's a lot that we want to do and to execute with our customers to drive every category in the home center store that ultimately can come back to help drive the paint department as well. Allen Mistysyn : Arun, I'd just add to that. It would be helpful if we see some moderation in gas prices, some moderation in food prices that have been very -- have hit the consumer very hard over the last few months. So I think you have to start seeing some moderation in those costs to help get back to some of these discretionary projects. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Leithead at Barclays. Michael Leithead : Just one for me. I guess, why do you think there's this big divergence or at least some level of divergence between DIY and pro painters right now? I guess I'm just trying to square the weak North American consumer you're calling out in Consumer Brands with a pretty strong demand outlook in your pro business. John Morikis : So I think Al touched on it just now. I think right now, as the gas prices spiked up, I think many consumers who might choose to do some of those projects might be more influenced by the price of a gallon of paint and other areas of inflation than some consumers that can afford and want to have painters in their homes to do projects. And so those prices, as they moderate over time, I think will have a more positive impact on the do-it-yourself customer. And those that are now working from home that are in an environment where they're saying, \"Hey, you know what to have a painter come in and freshen up my home is a relatively inexpensive but very impactful -- impact on my environment at home, and it's something that I want to invest in.\" Operator : Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : You have a slide where you say softer demand is hurting you by $0.50 a share. So $0.50 a share is about $163 million in operating profits. So does that reflect, I don't know, $400 million in lower sales than you expected or $1 billion in lower sales? And could you break it up between North American DIY, China and Europe? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Jeff, this is Al. You're closer on the $400 million than the $1 billion. And the way I look at it versus our expectations, which is what this is comparing, the -- about -- I'd say about half is Europe, and then the rest is pretty evenly split between the other two. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay. Great. And in the first half, Al, is your raw material price spread about negative $250 million? In other words, $250 million was unrecovered in the first half by prices versus raw materials? Allen Mistysyn : It's not that -- not quite that big of a delta. It's almost flattish to down, but not quite to the $250 million that you talked about. And that is why we -- versus our expectations, and we talk about this higher input costs being down a dime. It's definitely heavier in the first half than the second half with the additional price increases that we're taking. And the actions we're going to be taking to help moderate some of those costs, but also the other input costs that we can influence to drive those lower or at least flatten those out so that we can start seeing the improvement. And like I talked about, our gross margin should start seeing year-over-year improvement in the third quarter. And then again, in the sequential -- or then again in the fourth quarter and then -- so yes, it's a kind of a tail of 2 halves versus our expectations on that price-cost line. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Sison at Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Just a quick question on sort of the price of the paint can given September increase. I know that the cost of the paint in a project is the smallest portion. But if you think about labor inflation and how much the paint can is now, do you think -- are we getting to the point where a paint project becomes -- starts to impact demand and could impact sort of pro demand as we go forward? Or is it still a fairly affordable project, I guess, in terms of renovation? John Morikis : We see the latter. It's a very affordable and impactful project. And as labor increases in costs, it's actually more beneficial to the contractor to use a higher-quality product. And we clearly see that in our products' mix shift. A definite shift in higher-quality products helps the customers' efficiency, productivity, even the opportunity cost. If they have to come back and rework or touch up or whatever it is, they are clearly recognizing that moving up in quality. So it's counter to -- it's a good question, Mike, but it's counterintuitive to what's happening. It's -- people are standing in line the bid list, as I mentioned, throughout the balance of the year. Our contractors are referencing a very full year, and they're moving up in quality. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Kevin McCarthy at Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : John, can you speak to labor cost trends? How much might your labor costs be running up on a year-over-year basis? And is the trend any better, worse or stable if we think about it sequentially? And is labor having an impact on your sales internally or your customers' ability to execute at this point? John Morikis : Well, I'll take a swipe at the first piece, and I'll ask Al to talk about the specific impact. But yes, I think many of our contractors would tell you that if they could hire additional labor, they would certainly hire and they frequently are now paying more for that labor than they were in the past. In our stores and even in our distribution centers and plants, we've made some adjustments to ensure that we're in market because, as I mentioned earlier, you don't achieve the retention rates that we have purely on the culture that you have. We have a wonderful culture, but we also know in respect and want to pay our employees a competitive wage in the market. And Al, maybe you can talk a little bit about that. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. So Kevin, we do expect our labor costs -- so we have high single digits on a consolidated basis. And I would say that's higher in our global supply chain. As you can imagine, it's -- there's less desire to work in a factory environment, a distribution environment. Drivers have been a challenge to get, although I would give the team a lot of credit in global supply chain. They've been able to attract drivers. They've been able to improve their attraction and retention rates in their plants and distribution centers and really have a well-thought-out plan for the future as it relates to automotive. We have not had issues within our TAG organization. Just a comment there. We've added 3,500 management trainees over the last 2.5 years, and that pipeline is strong. So I think we're shoring up the markets we need to shore up to retain people because turnover, as you know, is very costly. So sometimes -- and I think it's leveling out. That doesn't mean there's not a market here or there where we'll have to do more, but it's -- we seem to be leveling out at this point. John Morikis : It does seem to be leveling out. But I'd also say we'll take the appropriate steps to ensure that we keep our great people. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, if I may, I wanted to ask you about raw materials and alkyd resins in particular. I'm cognizant that there was a major outage of an alkyd resin manufacturer about a year ago, but in your commentary, I'm sensing that the shortage there has become more acute recently. Is that true? And if so, maybe you can talk about allocation level, what products are affected and what sort of impact that may have had on your sales. John Morikis : Well, you're right. It does date back to the OPC fire in Columbus in 2021, and that impacted the entire industry as about 130 million pounds of resins disappeared from the market. The important piece here, Kevin, is that there has also been an additional fire in St. Louis at an all next plant that will clearly be more pressure in the market, something we don't need. And my understanding as of just this morning was that there might have been another one here that -- in the same space that could also have a negative impact. So we're trying to work through that. That's real-time stuff. Since we've come into the boardroom here, I've not heard anything. What I'd say is we've been working hard to make monthly progress towards improvement, but it's likely going to be towards the end of the year before we're out of the woods. The solution here is going to be a combination of the internal utilization of assets. And I would say that the recently acquired SPI resins business, again, has proven its value in many ways. This is one of them. But we'll also utilize external assets through arrangements and agreements there as well. But it is safe to say that our plans, our efforts, we were planning on better supply rates than what we experienced. And we think it's going to be a lot of work by our team to continue to gain ground, but it's going to be in small increments. But we believe that by the end of the year or as we enter into next year, we'll be in a much better situation than we are today. The issue here, I think is -- and again, maybe just speaking openly and transparently, a couple of quarters or a quarter ago, we talked about that we didn't believe that the raw material issues were going to be an issue that we faced. And to the largest degree, it's not. We've built inventory in architectural inventory. We supplied our Consumer Brands customers and a growing rate of inventory. And so to the largest extent, everything we said, we stand behind. That said, we also said that it was going to be very tight and hand to mouth. And in times like this, any shocks or any shortages are far more impactful than they normally would be. There's no WIP. There's no inventory in the system to absorb any shocks or anything. So literally, in some cases, if one of our suppliers has something that goes down for a shift or 2, where in the past, we would never feel that. Now we're dispatching, in some cases, our own tanker trucks to offset those or we're producing -- as Al mentioned, we might produce a batch in one plant and deliberate freight -- from one part of the country to the other to serve our customers. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, all of these are very conscious decisions. We're not out just spending money here. I mean we're trying to drive it to the bottom line. But as I mentioned, we believe with our hearts that coming out of this era of challenges with our customers, many of whom understand completely what it is that we're doing to serve them, will ultimately be in the best interest of our shareholders. And so while in a quarter or 2, we're going to feel this pressure there's a reason why our exclusive relationships, as an example, are increasing because our customers see what we're doing. And we'd like to drive it to the bottom line faster and better, and we will. But some of these challenges and shortages are real, and we're responding real time to them, and we're going to serve our customers. And as I said, we'll come out with our -- with these customers on the backside. Operator : Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson at Wolfe Research. Truman Patterson : First, John, I'm hoping you can give just a lay of the land for your supply chains in TAG and inventory levels. Are you all still manufacturing as quickly as you can kind of get it out the door? And March, April time frame, you mentioned that architectural volume production was at the highest levels in history. Should we assume now that July is still the highest levels? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Truman, I would say we are absolutely utilizing the 50 million gallons of architectural production capacity. And we are -- as John mentioned, we actually built inventory in our second quarter related to architectural, and that was both on TAG and CBG, where historically, as you know, we build inventory in our fourth quarter, in our first quarter. And we see inventory reduction in our middle 2 quarters, our highest volume quarters. So we're keeping pace with the level of sales, and we're very confident that also tells you, to John's point, the architectural availability issues, although may not be ideal, we're getting the raws we need to meet demand. And we'll be able to feel confident that we can meet the second half strong high single-digit demand from TAG and also build inventory in our fourth quarter this year and our first quarter next year to be ready for the next year's spring and summer selling season. Truman Patterson : Okay. And then, look, New Residential, if you look at builder orders, it's definitely decelerated. And we'll see if that goes into the repair and remodel market as well. But if I look back at kind of 2008-2010 time period, clearly different dynamics. But you all did slow your net store openings according to our data. I'm just trying to understand if we see an economic downturn. Would you all continue to try and open up anywhere, we'll call it, I don't know, 80 to 100 stores? Or would you guys maybe kind of call that back a little bit? Just trying to see how you all are thinking about the next couple of years. John Morikis : Yes. Truman, it's a good observation. I think, if I recall, we lowered our store count at that time to around 60 new stores. And I would say this, that we have confidence in that model, particularly what's happening in the market right now with some of the changes. Some of our competitors choosing to change their model creates terrific opportunities for us. And so you should expect us to continue to leverage that opportunity to the fullest. Might we adjust down a little bit? Maybe. I mean we're going to take a disciplined approach. Right-hand guy here, Al, and while she's not in the room, our COO, Heidi, I mean those are conversations that the 3 of us, along with Justin that runs our stores, have on a regular basis. I think the takeaway I'd like for you to have is that we've seen this movie before. Investing in the face of adversity is something that we've done. We've not done it without discipline. We will invest. And at the rate -- if it drips down a little bit below 80, we might do that, but we see the value long term. We're actually getting continually better at opening new stores. The focus that we've given, Justin in TAG and all his division teams, is to continue to drive that profitability faster so that we can continue to invest and get those stores contributing faster. So I guess the quick answer is, yes, we might in some of those drift down a little bit, but it won't be by much. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Truman, the only thing I would add to that is if you think about 2008 and '09, we were more heavily weighted to new res to commercial. And over that last -- coming out of 2010 through 2020, our res repaint 10-year compounded average growth rate was low double digits. That was not at the expense of new res, which was also low double digits but on a smaller base. So if you look at our mix today, our new -- res repaint is our #1 segment, the fastest growing, does offer maybe a slightly different view of how we invest in new stores this year and going forward into next year and maybe being even more aggressive than we were back in '08 and '09 just because of that mix of those segments. John Morikis : It's a great point. Our is resi repaint business now is much stronger, much better part of our business than it was at that time. It's a great point, Al. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Josh Spector at UBS. Joshua Spector : Just a follow-up on the Consumer Brands. I mean if I look at the performance in the quarter, your ex U.S. sales were maybe down 30%. Volume's down a bit more. Obviously, China is a factor in there. But curious if you could comment on Europe. I think some of the peers' volumes were down maybe 15% mid-teens-ish. Were your volumes down similar to that in Europe or down much more? And if it's more, what would be the difference? John Morikis : I'd say they were similarly impacted. And we were impacted by all the same issues as you read in the news, everything from inflation to energy costs, certainly the war. Despite that pressure, we believe we're with the right partner there. Our TiO2 program has been very well received, and we'll fight to continue to grow share. But there's clearly some pressure in the market there that we're not immune to. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Adam Baumgarten at Zelman. Adam Baumgarten : Just curious, in res repaint, do you have a sense for how much of demand is related to kind of a larger remodel projects such as a kitchen renovation or an addition versus just a refresh, something like someone just painting a few rooms in their home? John Morikis : I would say that in our TAG business, it's a relatively small percentage is tied to kind of a major remodel, big ticket. It's -- much more likely, it's going to be either an exterior or interior paint -- repaint. Certainly, we participate in those larger projects, but the largest percentages are painters pulling up -- jumping on the exterior of a home or knocking off the interior for res repaint. Adam Baumgarten : Okay. Got it. And then just given the slowdown in DIY demand... John Morikis : Adam, If I may, maybe just -- where we would see more of that kitchen remodel in some of the other areas that you talked about would be through our Pros Who Paint program on the consumer side. The painters that we focus on to our stores would be the guys that are gals that are coming in and focused on painting is the largest percentage. We like to think of our customers as 90-plus percent focused on painting through our stores. Adam Baumgarten : Got it. That's helpful. And then just on DIY, just given the slowdown, do you expect to see promotional activity pick up going forward? John Morikis : No. I think there's more in the area of branding and kind of awareness. I think there will be some promotional supply levels get back into more normalized levels. But with inflationary issues that everyone is facing, it's a pretty disciplined industry because of the percentage of cost of goods and the total cost keeps everyone pretty honest. So it's not likely something that's going to -- the floor is going to fall out, I would suspect. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from John Roberts at Credit Suisse. John Roberts : Gallons in TAG were down year-over-year in the quarter. So how do you square that with the record number of customers and record number of sales calls? Is the average gallon per job down? Or is there some other mix effect that's going on? John Morikis : Well, I'd say part of it is the really strong comparisons that we had last year. John, I don't have those on the top of my head. Al, if you can get those, that would be great. But John, I'd say that with what we have seen from a comp standpoint, we knew going into the year that the first half was -- is going to be a challenge. But I'm glad you brought that up because it's part of why we have the confidence that we do not only in the results, the fact that we have more accounts now and more call activity. But I think as Justin mentioned at the analyst event, our ability to focus on this effort and then see the actual results -- there's a lot of people that talk about what they want to do. But the fact that we have this controlled distribution model gives us POS data, gives us -- we have over 3,000 reps, and our store manager call activity is easily logged as well. And so what I'm really proud of is not only can people say, \"Hey, we're going to go do this.\" But we're really seeing the impact in the results and the fact that we have the number of calls taking place and the number of active accounts really points to the level of execution of this wonderful team. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. John, I would just highlight, last year in the second quarter, tax sales were up 22.6%. Same-store sales was up 19%. Res repaint was up 36%. And commercial property maintenance, new res were up all high double digits. So really tough comp. And what we commented on in our press releases, our pro architectural volumes were actually up low single digits. So I think that goes and points to the calls and the activity that's happening that help drive us year-over-year on volume. John Roberts : And then, John, I think you mentioned that Interior was a bigger part of the TAG mix in the June quarter. Is that unusual seasonally in a June quarter? I would think exterior might be bigger in that quarter. And weather, I think, was uneventful essentially. It was just hot, but we didn't have unusual rains or anything. John Morikis : Yes. John, you're right in that exterior does ramp up during the season, but interior is by far a much larger percentage of total gallons. But you're right for recognizing that during this time of the year, exterior does ramp up. It is -- interior is a pretty significant load of the gallons. Operator : Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois at Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : I'm sorry if this is done, but just on DIY. Just to be clear, did it slow sequentially late in the quarter? Or did it just not come in your initial expectations? Just wondering if there was just a material weakening in the DIY demand. John Morikis : Garik, I would say that it kind of bounced around. We had been working on trying to drive that. We expected a little more positive gallons than we actually saw. And so it was bouncing around without the gain that we had projected. Garik Shmois : Got it. Follow-up question just on the portfolio review you cited. Just to be clear, is this just normal course of business you look at either your portfolio regularly? Or are you perhaps accelerating some plans given some of the macro challenges that may be popping up? Allen Mistysyn : No. Garik, this is part of what our normal operating processes. We set market share or sales growth targets, ROS improvement targets, RONA targets and cash flow targets for each of our significant businesses, programs, regions, customer programs even and midterm and longer term. And it's an ongoing thing because the environment has changed. You look at just even in the last 2.5 years, the differences from the beginning of 2020 to today. So trying to look at macroeconomic trends and how that's impacting our investments and how that's impacting different businesses and then their path forward and action plans to still meet those targets regardless of what's happened in the macroeconomic environment. We have tremendous opportunities for market share growth in Europe and Asia across each of the businesses. So use that as one example. Okay, what's the value proposition that we're presenting to these customers? That gives us a clear line of sight to attaining those goals, midterm and longer term. And as an example, I highlighted our commitment if we don't believe we can hit those goals. Australia was an example, the Ace private label program was an example. Maybe those programs are better for somebody else. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky at Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : John and Al, when you talk about some of these raw material shortages and transportation interruptions and all the other things that seem to be randomly getting inventories in the supply chain back on track, well, how do you deal with allocating the limited inventory ROS between different markets? And I'm thinking mainly the professional architectural and the DIY architectural. John Morikis : Well, oftentimes, Chuck, what we find are we're making the products that we have the raw materials for. So in our Consumer Brands Group as an example, we have primarily a different resin system than we would in some of our -- most of our TAG business products. So where -- as those raws are becoming available, we're converting those as quickly as possible to what's available. But I'll go back to the point that Al made that and what I tried to highlight earlier on the architectural front. The availability of raw materials now has really diminished. To your point, transportation is an area of concern, and mainly the issue is on rail. If we point to the 2 areas most impacted then by rail, it would be TiO2 and bioresin. And we previously mentioned that we -- we brought on a number of -- I think we've ordered 400 tanker wagons to be able to -- I think maybe we've gotten 200. I think we ordered 400 tank wagons to be able to bridge any gaps. We think that's -- we're uniquely positioned in our industry to be able to do that given the fleet that we have. And so Chuck, we make what we have. We try to get what we need as quickly as possible through our suppliers in the worst-case scenarios. We work with them to send our own tankers to get there, make it as quickly as possible and ship it from whatever plant we can get it to and convert it as quickly as possible. Allen Mistysyn : Chuck, the only add to that would be certainly within TAG as we were experiencing the severe raw material shortages in our fourth quarter and into our first quarter, we clearly emphasized the Pro versus DIY segment within TAG. So we certainly can do it when we're in a specific business. And similar kind of decisions had to be made in consumers. So when you're within a segment or a group, you can make those calls, and we did, to get the best utilization of those precious raw materials we had. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne at Bank of America. Stephen Byrne : John, this initiative of yours to grow the business in consumer with Pros who Paint, do you feel that it's necessary to offer those pros some of the services that you provide from -- in TAG such as large volume shipments to the job site, the ability to place orders without having to call the Lowe's store? Are those functions that you're considering or do you consider not necessary? John Morikis : No. Steve, we're in this to win it. And so we're working with Lowe's on the services and fulfillment that will help that targeted customer be more successful. And so I say, Lowe's it's the entire consumer brands initiative is to align the our customers with the needs of their customers. So pricing and those types of things, we don't control that. Our customers would control that. But we're working with them to ensure that they have a complete offering, everything from the power brands that attract customers to the innovation in the can itself. We have reps that are working with their teams to drive their loyalty programs and other initiatives that they have. So yes, I mean, if we can do things to help attract those segments, it's a wonderful win for both of us. Those are customers that we're likely not penetrating through our own stores. They want a broader selection of products that are available in home centers. And we have great partners that we're trying to help to win, and we'll take the steps to do that. Stephen Byrne : And maybe one more drill into the TAG expectations for the third quarter. Is the improvement in volumes that you're expecting, are those on an underlying improvement from the second quarter? Or is that a year-over-year improvement in that the comp isn't as challenging in the third as it was in the second? Is -- so just a question about underlying trends in those pro end markets. And do you have any concern about any challenge or pushback from those -- in those end markets for your price increase that's on the table? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Steve, it's both a sequential improvement in gallon growth, and it's also a year-over-year significant improvement in gallon growth. And no, we do not expect -- we talked about expecting our price increase to be a similar effectiveness as previous price increases. And I believe that's going to be the case. John Morikis : I agree. You don't judge the effectiveness of a price increase on the 30-minute discussion you have on we need a price increase. It's -- we have to earn that every day. And so every day, our reps are out there, our store people are delivering the products that we have. Every single day we have to go right back to the point I made earlier, which is do we help you make more money? And if the answer is no to that, then we don't deserve it. But we're working really hard to make sure that we do obviously. And I think the fact that we're seeing the metrics and the activity that we are experiencing, we think that bodes well for our efforts. It's -- there's no complacency here, though. We want to get better every day and, and we feel as though the activities that we are taking as well as the environment in which we're in will support the increase that we need. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Eric Bosshard at Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard : Al, just a point of clarification. I thought like earlier on this call, you talked about the pricing realization in the quarter not being up to expectations. Is that -- again, I'm not sure if I heard you right. Can you just talk about how pricing relative to your expectations paid in the quarter? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. So Eric, what I say -- I'm glad you asked that question just as clarity. Our pricing actions themselves were we expected them to be. If the price-cost differential was not quite where we wanted it to be -- was not quite where we wanted to be on our expectations. Our costs were higher, raws were a little bit higher. Our cost of freight, transportation, labor, those types of things were higher and then the cost to serve our customers. As we came into getting our inventories built at the end of the first quarter and coming into the second quarter, we thought we'd see less of that gallon movement around our distribution network than we actually saw. So there's higher costs related to that. So that's what drove that price-cost dynamic, I thought would be better in our second quarter than it actually was. Eric Bosshard : And then within that, the pricing effectiveness, I think you commented earlier in the quarter was at least, if not better than the historic trend. That was the experience on pricing in the quarter? And is that the same expectation for this coming increase. Allen Mistysyn : That's right. And we actually did get on top -- the pricing in our second quarter was better and got on top of all those costs, just not to the expectation we have. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ken Zener at KeyBanc. Kenneth Zener : I think you made a comment earlier on Slide 7, the $0.50 share reduction. I believe you said for the softer demand, you said 50% was Europe, and then it was equal parts North America and China. Is that correct? Allen Mistysyn : That's -- it's directionally accurate, yes. Kenneth Zener : Okay. Yes, not exactly. And I raise this because it seems obviously with just 9% in line with kind of the earnings revision, it seems as though roughly half of the revision is tied to what I would consider lower-multiple non core U.S. businesses, which is to say, TAG, the pricing, your $0.10 hit on higher input costs is not that much. Is there something about the operating leverage that is different in Europe and China on that DIY? Because not a large piece of consumer, but it seemed to have really outsized impact on the guidance. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. The Europe and Asia comment not only includes consumer but has an impact on our certain businesses within our Performance Coatings Group as well. So it's a combination of the 2. It's not just consumer in Europe and Asia. Operator : Your next question is coming from Adrien Tamagno at Berenberg. Adrien Tamagno : So it looks like you repurchased $700 million of shares in H1, and your 3x end-of-year leverage target seems to leave very little space for more M&A in H2. So are you taking the view that with the current environment, you are better off growing organically and not adding complexity to your business? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Adrien, I think we -- what we talked about and what John talked about in his opening comments, our leverage ratio ticked up, net debt-to-EBITDA 3.4:1, due to the acquisitions. The acquisitions aren't -- because we only have half a year, because we have amortization and inventory step-up, we're not going to be able to cover the increase in debt, the interest that goes with that. But what we're committed to doing is using excess cash in our second half to pay down debt will offset option dilution with share buybacks. But as you know, that will mean a lot more cash available for us to pay debt down. And I would just highlight our second half net operating cash is going to be slightly different than what we've experienced in the past. As you know, we generate almost 70% of our cash flow in the second half, and it really flips from first half to second half. And you'll see that in our second half this year and maybe even a little more aggressively because we built so much inventory in our first -- had to build in so much inventory in our first half of the year. So you will see a flip in a much stronger second half in cash flow maybe than even you've seen in prior years. Adrien Tamagno : All right. And just a second one, the cash flow still. I've seen you reduced CapEx by around $100 million. So how are you able to find these savings without harming the future work? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. That's primarily due to the new headquarters and R&D projects. We've maintained our core CapEx because you're right, we are absolutely moving forward with our architectural capacity expansion. And we're -- another part of that, that we're moving forward with is the packaging capacity expansions just so we can keep up with the mid-teen compounded average growth rate that we've seen in packaging volumes. So that's going to be a continued investment. And then the final one, as we've talked about labor and labor rates and the challenges around the labor market, is the continued investment in our automation activities within our global supply chain. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. James Jaye : Thank you, Holly, and thanks, everybody, for listening to our call. Obviously, second quarter, a little bit challenging, but we're very confident about delivering a strong second half of the year. And I think that's really led by the strong demand we're seeing across our Pro architectural business in TAG. We're responding to ongoing cost pressures with additional pricing in all of our segments. We're continuing to invest in growth initiatives, and we're going to continue to manage our costs tightly. We're very determined, and I hope that came across. And we expect to deliver value. So thank you for joining us, and we'll be available for your follow-up calls. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

With us on today's call are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; Al Mistysyn, CFO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under US federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up this session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sherwin-Williams had an excellent performance in the third quarter, including high-teens sales growth resulting in the first $6 billion sales quarter in company history; significant, sequential and year-over-year gross margin improvement, record adjusted diluted earnings per share and strong cash flow. Demand remains strong in pro-architectural and North American industrial end markets in contrast to continuing softness in Europe and China. While year-over-year cost inflation remained very significant in the quarter, we were encouraged by a modest sequential decrease in raw material costs. The industry supply chain also continued to stabilize, though conditions remain tight with some previously noted specialty resins in particular remaining in limited supply. Throughout the quarter, our team continued to focus on growth initiatives, product innovation, customer solutions, pricing actions, cost control, supply chain improvements and business optimization activities while also taking actions and planning for a wide range of scenarios that could unfold next year. I'd like to go through just a few of the numbers at a high level and then turn it over to John, who will provide some additional color on the third quarter and our outlook. Comparisons in my comments are to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Starting with the top line. Third quarter 2022 consolidated sales increased 17.5% to a record $6 billion. Pricing was in the low double-digit range. Consolidated gross margin increased to 42.8%. This was an improvement of 120 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially, reflective of our pricing actions. Gross margin improved sequentially month-to-month in the quarter, with September increasing 650 basis points year-over-year. SG&A expense decreased to 25.3% of sales. Consolidated profit before tax increased $265.7 million or 43.5%. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $2.62 per share versus $1.88 per share a year ago. Excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense, third quarter adjusted diluted net income per share increased 35.4% to $2.83 per share versus $2.09 a year ago. EBITDA in the quarter was $1.12 billion or 18.6% of sales. Moving on to our operating segments. Sales in The Americas Group increased 21.4%, driven by double-digit volume growth across all architectural end markets and high single-digit price increases. Segment profit increased by $132.6 million and segment margin was 21.2%, which was about flat with last year and up 30 basis points sequentially. Sales in the Consumer Brands group increased 8.5%, driven by a low double-digit price increase, which offset lower sales volumes, primarily outside of North America. Continued tightness in alkyd resin impacted North America stain and aerosol sales. Adjusted segment margin was 16.2%, up 150 basis points year-over-year and 500 basis points sequentially. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 13.7% and were driven by mid-teen price increases, partially offset by a less than 1% decrease in volume. Mid-single-digit sales from acquisitions were offset by a mid-single-digit unfavorable FX impact. Adjusted segment margin increased 590 basis points to 16.4% of sales, due primarily to higher selling price increases. Let me now turn it over to John to provide some additional commentary, before we move on to your questions. John Morikis : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As we've indicated since the start of the year, we expected 2022 would be a year of two contracts to have, and that's exactly what we're seeing play out. We delivered strong results in the third quarter, and I want to thank our entire leadership team and all 61,000 employees for their focus, their determination and drive in what remains a challenging operating environment. We continue to have great confidence in our strategy. Before moving on to our outlook, let me provide some additional color on our third quarter. In The Americas Group segment, we delivered record sales and PBT. Mid-teens volume growth and high single-digit pricing drove sales, which were up by a strong double-digit percentage in every end market we serve. The sales growth was led by DIY, which was compared to an extremely soft quarter a year ago, where we prioritized our Pro customers given limited product availability. Sales growth was next strongest in our property management, followed by new residential, residential repaint and commercial, respectively. Sales were also up by a double-digit percentage in Protective & Marine, but were dampened by the ongoing limited availability of alkyd resin. We are seeing strong effectiveness from the 10% price increase we announced September 6. TAG segment profit increased due primarily to double-digit paint volume growth and selling price increases, partially offset by increased raw material costs and higher SG&A costs related to continued investments in our long-term growth initiatives and our strategy. From a product perspective, exterior and interior paint sales were both strong, with exterior sales growing slightly faster and interior being the larger part of the mix. We've opened 32 net new stores year-to-date and expect to open 40 to 50 in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in our management training program, expecting to hire more than 1,400 college graduates that will enter this program this year and who will be the future leaders of the company. We also added sales reps and territories in the quarter, along with ongoing growth investments in innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services. Our Consumer Brands Group had a much improved quarter, led by sales that exceeded our guidance. Sales in North America increased by a double-digit percentage, driven largely by price. DIY paint demand remained sluggish, as inflation continued to pressure consumers, while continued tightness in alkyd resin impacted our ability to produce stains and aerosols. On a positive note, the Pros Who Paint segment again grew by a strong double-digit percentage. Sales in China were down by a double-digit percentage, due mainly to the COVID-related lockdowns. Europe was also down double digits due to the slowing macroeconomic environment. Segment margin improved significantly, primarily due to selling price increases and good cost control, partially offset by lower sales volume, increased raw material costs and higher supply chain costs. The Performance Coatings Group followed a very good second quarter with another strong performance in the third. Sales were up mid-teens, including mid-teens pricing and a mid-single-digit benefit from acquisitions, partially offset by a very slight decrease in volume in a mid-single-digit impact from unfavorable FX. For the second straight quarter, this team delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement, driven by execution of our strategy, including effective pricing actions. The 16.4% adjusted margin in the quarter was the highest for the segment since the acquisition of Valspar. And excluding the impact of acquisitions closed over the last 12 months, adjusted segment margin was 17% in the quarter. Although, we're pleased to have reached the low end of our expressed margin target of high teens low 20s. We know there's a significant amount of opportunity ahead. I'm proud of our team's efforts to reach this goal and know they understand the high expectations we have for continued improvement. Sales varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased double digits against a challenging comp and included low single-digit volume growth. Latin America sales also increased by double digits against a strong comp. Sales were up high single digits in Asia, driven by price as COVID lockdowns continue to impact demand. Sales in Europe were backward mid-single digits against a double-digit comparison and continued economic slowing. Every division in the group grew led by coil and followed by packaging, auto refinish, general industrial and industrial wood. We're also pleased by what we're seeing so far from the recent acquisitions we've announced in this segment. Again, these businesses added mid single-digit growth in PCG sales in the quarter though this was nearly all offset by unfavorable FX. Earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire ICA, a high-quality European business focused on innovative wood coatings. Before moving to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation in the quarter. We returned approximately $203 million to our shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We invested $48 million to purchase 200,000 shares at an average price of $237.81 per share. We distributed $155.8 million in dividends. We also invested $175 million in our business through capital expenditures, including $125 million in core CapEx and $50 million for our building our future project. We closed three acquisitions in the third quarter for approximately $440 million. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.1 times as we increased short-term borrowings to fund our recent acquisitions. We'll drive the ratio to our long-term target of 2 to 2.5 times range in 2023. We will use cash in the fourth quarter of 2022 to manage debt and share buybacks will be done to offset option dilution. Turning to our outlook. We expect to deliver a very solid fourth quarter, resulting in our second half sales increasing by a low double digits to mid-teens percentage. And second half diluted earnings per share increasing by 35% at the midpoint of our guidance. Within The Americas Group, demand is strong across all of our pro-architectural markets, including new residential, despite higher interest rates, with customers reporting strong backlogs that will take them through the end of the year and likely longer. We also see a unique opportunity to continue winning new business as our competitors transition their pro contractor business models and our differentiated model has never been more on display in value than it is today. Within the Consumer Brands Group, we expect the North American DIY consumer to continue to face inflationary pressures and Europe and China remain challenging. Within the Performance Coatings Group, demand remains strongest in North America, our largest region. European demand slowed in the third quarter, and we expect continued softness in the fourth quarter. In Asia, the pace of recovery from prior COVID lockdowns in China and prospects for additional lockdowns make it difficult to assess demand trajectory. From an industry supply chain perspective, we're largely getting the raw materials we need, though the availability of alkyd and some specialty resins remain choppy and is impacting certain product lines within Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings. While we continue to push hard, we don't expect meaningful improvement in the availability of these resins until the first quarter of next year. Some near-term inefficiencies remain in our own supply chain as we continue to take steps to overcome industry issues and serve our customers. On the cost side of the equation, our full year raw material inflation guidance remains in the high teens. We expect to see further sequential decline of raw material costs in the fourth quarter, though they will remain elevated year-over-year. We expect the trajectory of raw material costs to continue trending favorably as we exit the year, although the pace and level of potential relief next year is difficult to project. Additionally, along with the highest inflation rate we've seen in 40 years, we're also experiencing significant higher costs and other elements of our cost basket, including labor, transportation and fuel and other costs. We will continue to monitor these costs, fight hard to offset them and respond with additional pricing, if necessary. So specifically for the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect our consolidated net sales will increase by a high single to low double-digit percentage, inclusive of a low double-digit price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up high teens to low 20%. We expect Consumer Brands to be down a mid to high single-digit percentage, and we expect Performance Coatings to be flat to up a low single-digit percentage. We expect North America, which is the largest region within PCG, to be up a low teens percentage. For the full year 2022, we expect consolidated sales to increase by a low double-digit percentage, inclusive of a low double-digit percentage price increase. We expect The Americas Group to be up by low double digits to mid-teens percentage. We expect Consumer Brands Group to be down a low single-digit percentage and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low double to mid-teens digit percentage. Given the many variables we've noted, we left our diluted net income per share guidance for 2022 unchanged and in the range of $7.65 to $7.95 per share. Full year 2022 earnings per share guidance includes Valspar acquisition related amortization expense of approximately $0.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2022 earnings per share of $8.50 to $8.80, which represents mid single-digit percentage growth from 2021 at the midpoint in what continues to be a challenging macro environment. This guidance implies a second half adjusted diluted net income per share of $4.63 per share at the midpoint, an increase of 35% over the same time period last year. In addition, we provided updated guidance on several of our full year data points in our slide deck, including our expectations for FX, CapEx, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. We expect our full year tax rate will remain in the low 20% range. While we're not prepared to provide any specific guidance on 2023 at this time, I would like to comment on demand trends and actions we're taking that will impact our 2023 outlook that we will provide in January. We expect slowing new residential demand with elevated interest rates and other costs that are impacting new single-family home permits and starts. However, multifamily production has maintained strong momentum. It's also clear that macro headwinds are likely to continue and potentially worsen in Europe and China. Our base case in this environment remains to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. I'm highly confident in our leadership team, which is deep in experience and has been through many previous business cycles. We've transformed our business in many ways since the last significant downturn, and we are now a stronger, more resilient company. We know what to do. To this end, we've been evaluating multiple options available to us based on a wide range of scenarios, and we are prepared to take appropriate actions beginning this quarter. These include the following we continue to review our portfolio of businesses, brands and customer programs to ensure that they are adding above-market growth and long-term shareholder value. As a result of this work, we are announcing action plans to simplify our operating model and portfolio of brands in Consumer Brands Group and to reduce costs in all regions in Performance Coatings Group, Consumer Brands and administrative segments. These actions, once finalized, could include one-time costs or charges in the range of $160 million to $180 million over the next four quarters, and could result in annual run rate savings of approximately $50 million to $70 million once fully implemented. Additional details on these planned actions are outlined in the slide deck issued with our press release this morning. We will call out significant one-time charges and update our progress on run rate synergies on future quarterly earnings calls. We remain committed to our strategy of providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and profitable. In challenging environments, we have the opportunity to become an even more valuable partner to our customers. We will continue to focus on new account growth and share of wallet initiatives. We will leverage our strength in recession resilient end markets, including residential repaint, property management, packaging and auto refinish, all of which are larger than they were in previous cycles. We will continue to invest in growth initiatives, including adding stores, sales reps and innovative products and services. We will continue to invest in our people, including our management trainee program I previously mentioned, along with ongoing training that positions our people as one of the most significant amongst our many points of differentiation. We will continue implementing appropriate pricing actions across the company to offset persistently higher input costs, with a focus on regaining our gross margins back to our long-term target range of 45% to 48%. We will continue investing in acquisitions that can accelerate our long-term strategy and top-line growth, and expand our operating margins, including our most recent announcement of European Wood Coatings leader, ICA Group. We will maintain our disciplined capital allocation philosophy. We will not hold cash, while investing appropriately in CapEx, paying a dividend, targeting acquisitions that accelerate our strategy and absent M&A buying back our stock. In sum, we expect to deliver a solid fourth quarter to complete a very strong second half of 2022, and we're also taking actions to get ahead of what could be a challenging 2023. We don't expect to be immune from any number of potentially difficult scenarios, but what we do expect is to outperform our competitors and the market. We will do this by leveraging the best team in the industry. We remain committed to creating shareholder value over the long term. And that concludes our prepared remarks. At this time, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Vincent Andrews. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Just a question on TAG and the margin, both sequentially and year-over-year. You saw a lot more improvement in margins in the other two segments. I mean you didn't TAG. So I was wondering why that was. I did notice you called out some long-term investment spending in TAG that might have affected that. So perhaps, you could talk about that a little bit as well in terms of what that is? And whether it carries over, not just in the 4Q but into next year as well? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. Yes, I mean, we saw a little over 20% increase year-over-year in our segment profit. Flow-through is a little in the low 20% range, and it typically is the case. We had higher sales volumes, which generally drives improved operating margin. I've historically talked about a low to mid-single-digit volume gain, getting in a normal state environment, mid- to high 20%. We had one really month of selling price increases, but these are still partially offset by the higher raw material costs that we had talked about being sequentially better, but still up maybe a mid-single digit in our fourth quarter. And really, the higher SG&A costs that we called out are the continued investments in long-term growth initiatives. So we've added 67 stores. We've put in over 80 reps. We've added headcount into our stores to support the growth outlook. And as John mentioned, we're going to add and really accelerate our growth in the fourth quarter by adding 40 to 50 new stores. So what I would expect in the fourth quarter is, you're going to see your normal seasonal slowdown in architectural demand, which is typical, and you also see a sequential decline in operating margin, but we expect stronger flow through in our fourth quarter, really upwards of over 30%. And you get a full quarter of the 10% price increase for -- that was implemented September 6. I would tell you, that price increase is going even a little better than what we had seen in the past, the fourth quarter sequential moderation of raw material costs and an easier comp. So you're going to see bigger year-over-year improvement in our operating margin in the fourth quarter. And you're going to see that SG&A growth into the first half of next year, and we'll give you more color on that in January. Vincent Andrews : And just as a follow-up, we talked a lot about raw material shortages for a year now, and part of what you were doing this year was trying to get your TAG inventory back to a comfortable level to service your customers. Are you there now? And given that maybe a lot of that was done over the last quarter or two when raws were peaking, should we be thinking about you carrying sort of peak COGS inventory into next year's spring season, or how should we think about the cadence of sort of lower raw material costs flowing through in TAG specifically? John Morikis : Vincent, I'll take the inventory piece first, and I'll show it to Al to talk to the accounting. Yes, we're in a very good place right now for the majority of our products. I mentioned earlier, the issue that we continue to face with the alkyd resin and some of the specialty resins, we'll fight through that. It's getting better. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to have the majority, if not all of that behind us, at the end of the first quarter. But for the most part, the remaining portion of our product line is available for our customers. You should -- and I know you do know Sherwin-Williams, our model is not to unlock the door and hope that people are finding their way back into our stores to find them. Our sales reps and store managers are very aggressive in the hunt of pursuing customers, both existing and new to share with them the fact that we have these products available for them. Al Mistysyn : Yes. And Vincent, we actually built a little bit of inventory from our second quarter to our third quarter, which is typically not the case. But to meet the strong demand that we're seeing, specifically within TAG with mid-teen volume growth in our third quarter and high -- low double-digit we expect in our fourth quarter, I think what you're going to see us do is try to manage our architectural inventory by year-end, maybe up another 4 million gallons. The reality of that is, we're going to monitor that very closely as the quarter progresses and look at demand trends specifically going into our first half next year, and we may adjust that number a little bit. And that's specifically to the DSCs. Our store level inventories are in great shape. We are meeting our demand -- our strong demand with high service levels, and we expect to continue to do that. But as you can imagine, we're -- as our inventories get in better shape, we'll get back to managing our working capital. Our working capital at the end of the third quarter is over 12%. We're going to target to try to drive that down between 11% and 11.5% by year-end, but still a very strong inventory position going into next year. John Morikis : And Vincent, this ties also back to your first question on the SG&A to Al's earlier point. We are continuing to invest in people to provide the service in the stores. So, as the product becomes more available, you may recall in the last couple of quarters, we talked about the new account activity at record levels and active accounts. So, now we've got a lot more people coming into our stores, new accounts coming in. We've got product available. We want to make sure that we have the service to deliver on our promise. And so they're all interrelated, and they're all working very well. Vincent Andrews : Great to hear. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson. Truman Patterson : Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, clearly, there are a lot of moving parts on raw material inflation between suppliers, the petrochem oil. But John, you mentioned the trajectory of raw material cost that's trending favorably as you exit the year. Can you just help us understand at this point in time what the gross margin basket or the raw material -- sorry, raw material basket might look like exiting the year sequentially versus kind of third quarter levels? Jim Jaye : Yes, Truman, this is Jim. I'll take that one. So, if you look at our third quarter, the raw material basket was up by mid-teens percentage year-over-year. I think as we get into the fourth quarter, we're looking at that being more like a mid-single-digit year-over-year number. I think, as John said in his prepared remarks, the trajectory is good and heading in the right direction. I think it's hard to project exactly what it's going to do next year. We're trying to still formulate that, and we'll come back to you in January with our full year guide to give you some more color on that. John Morikis : Yes. Truman, I'd just add to that. As we typically do and our planning for the upcoming year, we work with our suppliers closely on looking at demand trends, looking at volume trends by region, and it gives us a better line of sight as we get through the end of the year. And that's why January, we are able to give you a much better outlook on the raw material basket and other input costs, quite honestly, as we've talked about. Labor rates have been up high single digits, and in some cases, across our supply chain, low to mid teens in an effort to reduce turnover, which is very expensive, but the expertise that goes with that turnover and then freight and other transportation costs. So, we'd like to talk about the full basket as we get into January, and we'll have a better line of sight to that. Truman Patterson : Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then, you all mentioned some of the cost control initiatives in PCG and CBG in preparation of a slowdown, right? Savings of $50 million to $70 million annually. I'm hoping you can walk through those in a bit more detail. And then also, assuming volumes turn negative or remain negative through '23, how does that impact your thoughts on kind of decremental operating margins for both of those segments? John Morikis : Yes. Truman, I want to be careful about getting into too much detail on this call. I mean, we're making these decisions in our fourth quarter and going forward. And it's -- as we talked about on our second quarter earnings call in July, it's part of our normal earning process that we continue -- and as John talked about, we continue to assess these portfolio of business brands and customer programs and their ability to drive above-average market share growth and the operating margin and cash flow targets we set for them. And if we don't see that happening, we take action similar to what we did with the -- exiting the East private label business, the sale of our Australia and New Zealand business architectural. I would say, on the run rate savings, more of that is due to the portfolio review than what I would call more purely cost reductions, and that's relative to the macroeconomic headwinds we're seeing. And it's probably a 60-40 split. And why I think that's important is because, we're not overreacting to the macro environment. It means that we are driving operating margin improvement across consumer brands, across the PCG. And I would even venture to say that within PCG, yes, as John talked about, we hit the low end of the high teens of 17%. We have more work to do. This -- these actions we're taking in the coming quarters is not related to our long-term high teens, low 20 operating margin. This is really in response for the slowdown we're seeing in Europe and Asia. So we have opportunities to grow with platform consolidations. As we integrate these acquisitions going into next year, they'll start to be accretive as we get to the second half. So, if we see additional slowdowns in demand, we have more levers to pull to offset any decremental operating margin. So... John Morikis : Yeah. And Truman, I\u2019d answer this point as well. When you heard Al talk about not overreacting, I think your question is a good one, but I'd also point out that there are many areas of our business that we're actually continuing to invest and in some accelerating investments. So the leadership that we have, the ability to view and see where those opportunities are, I think, comes with a great deal of experience and what we're doing. And so we just talked about adding stores as an example. We'll have 35 new stores in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, 40 to 50 this year, this fourth quarter compared to 35 last year. And if you look at the staffing that we just talked about investing in digital programs that we're investing in. So we are making, we believe, the appropriate steps in reducing where we need to, but we're also investing in those areas that are appropriate. Al Mistysyn : The only other comment I'd make, Truman, related to that on the one-time cost. We'll call those out as we have typically done in the past, specifically even with the Valspar integration. So we didn't put them in the guidance in the fourth quarter. There are estimates. The timing is uncertain. We're pushing the teams pretty hard to take action and get these done, but we'll call them out over the next quarterly calls, and we expect to get approximately 170 over the next four quarters. Truman Patterson : Perfect. Thank you all and good luck in the upcoming quarter. John Morikis : Thanks Truman. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Josh Spector. Josh Spector : Yeah. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. A question on the Performance Coatings guidance. I guess, when I look at things sequentially, normally, it's relatively stable. You guys maybe have a 10% decline. Understanding things are getting worse in some of the regions, but I think when I look at some of the competitor guidance, things were already pretty bad in 3Q, and generally things stay bad into 4Q. Your guidance implies things are getting worse. So I'm wondering if you can maybe dig into some of the details there about getting worse or maybe your 3Q was helped by some items, which go away? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Josh, I think where we're seeing maybe a little bit more of a slowdown would be in Europe and Asia. And I think our largest region, North America, we talked about being in the low to mid-teens and price will start to annualize, so you don't get as much of a tailwind on price. Our comps are still pretty strong in our fourth quarter relative to last year. And so I don't know there's a significant step change that we're seeing other than -- I think we've got to be prepared and try to look at -- based on our history and what we've seen over the last few years is maybe a little bit wider range on sales as we go into the fourth quarter with the holidays and things of that nature. So I don't want to read too much into that other than maybe a little less price as we get into the fourth quarter and then a little bit worsening outside of North America. John Morikis : Well, I do think, to Al's point, if you look at the comps, if you take, for example, our packaging business, we had a high single-digit growth this past quarter versus strong double-digit comp. If you go into next quarter, fourth quarter comps last year were up over 30%. We've got a lot of momentum here in this business. We expect it to continue to win with our customers and grow with them. If you look at coil at a similar situation, fourth quarter last year, comps were up 20% coming off of a strong double-digit growth here as well. So there are some really strong performances here up against some really strong comps, and we think that these teams are continuing to grow in a pretty challenging environment. Josh Spector : Okay. Got it. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Jeff Zekauskas. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. In the fourth quarter, should your average prices in TAG be up about six percentage points sequentially? Al Mistysyn : No, Jeff. I think what what's going to happen is, we're going to get the full quarter of 10%. We're going to annualize the August 2021, 7%. We're going to annualize the September 4% of last year's surcharge. So when you net them all together, it's about flattish quarter-to-quarter or high single digit. Jeff Zekauskas : I'm sorry, the fourth quarter of 2022 relative to the third quarter of 2022? Shouldn't \u2013 since your prices are lifting, you increased prices 10% in early September, shouldn't you capture that all sequentially? No? Al Mistysyn : We are, but we're also annualizing some of the price we took last year. So from quarter-to-quarter, our dollars will be higher. I agree with that, but it's still in the high single-digit range for TAG. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And then in terms of raw materials, can you frame the alkyd resin sales and EBITDA penalty for 2022? And is TiO2 \u2013 are TiO2 prices going down sequentially in any area other than Asia? Jim Jaye : Yeah. I'll take the TiO2 piece, Jeff. What we did see in the quarter was some inflation that's happening. I think as we go forward, it will depend on some of the softening demand that we're seeing. And I think it's part of our overall view that TiO2 should start to be part of that basket that starts to moderate. The alkyd piece, I'll let Al. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Jeff, I think the alkyd impact. I mean, it could be around 1% on top line. It's \u2013 we're having to make choices. So, as an example, why it's difficult to pinpoint it. We're \u2013 there's a broad basket of alkyd, and we're somewhere getting fully what we need. Others, we're not. And it's just trying to look at ordering and reorders and things like that. So I think it's about 1% on the top line. The bottom line, I don't think we've quantified or really going to quantify at this time. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Al Mistysyn : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Ghansham Panjabi. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess, first off, starting off with TAG and the various sub-verticals within there, residential repaint has been a very strong grower for you for many years. I think part of that has just been due to higher home prices and consumers accordingly investing in what typically is your biggest asset. So just based on that, how do you think that category evolves as higher mortgage rates start to impact housing prices perhaps on the downside going forward? John Morikis : Ghansham, I might say it remains positive. If you talk with our contractors, they look at the backlog ahead, and they feel it's a terrific opportunity for them to continue to grow. The LIRA, if you look at the forecasting they have, is for double-digit growth for the remainder of 2022 going into 2023. I would agree that there's some projections that remodeling may slow down mid-2023, but I'll also remind you that paint represents a terrific project to have high impact of relatively low cost. And while rates are moving, house price appreciation has also moved as has the aging of housing. The stock -- aging stock home price -- values, I'm sorry, let me do this. The aging home continues to require more remodeling, more updates, people aging in place, and we see that. You see it in the NAHB, which has slowed just a bit, but still well above 50. And while existing home sales have slowed against strong comps, it's largely because of lack of inventory. And when people have a tendency to stay in home, they'll continue to invest in those homes. Res repaint, we've often talked about, is the largest segment in the professional sub-segment space. It's a great opportunity for us. These customers respond very well to our personal approach of selling with our store managers and our sales reps. Our focus here is pretty simple, and why we have confidence is that we focus on the services and the solutions that allow these customers to be more successful. And I mentioned just a moment ago about the new accounts and share-of-wallet, these are accounts that are responding well to us. And I mentioned earlier, the innovation, I thought I'd just share one really quick one with you as an example, because here in Cleveland, we've just experienced a pretty dramatic swing from cold weather to warm weather. And we've introduced a product called Latitude with Climate Flex Technology, and it's a terrific product that fits, and I think it's a great example of why we continue to grow. We're responsive to these customers' needs, and this is a product that can be applied anywhere from 35 degrees all the way up to 120 degrees with the same application, same flow, same hiding, same appearance. And so what you end up is with customers that understand we're really focused on making them successful, launching products that help them on projects longer, allowing them to work later into the season. And this product with very minimal warning, if it starts to rain usually within a few hours, not even about 30 minutes actually, the product is resistant to moisture. So these are just small examples, but it really allows us to demonstrate how we're moving the needle and why we have confidence in continuing to move the needle in this space. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, thanks for that John. And just for my second question, just on your comments on pricing effectiveness, which sounds like it's better than your initial expectations. What do you attribute that success towards in context of just the visible sort of plateauing of some of the inflationary numbers out there with oil prices stabilizing, et cetera? John Morikis : Well, it's really simple. It's not a 30-minute discussion. We don't win or lose our price increase on how well we talk to them about the price increase in a pricing meeting. It's everything that I just talked about. Every day, we earn the value that our customers are willing to pay us for our products and services. And so the fact that we're out there helping them to be more successful, more profitable, when our costs go up, they understand that we're doing everything we can. Every customer that does business with Sherwin-Williams should know, we're doing everything we can to drive our costs down in both raw material and every other item in that basket. But when we're with them in a meeting to talk about pricing, it's because we need it. We've done everything to offset it, but what's most important is, we're helping them to be successful and we're partnering with them in their business. And so yes, we're more effective now because we're helping our customers to win. Ghansham Panjabi : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good afternoon. John, last year, I think you spoke about adding 50 million gallons of architectural coatings capacity. Can you provide an update on that? Has any of it come online? And if so, what percent is loaded these days? John Morikis : It is online. It's allowed us, as Al mentioned earlier, to build inventory at a time where we typically would have been running flat with demand outside of Orlando, a terrific team. I got to hand it to our entire supply chain team for the great work they did in getting that capacity up and running as quickly as they did. It's pretty well utilized. We don't talk to the specifics, but we run a 10-year model out on capacity. And this capacity was needed, came in perfectly at a great time, and it's allowed us to be responsive to our customers. We've got more capacity coming in, in Statesville, which will allow us to further meet the growing demands that we're projecting. And again, I hope that you see exactly what we see, which is confidence in our ability to deliver and the investments to support the demand that we're going to create. Kevin McCarthy : Okay, that's great. And then secondly, if I may, I wanted to talk a little bit about the acquisition activity that you've done. I think you mentioned three bolt-ons closed during the quarter. What is the aggregate sales contribution that you would expect from those in 3Q and 4Q? And based on your margin comments and performance, it sounds like maybe the acquisitions feature significantly lower margins, is that correct? And if it is, maybe you can talk about the game plan to raise those to the company average or beyond over time. John Morikis : Yes. Let me start with the latter part of your question. I'll go over to Al to talk about the first piece. You're right, when we split out the acquisitions, it was to highlight to our investors our ability to reach the commitments that we've been talking about. In fact, when we first announced the Valspar acquisition, we painted a picture that we were proud of the performance of our TAG business and that we expected to drive this industrial business in that direction, citing our desire to get into the high teens, low 20 operating margins. The fact that we've reached adjusted backing out, to your point, the last 12 months of acquisitions up into the 17, there's no one popping corks here. We're not done. We know that, and it's one quarter. We understand that as well, but it clearly demonstrates what it is that we're out to do and how we're doing it. The fact that we've reached 17%, we think, is an indicator of where we are. And I will tell you where we're going is higher. The fact that we backed out these acquisitions should, in fact, indicate that we believe in these acquisitions. Some of them are as little as 30 or 60 days old, and we've not had the opportunity to drive the synergies that we know we can drive into these acquisitions. We're making these acquisitions with a long view in mind. We're not trying to add on the first 30 days of their joining our family. Do we expect them to be contributing what it is that we expect them to do? We buy them with a goal of bringing our synergies and plugging them into our platform, driving more volume out and cost reductions and synergies in. So, we're excited about these wonderful companies, the people that have joined our company as well as the technologies they bring, and we will drive those in the right direction, and they will contribute to our profit. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin, the acquisitions that we've had to date have added a little over 1.5% in the third quarter, expected to be similar in the fourth quarter. When I look at PCG, that would -- they would add about a mid-single-digit percentage. And just to highlight John's point, I mean, we spent over -- or about $630 million for the year on acquisitions. Most of that are two-thirds in the third quarter. John Morikis : The offset, as we talked earlier, to those acquisitions is in FX. So, about even if you're looking there just at the scoreboard. Kevin McCarthy : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Your next question is coming from John McNulty. John McNulty : Yes, thanks for taking my question. So, there's been a tremendous number of price hikes and announcements throughout the year at different times. So, I guess, can you help us to think about, if no further price hikes were announced, how should we be thinking about what the pricing in 2023 is year-over-year? Just to kind of help us to level set a little bit, just given how much you've been putting through. Al Mistysyn : Yes. John, with all the annualization, you'd expect mid-single-digit price effectiveness as you roll off the February 2020 increase and annualize this last increase along with each of the price increases we went out with through the other regions and segments. Right now, that's our estimate. John McNulty : Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then earlier, I guess, in the prepared remarks, you spoke to some of the e-commerce investment that you're making. I guess, can you give us an update as to some of the investments that you're making there? And how that market seems to be evolving at this point? We know it's still relatively early in that process, but I guess an update there would be helpful. John Morikis : Yes, John, I think what's important to understand is that our e-commerce initiative is not just a transaction. It's more than selling paint. The ability to transact over a platform like that is table stakes and ours goes well above that. It's a much broader approach towards trying to tie in the entire ecosystem that we bring. So that last mile delivery through our local store is something that we want to be able to deliver in, but we're reaching in to the contractor base that we have relationships with, and we're beginning to conduct more and more business along with the rep and the store manager in a very unique and differentiated way. We want these customers living on our platform, running their business on our platform and seamlessly doing business with us as a result of that, and it's working quite well. We've got a number of painting contractors, as well as a lot of national accounts that are that are really dialing into our platform. There'll never be a finish line to this. We're investing pretty heavily right now, but that -- as we're ramping up, it's part of our plan that will stabilize and diminish over time. But right now, we think we're in such a unique position with our store platform and the ability to conduct business in a way that no one else can that we're excited about it. We're leveraging it and more and more people are using that. John McNulty : Great. Thanks very much for the color. John Morikis : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question is coming from Christopher Parkinson. Christopher Parkinson : Good morning. Can you just hit on your broader expectations, whether it's 4Q or 2023, on what you're hearing in your general industrial businesses? Perhaps, just parsing out various content from geographies and then also more consumer versus core industrial businesses, it would be particularly helpful. Thank you. John Morikis : Chris, our industrial business, I would say, I talked just briefly about our packaging, but our packaging non-BPA coating is continuing to gain great traction. We mentioned that we're investing in this business. We've got great relationships with our customers here, and we are investing alongside with them with great agreements that allow us to really collaborate well and to grow with them. There's strong growth, for example, in beverage in both North America and Europe as the preference more and more moves away from other containers into aluminum cans. The Euro Food Safety Association opinion in Europe is also driving an increased demand for non-BPA coatings. We think that continues through 2022 and 2023. So this is a really, really unique technology, great customers. We've got a wonderful team here that's really executing very well. We're excited about this business. The coil business has been up double digits in seven of the last eight quarters. I mentioned earlier that we're facing some tough comps here with a 20% comp in the fourth quarter, but we're not running for the quarter. We're running this for years to come. We're really excited to hear again about this leadership team as well as the technology. Our solutions here have allowed us to be much more responsive to our customers. Quicker turns, smaller batches, works well in the face of adversity for our customers, and that's where we're headed, allowing them to be more responsive to their customers. So it's working very well. Our industrial wood business is another area that we believe we're growing share. Kitchen cabinets is a big part of this business. It's still positive now, but we do expect to see a little bit of slowdown in this business as new residential slows down. Furniture same way, we are growing share. But as new residential slows down, that will have an influence on industrial wood. There are other opportunities, though. We see a terrific opportunity in industrial wood flooring to continue to grow. Building products is our share position there offers tremendous opportunity. We do have a good position here in Europe, and so as Europe impacts industrial wood, we'll feel that in our industrial wood business. Auto refinish, I would say, there's a very high demand, and we're really pleased with this team and the job we're doing here. We know we're growing share here, particularly in North America, where our shop count is growing dramatically. There's a shortage here of body techs and parts that's having a material impact on backlogs, but our results in this business are terrific. And this is another one where we have a very similar model in our automotive as we do our TAG business with our controlled distribution. So our ability to serve and be responsive to our customers along with the shift that we're seeing, very positive mix shift towards our premium products gives us great confidence in this business. The combination of the Valspar and Sherwin technology that came together is really helping us win in auto refinish. GI, general industrial, strong demand here in heavy equipment expected through 2022 and 2023, especially large in ag and construction. And certainly, as you would expect, has been positive impacted by -- positively impacted by the infrastructure opportunities that exist. And then finally, in Protective & Marine, we're really pleased with what's happening here. Demand is strong in all end markets, oil and gas, water, wastewater. Again, same issue here as far as an opportunity in multiple high-value infrastructure opportunities. Solutions here go a long way as well. Our customers are willing to pay for products that help get them off the job quicker either with less coats, quicker recoat times, whatever it might be. We've been investing in this business in the flooring business. We're putting together a nice portfolio of technologies, services and capabilities that we believe will, again, further help us to differentiate. Our model here, again, is also differentiated, particularly in North America, where we have our store platform to use a distribution where many of our competitors are trying to drop ship in large orders. Our customers can work with our teams and leverage the local Sherwin-Williams store to source product and have it there when they need them, and our teams are working really well together on that. So, a lot of momentum here. We clearly see some pressures in the market as you look at Asia and Europe, and what's happening in those. We're not going to be immune to those, but we absolutely do believe where we expect and hold our teams accountable to outperform the market, and we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to do that, and we're making investments to help support them doing that. So we're feeling pretty good about this. Christopher Parkinson : That's very helpful color. Just as a very brief follow-up, there's been a lot of debate regarding pent-up demand in both resi and commercial repaint. Can you just quickly assess what you're currently hearing from your customers in terms of backlog, longevity, scope? I mean there's been kind of some rumors about the scope of certain projects, especially on the resi side actually expanding for people that are waiting a lot of time. Can you just give us your latest assessment on what you're hearing from your customers? And what -- how that drives your confidence at least into year end? Thank you so much. John Morikis : Well, Chris, hold on one second before you just gauge. Are you talking about new residential? Christopher Parkinson : No. Resi repaint and commercial repaint, I apologize. John Morikis : Okay. Got it. Well, commercial and resi repaint, I'd say, the underlying demand on commercial is strong. Projects are resuming and starts are positive. If you look at the Dodge Momentum Index, it's strong positive for every month in 2022 in the ABI, the Architectural Billing Index. And I'm sure you all know that's the index that really the metric for how architects are billing has been positive for 20 straight months. So that typically means projects in the next 9 to 12 months are going to be coming out of the ground and the fact that, they remain positive, we believe, is a good sign. Customers who are positive, they're still reporting delays resulting from some labor and material shortages that we are seeing a terrific opportunity for our products. Infrastructure spending here as well is strong and schools, airports, hospitals and also areas such as data centers, our position here is strong. Again, we really leverage our platform. We leverage our specification teams. We're calling on architects and continuously drive new products for customers that allow them to be more productive on the job. The combination of those local stores, reps and really great stable of products. I've got to hit it to our innovation team. It continues to do that. I know, they've been gathered just in the last couple of days, talking about how they can continue to add more to our success, and they're doing a wonderful job doing that. So I want to call out to them as well. As it relates to the residential repaint side, as I mentioned earlier, it's still positive. We see contractors in our stores every day. They're talking about the strength through the balance of the year and turning the corner into next year, still a pretty good backlog. I'd say that, if we talk to them about bidding and what's in the pipeline and really dial into our CRM to understand that, I'd say, what we've been witnessing is more and more the project scope has increased. So the size of the projects continue to grow, I think some of that might simply be \u2013 I finally found a contractor that will come give me a quote, and I'm not going to let him out just doing my living room. I want to have them do the entire house or expanded areas that they may not have planned on in the past. The quality of the leads seem to be going on. So there's \u2013 our contractors would refer to it as less tire kicking. There's people that, they are interested in projects, interested in getting quotes, and starting these projects right away. So we're very aggressive in pursuit of these customers. We feel as though our right to win and our value proposition is strong and getting stronger, and we're looking forward to continuing to leverage this. One last point I would make is that, we \u2013 our head is not in the sand here. The call out that we're making for adjusting our expenses and everything that we're doing, I think, highlights exactly the fact that we're grounded in reality. I will say, this though that when we exited the last slowdown, in the last recession, we did a postmortem and really tried to understand what is it coming out of the next slowdown. We want to be prepared with, and how would we be better positioned to withstand the next slowdown. And so throughout the period, 2008, 2010 period all the way to now, we've been working strategically on how do we better position the company. And when you look at residential repaint, it's a much larger percentage of our business now, and that\u2019s because when we \u2013 through the last one, new residential, while we've been successful and we've been growing in our success there, we wanted to offset this and diversify our business a little bit more. So we've been hard at work, driving more and more residential repaint. And now it's a larger percentage of our business, and we think it's going to allow us to weather storms much better than we have in the past. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you as always. John Morikis : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Begleiter. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Al, should gross margins be up in Q4 sequentially? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Yes. And part of that, David, is the full impact of the 10% price increase. We do have a softer comp, but really, you also have a strong low double-digit volume in TAG, which is our highest margin segment. So we should see a nice -- better flow-through, if you will, in our fourth quarter relative to our third quarter in TAG, which will help drive that gross margin up. So yes, I'm expecting sequential and a bigger year-over-year improvement in our fourth quarter and possibly even getting to the low end of that long-term 45% to 48% range. David Begleiter : Very good. And John, just on the Home Depot PPG relationship, has there been -- have you seen any negative impacts in your business in terms of business losses or share losses? John Morikis : Well, I would say this. Our belief is that we're in a really, really good position. We've been working hard, developing our approach towards a controlled distribution model that allows us to differentiate. When we're doing our job, we would expect people to react and change their models. And when they do that, we like to take advantage of that change. We think we're executing really, really well. We think people are reacting exactly the way we'd expect them to react, and we'd say that we're capitalizing on that, and we will continue to capitalize on that. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I guess, first off, you noted that there could be some challenges in 2023. Could you just describe that a little bit more? Is that a continued slowdown in Europe and China and potentially, that spreading over into North America in the TAG business, or is it mainly still kind of more likely in PCG. I will stop there. Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Arun, I think we've talked about it. We do expect continued slowdown in Europe and Asia. I think as we get into North America architectural demand, I'd prefer as we've gone through or going through our normal preparation for the coming year in the operating plan to give you a bit more color on that in January. We'll have a few more months under our belt. There's a lot of moving macro trends and things that are happening, and they're moving daily. So rather than try to give you an outlook for 2023 on ARC in the regions, I'd prefer we'd be better prepared to do that in January. I think the fourth quarter, like we talked about, strong high teens, low 20% in TAG and low double-digit volume likely to carry over into the first quarter and then the price of high single digits that we've got certainly carries over into the first quarter. I think that's as far as I think we can go on color. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up then, have you seen your customers change their order patterns at all in maybe some different market segments as the backlog actually growing, or is it that they're getting to jobs that maybe that were deferred during 2021 because of lack of availability to raws and labor? Maybe, you can just comment on that. Thanks. John Morikis : Well, there are certainly some of that. And I would say that -- two things : one is, I think we're working much closer with our customers. Adversity brings out the best. Sometimes you have to find it. The fact that we've gotten through this challenging time with raw materials with a closer relationship with our customers, we better understand what projects they're on. In the past, they just walked into the store and they knew they could have it, whatever it was. When they needed it, it was there. As we went through that process of working through the raw material shortages, we were more responsive or better responsive when we understood what the needs of the customers were. So I'd say, the pattern, first of all, for us, it's a closer pattern. We're working better with them. We do see some, I would call it, maybe, they're more fluid. They're moving to projects when they become available and if it's weather changing or getting outside when they can, the fact that they're racing with a pretty sizable backlog. They don't want to take any time off that they don't need to. It's why I mentioned that product that I mentioned earlier, it extends the painting season for them. But I'd say, as it relates to the pattern themselves on the architectural side, we're seeing more frequency, I would say. We're seeing people in our stores more. And on the industrial side, I'd say, we're probably seeing small orders more frequently -- smaller orders more frequently as our customers are trying to prepare for cash management, while being responsive for their teams with their teams or their customers. And again, that works to our advantage, given our model of responsiveness. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. John Morikis : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from John Roberts. John Roberts : Thank you. A nice quarter. One of your longest lead time planning items is new store openings. I assume you have your sights for 2023 selected. Can you give us some insights into what new stores might look like next year? John Morikis : You're right, we do have that planned out. And I'd say that we're probably get this point going to tell you, it's going to be in the 80 to 100 range. And you'll see those in a combination of metro markets where we're continuing to feed in locations, as well as in some markets where we want to supplement some of the previous investments with added locations for our customers. But you're right, John, as we go into the year, a good portion of those are already identified and the deals are just getting finalized, and we're working through those. So, we're prepared, and again, confidence. Confident in our model, confident in the differentiation of Sherwin-Williams adding stores while others are closing stores and taking advantage of the market opportunities that exist as a result. John Roberts : Okay. And on a one-year comp, the DIY in your stores was obviously very different than the DIY in your consumer segment because a year ago, you were prioritizing the propane or over DIY in your stores. If you looked at a two-year comp, is the DIY in your stores roughly up the same amount as the DIY in the consumer segment on a two-year stack? Al Mistysyn : I think it'd be up higher than that, John. I think we've had really nice strength in that DIY customer within TAG. And the fact that we've been able to do turn on super sales again to bring them in has really helped drive that growth. John Roberts : Great. Thank you, John Morikis : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Sison Mike Sison : Hey guys, nice quarter. Just one question for me. You sort of mentioned thinking or sort of managing the business on a worst-case scenario, what would that look like for the stores? Would demand be flat, down, down a lot? And in the event sort of that unfolds, what can you do to help mitigate some of that potential volume decline? John Morikis : Yes. Mike, trying to guess how bad could be is not something that we're going to do on this call. The reality is that we prepare for a number of scenarios. Our view is that, particularly in that store's business that when things get tough, we go hunting. And the reality of a really difficult time in stores might include scaling back on some of the staffing if we didn't have the transaction count or other expenses that we might feel are appropriate. But I would say this that in the 37, soon to be 38 years I've been with the company, our approach has been to take advantage of these situations. I mentioned earlier, the work we've been doing to grow res repaint as a percent of our business coming through COVID, I think it's a great demonstration of what we do in really difficult times. We go find customers. Those customers need to paint to put food on their plate, feed their families. We grow share, we grow active accounts and we outperformed the market. And I'd say, that's what you should expect us to do in difficult times. Al Mistysyn : Mike, I would just add to that. If you, kind of how I frame it, so to speak, is if you go back and look at new residential in 2008 and 2009, where there's a lot of housing speculation and things of that nature, our new res was down in the low 22% range. And as John talked, as we've come out of that -- and back then, res repaint and new res ratio is 1 :1. Fast forward that to today and our residential repaint versus new res is 2 :1. And when I look at also property maintenance over that same time period, you look at the combination of res repaint and property maintenance that are less recession -- more recession-resistant, we're probably over 50% of our sales relative to just over 40% back then. So, when he talks about how we've map the company to help us mitigate a recession, those are the types of things. And the metrics I look at to say, okay, I don't believe it can be bad as 2008 and 2009, but if it is, we're much larger in other segments to help offset it. John Morikis : And again, not to keep everyone here all day, but the res repaint is an important part of it. The Pros Who Paint is another piece. When we think about the residential, that is a new focus for us as well, as in that industrial side where packaging, auto refinish, these are growing parts of our business that weren't as strong in the past. So, we don't wait for bad things to happen. We're trying to make good things out of it. Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. John Morikis : Sure, Mike. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison. Mike Harrison : Hi. Good morning. You guys noted that you're working through some inefficiencies in your supply chain still. Presumably, that means that you're starting to get back to playing a little bit more offense when it comes to procurement. So I'm curious, when you're talking about raw materials coming lower sequentially, is that really just a decline in market prices, and that's mostly what you're talking about, or does it also include this greater supply chain and procurement efficiency that you should see over time? John Morikis : Yes, Mike, I think what we're speaking to there has been our willingness to serve our customers even at a cost. And so, I think it will, as Ghansham might have been asked about the supply or the capacity that came on the 50 million gallons. As our raw materials have become available, we don't want to turn those down. We may need finished product in one part of the country, but the raws -- because of the supplier base might be available in another part, near another plant. We've manufactured that product and shift it to our customers to serve them. We have worked with our suppliers at times, where they've been unable to ship raw materials to us. We've used our own tank wagons or our own vehicles or 18-wheelers to secure a product and get it to our plants, when needed. So, there's an advantage of doing business with Sherwin that starts with the customer in the store or the rep plant, but it works all the way through to the raw material and manufacturing piece. And we'll do what we have to, to keep our customers in business and producing, because we know in the long run, the better job we do at keeping them in business, is the better supplier we are to them. That's in our best interest long term. Mike Harrison : Right. And then looking at the restructuring actions, it looks like a good portion of those are targeted at the Asia Pacific region. Is that a region, where you're still investing for growth and still seeing a lot of opportunities, or is that -- is there kind of a retrenchment going on there? Maybe talk just a little bit about your strategy in the APAC region. John Morikis : Mike, I'd say, on the industrial side, we are investing and continue to grow. Nearly every one of our PCG businesses has a good and growing business there, and we expect that to continue. As you would expect, we are taking the appropriate actions based on slowdowns. And as I would say, is our custom, we continue to evaluate our businesses. And as Al mentioned, not only our businesses, our programs, our customers, relationships, everything we can to ensure that they reach the hurdle for us to continue to invest in those. I think it is safe to say that we're doing a deep dive review of our architectural business in China. And based on how that review comes out, we'll decide about what we do in the future. The industrial side, we know we can demonstrate the value for our customers that can allow us to win there. Mike Harrison : All right. Thank you very much. John Morikis : Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question is coming from Greg Melich. Greg Melich : Thanks. Thanks for the insight on the gross margin going forward, guys. I'd like basically asked the same thing on SG&A. I think it was up almost 12% year-on-year in the third quarter. Is that a -- should we assume a double-digit growth in SG&A as well in the fourth quarter? Al Mistysyn : Yeah. Greg, I think what you're going to see in our fourth quarter, with the TAG stores that we've invested in and then opening another 40 to 50, and in our fourth quarter along with the reps to support that, we'll continue to grow or control our SG&A pretty tightly. I do expect to get leverage still in our fourth quarter on SG&A. But as you typically see with the seasonal slowdown in our architectural demand, SG&A as a percent of sales will be up. I don't expect our SG&A to be up as much in our fourth quarter just because some of the actions we've taken on holding new positions, reducing travel, things of that nature will help offset some of those additional investments. Greg Melich : Got it. And then I guess my follow-up is, given that the -- we've tend to focus on getting on top of raws, and clearly, it seems like you're there now. But given all the other costs that are going up, is it possible next year that there could be another round of price increases even if raws are flattening out? Al Mistysyn : Greg, I think we've got to get through our normal planning process here. We'll evaluate the merit increases and different other inputs like labor and transportation. And if we -- you know us, if we need to go out again, we will, but we're not in a position today to talk to that specifically. John Morikis : And if we need to go out, we will have wrestled everything we can to the map to try to avoid having to go out, but I think we've demonstrated an ability and a willingness if we have to. But we don't take that lightly. Our goal is not to have to, but there are some inflationary areas of wages or whatever it is. We also want to make sure that we retain the best talent, and so we know we need to be competitive as well. Greg Melich : That's great. And then my last is really a follow-up on gross margin. Could you help us, if gross margins end up being, I guess, they were up 110, 120 this quarter, and let's say they're up 300 or more in the fourth quarter, is that going to be more from price versus raws or more just from volume increases? I think last year, you called out that was hundreds of bps of help. Can you just help us on that? Al Mistysyn : Yeah, I think it's going to be the strong volume through TAG of double-digit pricing and then the raw moderation in that order. Greg Melich : Got it. Thank you guys, and good luck. Al Mistysyn : Thank you Greg. John Morikis : Thanks Greg. Operator : Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten. Adam Baumgarten : Hey, good afternoon everyone. Just maybe sticking on DIY. I know you mentioned that volumes in TAG were really strong there. Were North American DIY volumes positive in Consumer Brands in the quarter? John Morikis : North American volume was up strong single digits. Al Mistysyn : Yes. I'd say, on the volume side, we were up low to mid-teens in the third quarter. Volume was up low single-digit. Adam Baumgarten : Okay. Got it. And then just as we're thinking about the raw materials, if we were to keep the current basket at the levels where they are today and flow that through to next year, what would that look like from a raw material inflation perspective, if everything just stays stable where it is? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Adam, I think you're -- if everything stayed exactly the same, which we know you're still talking probably low mid single-digit by the time you annualize everything, that's a hard answer today. Like we talked about let us get through our planning cycle, let us get through our demand outlook with our suppliers and let us give you a better view of our full basket of input costs, raw materials, labor, freight transportation on our January call. I think it's too early to be speculating too much on 2023 costs at this point. Adam Baumgarten : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois. Garik Shmois : Hi. Thanks. I'm curious if you could speak to any mix impact in TAG, or are you seeing any signs or anticipating any signs of trade down? John Morikis : No, actually, we see the opposite as customers are facing labor shortages and trying to get through projects as quickly as possible. They have a tendency to move up in quality. And we're actually even seeing that in our new residential as well as we've introduced new products, new one of Painters Edge Plus. It's an ultra flat product that hides in perfections as an example. So you get in some of these projects where the drywall contractors are struggling to hire and find experienced drywallers. They're passing drywall on that may not be as perfect as the painter might have liked. And so we're helping them with products that hide some of those imperfections. Our customers are willing to pay for those. 90% -- 85% to 90% of their cost is labor. So shifting up in quality helps them on the overall profitability of the project. Garik Shmois : Got it. Thank you. Follow-up question is just one more on DIY. It sounded a bit more sluggish coming out of 2Q. Just curious, are you seeing a sequential strengthening there? John Morikis : I'd say, some of what you're seeing in our DIY first in our stores -- and Al was right, we've seen more DIY in our own stores, but it's a relatively small percentage of our business. We're mainly focused on the pinning contractor through our own stores, but the comparisons there where we were shifting product away from DIY products into contractors is a portion of the benefit that we see. And then also on the consumer brand side, as we've reached a more level state, if you will, of raw materials. We've been able to benefit from some of the pipeline filling into other customers that we've not been able to in the past just because of availability. So we're seeing some benefit there as well. Garik Shmois : Got it. Thanks, again. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Steve Byrne. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. Are the equipment sales that you're paying contractors sometimes buy from you, the spraying machines and so forth. Are they still a good leading indicator of paint demand for you, or does that depend on which of the business is? I was just curious if it's still useful, how would you characterize those sales in recent months? And on the same theme, John, you talked about having visibility for the paint for the pro backlog through the end of the year, here we are almost in November, would you normally have a view of a backlog beyond year-end at this time? John Morikis : So let me answer the first question. You're right that the spray equipment sales, any given time of year, could vary as how much of a leading indicator would be. So residential repaint, as an example, I don't think many of us would appreciate a repaint contractor coming into our homes where we're living with an airless sprayer trying to spray the inside of the home. And as exterior slows down, they're less likely to purchase spray equipment. So I'd say that for the most part right now, spray equipment is riding along, as you would expect, with the sales volume of paint that we're experiencing. And then the second part of your question, Steve, was \u2013 Steve Byrne : Just whether you\u2019re seeing more of a backlog beyond a couple of months at this time of year? John Morikis : I'd say, right now, as we'd be talking historically to our customers, the outlook that we have is pretty much in line with what we would normally hear from them. Commercial contractors generally have a \u2013 a longer view. These are larger projects that go out to bid as far out as a year earlier. Residential repaint would be on the other end of the spectrum and those contractors could get contracts or agreements that could start in weeks, others in months. So I'd say, it's pretty much in line with what we would normally see if you put them all together and look at the backlog. It's pretty consistent with what we've seen. Steve Byrne : And then with respect to the consumer business in China, is that basically wallroom brand. And I was just curious whether that brand that you acquired with Valspar just hasn't worked out as well as you had hoped? John Morikis : It is the wallroom brand. And if I'm talking on a call about a deep dive, it probably is safe to say, it's not worked out as well as I had hoped. Steve Byrne : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : You bet. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Eric Bosshard. Eric Bosshard : Good afternoon. Two things for you. First of all, Al, in terms of production and inventory from here, can you just clarify what the plan is as you head into what you characterize as a bit uncertain in volume in some areas? What is the plan through 4Q and into 2023? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Eric, I talked about building some inventory in our fourth quarter on architectural specifically. I think of those as maybe some of the -- if you rank products, being your fastest mover rebuilding some inventories in Bs and Cs and Ds just to make sure we got the full spectrum of products covered going into next year's selling season. That being said, as John talked about, we're going to stay very close with our customers and what their backlogs and outlooks are, and we'll adjust production accordingly. I don't want to get too far out in front of demand, knowing that we were able to keep up with demand through the summer season with the additional capacity we brought online that we talked about earlier. So I think it gives us more flexibility to manage inventory lower if need be going into the summer. But I think those are things that we're very -- going to be very cautious about. Like I said, I want to get our working capital back down towards that 10.5% of sales, where we -- I would like to run the company. We think we can get down there around 11% to 11.5% by the end of this year, knowing we're going to carry a little bit more inventory into next year or I should say it that way, I should say, we'll be back to a more historical level of inventory than we were a year ago, obviously. But I think that's something we'll manage pretty tight. Eric Bosshard : Okay. And then secondly, John, I understand your comments on how the portfolio is different with more resi repaint versus new. In the last cycle, the industrial business is also, I'd say, notably bigger than it was before as well. I'm curious how that influences the gross margin path? How you talked about getting to the low end of the 45% to 48% in 4Q? But how does the gross margin recovery path behave? In this cycle, should it behave like in prior cycles, or is the inclusion of industrial change in the arc of that path? Al Mistysyn : Eric, I think what you see is that mix shift of -- on the industrial side is a little bit better for us from a gross margin standpoint. And then you got to kind of look at it even within architectural, the mix shift is a little bit better for us. So I get your question. We didn't have packaging through the last cycle. It's a larger portion -- a much larger portion of industrial even now than it was two years ago. So I think when you look at margin profiles, we might have a positive -- a little bit more positive shift when you get into these slowdowns. We're seeing some of that. I would argue with a slowdown in Asia and Europe across some of our businesses within Industrial. So as North America hangs in there and has better demand, our margins will be a little bit better around the business. John Morikis : To weigh in segments like our auto refinish and coil, I mean there's -- it's a very good question. Eric, I think if you look at the overall, we think we're not only better positioned from a demand standpoint. We talk about resi repaint, but you also would have to include property management in there, the auto refinish, the packaging, all of these are really better positioned, but we're going to be, I think, in a better position to grow volume as well, more absorption through the plant than we may have to the last cycle as well. And there's a lot that we bring in our approach even with existing segments. The strategy work that we've done to allow us to better focus on the sub-segments and those customers within there that are willing to pay for the solutions that we bring is where we're focused, and we think that's going to benefit us. Eric Bosshard : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Eric. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jim Jaye for any closing remarks. End of Q&A: Jim Jaye : Thank you, Holly, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. As you heard, we're looking forward to delivering a very solid fourth quarter that will result in 35% growth in our second half adjusted earnings per share. We're also very focused on preparing for any number of scenarios that might unfold next year. Our team is very deep and experienced, as John said. So very confident heading into next year, and we're looking to execute \u2013 continuing to execute at a high level. We'll be available along with Eric Swanson for your questions afterwards, and again, thank you for joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's event. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company's Review of Fourth Quarter 2022 results and our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2023. With us on today's call are John Morikis, chairman and CEO; Al Mistysyn, CFO; Heidi Petz, President and COO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which the statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered strong fourth quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, including high single-digit percentage sales growth, significant year-over-year gross margin improvement, expanded adjusted operating margins in all three segments, strong double-digit diluted net income per share growth and strong EBITDA growth. Sales in our professional architectural end markets increased by a high-teens percentage. On the industrial side of the business, sales were up by double-digit percentages in North and Latin America, partially offset by softer conditions in Europe and Asia. From a cost perspective, year-over-year inflation remained significant in the quarter, but we are encouraged by a modest sequential decrease in raw material costs for the second quarter in a row. Additionally, we made solid progress on the targeted restructuring and cost reduction actions we announced on our last call, the results of which we expect to begin benefiting us in the first half of 2023. Throughout the quarter, we remain focused on customer solutions and executing on continuous improvement in business optimization activities. We also identified opportunities and prepared for what we currently expect will be a challenging operating environment in 2023. I'd like to highlight just a few of our consolidated fourth quarter numbers. Comparisons in my comments are to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Starting with the top line. Fourth quarter 2022 consolidated net sales increased 9.8% to $5.23 billion. Consolidated gross margin increased to 42.7%, an improvement of 320 basis points. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased by 40 basis points to 29.8%. Excluding onetime costs related to our previously announced restructuring actions, gross margin improved sequentially to 42.9% in the fourth quarter of '22 from 42.8% in the third quarter of '22. And SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 110 basis points as compared to the prior year. Consolidated profit before tax increased $186 million or 60.2%. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $1.48 per share versus $1.15 per share a year ago. Excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense and costs related to previously announced restructuring actions, fourth quarter adjusted diluted net income per share increased 41% to $1.89 per share versus $1.34 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased $281 million or 52.7%. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our fourth quarter results by segment. John will follow Heidi with his comments on our full year 2022 results as well as our 2023 outlook before we move on to your questions. Heidi Petz : Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Americas Group, where sales increased 15.7% driven by mid-single-digit volume growth and continued effective pricing. Segment profit increased by $126.4 million and segment margin improved 210 basis points to 17.2%. Our pro architectural sales grew by a high teens percentage of the quarter, led by property management and followed by new residential, commercial and residential repaint, respectively. Sales in Protective & Marine, DIY and Latin America, all increased by double digits, but were below the TAG segment guided range. From a product perspective, interior and exterior paint sales were both strong, with interior sales growing faster and representing a larger part of the mix. We opened 40 net new stores in the fourth quarter and a total of 72 net new stores in 2022. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased by 2.4% in the quarter, which was better than our guidance. Sales decreased due to lower volume sales and low single-digit FX headwinds, partially offset by price increases. Sales were slightly positive in North America and Europe, but more than offset by significant continued weakness in China due in large part to COVID-related lockdown. Customers managed their inventories as inflation continued to pressure DIY paint demand from consumers for this segment. Tightness in alkyd resin also impacted our ability to produce stains and aerosols. Adjusted segment margin was 11.3%, up 500 basis points year-over-year. We also made good progress in the quarter on the China architectural and aerosol restructuring actions that we described last quarter. The actions in the fourth quarter resulted in $25.6 million in onetime restructuring costs and a $15.5 million impairment charge. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 4.2% and were driven by mid-teens pricing, partially offset by a low double-digit decrease in volume. Mid-single-digit sales from acquisitions were offset by a mid-single-digit unfavorable FX impact. Adjusted segment margin increased 530 basis points to 14.2% of sales. This is the third straight quarter that this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement driven by execution of our strategy, including effective pricing actions. Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased double digits against a challenging comp. Latin America sale also increased by double digits against a strong comp. Sales in Europe decreased high-single-digits against a double-digit comparison and amidst continued economic slowing. Sales decreased by a low teens percentage in Asia against a double-digit comparison and as COVID lockdowns continued to impact demand. From a division perspective, Growth was strongest in coil, which was up by a low double-digit percentage, followed by auto refinish and general industrial, which were both up mid-single digits. Packaging was down low single digits driven by negative double-digit FX impact in Europe and Asia and against an extremely strong comparison last year of over 30%. We continue to feel very good about our packaging position and expect this to be a recession-resilient performer. Industrial wood was down low teens as the housing slowdown is impacting furniture, flooring and cabinetry market. Similar to Consumer Brands Group, Performance Coatings made good progress on its portion of the targeted restructuring actions that we described on our last call, resulting in $22.2 million in onetime costs in the quarter. With that, let me turn it to John for his comments on our full year results and our 2023 outlook. John Morikis : Thank you, Heidi, for that color on our fourth quarter segment results. I want to thank our teams for working hard to deliver a strong finish to the year. I'm particularly pleased with the significant adjusted profit margin improvement that all three segments delivered compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Our fourth quarter completed a strong year for Sherwin-Williams and I'd like to provide just a few high-level comments on our full year performance. On a consolidated basis, we delivered record sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted net income per share in 2022. We generated these results in a difficult operating environment, including relentless inflation, less-than-optimal raw material availability, a war in Europe and COVID lockdowns in China. Our people refused to be deterred by these challenges and continue to do what they do best, serve our customers. Our success stems from executing on our strategy, which remains unchanged. We provide differentiated solutions that enable our customers to increase their productivity and their profitability. These solutions center on industry and application expertise, innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution. None of this happens without the determination and dedication of our greatest asset, the more than 61,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams. Together, this team grew full year consolidated sales by 11.1% to a record $22.1 billion. It was the 12th consecutive year we have grown the business. On a segment basis, the Americas Group delivered 12.9% sales growth and grew profit before tax $197.5 million. Our largest customer segment, residential repaint, grew by a double-digit percentage for the seventh year in a row. Sales in all other customer segments were also up by double digits for the year. Consumer Brand sales were down 1.1% for the year. Sales were up mid-single digits in North America, our largest region. This was more than offset by double-digit declines in Europe and China. Although the bottom line results weren't what we expected, 2022 was a transition year for Consumer Brands Group as they completed a number of restructuring and simplification efforts to position the business for long-term success and driving operating margins back to the high teens. Performance Coating sales were up 13.2% for the year against a 22% comparison. All divisions grew with the exception of industrial wood. It was down less than 1%. Adjusted segment margin expanded 250 basis points to 14.1% for the year as we continue to recover from the highest cost inflation in the company and pursue our high-teens margin target for this segment. Adjusted diluted net income per share increased 7.1% to a record $8.73 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $3.61 billion or 16.3% of sales. Net operating cash for the year was $1.9 billion or 18.7% of sales. We returned a total of $1.5 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share buybacks in 2022.  We invested $883 million to purchase 3.35 million shares at an average price of $263.64. We distributed $618.5 million in dividends, an increase of 5.4%. We also invested $644.5 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $188 million for our building our future projects. We ended the year with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times. Additionally, we invested $1 billion in acquisitions that accelerated our strategy. I'd also like to mention our ESG efforts where we continue to work toward meeting our longer-term targets. Newsweek, Forbes and other third parties once again recognized various aspects of our program. Throughout the year, we continue to execute on continuous improvement initiatives and targeted investments to drive growth, competitiveness, efficiency and profitability. We opened 72 new paint stores and hired 1,400 management trainees. We introduced multiple new products while reducing SKUs and formulations. We expanded production capacity and enhanced procurement and logistics processes. We also continued on our digital and sustainability journeys, and we executed on our acquisition strategy. I am confident we widened the gap between Sherwin-Williams and our competitors in 2022, and that's just what we intend to do again in 2023. So turning to our outlook. We enter 2023 with confidence, energy and a commitment to seize profitable growth opportunities wherever we find them. We have clarity of mission. We have the right strategy. We're focused on solutions for our customers. We're spending more time selling products and less time sourcing them, thanks to recovery in the supply chain. We're simplifying the business, and we're executing on targeted restructuring actions. We've made the right growth investments, and we'll continue to do so. We also have a portfolio that should be more resilient than in prior recessions. And above all, we've got the right people. We expect to outperform the market just as we have in the past. At the same time, we're not operating with our heads in the sand. We currently see a very challenging demand environment in 2023, and visibility beyond our first half is limited. The Fed has also been quite clear about its intention to slow down demand in its effort to tame inflation. These factors have not changed from what we communicated on our third quarter call and our base case in 2023 remains to prepare for the worst. Based on current indicators, we believe this is the most realistic outlook at this time. On the architectural side, it's no secret that U.S. housing will be under significant pressure this year. Single-family permits have been down year-over-year for 10 consecutive months, and single-family starts have been down year-over-year for eight consecutive months. Mortgage rates also remain elevated. As a result, we believe our new residential volume could be down anywhere from 10% to 20% this year. We expect our other PRO end markets to be more resilient than this, but there are headwinds in these areas, too. For example, existing home sales, which drive a portion of our repaint business have declined year-over-year for 16 straight months. Now while we see a backlog of new commercial construction, the Architectural Billing Index has contracted the last three months.  On the DIY side, we expect inflation to continue putting pressure on consumer behavior in the U.S. and in Europe. On the industrial side, the PMI numbers for manufacturing in the U.S., Europe, China and Brazil have been negative for multiple months. We have already seen an industrial slowdown in Europe and the same is beginning to appear in the U.S. across several sectors. In China, COVID remains a wildcard and the trajectory of economic recovery is difficult to map. The U.S. housing slowdown will also impact some of our industrial businesses, namely industrial wood where we have already seen pressure and coil to some extent. Our team fully understands the importance of winning new accounts and growing share of wallet in this environment, and that is where we will be focused. From a cadence standpoint, we expect year-over-year sales and earnings performance will be significantly better in the first half than in our second half, driven by several factors.  Our total company comparison will be much more favorable in the first half of 2023 as we delivered a very strong second half performance in 2022, where sales were up 13.8% and adjusted earnings per share grew by over 37%. As we've often said, volume is the key driver for operating leverage in our model. In the Americas Group, which is our largest and most profitable segment, our year-over-year volume comparisons are expected to be meaningfully better in the first half versus in the second half based on the trends we are currently seeing.  We also expect more carryover price in the first half of 2023, which will have the full benefit of our September 6, 2022 price increase in TAG as well as prior price increases in the other two segments, all of which will annualize in the back half of this year. Additionally, we expect new residential sales will hold up better in our first half before very meaningful deceleration of demand in the back half of the year. Acquisitions will also be a tailwind in our first half as we expect incremental sales of approximately $140 million from transactions which closed after July 1 of last year. Given these factors and the softening demand environment, we believe our expectations for the back half of 2023 are tempered appropriately at this time. As you would expect, we will gain more clarity as the year progresses, and we will provide a more finally tuned view of our second half outlook during our second quarter conference call. As we said on our last call, we anticipated the demand environment would be challenging in 2023, leading us to get out ahead on cost management with the targeted restructuring we began in the fourth quarter. We estimate the annual savings from this effort to be in the $50 million to $70 million range, with about 75% realized by the end of 2023, and we are reaffirming those estimates today. Our outlook also assumes our raw material costs will be down by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect to see the largest benefit occurring in the second and third quarters. We expect to see decreases across many commodity categories, though the ranges likely will vary widely. From an availability standpoint, certain alkyd resins remain a pain point, impacting stains, aerosols and some industrial products. We expect supply of these resins to continue improving through the first half of the year, in part due to ramping of our own internal production.  We expect other costs, including wages, energy and transportation to be up in the mid to high single-digit range. For the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will be flat to up by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2022, inclusive of a mid-single-digit price increase. Our sales expectations for the quarter by segment are included in our slide deck. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be flat to down mid-single digits, inclusive as a mid-single-digit price of carryover from 2022. Our sales expectations for the year by segment are included in our slide deck. We expect diluted net income per share for 2023 to be in the range of $6.79 to $7.59 per share. Full year 2023 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.81 per share and includes expense related to our previously announced targeted restructuring actions of approximately $0.25 to $0.35 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $7.95 to $8.65. We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. Let me close with some additional data points and an update on our capital allocation priorities. Given carryover pricing, raw material deflation and our ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, we would expect full year gross margin expansion. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to increase in 2023. This is similar to the slowdown in 2008 and 2009, where we continue to invest in long-term solutions for our customers that allowed us to grow at a multiple of the market when demand normalized. We'll also control costs tightly in non-customer-facing functions and execute on our restructuring initiatives. We have a variety of SG&A levers we can pull depending on a material change to our outlook up or down. We expect operating margin to modestly improve year-over-year, excluding restructuring and impairment costs and acquisition-related amortization expense. While we don't typically provide this level of color, we believe it is helpful to do so this year given the higher level of non-operating expenses impacting 2023. We expect to open between 80 to 100 new stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2023. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements as well as systems and product innovation. We expect to complete the targeted restructuring actions we announced on our previous call, including the benefits and onetime costs we have outlined. We will continue to simplify and optimize the organization. The Latin American business of the Americas Group is now being managed and reported within the Consumer Brands Group. The change allows TAG leadership to focus more exclusively on its core U.S. and Canada stores business. While the Latin America architectural demand and service model are trending to be more in line with CBG's strategy. This business had sales of approximately $700 million in 2022. The change will be marginally accretive to TAG and marginally dilutive to CBG.  You will see this change when we report first quarter results in April. Prior-year segment results will be restated at that time to reflect the change. The first quarter and full year guidance for 2023 we've communicated today does not reflect this change. Next month, at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 0.8% to $2.42 per share, up from $2.40 last year. If approved, this will mark the 45th consecutive year we've increased our dividend. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We do not have any long-term debt maturities due in 2023. However, we will reduce short-term debt to trend our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio towards the high end of our long-term target of 2 to 2.5 times. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. In addition, I will refer you to the slide deck issued with our press release this morning, which provides guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. Given the many variables at play, limited visibility beyond the first half and the high level of uncertainty in the global economy, we believe our outlook is a realistic one. Our slide deck further outlines the assumptions underlying our guidance and is based on our current dialogue with customers and suppliers and our reading of numerous macro indicators. As we get through our first half and we see more information, those assumptions could change. If those assumptions change for the better, we would expect to do better than the guidance we are laying out today. While we can't defy gravity, we do expect to outperform the market and our competitors in 2023. I'm highly confident in our leadership team, which is deep and experienced and has been through many previous business cycles. We've transformed our business in many ways since the last significant downturn, and we are now a stronger and a more resilient company. We also know our guidance is clearly reflective of the market pressure we are experiencing. We anticipated 2023 would be challenging. We've planned accordingly.  We have and will continue taking appropriate actions. We expect strong momentum coming out of this period of uncertainty, similar to prior downturns. That momentum will stem from our strategy of providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and more profitable. In challenging environments, like the current one, we can be an even more valuable partner to our customers, while we're also earning new ones. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question is coming from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Your line is live. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much for taking my question. On Slide 8, you have some pretty helpful framework specifically on TAG volumes. John, obviously, you've been discussing this for a while, but can you just talk about the differences, obviously, what you're seeing in the new resi side, which is a little bit smaller but what you're hearing from your team regarding the pent-up demand on the resi repaint side. How you feel about that versus a quarter, 6 months ago and how that shapes up throughout 2023. Thank you so much. John Morikis : Sure, Chris. I'll start with new residential. And what I'll do is I'll talk a little bit about new res and I'll hand it over to Heidi to talk a little bit about her view. She's obviously working closely with her teams, and then I'll pick back up on res repaint we'll do the same. New res, I would start with a very important fact that over the last 10 years, we've had a 10 year compounded growth rate of about 10.5%. So this has been an area of focus for us, and it's one where we have, I think, clearly demonstrated significant success, and we are determined to continue to drive that success. Permits and starts are down as we all know. And our relationships with our national builders are strong and getting stronger. There's a lot going on, and we're working closely with them. Heidi, why don't I give that to you? And maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're working on, on the new residential side? Heidi Petz : Yes, sure. No, I think the last 10 years that John referred to has really put us in a strong position in new res. And we have every intention of aggressively pursuing share gains, especially during what we will consider to be pretty choppy waters ahead. We're going to continue to focus on growing our exclusive relationships. And I would expect that we're going to add to an already strong percentage of mutually beneficial exclusive relationship. For example, we look at our partnerships here pretty broadly and these builders that we're working with. It's really allowing us to collaborate in areas such as reducing complexity simplification and importantly, execution and utilizing our store platform, our technology, our supply chain and also importantly, our technical teams, we're really partnering to help these builders to respond to today's challenges and really helping them to reach their goals. So ultimately, reducing complexity may assist in their efforts to drive efficiency and productivity. And new products really play the key role in the help assist during some of these challenging times. For example, we're going to be introducing extreme build -- an extreme high build interior latex. And in a segment that's going to be under pressure, you may be asking yourself why we're bringing new products. But to be truthful, this is where we do help our customers win. This extreme high build lets the contractor build eight to 12 mils wet film thickness versus the more conventional four to six mils. So if you can imagine, just minimizing surface imperfections and excellent touch up, especially in an environment where labor is a challenge and an issue for these drywallers and painters. This product is helping to hide the spends of what I would call maybe less experienced drywallers and really improve the speed for painters. So essentially, everyone is winning here.  So you can kind of ask what to expect. John mentioned this earlier, the rate increases will pressure our builders, and we will grow share, but we were not going to be immune to the impact of these rates. We're going to respond to these changes. And I would expect that our builders will do the same. They may adjust floor plans. Many are looking at standardization, but no one will respond like Sherwin-Williams. We're going to take this expertise. We're going to aggressively go to builders that may have relationships with some of our competition. And we're going to demonstrate these capabilities in a way that will allow us to grow share. So while in the short term, we'll likely feel pressured. We like the favorable demographics. The existing housing shortage gives us a great deal of confidence that our strong and growing position in new res will benefit our shareholders.  So we look at the strong business through both a short and long-term lens. I would say in the short term, given our success and our position in the market, and we may over-index right now while we're working through some of the short-term choppiness. But in the long term, make no mistake, we do believe that this is in our best interest to continue to pursue these important gallons. John Morikis : I think maybe just one more point or two points maybe on new res, Chris, to Heidi's point, I think our relationships with the new residential contractors, they're reaching new highs. I mean we're collaborating and working together. She mentioned, one of the new products that we're introducing, I think there's a steady stream of introductions of not only products, but services and collaboration that we think really helps us help our customers. And the other point Heidi is really driving with her team, Justin Binns, our Group President of our TAG business is really taking this terrific work in products and services beyond the large national homebuilders and even driving that down further into the regional builders, where there is terrific opportunity for growth. And so while we expect there will be choppiness in the new residential, and I think it's important to say this beyond just new residential. We're not just reporting things are tough and low as us. So that's not who we are. We expect it's going to be tough, and we're going to come out fighting and swinging aggressively. And so yes, we do well with a lot of the large national homebuilders. We're going to be fighting like crazy after these regionals and other customers that we don't have.  We expect new residential if you look at some of the information that's out there to be down in the 20% to 30% range. That's not what we're expecting for our business. That's what we see in housing starts. So actually, what we're saying is that the homebuilders are posting some of them in the 20% to 30% range, we expect to outperform that and bring in a much better number than that. But we'll feel the pressure.  We get really quick to the res repaint side, and we won't go through each of the segments with such depth. But I do think that, Chris, your point is, your question is right on point, given the headlines, if you will, that these two segments will play for us this year. In residential repaint, we would say that while we continue to grow, and again, another area of focus over the 10 years, our compounded growth here has been 11% -- a little over 11.5%. We do expect to see some deceleration in the annual gains. If you look at the LIRA and the NAHB projections they are positive, but at a decelerated rate largely tied to existing home sales. But this is also an area where people continue to invest. Painting remains a relatively inexpensive investment but a very impactful project, that along with the aging housing stock and home price appreciation, we think will have a positive effect on this business. But Heidi, maybe you could talk a little bit about res repaint, and some of the work you and your team are driving there. Heidi Petz : Well, part of the fact that we've built really strong momentum here. I think this is certainly not by chance, but by design continuing to develop innovative products. John referenced some of the services, innovative solutions to differentiate ourselves and we couldn't do it without our incredible team. Our managers are reps, they play an extremely significant role in all segments, but I would argue in the res repaint segment, which really responds well to our high-touch personal service really can help to differentiate our model. We often talk about our secret weapon is our people. And I think clearly on display as we're helping our customers navigate through unprecedented challenges for them as well and challenges such as labor when res repaint, our full product line really allows contractors to step up in quality, helping to compensate for some less experienced applicators. And as we continue to see our customers do step up in quality, the results are clear that they are becoming more successful. And we're helping them prepare for some choppiness ahead, I would say, in addition to the whole product line, preparing for some new substrates. I'll give you an example here. In homes where our res painting, we're in the midst of rolling out a new kitchen cabinet refinish paint product.  So if you think of the homeowners that are affected by certainly higher costs and not willing to replace entire cabinet systems, but willing to refinish their existing cabinets, we're helping contractors to serve these clients with some profitable solutions. So amongst our new products, we're going to be introducing a self-cleaning Exterior Woods capes Stain as well for the exterior, which I just mentioned. So each and every rain will have a home looking freshly painted. So literally, the dirt will wash away with every rain, which is a pretty incredible technology, and we'll look like a newly painted home.  So our position in res repaint continues to improve. In fact, we continue to not only grow share but accelerate some of these share gains. So while the bid activity has adjusted, overall, it's still strong. Our average job size is increasing, and our focus continues to be and will be on new accounts and share of wallet. John Morikis : Just picking up the last point there is a good one. The quality of the leads in the bids, it seems like listening to a majority of our customers that while some of the bid activity may have tempered down a bit, the quality of the leads are actually increasing and the scope is actually increasing. So they're doing more there. And as she mentioned, we're trying to help them with projects like expanding into cabinets, introducing opportunities in garage floors and a lot of different areas. So even taking some of those new residential contractors that may have been primarily focused on new residential and helping them get into residential repaint. So we're really partnering very well with our customers to help drive their success and their profitability. So Chris, great question on those two segments. We think those are two really important segments for us going into 2023. Christopher Parkinson : John, given all that substance, I'll pass it on. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. Truman Patterson : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions, as always. So you're expecting raw materials to decline in the low to mid-single-digit range in '23. Is this based off of spot pricing for petrochems as you see it today? Does this incorporate expectation for some incremental deflation in spot prices as we move through the year? I'm just asking because the petrochem futures are kind of bouncing around right now. And I'm just trying to understand how you expect the spot market to play out and what's embedded in the guidance. John Morikis : Yes. Good morning, Truman, I'd begin by telling you that we called out here, we've seen a sequential decrease in our third quarter into our fourth quarter and we're expecting that trend to continue. In our first quarter, we're kind of expecting the basket to be flat to slightly up, and you'll see a bigger benefit as the year goes on.  To your point, key feedstock\u2019s like propylene, they have started to come down pretty meaningfully significantly. And eventually, it's going to find its way even more into the resins and the solvents that we buy. And that's starting to happen. We buy some of our raw materials on spot prices, so we can take advantage of that where it makes sense, and we have some on contract. I think what you also have to look at, though, is that as we look across the entire basket. Each commodity really has some dynamics associated with it. So while we're expecting down low singles to mid-singles for the basket, there's really a wide range across those different products that we buy. Some are better than that range and some are worse. And I think you're also seeing -- in addition to that, you're seeing input costs like energy and wages, which are very volatile. Those are also putting some pressure right now. So I think the takeaway would be you can expect us to continue working very closely with our suppliers to bring those costs in line with the industry demand levels, and that also reflects our position in the marketplace. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you. And then when you mentioned the lead demand indicators, could you just -- what are those? Could you run through some of those? And then you mentioned that you have a little bit less visibility into the back half of the year. I guess, how is today maybe a little bit different than prior periods outside of just general uncertainty in the economy? Jim Jaye : Well, I'll talk about the indicators that you mentioned, Truman. They're the ones that we've cited for many, many years on our Analyst Days and our calls. So you heard a couple of them here on the res repaint side, the Lyra Remodeling index, existing home sales on the new res obviously, it's permits and starts. Commercial, there's a couple of different ones. If you look on the industrial side, John, in his remarks cited the PMI numbers, which have not been trending very well at all. So it's those kind of external indicators married with obviously the real-time feedback we have from our customers and our -- it's one of the advantages of our direct distribution model. John Morikis : And on the second half, Truman, I would say that the view of the first quarter, first half versus the back half, I think it's -- you can attribute that to a very fluid and changing market. Interest rates are moving up. Housing starts are adjusting accordingly. Quite honestly, in times like this, the flux in the market, and this is my 38 years of experience talking here as well is that the contractors vary in their ability to anticipate what's happening. Some of them will look at their short-term book and believe that everything is okay. We're working with those contractors to help them understand some of the pressures that are coming down the pipe. So some of what we leverage our own controlled CRM that we have developed, the fact that we've got almost 5,000 store managers and nearly 4,000 sales reps that feed a great deal of our understanding of the market.  At this time, there's a little bit of a disconnect in that because some of our customers are feeling perhaps more bullish than we think that they should feel. Others are tied to other areas such as new residential, and they understand what the pipeline looks like. So when we talk about the visibility that we have in the first half, it's tied more towards the bids and contracts that our customers have in hand. It gives us more confidence. And that's why, as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we get through the first half, we'll reevaluate. I want to be very clear, we won't be adjusting our earnings forecast after the first quarter. We expect to have a very good first quarter, but we're going to wait and see as we get through the second quarter, what the balance of the year looks like. Once we have that better visibility, we'll speak to our investors as to what to expect going forward. But I would also add is, as we've come through COVID and some of the shortages that we've had in the market, we've become much closer with our customers. It was one of the benefits of the challenges that we've had. And so we believe we'll come out of this with a better line of sight as that relationship has improved dramatically, and it was already strong. But I think that as we get through the second quarter, we'll have a better line of sight. Truman Patterson : Alright. Thanks for taking my questions and good luck in the coming year. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is live. Ghansham Panjabi : Good morning. I guess on Performance Coatings Group, can you just give us a sense as to what you're embedding for volume expectations by the sub-segments, auto refinish all the way through? That would be super helpful. John Morikis : Well, on refinish, I'd say there's a high demand here, coupled with a shortage of body texts and parts contributed to shot backlogs. We're working through a backlog of demand ourselves as we're securing more and more raw materials. As you work through some of these challenges, Ghansham, as you know, when there's a shortage of raw materials, the bottleneck moves through the process. So as we do get, which is a team effort at Sherwin, we're squeezing more and more raw materials and availability, that's improving, and we're trying to get more and more of the product out as a result of that. But as you look at automotive refinish, we're really pleased with the gains that we're gaining -- that we've gained, and we expect that to continue. I'd say packaging had a terrific year. Year-to-date, we finished the year in the mid-teens. That was on top of a year last year in the high 20s. So tough comparisons.  We're gaining a lot of share here. We're investing in capacity as fast as we've added capacity and add capacity, it's sold out. So the faster we can get that capacity up and running, the business will grow at an even faster rate.  Our coil business. This is seven consecutive quarters of double-digit growth here. Insight here that you're asking for, I'd say our North America end markets seem to be softening a bit. APAC, soft demand. And real estate market is limiting our extrusion business there and EMEA some pretty substantial declines as major coders in EMEA have shut down lines as a result of the demand. Our general industrial business, another strong year. And again, here, there are terrific opportunities within these segments. The heavy equipment market is very strong, and we expect that to continue into 2023, particularly in the ag and construction. Appliance manufacturers are appearing to slow down production as inventories get reset. Transportation and building products, I would say, are slowly down a bit. The industrial wood -- our industrial wood business is one that is tied to housing in many ways. If you look at kitchen cabinets, flooring, furniture, as I mentioned, they had a tougher quarter and were down slightly for the year. We've been investing in this business because we believe in our strategy. We've made a couple of acquisitions and have been open with the investors I've met with to tell them exactly that when we see these opportunities. We're a 156-year-old company. We're investing in this accordingly. We're not trying to win a week or a month or a quarter. We're investing long term. That confidence in our teams in each one of these segments, terrific leadership at the group level, Karl Jorgenrud, and we've got a lot of confidence that this is going to be a key driver for our business coming out of the choppiness and that we'll grow share during these choppy times. So it's really what we expect in the market. And again, we don't report we influence. We're going to outperform the market in each of these segments, we believe. Ghansham Panjabi : Terrific. And then as it relates to TAG and kind of going back to your prepared comments and your characterization of the world we have today. I mean, obviously, interest rates having spiked over the last year having an impact on the housing ecosystem, including you. What would change the calculus of that? Is it just as simple as it reversible interest rates? And I'm just trying to reconcile the fact that interest rates have pulled back pretty substantially since October. John Morikis : Yes, it's a good question. I think you should expect us, first I want to be very clear, not waiting for the market to lift all the boats. I mean we're going to go really aggressively here, Ghansham, I would say that -- let me be careful in the words that I choose, but I would say I wouldn't want to compete with our team. These people are really well focused on the opportunities that we have. Yes, it will be impacted by housing starts, resale. We've got a terrific business in our property maintenance. We've always talked about kind of the table preparing from a strategic standpoint or which whatever way the table will tilt. And here in this environment, as the rates work their way through, if it's in residential repaint, you're going to see us outperform in residential repaint. If it's in property maintenance where people are going into multifamily homes as opposed to building homes, we're the leader there. And the same point on property maintenance as new res. We've done exceptionally well on a national standpoint. We're really cranking in after the regionals. This is the opportunity we have. We have competitors that are backing off because of some of the pressure in some of these segments. And we're going to go -- we're going to be aggressive. I'll just leave it there. We're going to be very aggressive in the regional pieces as well. Allen Mistysyn : Ghansham, this is Al Mistysyn. The only thing I would add to that, to your point, interest rates bounced around. And just like we talked about, as interest rates rose, it takes time to filter through the market and specifically into paint. So if you think about paint, we're always at the end of the project. So even if starts flip today, you're talking three to four months out, assuming no supply chain challenges before we get to our part of that project. And those are the things that we'll keep monitoring and pushing on with our teams to make sure we're gaining an outsized portion of the share as it returns. John Morikis : One additional point, I'll go back to Heidi's comment about our over-indexing a bit in new residential. We've done very well here. And so as those points that Al just made as housing starts begin, while there will be a lag, we'll see the benefit of that in a considerable way. And when it's down, we'll feel it perhaps a little bit more. Ghansham Panjabi : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. David Begleiter : Good morning. John, in TAG, are you thinking about additional price increases this year? John Morikis : Why don't I start with that and Al, if I miss anything jump in here? I'd say that David, our view as it relates to pricing is always looking at total cost of the basket, not just raw materials, but everything from labor, transportation, containers, everything that goes into that. And right now, I would say, we've not announced any additional pricing. I think we've demonstrated the ability, desire and conviction to stay on top of that and the willingness to do that. So if, in fact, we find ourselves in that situation where we need additional pricing the first people that we'll hear about it will be our customers, and then we'll quickly advise the street of our actions. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. David, the only thing I would add just to put some color around 2023 on pricing in general. We talked about on our third quarter call that we had no additional pricing, we'd expect a mid-single-digit impact on our full year '23. Obviously, that would be a little bit higher in our first quarter. Our expectation is we're going to maintain the majority of our price like we've seen in the past. We think we've gotten past the margin contraction portion of that cycle. We're starting to see margin improvement sequentially and year-over-year, and we expect that to continue going into 2023. David Begleiter : Very good. And Al, do you still expect production this year to be below volume sell-through? And so how much -- what's the dollar impact on earnings here? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. I don't know we're going to quantify the dollar impact. But because we had to build so much inventory in 2022 to get back to more historic levels, and we are going to see a negative impact. And you could think about, and I talked about this, we'd expect a 5% to 7% decline in production gallons specifically on architectural. We are definitely expecting to see that. And that will have a drag when we look at Consumer Brands Group because that's where our global supply chain is embedded. So you're not going to see as much margin dollar improvement just for that very fact all else being equal. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman. Your line is live. Adam Baumgarten : Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, you mentioned in the slides some inventory destocking in the North America retail channel it seems like. Are you seeing any destocking outside of that channel, perhaps maybe some of your OEM customers? John Morikis : No. Most of our OEM customers operate on a very low min/max level. So they're leaning on us to be responsive for them. So while some would have inventory, I'd say that they lean on us and we support that as a means of helping them to be successful. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. And the only thing I would add to that, on the retail channel side, I think coming out of the third quarter, you heard some of our peers talk about destocking. We did not see that. So we were probably a quarter later anticipated some of that. And as a result, you saw consumer do a little bit better in the fourth quarter than we had planned. Adam Baumgarten : Got it. That's helpful. And then just in the past, you've touched on some pretty positive trends in the Pros Who paint business. Maybe an update there that also seen a slowdown as you move through the fourth quarter and into this year. John Morikis : Well, it's an important -- very important initiative for us. That's in our Consumer Brands Group. For those of you that may not be familiar with it. Todd Rea, our President there, is working closely with our teams to really capture a terrific opportunity. If you think about what we call the Pros Who Paints, it's someone that might be involved in either house flipping or remodeling and while we're very focused on the painting contractor through our store, there are customers who enjoy the wide breadth of assortment and availability of products that they get through a different format like a home center.  We're really excited about getting after this market because they prefer that type of a setting and we've got great relationships with customers that are interested in that. So I would say that in Sherwin, we're not a complacent company. There's good momentum here. But along with our customers, we want to go faster. We think some in the market have been enjoying an unencumbered run at this business, and we enjoy disrupting that and helping our customers to be more successful and we're intent on doing that. Good momentum, a lot of opportunity ahead. Adam Baumgarten : Great. Thanks a lot. Good luck. Operator : Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is live. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. As you move the Latin American business over to consumer, can you help us understand what the associated margin uplift might be to consumer from that repositioning? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin, it's really not a material change when you restate all of the factor -- all the income statement, it might give it a little bit of a lift on the TAG side because, as you well know, Latin America has been dilutive of TAG. But on the consumer side, where we're at today, versus where Latin America is. And I'll give Latin America shout-out. They've done a lot of hard lifting and rightsizing their business and are now back to focusing on growth where before it was about cost management and that type of thing. So now that team is externally focused and really going after market share growth. So I don't think you're going to see a material change on either segment because of this. But I think from a strategic standpoint, a focus standpoint and where the market trends are, it's the right decision at this time. John Morikis : Yes. Kevin, I know you didn't ask specifically about -- I know you asked about the margin piece of it, but I do want to expand that to include it does have a positive impact on our TAG business. The focus on North America. We've got, as Al mentioned, a terrific leader, Alberto Benavidez down in Latin America that leads a wonderful team, and there's a shift in what's happening down there more towards what best aligns with our Consumer Brands Group. So it is a terrific opportunity from a best practice standpoint to align those two businesses. We think it's going to help our TAG business focus, and we do think that it will allow our businesses to share information. We'll take information out of Latin America that will bring up to North America and vice versa as well. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. Thank you for that. And then secondly, I wanted to ask for your updated thoughts on Al kid resins. It sounded like that was a meaningful constraint in the fourth quarter. Is there a way to size that? And is the availability beginning to improve yet as we talk today in the first quarter? Heidi Petz : Yes. Kevin, I would tell you that the availability, I'm not a surprise that alkyd resin does remain an industry-wide challenge. I give our technical teams and commercial teams a lot of credit for working through some very thoughtful and, in some cases, upgraded substitutions during this challenge. And we've really isolated this down a very few and are seeing sequential improvements already into our production. So I think you could expect over the next few quarters that we're going to be in a much, much better position. Allen Mistysyn : And the only thing I'd add to that is, we haven't called it out. It's -- so it's not material to the consolidated results. And as you know, it's split kind of between consumer products, it's split in industrial within each of those segments, it's not material. So that's why we haven't called it out. John Morikis : Yes, just sensitive to those that are affected by it, it's very material. If you think of our sales teams or our customers. Al was exactly right on a consolidated basis. But there have been many of our people that have been forced to work through some pretty challenging times and customers that have been working with us on that. So the materiality on a consolidated basis may not be as impactful as what it is to some of those that are truly impacted by it. Kevin McCarthy : Appreciate the perspective. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is live. JeffZekauskas: Thanks very much. I was looking at your midrange assumptions on Slide 8. And in it, you assume that prices are, call it, up 5%, which is about $1.1 billion. And if volumes are down 5% maybe the detriment is 550. And SG&A, up mid-single digits is about 300, FX is maybe another 100, but that would be offset by a raw material decrease of 4%. So with these assumptions, why shouldn't your EBITDA be up $400 million rather than down $150 million at the midpoint. What is it in here that's really pulling the returns down if prices are really going to be up5%? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Jeff, I think what -- we went round and round in this about mid-single-digit range because you're talking at a mid-single-digit range. You've got a pretty wide margin. So I would say -- at the midpoint, we're thinking maybe a little bit lighter on the price impact and a little heavier than what you mentioned on the demand side and the volume side. So I think there's nuance in that, and this is why, to be honest with you, I struggled with laying this out that way because you can interpret it just as you have, if you go to the high end of each of those that are positive and the low end of each of those that are negative, I can get a significantly different results. So to clarify, that's why I'm saying, in the range in the midpoint, we do expect EBITDA margin expansion and EBITDA growth, it's just not going to be as significant as you're talking about. Jeff Zekauskas : And then for a follow-up, I think you had aspired to a 45% gross margin in the fourth quarter. And maybe you came in closer to 43%. Was it that volumes weren't as strong as you expected? Or was there a different factor? Allen Mistysyn : No, I think you're exactly right. And you're dead on, excluding onetime and items and acquisitions, we're probably 43.1%. And it's really by the missing tag. It's our highest margin business. It came in below the bottom end of our range. And as John talked about, some of the other segments, PNM, DIY were double digit but below our range. And we also I hate to throw a weather out there, but the last -- that snowstorm around Christmas really felt like a lot of people took the whole rest of the year off. Now that being said, we are seeing those sales back in our first quarter in January and our first quarter -- start to the first quarter is where our outlook is current... John Morikis : Yes, the last couple of weeks, it really dampened down and contractors pretty much checked out throughout that. And to Al's point, as January started, you see them back in the store activities right back where we expected it to be. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Michael Sison : Yes. Just one quick question. When you look at the midpoint of your guidance, I think you all said that the first half will be better than second half. So any help in terms of -- is volumes kind of flattish in the first half or down a lot more in the second half? And how does that sort of split up in terms of the 8.30. How much more front-end loaded is it than the second half? Thank you. John Morikis : Yes, Jeff -- Mike, I would say from a volume standpoint, we're expecting and I'll start with architectural volume. We're expecting architectural volume and TAG specifically to be up low single digits in the first half and then moderate certainly in the back half. Because when we think about the cadence of new residential and how I have it built into our plan, we'd start seeing a material slowdown as you get midway through the second quarter. That would accelerate into our third quarter. And then even if it's a shallow slowdown and it starts coming back, like I talked earlier, starts start coming back. We're not going to see the impact of that until three or four months out. So that's why it's a bigger negative impact on our fourth -- our second half than our first half. And as we've talked about, as volume goes, our operating margin and operating leverage is driven mostly by that. We expect to see more price in our first half than our second half as we annualize the price increases throughout the year, we'll see those moderate. And then we also expect to see more of the acquisitions in performance coatings in our first half and the sales and EBITDA incremental improvements there. And then as the July 1 acquisitions annualized, that will be more muted. And then a little bit offset by the way raw materials rolled out. Jim talked about the 4%, low to mid-single-digit benefit it's a little heavier on our back half than our front half just because even the first quarter, we might be flat or up or down slightly. Michael Sison : Okay. And any help on the EPS cadence or... John Morikis : Well, going back to the volume as the first half volume is there, it will flow through. Michael Sison : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. If I could just ask, if you think about the 2 halves of the year, and it's well understood that you've got some visibility in 1 half and you don't in the back half. And it's also well understood now what the key macro drivers are and so forth. If you think about the back half of the year and the back half of the year winds up coming in worse than you anticipated in the different segments. What do you think the key risks are in those segments that we really need to be watchful of to sort of be on guard in case that back half wounds up actually being worse than what you anticipated to be? Allen Mistysyn : I think, Vincent, the thing that -- I would say it this way, the thing that we're watching specifically is within TAG and within new residential -- and the -- it's not an exact science when you look at the timing of a potential slowdown as John talked about, and the macro headlines of single-family starts slowing.  You see some of the national homebuilders talking about the lower orders, but it's really as the homes get to completion is what impacts our sales the most and there's variability in that. So as we continue to work with our national homebuilders and get a clean line of sight of that and the impact that not only has on our new residential and TAG, but also kitchen cabinets, flooring and furniture on our Performance Coatings businesses, that's going to be the main driver of whether the second half is stronger or less strong than what our current outlook is. Vincent Andrews : And can I just ask 1 quick follow-up would be in Consumer Brands and in Performance Coatings. In Consumer Brands, are there any shelf space issues that we should know about? And likewise, are there any share gains or losses in Performance Coatings? Allen Mistysyn : I think there's no impact on the shelf impact shelf restriction on consumer, but I think there's a huge amount of market share gain opportunities within our industrial businesses, and that's all of them. As John talked about, we do not have 100% market share in any of our businesses, segments or regions and that's the way we're going into 2023. We're marching aggressively. So there are terrific opportunities that we're going to be pursuing. And we often talk about the coiled spring as this business comes back and we grow share, grow customers and it returns, it's going to spring. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Best of luck. Operator : Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live. Arun Viswanathan : There's been a lot of discussion here on the new housing market. Obviously, we've seen a slowdown there. We did see that permits are also down 40% year-on-year. I guess my question is there has been a greater correlation though with architectural gallons sold in existing home sales. And there's probably a lag between starts in existing home sales as well. So could you comment on what's your outlook for existing home sales and how that ties into your guidance? Do you see any risk that maybe the low end is not low enough if the existing market gets worse from here? Thanks. Jim Jaye : Arun, on the existing home sales, I'd remind you that drives a portion of our res repaint, but there's other factors as well that drive that repaint business. And I think, as John said, in his comments, that's an area we've been investing in more stores, more reps to go after res repaint. So I mean if you look at existing home sales, they've been down for 16 straight months but you've got other things that might offset that home price appreciation is still up year-over-year. You got the aging housing stock. You've got the baby boomers aging in place, all these things we've often spoken of. So while that will be a headwind, there's other things that will help drive that repaint. And along with the share gains that John is talking about, we think got a good outlook and high expectations for res repaint next year. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Ron, the only thing I would add to that is, as you know, res repaint is our fastest-growing segment. It's our largest segment, and it's our largest opportunity for market share growth. And I think that's what the focus of our TAG team is on with the specific investments in dedicated new res repaint stores and dedicated res repaint reps. John Morikis : As part of what gives us the confidence as we compare this to the last slowdown, we came out of the last slowdown determined to grow that residential repaint business to help offset, we call it almost a resilient segment, having the growth that we have had and we continue to invest. I think I don't know what the number is out. What the number of stores that we have now versus the last slowdown were up, how many? Allen Mistysyn : A little over 1,200 stores since 2010. John Morikis : 1,200 more stores now versus the last slowdown, probably a near similar number of reps focused on this area. And so it shouldn't be a surprise that we're growing the last 10 years over 11.5% and the conviction and determination that we have, I think, is an all-time high. And we expect, as we work through this challenging times to grow more share that we'll enjoy as the business -- through this as well as when the business comes back. Heidi Petz : So I would add to that, too, I think over the last 10 years. I think while the marketing dynamics certainly are similar to back 2008, 2009, I would say it's almost even better now. There's so much change in the market. I think as you mentioned, our incremental store count, we've been aggressively adding stores. Our competition, I would say, has been aggressively closing down stores. So with these changes, there's been some confusion in the marketplace that we believe is our opportunity. So we're adding a new store about on average every four days. And I think we'd all agree we're confident in our long-term strategy, but our near-term ability to execute. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Thanks. And just another follow-up, I guess, was given that a lot of your growth, you're investing is mainly on the organic side. Are there inorganic opportunities as well that may present themselves in a downturn like this? What are some of the areas within the portfolio that you'd need to buttress if at all? I know you made the bolt-ons in some of the raw material and technology areas, but anything would it be more like in those areas? Or is it industrial? Or what are you looking at for potential M&A? John Morikis : Well, we've been investing in a number of transactions that we think are terrific. We've been investing primarily on our Performance Coatings side. We've invested in industrial businesses, general industrial in Germany, industrial wood business in Italy. We've got a number of flooring businesses that we've welcomed into the family. And our goal here is not -- we're not portfolio managers. We don't bring them in and run independent businesses. These are going to be contributors on a much brand or scale to the overall business.  So technology that we acquire in some part of the world we're immediately looking at how we leverage that across the entire platform. So as you're watching and absorbing the acquisitions that we're making, I hope everyone understands, we're really not interested in buying small positions in different parts of the world. We're making these acquisitions, and we'll leverage them across the entire platform around the world. So these have been good investments, we think, and there's still a considerable amount of opportunity ahead to better leverage them going forward. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO Capital. Your line is live. John McNulty : Just one kind of cleanup question on pricing. So in the deck that you showed on Slide 8 where it showed consolidated pricing carryover and there was a range, low single digits to mid-single digits. I guess what drives the range there? Because it sounds like it's just a carryover from kind of where you ended 4Q. So I guess what would make it go to the low end versus the mid-single-digit side? I guess, how should we think about that? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, John, I think it's somewhat similar, I would think, as when we talk about a range on raw material costs, there's a lot of different market dynamics from demand and other things that might cause that range to move. The point I would [Technical Difficulty] TAG 5 different price increases over two years. We fully expect to maintain the majority of that price. So even a slight decrease, increase or movement within that range doesn't impact the overall fact that we're going to maintain the majority of that price as we've done in similar environments in the past, and I think that's similar across the industrial businesses and consumer because we are looking at the total input cost basket that's affecting what price increases we've gone out with and what continued investments we've been able to make as we bring our gross margin back towards that long-term rate of 45% to 48%. So just to be clear, we kept investing when we're taking margin contraction through the cycle and now that margins start improving again. We can continue those investments to drive growth, both through our retail partners, through our own stores and help our industrial partners drive growth as well. Heidi Petz : Yes. I'd add to pricing isn't just a quick 30-minute discussion with our customers. It's the result of adding value everyday that's allowing us to be effective with them. So when you think of the value that we're bringing. It goes well beyond the product, but you talked earlier about services, project health, digital convenience. So we're really confident we're going to be able to hold on to this. We're not just talking about price of kind of a stand-alone discussion, so confident we're going to be able to hold on to that. John McNulty : Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up. So your stores tend to have a higher service component to it than maybe some of the competitors out there, and that's helped you on the share front. But I guess our concern would be with labor inflation as big as it is and labor being a bigger component of your cost, I guess do you have enough levers that you can pull to offset that beyond price because your competitors may not actually have to raise price as much to deal with kind of wage inflation. So I guess, how should we think about that? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, John, it's about driving higher quality products that make our companion contractors more efficient, allows them to get more jobs done with the same number of painters and it drives their bottom line. And I think when you look at it in an inflationary environment, and we've talked about this in the past, you tend to see more -- and I'll use as res repainters move up to a higher quality product because they're going to pay more for that gallon of paint. The gallon of paint is small relative proportion to the overall cost of a project. So as we get those higher quality products in their hands and show the efficiencies they can get, it drives higher -- as you imagine, higher quality products, higher margins. And that's how our strategy is when we innovate new products, and I've said this many times before, you always innovate the high end of the good, better, best continuum and over time, that good gets replaced. So I think that's a big lever for us and a big driver of how we can continue to expand our margins. John McNulty : Got it. Thanks so much for the color. Operator : Your next question is coming from John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Your line is live. John Roberts : Great. Thank you. the DIY paint historically is not price elastic, but do you think that some of the demand weakness here is that prices just got too high? John Morikis : Well, I'd say that our residential repaint business is strong, and it's as even more in times to have a contractor apply to paint, John. John Roberts : I was asking DIY consumer, sorry. John Morikis : I know I understand that, but I'm saying that in the market, we are having customers that are continuing to invest in their homes as prices have gone up and in the breadth of product that we offer, while there's a wide platform of price points, we continue, as I mentioned, to see stickiness in the higher quality products.  So I don't know that it's -- we've reached a point of demand destruction. If that's your question. I think the consumers are very well aware of inflation in the market, and I think that they're making decisions right now. No question that building up your tank has been more expensive than it has been in the past. But I'll go back to the point that we made earlier, which is that it's a -- amongst all the opportunities to influence the environment, which is most important to most of us, where you live, relative -- still a relatively inexpensive but highly impactful investment in your home. Allen Mistysyn : John, the only thing I would add to that is -- and we saw this in our second quarter, and I think it segment our DIY customers between what we see in the retail channels versus what we see in our stores, certainly, with the inflation of energy and food, and we saw a bigger impact on demand in our retail channel versus our stores channel. So there may be that nuance that you're seeing. Heidi Petz : One piece I would add to that, too, in terms of just elasticity, I think there's also the dynamic with the consumer DIY segment to Al's point, where they're purchasing less frequency, you're going to have some that are more value conscious. But we have introduced and innovated so many different products that have brought trading up to be more attractive, whether it's [indiscernible] increased durability. And so that consumer that's paying every five to seven years has demonstrated a willingness to pay for that as well. John Roberts : Okay. And then, Heidi, I think you mentioned that coil was one of the stronger end markets. Isn't that appliances and sheet metal for construction? What's going on there that, that outperformed? John Morikis : John, you might have misunderstood my voice versus Heidi so it was my voice that talked to coil. We have a nice business in our coil business that is impacted by our appliance business. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we do see some settling, if you will, in the appliance business as there's kind of a reset to inventory level. So it has impacted our coil business. Operator : Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is live. Josh Spector : A question on the China and the aerosol restructuring. I guess it's a pretty significant amount of sales you maybe walking away from or rationalizing. I guess, are we past the point of having any ability to monetize that? Allen Mistysyn : I'm sorry, Josh, when you say we past the point of ability to monetize it. No. I think we have consistently taken a review of our portfolio of businesses, brands, customer programs. And I think we look at it both midterm on their ability to get significant market share growth and return on sales and cash flow. But we also take a longer-term view of it to say, if there are opportunities to monetize the business. We'll work to reorg to get it in position and pursue that option, among other options. You can run it for cash, you can run it as a growth business or you can monetize it like you're talking about. So each of those options are being evaluated and we'll update the Street as we get to that. The short-term reality though is that market, in particular, China, architectural is under heavy pressure, and we have to and we did take appropriate significant actions to adjust to that market conditions. Josh Spector : Okay. Appreciate that. If I could ask 1 just to follow up on Res. I mean it's obviously down low to mid-single, put a small dent in the 30% plus you guys have absorbed in terms of increases. I guess is this where raw materials stabilize in your view? And I guess if you have a weaker view on volume in the second half, do you have any visibility to either longer-term contracts or anything else becoming a relief point for raw materials into the next year? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Josh, I think you hit it, I mean, if demand continues to deteriorate, we would -- or more so than what we expect in the back half, you'd expect raw material costs to drop with that. And there's not long-term contracts or agreements that lock us into to not participate in those kinds of actions. John Morikis : These principles of supply demand we've dealt with for decades. Operator : Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. GregMelich: Thanks. Two questions. One, thanks for the helpful CAGRs on new resi versus resi repaint. Could you remind us as to how much bigger the resi repaint businesses compared to new residential? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. It's -- Greg, it's today, 2:1 res repaint versus new residential. Back -- prior to '08 and '09, it was 1 :1. So John talked about the tremendous low double-digit growth in both segments since 2010. It's just the new res repaint was starting from a higher base. Greg Melich : So repaint is 2x new res today? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Greg Melich : Perfect. And then the second is more about understanding the gross margin progression. It sounds like 45% to 48% is still the right goal. I think, John, you talked about getting that in a couple of years in a normalized environment. So I guess my question is, if volume this year ended up being flat or slightly up as opposed to down, would we be back in that 45% to 48% range this year? Or is there something else going on that is impacting being on... John Morikis : No, I think that's a fair -- that's directionally fair. I think if the volume is better. And in particular, the volume is better in TAG because it's our highest gross margin segment. And yes, with the pricing that we would maintain the majority of monitoring raw materials, the continuous improvement mindset that we have across our manufacturing and distribution facilities all play into driving that margin to that 45% to 48%. But to your point, Greg, it's always about volume, and it's about volume through TAG that's going to help lift that gross margin. Greg Melich : Fair enough. Would it be fair to use the fourth quarter as a proxy to get an idea of that operating leverage? In other words, it looks like volume was maybe 300 or 400 bps lower than you thought it was going to be and gross margin end up being 200 basis points lower? Or am I thinking about that the wrong way? Allen Mistysyn : No, I think you're I would say, you're directionally accurate here. Greg Melich : Yes, good luck and thanks for all the info. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is live. Steve Byrne : Just following up on the comment, John, you made earlier about your home center partners or you're helping them as they requested for the Pros Who Paint. And I was just curious whether any of your home center partners within consumer are trying to do what you can do through your stores, like delivery of large volumes to the job sites on a digital access. Are you seeing any of them do that? And does that have any impact on your stores in the area? John Morikis : Yes, Steve, I want to be really clear here that we're supporting our customers and their efforts to apply and execute on the strategies that will help them grow in this business. I think what you're trying to get after is cannibalization between the home centers and our stores. And we've looked at this in great depth. There would be very little -- there might be a few accounts here. They are a small amount. But we would gladly put those on the table to expand into a virtually untapped market for us. And the painter that's in our stores every day has expectations that are likely best filled through a specialty paint store. Some of them find their way into home centers, and we want to support those that find their way in there. But I would say that the target here and the higher level of success is going to be attracting those customers into the home centers that prefer the home center experience, largely because of the breadth of the product lines. And so we're not bashful about it. There'll be a little bit of cannibalization, very little compared to the opportunity that collectively we can pursue with our partners. Steve Byrne : Okay. And I wanted to ask you how much visibility do you have to the backlog that your contractors have? And do you have a view on how much do they have, whether it's residential repaint versus commercial and property management? Are those meaningfully different right now? And was there a big change recently. We had some dialogue with some contractors where there was a significant change like in the last month. John Morikis : Yes, there's been some change. I referenced that earlier that the pipeline of bidding has tempered down a bit. The quality of those bids seems to be improving and the scope of the projects continue to actually grow. I'd also say -- so the answer is yes. We do work closely with our customers. And as I mentioned previously, we I think are working much closer with them than ever in my career, partially because of the experience that we've had over the last couple of years. And so I'd say there's a wide spectrum. If you look at the one end, the commercial painting contractor and the industrial painting contractor, they generally have a longer view of what's happening because of the scope of the project. On the commercial side, something might be coming out of the ground and that project may be in a couple of years in the making. Industrial side, when they're talking about the protection of assets, there's usually a plan that they're following. That would be on the far right side. And on the other side, a shorter line of sight would be the residential repaint side. And in between would be property maintenance and new residential where there are varying lengths of view, if you will. So we work with our customers, all of them to have a good understanding. There has been some shift that's reflected in our guidance that we've given. But again, I want to reiterate, I want to -- this is really important. I apologize for repeating it so often here. We're not sitting here on our back saying well bad things are happening to us. We're aggressively pursuing any one of these segments we can talk to, what we think the market is going to perform it and how much better we expect to perform in that market. So whilst even some of the bidding that might have tempered down, again, we're not sitting here with 100% market share. We're aggressively pursuing and we expect our competitors as they pull back, we're going to take advantage of those opportunities as well as the new products. You mentioned a couple of those, the services, the new stores, we're going to be very aggressive during these times. And we expect as we go through this, to grow share. And as we come out of it, that coil spring is going to pop. Heidi Petz : The other thing I would add is, I think everything that John just covered across segments, I would say that in general, our customers like we have become better planners. And together, we are creating not just that stickiness we always talk about, but becoming better business partners and business planners together. Steve Byrne : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Your line is live. Garik Shmois : Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on the SG&A guidance range? And what are some of the factors that you're going to be looking at when you decide to pull the trigger on some of the growth initiatives versus pulling back some. Is just a function of how demand is tracking this year? And maybe when do you have to make that decision, just given the range is down low single digits to anywhere to up mid-single digits through the year? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Garik, I think we look at it as we progress through the first half and get a better outlook coming into the second half. I would tell you that from a G&A standpoint, we are going to maintain our G&A tightly through the first half. I think you're going to see us -- I'll use the term pedaling clutch like one of our predecessors here have used where we'll spend merchandising, advertising, things of that nature that are not committed and their they are discretionary. We'll manage those to how demand outlook we feel like.  And it's on the long-term growth investments that you can expect us to continue to push those through stores, reps. We just talked about the Pros Who Paint because we have confidence and we have a lot of strong outlooks for the long term when it comes to architectural demand. We talked about packaging, we talked about any number of market share opportunities we have across all our businesses.  So the confidence we have in the long-term outlook makes you say that we're going to continue to invest in these long-term growth opportunities. These other noncustomer-facing type of spending, we're going to maintain very closely. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thanks. Follow-up question is just on the pace of new store openings for '23. Just given that it picked up quite a bit in the fourth quarter, should we expect it to revert to maybe kind of a more linear pacing or any color on how that looks? John Morikis : Garik, we've been trying to spread those out more evenly for 38 years that I've been with the company. For a lot of reasons that they get back loaded as the year unfolds. We've got a good line of sight on the number and locations. But I would say they're likely going to be -- I hope not as backloaded as last year, but they're going to lean in the back half of the year again in 2023. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thanks. And best of luck. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Jim Jaye : Thank you, and thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. As we went through our comments, I believe you heard that we're very confident in our strategy going forward. I'm very confident in our people. It's a very deep and experienced team. But at the same time, given what we see today, our outlook, I think, is a very realistic one starting off this year. Even in that outlook, we're going to continue to gain share. We're going to continue investing in the business to grow. You heard Al say we're going to control the G&A very tightly. And I think John said it multiple times that we really expect to outperform the market just as we have in the past. So thank you for joining us today. As always, I'll be available along with Eric Swanson for follow-up calls. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company's Review of First Quarter 2023 Results and our Outlook for the Second Quarter and Full Year of 2023.  With us on today's call are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; Al Mistysyn, CFO; Heidi Petz, President and COO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Finance; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. James Jaye : Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered excellent first quarter results compared to the same period a year ago. Consolidated net sales grew by a high single-digit percentage, ahead of our expectations and were led by a mid-teens percentage increase in our professional architectural end markets. On the Industrial side of the business, sales increased in all regions except Asia Pacific. Gross margin significantly improved sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strong volume in the Paint Stores Group and effective pricing. Cost of goods sold includes higher inflation in wages and other employee-related categories, which were partially offset by a slight decrease in year-over-year raw material costs. We expect to hold the majority of the pricing we have put into the market, given the ongoing investments we have made to drive innovation, enhance services and secure the talent that provides differentiated solutions to help our customers reach their goals and drive their success. Segment margin in all three reportable segments expanded sequentially and year-over-year. We also delivered strong double-digit growth in diluted net income per share and EBITDA. Additionally, we continue to execute on the portfolio realignment actions we announced late last year, including the divestiture of a noncore aerosol business, which closed on April 1, and our recently announced agreement to divest our China architectural business. I'd like to highlight just a few of our consolidated first quarter numbers. Comparisons in my comments are to the prior year period unless stated otherwise.  Starting with the top line. First quarter 2023 consolidated net sales increased 8.9% to $5.44 billion. Consolidated gross margin increased to 44.5%, an improvement of 340 basis points. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 31.1%, an increase of 140 basis points, driven by investments in the Paint Stores Group's long-term growth initiatives and investments in our people across the company through year-over-year increases in compensation and other employee-related benefits. Our people remain our key differentiator in the marketplace.  Consolidated profit before tax increased $153.7 million or 33.3%. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $1.84 per share versus $1.41 per share a year ago. Excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense and costs related to previously announced restructuring actions, first quarter adjusted diluted net income per share increased 26.7% to $2.04 per share versus $1.61 per share a year ago. EBITDA in the quarter increased $185 million or 26.7% and was 16.1% as a percent of sales.  Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our first quarter results by segment. John will follow Heidi with comments on our outlook before we move on to your questions. Heidi Petz : Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, previously known as The Americas Group. We described this change on our last call and in this morning's press release. There is no impact to prior year consolidated results related to this change. Current and prior year segment results have been restated to reflect this change. First quarter Paint Stores Group sales were ahead of our expectations and increased 14.8%, driven by high single-digit volume growth and continued effective pricing. Segment profit increased by $97.9 million and segment margin improved 120 basis points to 18.4%. Our Pro architectural sales grew by a mid-teens percentage in the quarter. All Pro market segments increased by double digits, led by property management and followed by commercial, residential repaint and new residential, respectively. Sales in protective & marine and DIY also increased by double-digit percentages. From a product perspective, interior and exterior paint sales were both strong, with interior sales growing faster and representing a larger part of the mix. Moving on to results in our Consumer Brands Group, which again now reflects the addition of a Latin America architectural business in the current quarter and prior year. Sales were well ahead of our guidance and increased by 2.4% in the quarter. Performance was better than expected in North America, where sales were down less than 1%; and in Europe, where sales were down low single digits. In other regions, sales were up strong double digits in Latin America and down double digits in Asia. Effective pricing led by Latin America was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in volume and low single-digit FX headwinds. The tightness in alkyd resins impacting our ability to produce stains and aerosols, improved significantly during the quarter, and we expect this issue to be behind us by the end of the second quarter. Adjusted segment margin was 13%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, we divested a noncore aerosol business at the beginning of this month, and we also entered into an agreement to divest our China architectural business. We expect these actions will benefit segment margin over time as we drive a return to our high teens, low 20s adjusted margin target. Onetime restructuring costs in the quarter were immaterial. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 3.4% against a 20.4% comparison. The increase was driven by low teens pricing and mid-single-digit sales from acquisitions, partially offset by a low teens decrease in volume, which included the impact from discontinued operations in Russia and a low single-digit unfavorable FX impact. Adjusted segment margin increased 390 basis points to 15.7% of sales. This is the fourth straight quarter this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement, driven by execution of our strategy, including effective pricing.  Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased high single digits against a nearly 30% comp. Latin America sales increased by double digits, also against a strong comp. Sales in Europe were up mid-single digits, while sales in Asia were down double digits. From a division perspective, growth was strongest in Auto Refinish, which was up by a mid-teens percentage, followed by Coil and General Industrial, which were both up mid-single digits. All three of these divisions grew against double-digit comparisons. Industrial Wood sales were down mid-single digits as expected due to slowing in furniture, cabinetry and flooring related to new residential softness. Packaging sales also were down mid-single digits against a 30-plus comp with volume down about 1 point in the remainder due to our exit of Russia and unfavorable FX. We continue to feel very good about our position and growth prospects in this end market.  With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. John Morikis : Thank you, Heidi. I want to thank our teams for working hard to deliver a strong start to the year, especially the margin recovery we are seeing following the relentless cost inflation we've experienced the last two years. As we said in January, we expected to have a strong first quarter, and that's exactly what our team delivered. We also indicated that we would not be updating guidance after the first quarter. We know we have work to do, and we're under no illusions about the macro headwinds we're likely to face as the year progresses. We'll have a much better idea of how the year might unfold as we get deeper into the painting season over the next few months. As we enter the second quarter, we'll remain focused on what we can control. This includes leveraging our recession-resilient markets, growing new accounts and share of wallet, continuing appropriate growth investments in stores and sales representatives and managing price cost dynamics. We remain confident in our differentiated strategy, capabilities and product and service solutions, and we continue to expect to outperform the market. For the second quarter of 2023, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will be up or down by a low single-digit percentage compared to the second quarter of 2022, inclusive of a high single-digit price increase. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be flat to down mid-single digits, inclusive of a mid-single-digit price carryover from 2022. Our sales expectations by segment for the second quarter and the full year are included in our slide deck and reflect the move of the Latin American architectural business from Paint Stores Group to Consumer Brands Group. There is no impact on our sales guidance in the quarter or the year from the divestiture of the China architectural business at this time as the transaction has not yet closed. On the cost side, there is no change in our raw material outlook where we continue to expect costs to be down by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect to see the largest benefit occurring in the second and third quarters. We expect to see decreases across many commodity categories, though the ranges likely will vary widely. We expect other costs, including wages and energy, to be up in the mid- to high single-digit range. The first quarter is typically our smallest, and we need to see second quarter trends and performance to better understand potential impacts on our second half outlook. We expect to provide an update on our full year sales and EPS guidance following our second quarter. As a result, there is no change at this time to our guidance for full year 2023 diluted net income per share, which we expect to be in the range of $6.79 to $7.59 per share. Full year 2023 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.81 per share and includes expense related to our previously announced targeted restructuring actions of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $7.95 to $8.65.  We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. There are also no updates to the additional data points and capital allocation priorities we provided on our January call. I'll also refer you to the slide deck issued with our press release this morning, which provides guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. All of these remain unchanged from our January call as well. Given the many variables at play, limited visibility beyond the first half, and the high level of uncertainty in the global economy, we continue to believe our current outlook is a realistic one. As we get through our second quarter and we see more information, the assumption we laid out in January could change. If those assumptions change for the better, we would expect to deliver stronger results. We've transformed our business in many ways since the last significant downturn, and we're now a stronger and a more resilient company. I'm highly confident in our leadership team, which is deep and experienced and has been through many previous business cycles. We anticipate that 2023 would be challenging. We planned accordingly. We have and will continue taking appropriate actions. We expect strong momentum coming out of this period of uncertainty, similar to prior downturns. That momentum will stem from our strategy of providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and more profitable. In challenging environments, like the current one, we can become an even more valuable partner to our customers, while we're also earning new ones. The bottom line is we expect to outperform the market and our competitors in 2023 and for years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks.  With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Could I ask in TAG in the quarter, just was looking at the incremental margins, obviously, you had a very strong sales performance. And I know there was about 5% carryover pricing in there. So it seems like the volume was quite strong. So was there just a lot of investment spend in the quarter ahead of store openings or just some of your initiatives and that if you could sort of bridge as to what the underlying total company SG&A expense was in the quarter and whether that is a good number to run with as we move through the balance of the year? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. And let me start with consolidated SG&A was up 14%. Paint Stores Group was just over 2/3 of that increase, and excluding acquisitions, was approximately 80% of the increase year-over-year. And this is due to the increase in new stores and additional sales reps, which probably represented about 2/3 of the increase. And then in addition, employee-related costs were higher year-over-year due to multiple merit increases beginning in the second half of last year and into the first quarter of this year. John Morikis : Yes. Let me just jump in here before you carry on there on the investments of our employees, I think it's absolutely critical to understand in a controlled distribution model, particularly, we see the value of the retention of our employees as a key element of our strategy. We want to build relationships with our customers. We want to make sure we have the right talent that they're trained, that they're developed and that we retain them. And so the investments that we've made beginning actually about midyear last year, we are clearly seeing the benefits of that. Now there's some benefit in the market as the economy has taken its course. And clearly, that's had an impact on some employees and employers. But our relationship with our customers -- our employees has improved dramatically. And I would point to our retention. We've often boasted about our turnover rate down in the 7% to 9% range. And we're proud to say that we're back in that range of employee turnover. So our retention is back to a historic low. We think that's an important element and an important investment that we make because we want to make sure that those employees are there when our customers are walking into our stores. So let me turn that back over to you. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. The only thing I'd add to that is, Vincent, as we discussed in January, we're going to continue to manage our G&A expenses tightly and adjust other discretionary marketing and other spending as we get a better outlook on demand in the second half. I would say I would expect a smaller year-over-year increase in our second quarter as we annualize the merit increase from last year. We start realizing more cost reductions from the restructuring activities. . Typically, we see a slight uptick in SG&A in our Paint Stores Group as it ramps up staffing and service to increase seasonal architectural demand uptick. Acquisitions will be slightly less than what we saw in our first quarter, which is a low single-digit impact. And then we'd expect those to annualize and not see much in our second half. So as the year goes on, my second quarter, I'd expect a lower percent of sales because of the seasonally higher architectural sales, but then the year-over-year change gets tighter as the year goes on as we annualize some of these things. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : The SG&A increase of 14%, I understand that it should moderate from that level. But this year, with everything you're considering, are we going to be up more than 10% as a base case year-over-year? Allen Mistysyn : No, Jeff, I'd expect -- if you look at how Paint Stores Group, in particular, SG&A rolled out as the year went on last year, it ramps up as we get into our second half because we added more stores, but the merit increases happen in our second half. So the comp gets higher, so the percent change gets lower as we go through the year. I would say the other groups have done a really nice job of managing their SG&A. Consumer, Paints, PCG would have a similar impact with the merit increases, but they've been managing their SG&A very tightly. And then in admin, we'll continue to invest in system upgrades and things like that, but we're going to manage it tightly. So I would not expect that high of a percentage increase for the year. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay. And then secondly, your new residential business seems to have held up reasonably well, given market conditions. When we get to the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year, as a base case, what do you think those volumes are like year-over-year in new residential in the Paint Stores Group? John Morikis : So Jeff, we've said that the single-family housing starts are expected to be down year-over-year in the range of 20% to 35%. And our expectation would be that in our business, we'd be better than the market. So our expectations would be that it would be down in the 10% to 20% range. And we've also talked openly about the fact that we expect some of our more recession-resilient segments to pull heavier during that period of time. So as we saw the quarter unfold, we saw exactly the sequential trend that we -- that you just described. So year-over-year, January, we saw high teens percentage increase; in February, low double-digit increase; and then mid-single digits in March. So we expect that type of a trend to continue through the balance of the year. If you look back 90 days, 120 days and you see the number of starts in comparison to previous quarters, you can see the downturn and then the impact on our new res sales as it unfolds. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Christopher Parkinson at Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : John, can you sit on a little bit more on what you're hearing from your customers and contractors in terms of backlog, specifically in the resi repaint market, property maintenance and then perhaps just hit a little bit on what you're seeing in protective? It would be greatly appreciated. John Morikis : Yes, Chris, I'd start with the fact that our Paint Stores Group is our largest business, as you know. It's a $12 billion portion of the company. 90% of our Paint Stores Group is made up of professional sales. And as Heidi mentioned, PRO sales in total grew by a mid-teens percentage with every one of our professional segments growing double digits. So these are large segments growing double digits. So we're growing real market share in absolute dollars. And I'll give Justin Binns and his team a lot of credit for the new account and share of wallet initiatives that are clearly working. To your question specifically on residential repaint, we probably best would describe the bidding activity as having returned to a more normalized bidding market, where in the past 12 to 18, maybe 24 months, it was difficult to get a painter to even come out and give you a bid because they were so busy and so backlogged. I would say that it's likely best described as a more level or more normalized bidding activity. If you look at the LIRA or the NAHB remodel index, both are positive, but clearly some deceleration in what they're projecting. Our double-digit quarter this year was on top of a mid-single-digit performance last year. So I'd say that we have confidence in what we're doing. We have confidence in our ability to continue to grow and grow at our competitors' expense. We have product back in our store. We just talked briefly about the people in our stores. We think that's a very important element in what it is that we do. So the retention of our people, we believe, has a direct correlation to the retention of our customers. And we continue to introduce new products. We can get into some of those details, perhaps later, if we like. But we're introducing new products to help keep that residential repaint customer not only successful in what they're doing, but also growing in new segments as well. Talk a little bit about new res there a moment ago after Jeff's question, but I will say that our ability to work with our builders and help to drive their business and their efficiency, we believe, has been an important element in our ability to retain the relationships that we have, and in fact, grow those relationships. We're introducing in the face of an adverse market here in the diversity of new residential, we're introducing new products that will help our customers high build products that will help hide imperfections and improved durability, and that's helping us to grow our new residential business, and we expect that to continue to grow. We expect to come out of this time here of some challenges in the market with absolute new and greater market share. On the Commercial side, you asked about this was one of the markets that clearly came in with stronger-than-expected results for the quarter. Our position in this segment is very good, strong and growing. We've been long investing in reps, products, specifications and the fact that we have local stores and local reps is an important element in growing this segment. Again, we've introduced a number of innovative products here as well. When you think about labor, we often talk about that labor represents, on average, about 85% to 90% of the cost of goods for a painting contractor. The cost for a commercial contractor is likely higher than the average, perhaps in the 90% to 95% as many of the commercial contractors are either union or applying paint in the metro markets, which are higher cost. Our model, therefore, is even a greater value to these customers. Our ability to collaborate with the architects, work with the designers, work with these contractors is absolutely paying dividend. And we're excited about this business. The commercial side, there's a lot of work that's still coming out of the ground, and we expect to continue to grow with this market and at the expense of our competitors. Property maintenance, you asked about as well, is another segment that grew stronger than expected. Occupancy and rents are returning to more normal rates, and growth here is driven by not only our continued share gains but capital improvement projects as well as an increase in turns. So the Pro side by segment is really going well, and we're going to continue to put fuel in this tank and feel really good that while we're growing share, the only expectation we have for our team is to grow it even faster. Christopher Parkinson : Understood. And just as a quick follow-up on the raw material basket, just to keep this simple, you've got a few things that are sticky, but broadly, it seems like we're moving in the right direction. Can you just hit on the two most pleasant surprises in terms of the basket and perhaps the two most frustrating substrates as we are if you're saying here today? James Jaye : Yes, Chris, I would say that raw materials are really trending as we expected. And not sure that I'd say there's a lot of surprises there. They were down slightly in the first quarter. The moderation was led by monomers, solvents and resins. To your point, TiO2 and pigments may be a little stickier near term, but we expect to see some moderation there as the year goes on. I would remind everyone, as a reminder, our cost of goods also includes higher inflation in wages and other employee-related costs. For the second quarter, we're expecting to see some further moderation as we move towards our guide for the full year, which, as we said in our opening, is unchanged. Raws down low to mid-single digits. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison at Seaport Research Partners. Michael Harrison : Was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the additional architectural capacity that you brought on probably a little over a year ago? As you look at these housing challenges that seem to be ahead, is that additional capacity is something that we should think about as weighing on utilization or fixed cost absorption as we're going forward? And I guess in hindsight, should you maybe have pulled back or wait a little bit longer to expand some of that capacity? John Morikis : Absolutely not. We expect and are filling that capacity, Mike. And when you believe like we do and what's happening in the market and where we're going, if you were sitting in my chair, you would have invested exactly as we did. I would not have pulled back one penny of it. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Mike, I'd just add to that. As you remember on the January call, I talked about a potential headwind with just lower architectural volume because everybody in the industry had to build architectural inventory back up. So that's short term.  Long term, we have a lot of confidence in the growth across each of the segments, Architectural Pro segments that John talked about, and we'll fill up that capacity very quickly. So even though it might be a short-term headwind, as we've lived through some of these cycles before, the bounce back and the strong growth, I'll go back to 2008 and '09, and we grew high single digit for the 3-, 5- and 10-year compounded average growth rate, and we're a much bigger architectural business today than we were back then, we'll fill that capacity. So -- and I would argue or add to that, we're going forward on Statesville because of the confidence we have in the future outlook and the growth in architectural. Michael Harrison : All right. Great. And then on the Performance Coatings business, it was a little bit surprising to me that Asia was the weakest region for you. Can you comment on how you expect demand to play out in the rest of the year across the different regions? And I guess with particular emphasis on, are you going to be seeing some recovery in China and in that Asia business? John Morikis : Well, Mike, we're positioned well to do just that. It's yet to be seen as the market or the the market tries to kind of resume back to some normalcy in Asia. We're positioned very well. Our technology, our assets, our people, I think a lot of that has to do with what happens in the market and our expectations as in any situation is to grow faster than the market. I think we're in a very good position from a technology, but also a relationship perspective. So yes, I'd say that there is some uncertainty with the market in general as it opens up, and our customers are back producing product, we expect to capitalize more than our share there. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Can you -- it sounded like in the Consumer Brand side, business was maybe a little bit better than you expected. Can you speak to the stocking patterns that are going on there? Are we seeing kind of a normal stock? It seems like the expectation was it was going to be a little bit below normal, but again, you're kind of coming in better than you thought. So maybe a little bit of color there would be helpful. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, John, I would say that you're absolutely right. We have obviously saw a better performance in North America and in Europe. And if you remember on our January call, I said we had not seen the destocking in our fourth quarter that maybe some had seen. So we anticipate it may be a slower build in inventory at the retail channel. We actually saw a slight increase in the retail channel inventory. And I think -- thinking back, if I look at across the chain from the retail channel back through our DSCs, we're back to more I would call, historic levels of inventory. So we're well positioned to service the spring and summer selling season that's coming up. And I'd just highlight also, Latin America was a mid-single-digit tailwind in the quarter. Latin America had a very strong double-digit quarter and that helped when you brought them into the Consumer Brands Group. John McNulty : Got it. Okay. Okay. And then when you -- I know you guys don't tend to do much around the weather or blame a lot or take much credit for things on the weather front. But was a much wetter start to the season, particularly in regions where you can't paint in the first quarter out West and what have you and it looks like the Midwest also maybe started a little bit more slowly. Do you have pent-up demand? Is that why maybe some of the -- it looks like some of the data that we've at least been seeing from the contractors is maybe a little better than expected? I guess, how would you characterize that? John Morikis : I'd characterize it as we don't like to talk about weather, you're right. I think there are areas that are going to be under pressure with whether, John, and there are going to be other areas that are a little better in weather and does it have some impact in some of those areas, sure. But short of significant impact on our businesses, we try to stay away from that. Our expectations from our team includes the opportunity to go out and grow business. And so appreciate the question, but we're not going to follow the weather as a means for what's driving our results right now. We're proud of what we've accomplished. We're determined to accomplish more, and we're not going to let weather stand in our way. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi at Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : John, you've given us parameters as to how to think about new residential for 2023, which was a reiteration of your previous view three months ago. Has your view changed on Commercial for the year in context of the credit issues that the U.S. banking system and also Europe went through starting in March? Or is it still pretty consistent with before? John Morikis : Ghansham, I'd say this year, we see a pretty solid year. These buildings are reaching the painting stage now. They started 12 to 18 months ago. So we'll have to see if there is, in fact, an impact on Construction and Commercial 12 to 18 months from now. But the long line of sight that we have in this space, we are growing share, and there's a lot of projects coming on, which we expect to paint. Ghansham Panjabi : Got you. And then in terms of packaging, I know very tough comps for the first quarter, but how are you thinking about the rest of the year for that specific business? John Morikis : That's an interesting one because I think when you look at Packaging, we never accept from any of our businesses softness. But this is a very unique situation with our Packaging business on top of the 30% comps. This team is continuing to expand the commercialization of what we consider a very unique technology. So we continue to see the lines that our product is on. They grow. They're growing. We're growing share. What's happened right now is there's a level of destocking that's taking place within many brands impacting our customers as they work through high inventory levels. It's not often that I'm accepting to a team that's brought in softness. But in this case, given the line of sight that we have and the share that we're gaining and the incremental production lines that were going on every day, we're giving them a break. So I think the first quarter was a little tough. We'll probably have a little choppiness here in the second quarter. And as the year progresses, our expectations will resume for this team to continue to grow or to be able to demonstrate the share that they're growing. It's a short-term issue for this team. We've got a lot of confidence in the technology, the team and what we're doing. We'll be fine here. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Sison at Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Nice start to the year. John, I know you mentioned that you need to see how trends for 2Q on the folds to have a better idea for the second half. So just curious if unfold as you expect today, and I think it means -- I think your outlook suggests that PSG volumes are going to flatten out versus a pretty strong first quarter. What does that mean for your second half outlook? And if 2Q comes in better or worse, what does that sort of mean? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, I would say, as John talked about, I mean, our first quarter is the smallest quarter. We expected a strong quarter. We delivered on that. We're closely monitoring the demand trends and expect, as you mentioned, and we said it on our year-end call that new residential demand would start slowing in our mid-second quarter. We've experienced a lot of market uncertainty before. I just look at the last three years, I think it's better to get a better view of demand after our seasonally higher second quarter. This gives us the best opportunity and more certainty for our second half. And we'll continue to manage our SG&A, particularly G&A tightly, continued investments in other discretionary items will be managed with the demand outlook. I think we believe these long-term growth investments allow us to grow market share in any environment and especially as we come out of this slower macro environment. But that is how we're going to manage the company going forward. I mean, we believe our second half outlook is realistic. But we also believe we'll outperform the market. And if the market demand is better than our expectations, we'll perform better than what we currently have here. And we'll all those variables together and give you our best outlook after the second quarter for the year. Michael Sison : And as a quick follow-up, given your new capacity, better cost structure and such, if you do get your volumes back to where they were prior to this downturn, where do you think earnings or margins should be at this going forward? John Morikis : Well, we've talked about our -- speaking to the margin -- gross margin, we expect we'll be in the range of the 45% to 48%. We've I think demonstrated the incremental sequential margins in this quarter, getting close to that bottom level of the range, and we expect to poke through that. And the reason we do expect that is, is that we believe we're focused on the right customers with the right solutions. Our focus is really simple. I mean we want to help them make more money, help them to be successful. And as a result, we are in a position to be able to build that combined success. And as a result, we expect to be able to provide margins for both our customers and our shareholders. And the combination of the right customers with the right solutions, we believe will lead us to that. Allen Mistysyn : The only thing I'd add to that, Mike, is when thinking about it by segment, we have a lot of confidence in our Performance Coatings Group to drive operating margins to that high teens, low 20s. The first quarter, excluding acquisitions, we were at 16.4. Again, if you remember, we hit that mark in the third quarter. It's an all-time high since we've owned Valspar. And we're confident in driving Consumer Brands Group back up to that high teens and low 20s. So we get our cost structure right, that will be a tailwind. We hold on the price. But as we come out of this, we drive strong architectural gallon growth, market share growth in our Performance Coatings business, and that's what's going to drive those operating margins back up to the high watermarks we experience in different occasions on the different businesses. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne at Bank of America. Steve Byrne : What fraction of your Consumer business is the Pros the Paint category versus what was it back when you first got that exclusivity with Lowe's? What would you say is driving that growth? For example, is it the product offering? Or I know Lowe's has at least in some stores offering free delivery to the job site? Can you comment on how extensive that is? Is that meaningful? And are you involved in that? Heidi Petz : Yes -- well, go ahead, John. John Morikis : No, I was just going to say I want to start and then kick it to you, Heidi. I'd say, first of all, as there's a commitment by both companies to grow this, that terrific leaders inside our organization and they're working with terrific leaders inside the Lowe's organization, an outstanding partner. And I think we're combined looking at the right elements of the business. And so we're not going to disclose the percentage on that, Steve. But Heidi, I would like for you to maybe could talk a little bit about the Pros Who Paint, but also on a broader view, the importance of this relationship and in the Consumer Brands portfolio as well as the initiatives that we have to grow. Heidi Petz : Steve, this is Heidi Petz. John covered a good bit of this. I think, at the end of the day, we want to make sure that we are demonstrating that we're the very best partner. In fact, we want to be their #1 partner. So we think of some of the engagements here and how we're activating, certainly, there's a lot of support as they're working through their promotional calendars, making sure that we're investing in the right areas, not only to drive traffic, but to make sure that we're converting those shoppers in the aisle certainly. And we've got a lot of great brands. We've got some launches that are taking place right now. We won't get into too much detail here, but we want to make sure that we're a lockstep with them in terms of driving those conversions. John mentioned this, but the leadership team, certainly all the way through the organization, I would say our partnership has never been better than it is right now in terms of making sure we've got the alignment across the organization, both with their Pros Who Paint and the DIY segments. So when you think of the structures, we've got to make sure that those are mirrored and that the metrics are aligned there. So I feel really confident in the way that we're moving forward and got big plans for the year. So we're going to keep moving. John Morikis : On the Pros Who Paint, specifically, Steve, to your point, there are customers that prefer a home center platform. They can purchase everything from dry wall to every other element that they might use on a project. And -- so to get to your question about who supplies delivery or sales calls or anything, there's a team effort that goes along with that. And while we don't disclose the details of those for strategic and competitive reasons, I think hit at best. The collaboration and focus has never been stronger. Steve Byrne : And maybe one more for you, Heidi, and that's the Huarun brand over in China that is an old Valspar brand. I recall a few years back when the merger the company was going to drill into that those Huarun stores in China and see if that could be driven into a paint stores type of model like is in the U.S. was the conclusion of that effort? Is it really didn't have that potential? And thus, you're not the best owner for that brand? Heidi Petz : Steve, I think you answered it perfectly. Yes, there was -- there's a better model here. I think the divestiture certainly it does align with our strategy And as we've done a lot of work in that group to optimize the portfolio of the brands, certainly making sure that we're driving a focus on where we can get a return for our shareholders. And I think you said it -- sometimes they're just assets that are more valuable to others and this is an example of just that. We had -- the business was about $100 million in revenue with 300 employees -- and frankly, it was acquired as part of the Valspar acquisition, you remember, in 2017. So as we move down the next quarter here, we'd expect to close on this second half of 2023. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Gregory Melich at Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich : Thanks for the helpful volume trends through the quarter in architectural. Is it fair to say, given the deceleration in top line that you expect that April is running negative volume year-over-year now? Or is it -- has the deceleration been less dramatic than that? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Greg, I would just say that April is trending as we would have expected it to trend, not any better or worse. Gregory Melich : All right. Well, I have to try. But how about this? In the first quarter, could you break down the sales growth, the 8.9% into -- I think volume was down slightly and just sort of what was price and FX in that to sort of help us frame the sales going to flat in the second quarter. How much of it is from volume deceleration? How much of it is from price staying where it is? Allen Mistysyn : Sure, Greg. I would say price is up high single digits. And with that being a little bit higher, acquisitions added a low single-digit percentage, which was mostly offset by FX headwinds. And you're right, the volume was flattish. If you look at that in our second quarter, effective price is going to be slightly lower year-over-year in the second quarter compared to the first quarter as we annualize the Paint Stores Group 12% price increase February 1 and some of the other price increases. As you know, the other divisions and groups were out with significant price increases as well. So they're just not as uniform as Paint Stores Group, but they will annualize as we get through our first -- as we've gotten through our first quarter and into our second quarter. The main difference is lower volumes, primarily due to lower new residential that we talked about, some softening in North America Performance Coatings Group. And then FX headwinds will mostly offset acquisitions in both quarters. Gregory Melich : And is it fair to say that -- or maybe you could help by breaking down the gross margin expansion in the first quarter. Was that primarily getting price on top of raws? Or the fact that volume sort of held in there, were you able to get some margin expansion from volume not being down so much? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. I'd say most of the impact were price increases. But the benefit -- we did see a nice benefit of the increased volumes in Paint Stores Group. As a reminder, that is our highest gross margin segment and plus the slightly moderating raw materials that John talked about. And we are getting on top of the raw material costs. As you know, as we get into significant raw material inflation, we see that short-term contraction. As pricing starts catching up, we moderate our gross margins flatten out, and then we see growth as raw materials moderate and we hang on to most of the price. And it's because of the investments we continue to make. And... John Morikis : Yes. I think it's an important element. We continue to invest not in the products, but the services and technologies as well as the other assets. Additionally, I'd say the obvious and important investment in talent that we just talked about, the retention of talent and as well as new talent. So it's more than what's in the can. We're investing in the success of our customers with every rep, every tech rep, every store, even the trucks we're adding to our fleet, all designed to improve the profitability of our customers. So there's more to it than the cost of what's in the can, and we're trying to drive the success of our customers with the investments that we're making. Gregory Melich : And with that, John, maybe I'll jump on that. Given those investments you're making in wage pressure and other costs besides raws, is this a year where you actually could have a price increase, even if raws are slightly down? John Morikis : Greg, we've talked for many years together about our approach, and it's not -- it doesn't change. Every 30 days, we sit down, Al, Heidi, myself with the entire leadership team, and we have a discussion. And the discussion isn't just on raw materials, to your point, it's on every cost that we have. And we do everything we can to try to drive more and more efficiency into the operations that we have. We try to use our leverage with purchasing. We try to drive efficiencies in the plant, everything so that we don't have to go out with price increases. So that's our first choice. But there are times when we find ourselves, as you've described, in situations where it may not be the lever on raw materials that drives it, it might be some of the others. Energy, transportation, whatever it might be. So on a monthly basis, we evaluate that, we make that decision, we take it to our customers, and then we talk to our investors. At this point, we're not in a position to talk about any increases because we're not out with those on a broad scale inside our stores. I will say that with some customers in different parts of our businesses, where we've been working to put pricing in, we're still putting pricing in. So there's no finish line in this area. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Leithead at Barclays. Michael Leithead : Just one on my end. I wanted to dig in on the Performance Coatings outlook. I guess revenue was up, call it, 3.5% in 1Q. You're guiding 2Q down low single digits, so call it flattish for the first half and the full year guide is down about 10% or so, which is seems to imply some pretty steep second half decline. So can you maybe just unpack that a little bit? Allen Mistysyn : Sure, Mike. Let me start and then I'll let Heidi jump in. We do expect continued strength in Auto Refinish and positive sales in General Industrial in the second quarter, may be a little bit slower than what we saw in our first quarter. We expect the continued softness in Industrial Wood. And then we expect Coil and Packaging to be down low single digit, primarily due to the strong double-digit comps in the second quarter. I think if you look at it by region, North America, our largest region, is expected be up or down low single digits compared to a high single-digit first quarter, both against strong double-digit comps, and we're not expecting a ton of improvement in Europe or Asia Pacific and even Latin America will moderate a little bit. Heidi Petz : Yes. And I would just hit a few highlights here on the segments. I think, obviously, a lot of this is based on our strategy of differentiation. I'll hit on some of the regions. So just a couple of highlights. If you look at where we've said based on being recession resilient, Automotive Refinish is a great example where we were up mid-teen percent. We do see strong demand in most regions, and I would also comment on the really good price realization for the value that we're able to create and demonstrate for our customers. We've been a number of calls here in the last few quarters, we've been talking more about our installations, and we're now seeing the momentum really building here. We would expect to continue to build up momentum and think you could expect to see us taking some meaningful share here. A few challenges. We're still working through. You'll probably hear a consistent theme across Performance Coatings Group and some of these segments where we've largely recovered our raw material challenges, but it is now a race to convert to finished goods as soon as possible. So you can imagine the Automotive Refinish space that is absolutely a priority and also working closely with our customers where labor does continue to be a challenge for these customers. The shop technicians, parts shortages are impacting some of these customers that are working through backlogs rather the Automotive Refinish. I'd highlight quickly here, too, Mike, is the Protective and Marine where as you know, we're servicing this segment through our Paint Stores in North America and very strong double-digit sales in the quarter and still a strong -- aggressively strong outlook, I would say, through 2023. Demand is strong in North America and Latin America through most of the segments in protective & marine. Europe, Asia, we've talked about these, certainly seeing some pressure there, which is leading to some project delays. And as I mentioned, we're on the path here making sure that we're taking every ounce of the resin as it continues to improve to raise the conversion here. So we'd expect to see growth and incremental share gains there as well. I'll comment just briefly on General Industrial. You mentioned that think this, I would categorize as more of a mixed bag across the segments and the regions. However, globally, heavy equipment remains our strongest. And then you've got some areas that are showing early signs of slowing. Appliances will be a good example of that, just adjusting to inventory levels. So we're going to continue to ramp up production there. Briefly on Coil and I'll hit Industrial Wood and certainly come back to any additional comments. Coil, North America is remaining strong with very consistent demand. Our metal buildings business is performing better than expected and seeing some softness in areas like the aluminum trim business. Latin America continues to be very strong with good performance that is built on new business and new accounts. The teams been laser focused there, but we're still seeing pressure across EMEA and Asia in Coil. And I'll briefly hit on Industrial Wood. We've talked about this segment where we feel the most pressure. And I would say within the actual segment, the most pressure as it is coming from furniture. The other segments like kitchen cabinets and flooring, we mentioned in our prepared remarks that are tied to new residential continue to be a challenge. So we're seeing the continued pressure there. But importantly, what the leadership team there is working on is expanding aggressively through market share gains, while our competition, in some cases, it's reacting to the market softness differently. So we're working on getting these gains with a focus on introducing new technology. And I'll give you a quick example here. The example in our furniture category, this technology is going to allow our customers greater service, quicker turnaround and ultimately, smaller batches, which brings benefit to the customer with less working capital, less waste and less obsolescence. So I'm bringing this to you just as another example of beyond what's in the can, how we partner with our customers to bring them solutions that are meaningful to their business goals. So quick overall around those segments, but just a little bit of color. Operator : Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson at Wolfe Research. Truman Patterson : Just following up on one of Greg's questions just for a little clarity. Pricing trends during the quarter in each of the segments, were you actually able to realize or capture incremental pricing in each of the three segments? Or was it really just kind of carryover from what was already in place in the fourth quarter? Allen Mistysyn : Well, Truman, for Paint Stores Group, it's mostly carryover for consumer. There's pockets where maybe we didn't have product that now we're able to better service the customer with improving alkyd resin situation. But in Performance Coatings group, for sure, there was some incremental pricing across specific businesses and specific regions that John even talked about where maybe we haven't been as effective as we needed to be in the past or there's other inputs that are causing our cost to go up. I use energy in Europe as one example where we've had to be out to offset some of those higher costs. So maybe some incremental, the mass majority of it, though, is the carryover pricing from 2022. Truman Patterson : Perfect. And then in Performance Coatings, op margin was up like 400 bps year-over-year to 15.7%. That's highest first quarter in like 8 years, even though volumes were down like low teens. Normally, you see a sequential ramp in those margins in 2Q and 3Q. Were there any onetime items in the first quarter that we shouldn't think margins will follow normal seasonality in 2Q or 3Q? Or is that kind of a good cadence to think about? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, I would say it's probably a good cadence. There wasn't anything onetime that jumps out, Truman, as you can imagine, across a global business, there's puts and takes every quarter. But nothing that drove the over increase in our gross -- in our operating margin. John Morikis : Truman, I'd give a lot of credit to our leader there, Karl Jorgenrud and his lieutenants that are out driving every day. To your point, we see the sequential improvement. There's a lot of hard work. The identification of the right customers, the right segments, the right technologies and really demonstrating the ability to help our customers to improve their profitability. And we've said for a long time that we expect this to be in the high teens, low 20s. And Karl was in the room right now. I look him in the eye and tell them I'm expecting them to get there very quickly. So -- and he would probably respond that he's going to. So we've got a lot of confidence in that team, a lot of expectations, high expectations, and we are going to deliver. Allen Mistysyn : Truman, the other -- the only other thing I would add to that is acquisitions were slightly dilutive in the quarter as we continue to integrate those acquisitions realized synergies as the year goes on, my expectation that, that will improve as the year progresses and help drive better operating margin in this segment. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : John, just on Q2, historically, you see about, say, $0.75 increase sequentially from Q1. Would you expect a similar increase this year or perhaps a little bit less, given the demand weakness that you've been talking about here? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, David, we're not going to give guidance on our second quarter EPS. I understand the question. What I think you can expect to see in our second quarter is, gross margin, we expect sequential and year-over-year improvement We talked about the price increases and a sequential carrying over and a sequential improvement in raw material costs will have a positive impact, partially offset by higher wages within manufacturing and distribution. I would say with SG&A, I do expect a smaller year-over-year increase in our second quarter as we annualize that merit increase from last year and we start realizing more of the cost reductions from restructuring activity. So we typically see an increase in SG&A, as I talked about, with Paint Stores ramping up to service the increased sales. But as a percent of sales, I would expect our SG&A as a percent to be lower in our second quarter because of that seasonally higher architectural sales. So you do expect a lift in our second quarter because of the improvement in Paint Stores Group quarter-to-quarter architectural sales, but we're not going to John Morikis : We expect to have a good second quarter, and we're going to update you at the end of the quarter. But what we see right now, we expect a good quarter. David Begleiter : Understood. And John, just on the Paint Stores Group, are you giving -- are you seeing any price erosion or givebacks in that business? John Morikis : No. Actually, David, normally, what we see is a small percentage, large, perhaps what we might call, marquee jobs that get a lot of attention, and we're all proud and some of us have egos. We met that that we want to see our pain on specific projects. But for the most part, what you see is a pretty disciplined industry because we all understand that it is competitive and the ability to continue to keep your company healthy and invest in those drivers that will help your customers to be successful requires that health. And so it's competitive for sure. But for the most part, it's race to demonstrate the value that you can bring. And we believe that in that race Sherwin-Williams wins. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Josh Spector at UBS. Joshua Spector : I wanted to follow up on the Pro contractor side of things. I think last call, John, you made some comments that to some of your customers, you need to almost educate them about the fact that there are going to be market declines, and they weren't really seeing declining in backlogs or anything to that extent. Has that changed? Is that conversation changed? And from what you guys have visibility on the backlogs now, has that changed much versus a few months ago? John Morikis : Yes. I should be careful in making general statements like that because to characterize an entire industry like that can be challenging to say the least. But yes, I would say that many customers that have in the past not been able to even return phone calls on bids. Bid requests are now either returning those calls or looking for some of those bid requests. There's an understanding that there's an opportunity to continue to grow. If you look at the homes in the U.S., they are aging. The residents of those homes are aging. And while many of those people may choose to move into a new home, many are choosing to stay in those homes and paint remains relatively inexpensive, yet highly impactful project, and those painting contractors are pursuing those. So again, I mentioned earlier, I would describe it as a more normalized market. Contractors are looking and doing a lot of work, and they are also probably a little more aware that having a marketing aspect to what they're doing is an important part of their future success, and we're helping them with that. It's an element that most people don't recognize. And when I say it's not just what's in the can, we've been at this for over 150 years, obviously, and our ability to align with our customers, help them to understand not only that they should be looking around the corner, but how to prepare for that. They might have been great painters. Now they own a paint company. And when they started the business, they put a sign on a project and every person in the neighborhood came to them. We're helping them to understand how to reach out and grow their business, how to, in some cases, specify products, in some cases, even how to interview potential painters. So we're lockstep with these firms, helping them to grow their business in ways that most people wouldn't understand Joshua Spector : And I guess if I ask about the repaint demand side of things, just we've been in this downturn now for the last six, nine months or at least when starts come down and some of the housing turnover softened. Given the higher DIY demand during COVID and where interest rates are and more people staying put, I guess how do you square all those to say, is repaying that 75%, which is more defensive, is that staying defensive? Is that less defensive, more defensive now? Any way to characterize how you're thinking about that based on what you're seeing today? John Morikis : I'm not sure I quite understand your question, but I might say that we see this residential repaint business and have seen it as an important element to offset some of the softness in the market coming out of the last downturn. Al, myself and many of the leaders that are currently running the company sat and reviewed during a slowdown like we had experienced then, what would we like to have going forward. And it was a larger, more meaningful residential repaint business, and we've been successful in doing that. We were successful in growing new residential, our position there. We love our position there. And we've over-indexed now given the success that we've had. And so the offset to that has been the residential repaint, the property management and on the Industrial side, businesses like our Automotive Refinish and some other even sub-segments within some of our areas. So we manage this business with a long-term view, and we're always looking at the war game of if this happens, then what? And residential repaint right now is an important element. If you look at our DIY business, our DIY business was up double digits, but it's because the comparisons were so small. Last year, we made the decision to deemphasize We weren't making our DIY product. And the reason we did that is that we were allocating that to our DIY retail customers that are important. We want to maintain that long-term relationship. We took a hit there in last year's sales in DIY to help our large and important customers grow. As a result, our DIY comps look good now, but it's on a small base. The residential repaint business is an important element that we expect to continue to grow. DIY, we'll take that business, but our focus is on the 90% of the professional through our stores. Heidi Petz : Josh, one more thing I would add to that on the residential repaint side. I think if you look at -- back to your question on the backlogs and how we think about this business offsetting some of the other softening demand, we're introducing new products. So if you think about these contractors going in, largely focused on the walls, we've introduced a new professional cabinet coating. It's essentially a one component that performs much like a 2-component epoxy. So excellent chemical and moisture resistance and allowing these contractors to go in and essentially help to complete an entire kitchen from the walls to the cabinet. So really trying to arm them with the ability to take advantage of while they're in the home, where else they can generate revenue. Operator : Your next question is coming from Alex Yefremov at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : I have two questions on the cost side. One is on the labor cost. What are you seeing in terms of trends? Any signs of inflation leveling out there? And the second part is on the real estate. As you sign new leases or renew existing leases, are you seeing any cost moderation there? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Let me -- I'll take the first one on our labor costs. We talked about mid-, high single-digit labor costs through our nonfactory distribution facilities. We do expect that to level out, especially as we get into our second half in our factories and distribution centers. I would say the rate of increase has been higher to attract and retain those individuals and our sites. I would say on that side, Alex, we're going to continue to do specific market studies to make sure we don't get out of bed, if you will, or outside of the market in any given area. I think what I would admit to as we maybe got a little behind. Previously, we're not going to let that happen. So I believe it's leveled out as we see more unemployment rates tick up, it will put less pressure on wage inflation going forward. But I think we've got to be diligent in the manufacturing distribution areas to -- each market is a little different. Each one is going to be more specific to what's happening in that market, and we'll be more diligent there. But I do expect them to level out. John Morikis : And on the rent side, I would tell you that for the most part, I'd say, rents seem to be relatively flat. We make a very good tenant. We try to use that and leverage that. The fact that as the predominant or premium brand here, we like to talk about what it is that we bring. We talk about our financial strength and the fact that we're investing in our industry, while others are closing stores, we think, plays well to those tenants that are looking for a long-term tenant that can pay their bills, and we fit that bill. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Arun Viswanathan at RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : So first question, I guess, was you guys have obviously many, many businesses. If you were to characterize maybe the top 2 or 3 that are performing better than expected or have the capabilities of performing better than expected, what would those be? Would that be maybe Commercial and maybe new home -- new resi potentially not being as bad as you initially thought? Or how should we think about that? John Morikis : Well, I would say that Commercial certainly has performed better. Our property maintenance has performed better. Our protective & marine has performed better. I think that our residential repaint is, we had high expectations of that going in. So we -- I think -- I would never say they're meeting our expectations. When they meet our expectations, we raised our expectations. On the Industrial side, I think our Automotive business is really doing very well. And I'd say that -- there are some others that -- it's hard to answer this question, Arun, because in each of our businesses, there are opportunities. So in our business, the way we look at it, it's not a 1 or a zero. When our teams come in and talk about -- if you're looking at our Paint Stores Group, you can come in and talk about new residential being under pressure, but then the focus is on where are the opportunities. And so even within new residential, we know there are opportunities there for growth. And so there's -- I often say there's no finish line. In each of these businesses, there are opportunities. And the role of our leadership teams that have been through many of these in the past is to find those opportunities and they exist in every single business. Even Industrial Wood, where there's a lot of pressure, there are opportunities for growth, and we expect the team to find those opportunities, grow in those segments while improving their position within the segments -- the sub-segments that we play in now so that when the market does return that we are that coiled spring and we take advantage of it. But we expected them all to grow faster than the market. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the EPS outlook here a little bit. So prior to your last earnings report, I think several of us rightly or wrongly were in the $9.50 to $10 range for '23. Yourselves and us have rebased our expectations to $8.35 or so at the midpoint. So does that $1.50 or so that we had to remove from our outlook, what would it take for that to come back in '24? Is it mainly lower -- a better affordability environment driving higher housing turnover? I know there are several things that you can probably mention, John. But similar -- maybe a couple of the top drivers that we get you back into that near $10 range on EPS? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Arun, the first and always the biggest is volume growth. I mean there's been a lot of macro headwinds. There's a lot of uncertainty and some of the mortgage rates are higher. Existing home turnover is lower. New family -- single-family starts are lower. As we keep investing in new stores, in new reps and some of the other long-term growth opportunities, reps across each of the businesses as the market improves because of the added investments we've put in over time, we expect to grow much faster than that market. So instead of a headwind with the macro environment becomes a tailwind, and then we grow. I keep going back to '08 and '09 because I believe it's a similar environment and the similar dynamics. So we expect to grow not 1x to 2x the market, but 2x to 2.5x to 3x the market. And that's how we're going to drive that operating margin back to where we expect it to be. John Morikis : Yes, it's capitalizing. I mean mentioned in the last response, that in every one of these segments, I agree, volume is the key and growing share is important. And even we talk a lot about new residential, and we point to single-family frequently when we're having that discussion. But the fact that multifamily starts have been more robust since last summer. It's a terrific opportunity. And our ability to shift resources and attention to those opportunities is what differentiates us and why we believe that we'll get there. And the opportunity to really see that expansion we're not just waiting for the market to come back. We're working every day to take that volume and be in a better position to capitalize on it once the markets improve. Arun Viswanathan : And just one last quick one. I know you guys have moved the FCP to August. Was that mainly just you had a little bit more visibility into the year? Or I guess, usually, it's some in May or June. So just if there was anything to that, I just wanted to understand that move. John Morikis : We wanted to bring you to Cleveland in August. It's a beautiful time to be here. It's... Arun Viswanathan : Great. John Morikis : Yes. I mean to bring you in and be able to talk a little bit more about our line of sight in August is going to be much better. And quite frankly, we're proud to put our teams in front of you, and we think we're going to have a lot of really good things to talk about. So we're looking forward to hosting you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from John Roberts at Credit Suisse. John Roberts : Your Auto Refinish business has been consistently strong for a long time right now. During the pandemic, I thought it was Dupli-Color, but now we're out of the pandemic and it's still strong. Is it controlled distribution? Is it new products? What's driving that above-market performance? John Morikis : Yes. It's controlled distribution. It's technology. We talked about the combination of the technology system between some technology combining Sherwin and Valspar technology. We have wonderful leadership. We have great products, great distribution that's controlled. And we've been talking, to your point, John, about our position here for some time and expected it to grow. And we think the numbers are proving exactly what we said was going to happen is, in fact, happening. John Roberts : Okay. And then you've got over 300 stores in Latin America. Now that they're in the Consumer segment, do you run them differently? Are you going to be repositioning those stores? John Morikis : No. All along, we've been sharing talent as well as best practices amongst the Consumer brands and our Paint Stores Group. There is a realization that more and more of that business represents or mirrors business that might most likely be found in our Consumer Brands Group. We've got talent in our Consumer Brands Group. Todd Rea and the team has really done a wonderful job, and we think bringing their expertise to that market where we can leverage their experiences will be terrific. And quite frankly, it will work both ways. We have terrific leaders in Latin America as well, and we expect to learn from what it is that they do down there and bring some of that back to North America. So it's a win-win for both businesses and certainly for customers on both sides. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Kevin McCarthy at Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : With regard to your Performance Coatings Group, is it your sense that customer destocking is done as we sit here in April? Or is it still playing out among certain businesses within the segment? John Morikis : I would say it's likely played out, although I would say there might be some differences in region by region, Kevin. But if you look at what's happening in Europe as an example, there's a lot of concern in the market. So we might have some customers that might still be in unique position. But for the most part, particularly here in North America, I don't think there's a great deal of inventory in the segments that we play in. Kevin McCarthy : Good to hear. And then secondly, if I may, what percentage of your Performance Coatings Group sales are linked to contracts that would feature some sort of indexed pricing mechanism as it relates to raw materials? John Morikis : A very small percentage. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. So when you say in your prepared remarks, John, that you hang on to the majority of your price increases, it sounds like that would be a vast majority indeed, if index pricing is quite small. John Morikis : That's correct. Operator : Your next question is coming from Duffy Fischer at Goldman Sachs. Duffy Fischer : Just first question on structural raw materials. A year ago, you guys were shorted and couldn't supply your customers what you wanted. Obviously, now things are slacked in the system. We're seeing prices roll over. If we get back to a normal demand level, let's say, next year, are raw materials structurally short again? Or have you guys taken steps and what steps have you taken to increase the availability of raw materials if we get back to a normal demand level? James Jaye : Duffy, I would say they will not be structurally short. The availability has recovered very nicely for us. We've taken a number of steps over the past couple of years in response to what we've seen. One of those was certainly our purchase of specialty polymers, which has increased our internal resin production. We work closely with many of our suppliers. We've simplified the portfolio as well. So there are maybe not as many raw materials that we would have to procure as we would have in the past. I don't know... John Morikis : I'd say from an assurance of supply, it's very important to understand, Duffy, we're not trying to return to a supply chain of the past. Our goal has been to improve our position and our ability to supply our customers, and we've taken appropriate steps. For competitive reasons, we're not going to lay out what those steps are, but Heidi and her team -- Heidi is leaning on the edge of receipt, wanting to answer this question. We're not going to get into those details right here right now. I would tell you that we have been very forward-thinking in how we're going to work through future issues, and we learned a lot during this process. And I'd say we're coming out better and smarter as a result. Duffy Fischer : Fair. And then a decade ago, the Glidden brand bumped you guys out of Walmart once before. And I think if my notes are right, it was like a $250 million opportunity back then. This time, does it move the needle? It's no longer Dutch Boy, but it's Valspar, but does it move the needle for you guys or that's kind of a non-event in what we'll see in your printed numbers? Heidi Petz : Yes. We don't think this will really have any impact to be really candid with you. And I think if you look at the business in general, Walmart is still a very important customer to us. We sell them a lot of our key brands such as Minwax, Thompson's, Krylon. And while we have, to your point, enjoyed the private label in the past, I think this is an exciting opportunity for us as we move forward because we're going to continue to service the existing brands that we have, and we will look forward to an opportunity in the future. If there comes to be something where we can both create value on both sides or both companies will absolutely be interested in looking at that. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Adam Baumgarten at Zelman & Associates. Adam Baumgarten : Just one for me. Are there any other businesses at this point in the portfolio that are under strategic review? Or are you kind of through that process? John Morikis : Adam, we look at every business, every brand, every program, everything constantly. We have that discipline. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky at Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : When you look at the Paint Stores Group, DIY was up double digits in the quarter. And I think you touched on some of that. But in the Consumer Group in North America, DIY was soft. Was there more to talk about there than just short supplies a year ago at Paint Stores? John Morikis : Not really, Chuck. I'd say we have really deemphasized DIY last year to serve our customers. And so we now have a product to sell. And -- so it's on a smaller base because of last year. And again, I think it's important to mention that our focus and our success is going to largely be determined by the professional sales that we have, representing about 90% of what goes through our stores. So we'll take the DIY business. We're there. It helps us, but the focus is on our PRO business. Operator : Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois at Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : I wanted to follow up just on the inventory field that you saw in Consumer Brands. Was that across both DIY and Pro? And do you expect any of that to bleed into the second quarter? Allen Mistysyn : No. Typically, what we see in our mid spring and summer selling months are, you'd start seeing the declines in inventory as we come out of the season. So I wouldn't expect to see inventory builds like we saw in our first quarter. So I think you'll see a more typical seasonal inventory pattern this year. Raw materials are in a good place. Like I said, we're through the total supply chain Inventories are in a good place. So just to put it in perspective, we're back to servicing our customers at the level that we expect to service them at, and they expect to be serviced at. So I would expect that management of inventory will happen similar to the flow of past cycles. Garik Shmois : Got it. I just wanted to follow up. It doesn't sound like it, but I just wanted to confirm if you're seeing any trade down or any change in mix at all, be it in paint Stores or in Consumer Brands? John Morikis : No, the opposite. It's a positive mix shift. Customers that have labor as a percent of sales continue to learn that a higher-quality product might cost them a little bit more per gallon, but that they actually make more on a project. So our mix is positive in our stores. Operator : Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard at Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard : A follow-up for you, Al, I guess. On gross margin, the upside performance in the first quarter or strong performance, however you characterize it, I'm assuming there was some benefit from strength in volume. What I'm trying to figure out is the volume behaves differently in the coming quarters as you've talked. Do you build from the 1Q gross margin? Is that having an impact on the gross margin? How should we think about the linkage between volume and gross margin as we move through the balance of the year? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. It certainly because Paint Stores Group had a better -- had increased volume, and it's our highest gross margin segment and certainly improves our gross margin going in the first quarter for sure. I think as we're moderating some volumes, but still Paint Stores is still going to be our best performing segment in our second quarter. And we do also expect to hang on to the price and see that sequential raw material moderation. So I think the volumes help for sure. And when a Paint Stores Group is stronger than the other segments, because of that mix dynamic, it will help our gross margin. But I do expect to see sequential and year-over-year improvement in gross margin in our second quarter. And then we'll give you an update, Eric, on the rest of second half after the second quarter. Operator : Your final question for today is coming from Jaideep Panaya at On Field Research. Jaideep Pandya : The question really is on Industrial Wood. Could you tell us when did the destocking actually start? And is there any signs of really destocking or weaker demand coming towards? And then the second question really is on the multifamily homes. One of your competitors was sort of alluding that there is a decent backlog this year, but there could be some air pocket next year as the projects sort of finish. So do you expect weakness in the multifamily homes or for that matter in commercial/property management in 2024? Or it's not something you worry about? John Morikis : Well, on the Industrial Wood and multifamily, I'd say -- let me start with the multifamily work backwards. I'd say our line of sight right now on both commercial and multifamily is strong for the balance of this year and certainly going into next year, we'll see what happens as we move forward. But right now, our confidence is high and the pipeline is full. We're bidding a good amount of activity with the contractors in this space. So I'd say our future looks pretty positively on that. In the industrial Wood, timing, it's been under pressure likely along with housing. So if you want to look at housing starts is a good precursor for this business. It's not exact, but we'll give you some insight as to how that business has behaved. And again, our expectation is that there are opportunities in this business to outpaced the market in both -- in all the segments you talked about, multifamily as well as Industrial Wood. We have teams that are out there focused on growth every day. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. James Jaye : Yes. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I did want to remind you that please save the date for our annual financial community presentation that will be in Cleveland, as John said, on August 24. The event will also be webcast. Registration details on that will be available soon, and we look forward to seeing many of you here to close out the call here, you heard today that we're off to a very good start to the year with today's results. And at that same time, our team knows we still have work to do, and we're prepared to do that. We know there's going to be macro headwinds as the year progresses, but we'll deliver strongly in those conditions. And we're going to remain focused on what we can control. So thank you for attending today. And as always, I will be available along with Eric Swanson for your follow-up phone calls. Thanks for your interest in Sherwin. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company\u2019s earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Jim Jaye : Thank you and good morning to everyone. Joining me on the call today are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; and Heidi Petz, President and Chief Operating Officer; Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; and Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President of Enterprise Finance. Sherwin-Williams delivered excellent second quarter results compared to the same period a year ago. These results, coupled with a similar strong performance in the first quarter led to an excellent first half that exceeded the expectations we laid out back in January. Given the strong first half and current visibility into our second half, we are significantly increasing our full year guidance, which John will talk about in just a few minutes. But first, let me touch on a few second quarter highlights. Consolidated net sales in the quarter exceeded our expectations and grew by a mid-single-digit percentage. Sales in all 3 reportable segments came in above our guided range. Gross margin significantly improved sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strong volume in the Paint Stores Group and moderating raw material costs. Pricing discipline remains strong. SG&A expense increased over the prior year quarter, though the year-over-year percentage increase was lower than that of our first quarter. Excluding the impact of incremental acquisition and restructuring costs SG&A increased 8% year-over-year. Approximately 85% of that second quarter increase was related to investments in Paint Store Group long-term growth initiatives with the remainder driven by increases in compensation and benefits. We are highly confident these growth investments will deliver strong returns and benefit our customers. And while we recognize SG&A expense was higher year-over-year in the quarter, we ultimately manage the business to drive operating profit and margin, both of which expanded meaningfully in the quarter. We are committed to investing in and profitably growing the business at the same time. Segment margin in all three reportable segments expanded sequentially and year-over-year. We also delivered strong double-digit growth in adjusted diluted net income per share and EBITDA with adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.9% near the high end of our current long-term 19% to 21% target range. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our second quarter results by segment. John will follow Heidi with comments on our outlook before we move on to your questions. Heidi Petz : Thank you, Jim. I\u2019ll begin with the Paint Stores Group. Second quarter Paint Stores Group sales were ahead of our expectations and increased 10%, driven by mid-single-digit volume growth and continued effective pricing. Segment margin improved 280 basis points to 24.3%. Growth was led by our protective & marine business, which was up strong double digits and was driven by industrial flooring infrastructure and oil and gas applications. In our pro-architectural end markets, the strongest performers were commercial and property maintenance, both of which increased by double-digit percentages. Residential repaint was close behind with sales up by a high single-digit percentage. Demand in this market is being somewhat tempered by the extended period of weak existing home sales. New residential sales were flat against a double-digit comparison, reflecting the softer start that we saw at the end of last year, which have continued into this year. As we\u2019ve previously noted, we anticipated new residential would be challenging in 2023, though we are performing better than the market as we continue to focus on new accounts and share gains. Our DIY business was up strong double digits, albeit against a softer comparison where sales were impacted by supply chain challenges. From a product perspective, interior and exterior paint sales were both up high single digits, with interior sales growing faster and representing a larger part of the mix. Sales in our Consumer Brands Group also exceeded our guidance and increased by 5.1% in the quarter, primarily driven by mid-single-digit pricing. Sales in North America, our largest region, increased by a low single-digit percentage. We continue to invest here with our strategic retail partners for growth. In other regions, sales were up strong double digits in Latin America and Europe. Sales in China were down double digits, and we expect the previously announced divestiture of the China business to be completed in the third quarter. Adjusted segment margin was 15.7%, up 470 basis points year-over-year. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased less than 1% against a strong 15.2% comparison. Volume decreased low single digits but was offset by mid-single-digit increases in price. Adjusted segment margin increased 420 basis points to 18% of sales, which is within the range we have been targeting for this business. Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased low single digits against a nearly 30% comp. Sales in Europe were up mid-single digits. Latin America sales were down less than 1%, also against a strong comp of over 20%. Demand in Asia remained weak with sales down double digits against a soft period a year ago. From a division perspective, growth was strongest in Auto Refinish, which is up by a high single-digit percentage followed by General Industrial, which was up mid-single digits. Industrial wood sales were up less than 1% as softness in new residential continued to impact demand for furniture, capetry and flooring. Coil sales were down mid-single digits driven mainly by Europe, which was impacted by last year\u2019s Russia exit and against the nearly 40% comparison. Packaging sales were also down low double digits against a 20%-plus comp. We anticipated this decline given the near-term destocking by brand owners that we described on our last call. We continue to feel very good about our position and growth prospects in this end market. With that, let me turn it to John for his comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. John Morikis : Thank you, Heidi. As we said in January, we expected to have a strong first half of the year. Our team exceeded those expectations, and I want to thank all 64,000 of our employees for their relentless focus on serving our customers and for driving continuous improvement across the organization. We also understand that a good first half does not make a good year. We know we have work to do, and that\u2019s exactly where we are focused. On our April call, we said we would have a much better idea of how the year might unfold as we got deeper into the painting season. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing as we begin the second half along with our plans for seizing the opportunities in front of us. In Paint Stores Group, we\u2019re facing a strong comparison to the second half a year ago, where sales were up 19%. We see customer backlogs as being solid in commercial, property maintenance and protective & marine throughout the second half, and we expect to deliver very solid strong growth in these end markets. Residential repaint should also be good for us as based on contractor feedback, though visibility here is only about 6 to 8 weeks and existing home sales are likely to remain weak. There\u2019s some recent optimism from new residential homebuilders regarding starts, but it won\u2019t be enough to move the needle meaningfully for us in 2023. We are more tied to completions, which are slowing. While we are confident we are growing share, we expect new residential volume will be challenging for us in the second half, though the year will likely come in closer to down high single digits compared to the down 10% to 20% full year range we provided in January. In DIY, double-digit growth in the first half was aided by softer comparisons to the prior year, where supply chain headwinds impacted our sales. We do not expect this pace of growth to continue as comparisons become much more difficult in the second half of the year. In Consumer Brands, North America DIY demand remained soft. Europe demand has stabilized and Latin America markets remain mixed. In Performance Coatings, many of our customers continue to report a high level of uncertainty regarding demand. Auto Refinish demand remains an exception and is solid in most regions with shortages in parts and technicians increasing CHOP backlogs. Installations of our systems in North America are up strong double digits year-to-date. This continues to bode well for future sales in this business. General industrial end markets are choppy with North American customers reporting mixed demand by end markets served. Industrial wood demand remains soft, though some positive signs in new residential construction indicate we may have reached the bottom. In Coil, demand is holding up better in the Americas versus Europe and Asia. And finally, in packaging, customers are returning to just in time versus just in case supply chain management, resulting in destocking that we expect will continue in the second half. The longer-term view here is still very robust with customers already committed to fill the additional capacity we\u2019re bringing on this year. Let me be very clear on our expectations here. We do not accept the excuse that markets are soft, and therefore, our opportunities are limited. Our job is not to report conditions, but to influence results. We know we cannot defy gravity in terms of the macro environment. But in every business, we are aggressively pursuing new accounts and share of wallet opportunities to drive market share gains. Moving to the cost side. We are revising our raw material outlook. We now expect costs to be down by mid- to high single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect to see decreases across several commodity categories, though the ranges likely will vary widely. We expect other costs, including wages and other input costs to be up in the mid- to high single-digit range. Compared to the guidance we laid out in January, full year sales growth and raw material costs are trending better than we anticipated. With this first half outperformance we expect considerable year-over-year operating margin expansion and earnings growth for the year. At the same time, these dynamics also afford us the opportunity to accelerate growth and service investments at a higher level than anticipated at the beginning of the year. As a result of these disciplined and enterprise-wide investments, which will drive our customers\u2019 continued success. We now expect the year-over-year increase in SG&A to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range for the full year. As in the past, we are highly confident in our ability to drive future above-market growth, and our returns will justify the actions we are taking now. Now moving on to our specific guidance. We anticipate our third quarter 2023 consolidated net sales will be up or down a low single-digit percentage compared to the third quarter of 2022, with volume down low to mid-single digits. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be up a low single-digit percentage with a volume down a low single-digit percentage. Our sales expectations by segment for the third quarter and the full year are included in the slide deck issued with our press release this morning. We are increasing our full year 2023 diluted net income per share to be in the range of $8.46 to $8.86 per share. We believe this increased range accurately reflects our first half outperformance, continued pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs while also acknowledging the ongoing uncertainty in the second half demand environment. This guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.81 per share. It also includes net expense related to our previously announced targeted restructuring actions of $0.03 per share. On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $9.30 to $9.70. This is an increase of 14.5% at the midpoint compared to our prior adjusted guidance of $7.95 to $8.65 per share. We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. Our slide deck includes additional information on our updated assumptions for the year, along with guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. We\u2019ve also provided an update on our previously announced restructuring efforts. Onetime costs will be lower than previously anticipated. The estimated annual savings from our actions are unchanged. As we begin the second half, we\u2019ll remain focused on what we can control. Across the business, this means growing new accounts and share of wallet. It also means developing and retaining talent, improving and simplifying our operations and managing price cost dynamics. We remain confident in our differentiated strategy, our capabilities in our product and service solutions. Should the demand environment prove to be better than we are currently assuming, we would expect to deliver better results. What we can\u2019t control is the market. We\u2019re not interested in trying to time the economic recovery. What we are interested in is taking full advantage of it when it eventually arrives. This means investing in our growth now ahead of the curve. This approach has served our customers and our shareholders well over multiple past cycles. I have every confidence that it will do so once again. Above all, I have the utmost confidence in our leadership team and our people. They are the true differentiators. Together, we expect to continue outperforming our competitors and the market. This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks and congrats guys on a great quarter. I\u2019d love to go a little bit into that, the deceleration that you still expect into the third quarter. I think it sounds like volume total sales are kind of flattish, that we would expect volume to be down kind of low to mid-singles? And maybe give us a little more color on why you expect that deceleration in what you\u2019re seeing? Heidi Petz : Yes, hi, Greg, I think it\u2019s a great question. I think if you look across our entire enterprise right now, I would just qualify this or characterize this as choppy. I think that\u2019s true both by division, by region. When you break it down, our volume is down low to mid-single digits. If you look at Paint Stores Group alone down low single-digits, I would say that\u2019s primarily due to the new residential slowdown but confident in the increasing starts that we\u2019re seeing. Remember, that\u2019s against a really tough comp of 19%. That\u2019s a bit offset by some of the heavy impact that we\u2019re seeing with both PCG and CBG, but I\u2019m confident in our ability to drive above market growth here. Greg Melich : Got it. And I guess my second question is on getting back to those that margin range, the 46% gross margin. Could you remind us of the range you were targeting? And is there a potential to be above that in the cycle, given that it sounds like at least the pricing environment is remaining quite rational? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Greg, this is Al Mistysyn. And we\u2019re really pleased with the performance of our gross margin. As a reminder, our target is midterm, 45% to 48%. As we have talked about in the past, we \u2013 in our raw material inflationary environment, we put price in to offset those dollars. And then as raw materials moderate, we start seeing the benefit of that pricing to increase our gross margin and helps us cover the continued investments we make to help our customers drive value in their business. So I\u2019d expect the sequential gross margin to be similar to what I saw in this \u2013 what we saw in the second quarter. Price, as you know, we\u2019ll start annualizing the price increases in our third quarter, specifically the September 10% in Paint Stores Group plus the other items, other segments that have put pricing in. So for the full year, I think our gross margin, depending on where Paint Stores Group volume is could be in that 45% to 46% range. And then as you know, we\u2019ll evaluate that 45% to 48% range over time. And as we get consistency in that range, look to raise the bar and move that target up. John Morikis : Yes. So I\u2019d say we refer to that as our current range. And I\u2019d say in addition to every point that Al just made, the additional steps that we\u2019re taking on a regular basis and reviewing the programs that we have, the investments that we\u2019re making, the mix of our products, everything that we\u2019re doing goes into driving that margin. It\u2019s not simply just a price. There\u2019s a lot of activity on the operations side to drive inefficiency. We talked last year about some of the inefficiencies as we serve our customers we were shipping product from 1 point in the country into the other. And so as we continue to optimize our supply chain we expect to continue to drive that as well. Greg Melich : And it sounds like even with the lower raw material expectation for this year, your pricing expectations are unchanged. Is that fair? John Morikis : Yes, that\u2019s correct. As we continue to invest in our business and bring more value to our customers, we\u2019ll invest into that and drive their profitability. And naturally, we\u2019d expect that our shareholders participate in that as well. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. Good luck. John Morikis : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. I got two questions on SG&A. I guess, first, if you could just help us understand \u2013 I know we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but the incremental spending for this year, what details can you give us in terms of what it targets? And then secondly, should the back half of the year play out better than you forecast? Do you have more SG&A activities that you could get into in the back half of the year than you\u2019re already guiding to or is this SG&A guidance done for the year? John Morikis : Yes, Vincent, let me kick it off kind of my thinking on it and then I\u2019ll ask Al to get into some of the details. First, we are going to adjust our investments to market conditions. And these are things that we monitor closely. We reminded the trends in the market, as you just mentioned, activities and opportunities, cost, even the activities of our competitors. And we\u2019ve seen this before. We\u2019ll capitalize on the market opportunities, the competitive shifts and missteps that our competitors make, these are all opportunities. So to your point, as we see raw material trends and these are part of our data set, all roll into what you should expect to see from Sherwin-Williams. We\u2019re going to be aggressive. We\u2019re going to drive market share and invest in our businesses. And I think it comes down to when you have confidence in your strategy and confidence in your leadership team like we do, you can invest. And while others are adjusting their strategies, we\u2019re going to take advantage of any shifts. We will be on the attack. Al Mistysyn : As you know, we\u2019re all about managing operating margin growth and operating margin growth over the long term. So your comment about will we be done with SG&A commentary as the second half goes on. I would say, no. I think as we see how the demand environment and volumes unfold and as they\u2019re at or above our expectations, we\u2019ll look at that. We\u2019ll look at gross margin performance in the second half. And the beautiful thing about our model is we can be very agile across each of the segments, both field sales and tech service reps with the Pro Paint within the Consumer Brands Group. So if we see a path of a higher gross margin than what we have in our current outlook, we\u2019ll look to put more investments in our long-term growth initiatives to drive higher share as the market returns. Vincent Andrews : Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. John Morikis : Thank you, Vincent. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO. Your line is live. John McNulty : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So in the Paint Stores Group, you had been looking for kind of a flattish guide. Now you are looking for up mid to high single-digits. When you look at the major sub-segments of that group, I guess where are you surprised the most, where are things kind of working out better than you expected? John Morikis : So let me start with New Residential, because I think that\u2019s an important piece. And maybe what we will do here, John, is I\u2019ll start with New Residential, maybe talk about Commercial and then I\u2019ll ask Heidi to talk about some additional segments because to be truthful with you, we\u2019re very pleased with the execution of our team. We talk a lot about our secret weapon. And we talked about the recruitment and retention of this team. They are truly executing. We couldn\u2019t be any more proud. In New Residential, I think it\u2019s clear to all of us, there\u2019s pressure in the new residential space. Our flat sales in this quarter, I believe, are indicative of the share gains we\u2019re executing. We talked about penetrating that top 100 builders for the last couple of quarters. And quite honestly, we\u2019re working on that, and we\u2019re experiencing terrific success, in fact, even deeper into some of the more custom homebuilders as well. It\u2019s growing, and we expect to continue to grow there. We continue to execute on our strategy of bringing solutions to these builders to make them more successful. And I think that\u2019s the key and core behind everything we do. So in the builders area, the efficiency that we\u2019re bringing in our supply chain to help them in innovation, quality, consistency, even as they\u2019re adapting into different substrates to help defray costs. We are working with them to ensure that we have the right coatings for them. Importantly, I just talked about our people. I think our stores and our reps in this area \u2013 they\u2019re doing a fantastic job of staying close and in contact with not only our builders, but their applicators, which is very unique. And we\u2019ve got a distribution platform that wherever our builders are building, whatever developments they\u2019re pursuing, our stores are where they are building and where they might want to build. So we\u2019re not out there promising if you will invest here, we\u2019ll invest with you. Our people are there and our assets are there, and we\u2019re capitalizing on that. So we\u2019re growing share. We have not experienced the depth of decline, as you mentioned, we originally projected. Although I would say we do expect to see softness in the second half. You talked about our strategy here and our commitment to favorably position the company and we think this segment absolutely demonstrates that. In the commercial side, I\u2019d say we\u2019re experiencing very good performance. And again, I think it highlights the advantages of our controlled distribution. We expect the balance of 2023 to be strong. We\u2019re really focused on the sub-segments inside commercial going forward. So again, really leveraging the value of this controlled distribution model. Our reps and our specification teams are really dialing into those areas that provide opportunity. And even within those areas that might be strong now that could dry up even in those areas. We know that there will be opportunities could be in tenant build-out or wherever in commercial, it might shift we\u2019re going to be there. So again, our focus on applicators, the specifiers and the owners, we believe, will pay off for us. Res repaint is another area that I think is really important to talk about. Let me turn it over to Heidi. Heidi Petz : Yes. And as you know, we\u2019ve had 7 years of double-digit growth here in this segment, and we\u2019re confident in our execution. But it\u2019s important to know that we\u2019re never complacent and doing what we know how to do, we believe we\u2019ll take share, especially in this environment. While it\u2019s currently positive, we know a slowdown is coming, and it\u2019s also being tempered by, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, by the extended period of week existing homes. So having said that, even in that challenging environment, paint will continue to outperform other categories since it is an inexpensive and highly impactful category. There\u2019s been a lot of speculation about next year, and I will tell you that the bidding activity has somewhat normalized. And believe it or not, these are actually very good times for Sherwin-Williams, where we believe that adversity brings about opportunity for us. In a large part, our controlled model, as many of us talked about previously, this allows us to dig deeper and not just trying to sell our contractors product, but really taking the time to intersect them where they are in their business and helping them to focus on growth and profitability. We have a lot of data that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, but I think, and we won\u2019t get into specifics or details here. But it\u2019s important that as the team is working hard, John mentioned the talent in the frontline here, mining this data for opportunity and getting very surgical in addition to the data leveraging our rep force so that we can be very thoughtful as we approach these contractors and making sure that we are taking advantage of the talent that we\u2019ve got out there. So we are currently focused on building these relationships and confident that we will continue to see some aggressive share gains here. I\u2019ll hit briefly on the DIY relative to stores. And I think, John, your question was specific to stores. Sales were up double digits in Q2 against a fairly soft comp. We don\u2019t expect this to continue at this pace, but we will note that there is been some very positive foot traffic in our stores relative to the segment. And with that, maybe just a brief touch on P&L. John Morikis : Well, property maintenance, I think, is another area that performed a little bit better than we expected. And we have a lot of confidence here. A lot of the delayed maintenance we believe now is being addressed. Apartment turnovers are strong and bodes well for us. And again, I think even the idea of return to travel, office and school all help. And as we leverage a national platform of just up stores and reps to be able to really capture that business as well. So it\u2019s a good business for us and one that performed better as well. Protective & marine was another area that in our stores that performed stronger than I would say we expected. I\u2019ll say that here, not to our team. We expect more from our team would be the answer I\u2019d give them. Our core business was very strong, double-digit growth. But we\u2019ve been investing in this business, and our expectations are high of this team. We\u2019ve got terrific leaders in this area, and we\u2019ve been making investments in areas. We\u2019ve announced a number of acquisitions, for example, in flooring. That\u2019s helped us get into some really key opportunities in food and beverage, pharma, even airport hangers, all have been very strong. Energy has been very strong for us. It\u2019s another great example where we focus on everything from extraction to processing as well as alternative energy. Government activity here is trying to stimulate has been good for us as well. We see business in the area of mega plants for chips that have been good for us. as well as I mentioned, alternative energy, where we really have done a very nice job of bringing technology from all aspects. We\u2019re taking into wind farms, for example, there is one that\u2019s been promoted in the Northeast. It\u2019s going to be a terrific opportunity to bring our marine coatings as well as our heavy-duty petrochem technology to bear in a very unique way. So we\u2019re bringing technology. We\u2019re bringing a strength of a distribution platform, specifications and it\u2019s driving business that the business is very strong. Heidi Petz : And just one piece I would add to that, John mentioned recent acquisition in flooring. I think that really is a great illustration of how we\u2019re looking at this as a broader portfolio of both technologies and services that we\u2019re bringing together in terms of our value proposition. But if I look specifically at something like the battery plants for semiconductors, we\u2019re not just excited for those projects, but candidly, for the infrastructure that will eventually surround those projects as well. So we feel we\u2019re very uniquely positioned to take advantage of that wave. John McNulty : Great. Thanks very much for the detailed color. Appreciate it. John Morikis : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Your line is live. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much. I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on your longer-term thoughts on PC margins, just given the competitive dynamics in each of their respective end markets, obviously, ongoing price cost. I mean I think it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s significantly better than we thought, at least for the quarter. But going to that kind of unofficial 20% marker. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re feeling pretty good about that. But if you could just give an update on the longer-term thoughts there would be very helpful. Thank you so much. John Morikis : Yes, Chris, thanks for your question. I\u2019ll start and kick it to Al. You\u2019re right. We do feel very good, very proud of Karl Jorgenrud and his entire team. That leadership team is really focused on doing this the right way. So the solutions that we\u2019re bringing to our customers and the focus and discipline that we\u2019re bringing is part of the strategy we keep repeating. And as we do that, we bring value to our customers and we\u2019ve been successful. The discipline in that is that if not every gallon is necessarily a good gallon for us as a result. We\u2019re focused on key segments, key customers. We\u2019re trying to introduce technology and services that help them to make more money. And again, as a result, we believe that our shareholders should participate in that. But the push is to make our customers successful and have discipline doing that. And that\u2019s exactly what the PCG team is doing. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Chris, I think the takeaway that I\u2019d leave you with is, as we\u2019ve progressed through 2022 and into 2023, you start seeing consistency in that segment operating margin in either at the bottom of the range or in the range and a couple of additional points. One, they have got the discipline to get price. And when you look at the last 2 years, \u201821 and \u201822, they took the front of the 40% increase in raw material costs, and they were able to get price while still driving volume and when we look at the acquisitions that were made last year, and the integration activities and the synergies that the team is working on. We feel very good about coming out of this year with the operating margins of those acquisitions being accretive to PCG. And then they are also focused on a number of other initiatives, whether it\u2019s SKU rationalization, simplification to make operations more efficient that can better serve their customer at a higher level. So I think you put those things together, and that team is on a strong trajectory to hit that 20% target. And then we will ask for more from there. Christopher Parkinson : Got it. And just a very quick follow-up, and also, quite frankly, a corollary of what you just said. I don\u2019t get to have myself with the next remark, but it seems things are generally progressing a little bit better than expected. Obviously, that\u2019s reflected in the guidance range and so on and so forth. When we take a step back and you look at your portfolio, obviously, you\u2019ve taken a few extra actions of the last 12 to 18 months in both divesting as well as acquiring. Can you just give kind of a very quick update on where you stand with that thought process? Are there any technologies which you still feel you\u2019re focusing on? Are there still assets which you would consider divesting? Just given the actions over the last, quite frankly, 5 years plus? Any update there would be very helpful. Thank you. John Morikis : Chris, we\u2019ve done 20 transactions since announcing Valspar, 16 were acquisitions and six were divestitures. What we\u2019re focused on is and where we want to grow our those areas that we can bring value, that we would be rewarded for bringing solutions to our customers. And we take a hard and disciplined look in other areas. So we\u2019ve divested \u2013 the Valspar wood divestiture was required by the FTC. We divested Guardsman, which came with Valspar, Wade in Australia, which came with Valspar. We\u2019ve announced the Huarun in China came with Valspar in the specialty aerosol plant that we\u2019ve recently announced also came with Valspar. One legacy Sherwin business was the thermoplastic road marking business. Here at Sherwin, we\u2019re focused on high-value products and areas. So that didn\u2019t fit our portfolio. But we\u2019ve done a lot of really good deals that we believe that can help drive value for our shareholders while bringing solutions to our customers. And with that discipline, to your question on will we continue that discipline continues every day here. We\u2019re having discussions every day about programs, the hard discussions about customers, the geographies. We don\u2019t want to just put flags on a map. We\u2019re here to create value for our shareholders. And it\u2019s sometimes hard to make those decisions. But quite frankly, we look at all of these businesses as part of our capital allocation. When we put our money in to buy Valspar and we inherited a lot of these businesses that was capital that was allocated. And if it doesn\u2019t meet the threshold for our shareholder return, then we make those difficult decisions. And that\u2019s part of who we are. And when we\u2019re out looking for acquisitions, it\u2019s not just what\u2019s for sale. We take a very disciplined approach. We\u2019ve got a team led by Bryan Young here and our team that does a wonderful job in helping to identify what would be fit if it\u2019s for sale or not. And if it\u2019s not for sale, we go try to have those honest discussions with the owners about why it might be a better fit with Sherwin. So it\u2019s a disciplined approach that we take. We\u2019re proud of it. We\u2019re not out just trying to buy volume or sales or book of business. It has to fit strategically or we\u2019re not interested. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you for your thoughts. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from R.W. Baird & Company. Your line is live. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. John, as you kind of think about 2023 specific to Paint Stores Group, what do you think the common theme is as it relates to the volume outperformance across your various categories? I\u2019m just curious, is the customer backlogs that were a bit stronger than relative to what you initially thought or market share gains or something else? And then on residential repaint, do you think that vertical could be directionally less sensitive to existing home sales on a go-forward basis relative to the historical baseline? John Morikis : Well, how about if I take the first piece, and I\u2019ll throw it to Heidi on the resale because she\u2019s working very closely on that. I think there is a number of areas, Ghansham. I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time on this because I did just hit this, but I think the foundation of our strategy and our focus really comes down to the people that I just mentioned. We talked about this management training program that we\u2019ve had for over 40 years. We recruit 1,500 college graduates every year. So we\u2019re recruiting and we\u2019re training and developing the best talent, we believe. And yes, we\u2019ve made some compensation adjustments that appeared in our SG&A to retain this talent. And we think that was a great investment, and we\u2019d make it every day because we\u2019re going to win or lose by our people. And so when you ask about what\u2019s happening in the market, I think, quite honestly, our people are executing. It\u2019s a very choppy market out there right now. There were times when you would talk with customers, and they would say they have not advertised in 5 years and some of our customers had never advertised at all. They were spin-off of working for someone else and the market has been so hot, that they just put a sign up in the first house they painted and then it started to roll. Now with the adversity in the market, we look that much more attractive to painting contractors that are looking for assistance and looking for help. And we welcome that. It\u2019s the reason we have over 3,000 sales reps and nearly 5,000 stores in the market. We don\u2019t look at our position nationally. We look at our business market by market, customer by customer, and we\u2019re trying to address their needs. And so I don\u2019t think that there is a lot of wind in the sales of a lot of people on the architectural side, there is good a good book of backlog business, as Heidi mentioned, but there is some uncertainty and there is some choppiness. And our people are there to paraphrase this almost to hold the hands of these important customers and help them through that. And as a result, we get rewarded. So we\u2019re executing really well in a choppy market. That\u2019s how it would respond how we\u2019re performing in the market. Regarding res repaint specifically, Heidi, maybe I\u2019ll have you answer that. Heidi Petz : Yes, Ghansham, I think the good question. In terms of the reliance on resale, I think that the inverse is true as well, which is that those that are staying in place, making sure that they are aware that this is really about the opportunity to raise the value of their home if they choose to stay. We mentioned earlier the inexpensive and highly impactful project. I mentioned the data earlier. I\u2019d like to go back to that. I think it\u2019s a great example of how we\u2019re able to penetrate and not be reliant on the resale market. In terms of our ability to go back \u2013 I\u2019ll give you an example, again, without getting into too much detail, mining for the data for those customers that haven\u2019t bought paint in a while for customers based on a certain demographic that we know are more likely or a certain region that are more likely to reengage in the category. Mentioned earlier, our team, something that really differentiates us in this space is we\u2019ve got 1,500 graduates every year that really own the P&L in their store, and they are hunting for this exact customer. So a lot of respect for the people out that are building these relationships and making sure that whether it\u2019s a homeowner or a contractor making sure that we\u2019re being very surgical in terms of how we approach these really important customers. Jim Jaye : And I\u2019d add one thing to that as well, Ghansham, what you\u2019re seeing with the softness in existing home sales as an extended period what we\u2019re seeing is people can\u2019t wait. So that\u2019s driving them to new res. And I think that\u2019s also supporting some of the new res business. And as we\u2019ve spoken many times about our business as a table, whichever way the market may tilt. I think it\u2019s a great example as John walked through new res, telling you how well prepared and how much value we bring in that area as these folks simply can\u2019t find a home to move into because the inventory is so low, we\u2019re going to go new build, and we\u2019re right there. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. And then for my second question, on PCG, several categories seem to have been impacted by destocking across the various regions. Where are we in that process, do you think? You give some comments on packaging? What about the other major verticals? Thanks. John Morikis : Well, I would like to talk about packaging because if there is one, Ghansham, that fits your description there, it would be packaging. We\u2019ve got customers working through softer demand and overstock. And as we see that continue. It\u2019s likely going to continue through Q3, perhaps even Q4. But we feel really confident. This is a strong team with a growing position with great technology. We talked about this V70 unique technology that is really fantastic, and we hear it from our customers. It\u2019s a plug and play. It\u2019s really highly efficient is superior in its ability to keep flavor protection of the product, next-gen non-BPA. It\u2019s just a fantastic product, and it\u2019s been very well received by our customers. So we\u2019ve got confidence in this business. It\u2019s just going to be bumpy. And while we have high expectations, we often push hard. We also have to be realistic with our team. So we\u2019re feeling good there. When you look at the rest of the businesses inside our PCG business, we mentioned it\u2019s bumpy. We\u2019ve got some that might be more resilient as others. We talked about auto refinish. This is a team that\u2019s really hitting on all cylinders, unintended that is really leveraging the technology combination from Valspar and Sherwin together, along with the platform of stores. Many people think about stores through our architectural Paint Stores Group, but we bring the same value through our automotive stores direct to customer, and we are really growing business there as well. Our general industrial business is one that is kind of a mixed bag. If you look at areas such as large ag and construction is doing well, where building products and general finishing is soft. So when you look at this business, and you look around wherever you are right now, the office, every sub-state that you see likely is one of two businesses, general industrial or industrial wood and our businesses there offer a terrific opportunity, but they are going to be a little bit bumpy. In Coil, I would say we had a decrease in Coil, largely driven by Europe and Asia. North America is holding up a little bit better than other regions. But again, it\u2019s a team that\u2019s bringing a unique responsiveness to customers\u2019 needs in a way that help us grow market share even in a down market. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you so much. John Morikis : Thank you, Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan Securities. Your line is live. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Is it fair to say that in the first half, raw materials were down by a low to mid-single-digit rate? And in the second half as a base case they should be down by a high single-digit rate. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Jeff, I would say you are correct, maybe not quite high single digit on the second half, but close to it. Yes. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Al Mistysyn : Third quarter, actually, it will be up our high \u2013 it will be the best improvement year-over-year. Jeff Zekauskas : Would be the highest, yes. And as a base case, for 2024, when you look across your businesses, do you expect your general level of prices to be higher or lower or flat? Al Mistysyn : Sitting here today, Jeff. We continue to talk about our pricing and our ability to maintain pricing as the raw materials moderate because of the solutions that we drive. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to talk about incremental pricing for 2024. We have \u2013 we look at the total input cost basket to determine if we need a price or don\u2019t need a price. And as you know, any price discussions we have we\u2019d have them with our customers first then talk to the Street. So we have time to talk about 2024 over the next quarter and half quarters. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Great. Thank you, so much. John Morikis : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. John, Al, how should we think about second half earnings in terms of the cadence between Q3 and Q4? Al Mistysyn : Yes. David, I mean, when you look at the earnings, as John and Heidi talked about, our visibility and demand, which is going to drive our performance through the second half is limited. So we have a better line of sight in our third quarter than our second quarter. We\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t give EPS or fourth quarter. We don\u2019t give EPS guidance, but a couple of other things I would note, I do expect to see a seasonal slowdown in architectural in our fourth quarter, which will impact our gross margin as it historically has done. So I believe this is a year that is the second half more what I would say, typical than some of the last 3 years. But our third quarter is typically a stronger quarter, and I\u2019d expect that to continue. David Begleiter : Very good. And John, one of your competitors announced a couple of homebuilder wins over the last few months. Why do you think they won that business and you may have lost that business? And overall, how is the competitive landscape in that portion of the business? Thank you. John Morikis : Yes. Thanks for that. I\u2019d start with every single customer is important to us, everyone. I also think it\u2019s important that you understand how we think to us, we play every day in the world series. And we want to sweep the series. We want to win every single game. But we\u2019re also realist. We\u2019re not going to expect every one of our pictures to throw a perfect game were to win every game is a shut out. But I\u2019ll tell you this, I believe we have the best team, the best resources and great momentum. So even if our competitors score an occasional run or if our pictures throw up occasional ball here or there, we\u2019re not going to panic. We\u2019ve got, we believe, the right team will sweep the series. And we\u2019re out there right now. We believe if you look at that top 100 builders and the penetration that we have, we\u2019re growing it and growing it aggressively, and we expect that to continue. And we\u2019re doing that at all our competitors\u2019 expense. We just don\u2019t choose to talk about it. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. John Morikis : You bet. Heidi Petz : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Mike Sison : Hi, guys. Nice quarter. With the third quarter volumes potentially being down, do you think things are bottoming as I think about the fourth quarter volumes look like they could be flattish to maybe even up? And then \u2013 and how do you think about 24% volume growth next year? Do you think it\u2019s \u2013 we could be in a position to start growing again? John Morikis : Yes. Mike, take one more run at that question here, maybe I missed. Mike Sison : Yes, I guess for quarter. I guess I\u2019m trying to understand if you think things are bottoming here in the third and then potential for volume growth for the total entity maybe into the fourth quarter and into 2024? John Morikis : Yes. I think that\u2019s a challenge answer. I\u2019d say if you look at new residential, we\u2019re suggesting that we\u2019ve outperformed, for example, in new residential and that we expect the balance of the year to be a little bumpier. Housing starts are starting to come back, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, but even homes that are they break ground today, it\u2019s likely going to be for the future likely next year before we start painting those. And so I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019d say we\u2019re probably bouncing around here a little bit. We will see what happens. But our approach has been right now that as the market is soft, our goal is to outperform it. And going forward between Q3 and Q4 gallons, I\u2019d say it\u2019s likely going to trend about where we are. Al Mistysyn : Yes. I think on if you look at we said projected to be flat to low single digits. But when you look at the dollars, sequentially, they are pretty close. And that\u2019s with new res declining more in our third quarter than we expected in our fourth quarter, which tells you we have some strength in our other segments that John and Heidi talked about, and it\u2019s going up against the 21.5% comp last year. So when you think about the second half, Paint Stores Group has a tough comp, I\u2019d say the other segments, as we talked about, are choppy, and it\u2019s by business, by region. I think some businesses in certain regions have bottomed out. I think there is still challenges that we see in Asia Pacific. But as an example, Europe in our second half, we expect to do better than what we did in the first half. 2024, that\u2019s a whole different discussion that we will have as we get into January on our year-end call. Heidi Petz : One piece I would add to that, I think, is just an indicator of the strength of the backlog. I think if you look at stronger and more solid backlogs across commercial property maintenance and PNM. And I would also say it\u2019s not just the backlog, it\u2019s the way in which we\u2019re interacting with these customers. We\u2019re close to these customers than we\u2019ve ever been before, which is a large part based on our controlled distribution model, but it\u2019s also based on coming out of the last few years of a lot of challenges. I think we\u2019ve all essentially become better planners together. So those backlogs our component, but also our closeness to the customer, gives me a lot of confidence in the outlook. Mike Sison : Got it. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to follow-up on that last point as far as backlog. Could you potentially provide us with some backlogs across maybe some of the different market segments that you\u2019re seeing in PSG? I know when you started out the year, you noted that there was quite a few jobs still in the backlog on the new side through the first half, but then it really kind of limited after that. So how would you characterize the backlog now, if you can provide a little bit more granularity on that? Thanks. John Morikis : Yes, Arun, I\u2019d say I\u2019ll jump in here. I think if you look at the points that Heidi is making, I think there is two points. You\u2019re asking one very good question, but there is another element here that I want to tie to this. One is if you look across the various segments and say, okay, commercial, we see strong residential repaint, a little bit choppier with resales, but we can see out 6 to 8 months property maintenance strong. DIY has been strong, but it\u2019s on a softer comps, so we don\u2019t expect that to continue. I think all of those are opportunities for us to continue to grow market share, and we will. The other point, though, that I think she\u2019s talking \u2013 that she spoke to that I think is important is coming through COVID and in the shortage we\u2019ve worked much closer with our customers in ways that, quite honestly, I wish I would have had that opportunity when I was in a store. We\u2019re now working collaboratively with what projects are taking place now, what\u2019s next, even to the point where if it rains, my fallback is this position. And the fact that we\u2019ve got our reps and our stores out there, close to the backlog and close with our customers closer than ever before is a terrific advantage that we\u2019re trying to leverage. So by segment, I would say, yes, we see new residential likely to slow down a little bit as the slowdown works its way to the painting phase of the homes that weren\u2019t started 8 months ago. Property maintenance, we\u2019re really leveraging the fact that their CapEx money is freeing up. Our national agreements are opportunities for us and the others, as I described. So it\u2019s a good market for us because there is a lot of diversity in the market, and that\u2019s what we thrive on. Arun Viswanathan : That\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up on the raw material side. Could you just maybe provide us with some idea of what you\u2019ve been procuring at in the second quarter? I would imagine it\u2019s maybe down mid to high single digits. And does that flow through, I guess, in the second half? And have you seen any declines in TiO2 as well? Or do you expect any of those? Thanks. Jim Jaye : Yes, Arun. So our raw material basket in the second quarter was down in that high single-digit range. And what was really driving that deflation for us, as you might expect, is the petrochemical side of the basket, resins, in solvents, even plastic packaging, the decline in some of the key feedstocks such as propylene, it\u2019s now flowing through into the things that we\u2019re buying, and we expect that to continue \u2013 this is a cycle that we\u2019ve seen many times over the years. With regard to TiO2, your question there, those costs are still a little bit elevated for us, but we expect to see them starting to trend in a more positive direction as the year goes on. Some of the key input costs on TiO2 are elevated right now, chlorine being one of the main ones. And I\u2019d also say some suppliers are also trying to manage their capacity a little bit more tightly. But with demand soft here, you\u2019re going to see or we believe we\u2019re going to see and expect to see some decreases in the TiO2 pricing. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Jim Jaye : You bet. John Morikis : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. I was hoping you could help us just triangulate a little bit. When you look at the midpoint of your guide, what it implies is the back half versus the first half this year is going to be down 22% on EPS. But when you look at the last 7 years, the average is for that to be up 6%, and it\u2019s been up 5 of the 7 years. So when you add to that the raw materials should be better in the second half versus the first. I just have a hard time triangulating that new resi will be a big enough negative to take the earnings down on a sequential basis, first half to second half. So, could you just talk through what else might be negative first half to second half? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Duffy, I mean it starts with that sales outlook down mid-single digit from \u2013 for second half versus first half. Less price would be in that, so we have got a nice tailwind in the first half for price that helped drive our operating \u2013 our gross margin. And so you also see a lower volume, specifically in consumer and in our Performance Coatings Group. So I think as you would expect, you are going to get lower gross profit dollars. I do still expect gross margin expansion in our second half, not quite as good as year-over-year anyway that we saw in our first half because of our comps. And then you do get some help on the raw material reduction, but that is partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption in our second half due to lower production volumes. I think SG&A, even we talked about SG&A in the opening and being more aggressive at adding investments for our long-term growth strategy, both in stores, reps, field tech service reps. And the final piece these non-operating costs that I would call out that were \u2013 are probably going to be an incremental $60 million to $70 million headwind versus our first half because some of the gains that we had on sale of assets and marketable securities. So, I think those are the things that are driving that sequential movement. Duffy Fischer : Okay. And then just, again, if we ever get back to normal, whatever that is, do you still believe that your structural footprint is the second half earnings profile is better than the first half earnings profile for the company? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Duffy, I will try to go back to a normal year, 2019. So, to your point, I am not sure what normal is. But I think as we continue to see growth in our Performance Coatings Group, that\u2019s less seasonal. You might not see as big of an increase in our second half versus our first half as we move forward. But if we get back to the way Paint Stores Group brand, our consumer business brands and yes, you should typically see that. John Morikis : Okay. I guess I would just add on to the investment strategy that Al mentioned. We are a 157-year-old company. We are not trying to run the company for a perfect quarter here. We have got confidence in our strategy. It\u2019s a proven strategy with proven leadership team, through a proven and growing asset base in stores and in the facilities that we are running. So, to Al\u2019s point, we are going to invest into that. And we played a long game here. We know what we are doing. And quite frankly, we are going to do more of it. Duffy Fischer : Perfect. Thank you, guys. John Morikis : Thank you, Duffy. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman & Associates. Your line is live. Adam Baumgarten : Hey. Good afternoon guys. Just curious if you could give an update on the Pros Who Paint business and how that\u2019s been trending? Heidi Petz : Yes, good question, Adam. I think there is a lot of growing \u2013 certainly growing interest here as it relates to how we are partnering with our strategic retail partners and certainly the investment that\u2019s following that with a lot of confidence and growth to be gained there. And I won\u2019t get into a lot of the details because I think those are certainly for our retailer partners to share. But I can tell you that the level of collaboration an alignment from the planning standpoint, certainly understanding how the calendar lays out, laying in key events throughout the year, making sure that the data is aligned, that the reps are aligned, that the structures are aligned. It\u2019s \u2013 we are just getting started to hear and we have got a lot of confidence in where this can go. Adam Baumgarten : Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just if you could discuss some of the simplification efforts you are making across the enterprise and kind of the timeline there and the impacts you ultimately expect that to have on the business? Heidi Petz : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I will tell you that, that\u2019s going to be a journey onto itself. So, when you think about it, how we are kind of broadly defining this is truly looking end to end. Al mentioned this earlier, where we are looking to bring some efficiencies, certainly with our global supply chain team. Al mentioned the Performance Coatings Group, I would say true for all groups and for our supply chain as well, really understanding all the way from the raw materials you asked \u2013 the question was asked earlier, Jim mentioned how we are thinking about procurement in general. The conversations that we are having are I would say a lot more detailed relative to the sub-supplier level and making sure that when we step back and look at our supplier strategy, there is a distinction between strategic suppliers and transactional suppliers. So, we are having those very important conversations at the front end. And then if I take you all the way through, Al mentioned our rationalization efforts that are underway. But as you can imagine, as we simplify the basket, and continue the rationalization efforts from a customer-facing standpoint, it puts us in a much more optimized and efficient standpoint from an operational manufacturing logistics. And so there is a lot of milestones that the team is setting forward here. This will be a multiyear journey, as I mentioned, but I would expect that we will see some customer-facing updates as it relates to how we can compete with a more aggressive portfolio of products here in the short run. And then you will see that continue to show up to the bottom line as we move faster and faster towards automation and the like. Al Mistysyn : The only thing I would add to that, Adam, is we talk about efficiencies, but we also are focused on these efforts to increase our capacity so that we are not having to put capital back into capacity and then also looking at opportunities for working capital reduction. So, John talked about the divestitures and part of our capital allocation philosophy, it\u2019s really a strong and focus on delivering cash generation back to our targets that we laid out and also how we utilize our \u2013 best utilize our assets. Adam Baumgarten : Thanks. Best of luck. John Morikis : Thank you, Adam. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is live. Josh Spector : Yes. Hi. So, just a follow-up on working capital and specifically inventory. So, I mean your inventory stepped down a few million \u2013 a few hundred million sequentially. Just curious if you would say you have your volumes of inventory at the right level for what you are expecting in terms of second half volumes or if you are continuing to destock that inventory through the year, and really what that means for your expectations for working capital for 2023? Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Sure, Josh. As typically is the case as we get into the summer selling season, we will see a sequential decrease in our inventory gains, as you mentioned. I think you will see a sequential decrease in our third quarter, which is also typical. And then we will build inventory back in our fourth quarter to our targeted numbers that are similar to prior \u2013 similar to last year, but to more historic levels. So, I feel very good about where our inventories are at today. That being said, we will adjust production through the second half to maintain that targeted year-end inventory. I don\u2019t want to get us too far ahead going into next year. So, we will monitor demand trends closely and adjust production schedules accordingly. We will try to push that working capital back towards our target by year-end of 11.5%. I think that\u2019s going to be a little difficult considering accounts payables because of the lower production is what\u2019s driving our increase over that 13%. But we will get that working capital back towards the target of 11%, 11.5% going forward. Josh Spector : Okay. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Josh. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is live. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. This 10%, roughly increase in SG&A that you are expecting for the year. Can you talk a little bit about what exactly is driving that? Is that underlying wages? Is it variable comp to incentivize aggressive effort in sales? Is that headcount? Is it something else? Is it a digital app? What would you say is driving that? What are the primary buckets driving a 10% increase in SG&A? John Morikis : Yes. Steve, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in our best interest to lay out exactly where our investments are to be truthful with you. I would say that we have a proven leadership team. We have been at this for a long time. We see opportunities, and we invest. And many of the topics that you brought up are areas of investment. So, yes, we are going to invest in securing our people, the retention of our people, the training of our people. We are going to add reps through our stores and through other channels that are important to us. We are investing in innovation and digital. We are not going to get into any specifics deeper than that. But we believe \u2013 and quite frankly, we are very proud that when we make an investment that our shareholders can count on a return, and we have demonstrated the discipline to be able to do that. Steve Byrne : And then on your cost structure, Al, if I heard you right, I think you have indicated low-single digit deflation in raw material costs. And I believe that was not current purchases, but what flowed through COGS in the second quarter, is there something else that was a meaningful change year-over-year in cost structure like freight or logistics or something because your gross profit increased year-over-year, significantly more than revenue. There seems to be maybe something else in there other than just low single-digit raws. Al Mistysyn : Let me ask Steve, if we had better than those, low-single digit raw in the second quarter. If that\u2019s what I said, that wasn\u2019t correct. We had more like high-single digit reduction in raw material costs. And what I said is the offset \u2013 partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption because we had lower production volumes in the second quarter, mainly because we had to rebuild inventories last year, and we didn\u2019t have to redo that. So, we are at a more typical production schedule this year than last year. So, that\u2019s maybe what the little bit of a headwind would have been in the quarter versus raw material benefits. John Morikis : With a more optimized supply chain this year versus last year, Steve, last year, literally, we were taking raws wherever we could make them or get them manufacturing paint and sending it to customers wherever they needed it. And we absorbed that into our margin. But I think again, it speaks to the commitment we make to our customers and why they can count on us. Steve Byrne : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Steve. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Patrick Cunningham from Citi. Your line is live. Patrick Cunningham : Great. Thank you. You talked about the fixed cost drag from lower production volumes. How much lower are utilization rates versus historical levels? And if the recent uptrend maybe in housing starts or commercial and property hangs in there, do you expect to bump up to historic high utilization rates in 2024 and perhaps even pre-build more additional inventory in 4Q? Thank you. John Morikis : Patrick, we don\u2019t talk about capacity utilization. I will tell you this that we have added some capacity. So, we have got the ability to be more responsive to our customers\u2019 needs. When we talked about taking working capital down, Al\u2019s comments about getting down in that 11.5% range, we have confidence in our ability to do that. While improving service to our customers as we go through the simplification efforts that Heidi is leading to the company on the operational side as well as the capacity that we have. Patrick Cunningham : Great. Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks Patrick. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc. Your line is live. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks. I just had one question. On DIY, you have easy comps in the first half, getting to harder comps in the second half. What is the underlying trend here for your business and the market overall? Is it sequentially still decelerating, improving or stable? Heidi Petz : I will start with that. I think if you look at DIY and our Paint Stores Group, I give you a slightly different response versus what we are seeing in the rest of our business and largely based on the premise that there is a slightly different segment and a customer that\u2019s looking for more service that want more of that specialty paint store experience. So, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing traffic up in our stores. I think the challenge on the softness and you will see this on the consumer brand side as well. We have gotten back into a strong position of inventory. You will see some more promotional activity that\u2019s been happening in an effort to drive traffic. But still continue to see some of that softness coming in the current state, at least through the balance of the year. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks a lot. John Morikis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is live. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good afternoon. In your consumer business, can you speak to the outlook for repair and remodeling activity. And given that backdrop, do you expect your market share among Pros Who Paint to rise or fall or stay about the same over the next year or so? John Morikis : We expect our market share to grow. And if you look at what\u2019s happening from a Lyra standpoint, predictions on what\u2019s going to happen right now, I would say, there is a slowing in the remodel business, but the truth be told is that this is an opportunity for us. In our business, there are a lot of people that talk about percentages and might most large percentage increases on a relatively small business. And quite frankly, this is a new and growing opportunity for us. So, the dollars are not where we believe they can be percentage-wise, we have significant increases, and we expect those increases to continue as we partner with our customers who are interested in growing this. And importantly, I think to understand the strategy here, there are customers, particularly those that paint as a part of their project that prefer a home center model. Some of those customers might find their way into our stores. And a natural question is the concern about cannibalization. We are not concerned with that. We will gladly put that share of business up, knowing that there is a significant opportunity for us to grow with our partners to pursue the remodeler, if you will, who is using paint on a project. So, yes, it\u2019s going to grow. We are focused on it with our customers, and we are determines\u2019 group combined. So, we expect positive growth. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Thank you for that John. And secondly, if I may, perhaps for Al, it appears as though your 2023 CapEx outlook declined by $100 million to $700 million. Why is that, is that a function of timing or any meaningful changes to the project roster? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Kevin, it\u2019s all related to timing. We are still moving forward with the Statesville expansion that we had talked about earlier this year. We are still moving forward with the warehouse automation projects that we had talked about and continued driving the packaging capacity expansions that we talked about. So, it\u2019s just timing and with a better line of sight to the second half we thought we would update that number. Kevin McCarthy : Perfect. Thank you so much. John Morikis : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global. Your line is live. Mike Harrison : Hi. Good afternoon. You have completed a handful of acquisitions and you are integrating those in the Performance Coatings business. Can you just give us an update on how you are seeing those operating and commercial synergies progressing on some of the key deals that you have completed? Heidi Petz : Yes. Mike, it\u2019s a great question. I think there is a whole host of acquisitions John mentioned earlier. And I would say the team is laser focused on, first and foremost, making sure that these integrations are seamless to the customer. We are very focused on the integration at the team level. I think when you look at some of our \u2013 the acquisitions that have been around technologies, and our ability to quickly \u2013 the tech transfer has been an area of focus so that we are able to get those products outside of one necessary region and in some cases, moving across the country or moving them across globally. So, we are really focused on making sure we are getting the value capture out of some of these and the synergies that we know are there. But there is a lot of great work being done by the teams to make sure that we are keeping our customers focused on a fuller assortment in a fuller portfolio of choices based on these acquisitions. Mike Harrison : Alright. And then you mentioned in the consumer business that you were seeing some stabilization in Europe. I was hoping that you could maybe provide a little more detail on what you are seeing there and maybe what your expectations look like for the second half in Europe, both in terms of demand and as you think about the price/cost front? John Morikis : You are talking about on the consumer side in Europe? Mike Harrison : Consumer in Europe, yes. John Morikis : Yes. So first, to capture this, it\u2019s a relatively small percentage of our overall business. It\u2019s \u2013 we are proud of our relationship there. We play a kind of a niche role, if you will, in intended paint through the Valspar brand this came to us with our acquisition. We have got a terrific relationship that we are interested in growing. And I would say the momentum that we have is good, and we are excited about it. Heidi Petz : One of that too, just based on some of the economic recovery, the stability that we are seeing coming in, and I think it\u2019s playing to our favor based on this tented program that\u2019s unique in a lot of these countries. Mike Harrison : Thanks very much. John Morikis : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Your line is live. John Roberts : Thank you. Could you just remind us how big U.S. new resi is as a percent of total sales? And even though your paint doesn\u2019t get applied until completion, I think you bid it closer to the start. So, what\u2019s the \u2013 can you quantify at all what the bidding activity has been or the backlog? John Morikis : John, new residential is a mid-teens percentage of our Paint Stores Group. And we don\u2019t bid house, John. We quote our customers on a regular basis, and those are fluid discussions that we have with our customers. So, it varies by customer, the timing of any agreements that we have, and we just work closely with our customers to ensure that they have as much lead time to any adjustments to pricing as possible. John Roberts : Okay. Even the largest homebuilders? John Morikis : Even the largest. John Roberts : Thank you. John Morikis : Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your line is live. Eric Bosshard : Clarity on two things if you could, first of all, on raws. The 5 to 9 full year, what was the first half of raw material? John Morikis : Yes. The first half, I would say our second half is going to be better than our first half, Eric. In the first quarter, it was a pretty modest. If you remember, we said it was a pretty modest deflation. It got better. I mentioned sort of high-single digit range in the second quarter. It will be better in the second half with probably the third quarter, probably the peak year-over-year benefit. Eric Bosshard : And then secondly, relative to the original guidance, is the increase relative to what you thought the year would look like, is that even between the first half and second half, or is that more first half loaded? John Morikis : Yes. Eric, I would say it\u2019s more first half loaded. And as we talked about, we expected a strong first half and demand, as we again talked about was stronger in our first half. So, it\u2019s more first half loaded. Eric Bosshard : Okay. And then is there anything different that makes it more first half loaded, or is there \u2013 I understand the comparisons, the comparisons existed and there were comparisons in the first half as well. I mean is there something that makes \u2013 creates more benefit in the first half than the second half? Al Mistysyn : Yes. The comparisons are better. We get more price tailwind in our first half and even with that within admin, we had some gains on sale assets and stuff like that, that maybe helped us $0.05 in the second quarter. But yes, the comps are going to get steeper. And then it\u2019s the outlook on the choppy demand environment. And I would say that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see a bigger tailwind in our second half plus the investments we are making for future growth. Eric Bosshard : Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. John Morikis : Thank you, Eric. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Your line is live. Garik Shmois : Hi. Thank you. Just want to follow-up on the strength you are seeing in commercial within Paint Stores Group. It runs a little bit contrary to some of the macro that\u2019s been a bit choppier on commercial. So, I am just wondering how much of that is maybe share gains versus a particular vertical that you have been over exposing yourselves to? John Morikis : We do believe we are gaining share there. It\u2019s a great opportunity again to highlight this controlled distribution. The approach that we take has been grounded in the focus on the applicator on the specifier and the owner through a distribution platform that is first class. And so our reps are working hand-in-hand with our customers. I would say that many of our customers would see our reps almost as part of their team. And the more challenging the market, the more valuable that sales rep is and the facilities that we build to service those needs. So, yes, I think we are growing share. I think there is a good \u2013 really good momentum through the balance of the year, rolling into next year. From there, as I mentioned earlier, while we are not waiting for the business that \u2013 to finish up, we are very focused on those sub-segments that I mentioned earlier that are a bit more resilient that we are focused on to continue the momentum. Garik Shmois : Okay. Thanks. And I wanted to follow-up on resi repaint, you talked about contractor visibility and backlog several times. I just wonder if you could put that in context, is the visibility in backlog that you are hearing from your contractor customers. Are these back to more normalized levels at this point, or are we still running below normal given some of the headwinds over the last several quarters? Heidi Petz : I would say they are back to more normalized levels. I think you will see, depending on the size of the resi repaint contractor, some that are willing to take on more and have the labor and the support and the resources to do that and some that are smaller in size and that might be more governed by shortage in labor. We are really trying to intercept them at that point and help them focus on how they can be as productive as possible. So, everything from our product assortment to our tools to our reps and how we are engaging these contractors, making sure that when they are on the job site, they are as productive as possible, how they bid, how they quote, how they get paid. So, really trying to help them from an entire business standpoint, regardless of the maturity of their size. Garik Shmois : Got it. Thanks again. John Morikis : Thanks Garik. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Jim Jaye : I want to thank everybody again for joining our call today. I hope you heard come through loud and clear. Our team is aligned and committed to growing our business profitably, but we are also going to invest in growth and customer-facing initiatives. That\u2019s going to drive our success and our customer success over the long-term. I will remind you that our annual Financial Community Presentation is going to be held here in Cleveland on August 24th. In addition to John, Heidi and Al, you are going to hear directly from our group presidents at the event, and they are looking forward to sharing their plans in each of those operating groups. And you will hear how they are planning to execute and drive those businesses forward as we described on much of the call today. You can register for that event on our website, and we look forward to seeing you at that event. So, thank you again for your interest in Sherwin. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : Thank you everyone. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company's review of third quarter 2023 Results and our Outlook for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2023.  This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com beginning approximately 2 hours after this conference call concludes.  This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.  I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. James Jaye : Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Joining me on the call today are John Morikis, Chairman and CEO; Heidi Petz, President and Chief Operating Officer; Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; and Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President of Enterprise Finance.  Sherwin-Williams delivered excellent third quarter results compared to the same period a year ago. These results follow our strong first half, and we are again increasing our full year guidance, which John will talk about in just a few minutes. But first, let me touch on a few third quarter highlights. Consolidated net sales were within our guidance range. Consolidated gross margin expanded significantly sequentially and year-over-year driven by pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs.  To reiterate our commentary from last quarter, we are committed to investing in and profitably growing the business at the same time. The high single-digit increase in SG&A over the prior year third quarter reflects those investments, which are deliberately being made at a higher level to take advantage of current market uncertainty and are aimed at driving the success of our customers and growth across all businesses.  Operating margin expanded year-over-year and adjusted diluted net income per share grew by a double-digit percentage. EBITDA also grew by a double-digit percentage with adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.7% near the high end of our current 19% to 21% target range.  In addition, we returned $566 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.  Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our third quarter results by segment. John will follow Heidi with comments on our outlook before we move on to your questions. Heidi Petz : Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group. Third quarter Paint Stores Group sales increased 3.6% against the challenging 21.5% comp. The increase was driven by continued effective pricing and higher Pro architectural volume, excluding New Residential. Segment margin improved sequentially and year-over-year to 25.9%, driven by pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs.  Protective & Marine was the fastest growing in the quarter, driven by strong volume as sales increased by a double-digit percentage against the mid-teens comparison. Industrial flooring, infrastructure and oil and gas applications remain key drivers. In our Pro architectural end markets commercial sales were strongest, increasing by a high single-digit percentage versus a high teens comparison.  Residential repaint sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage amid continued softness in existing home sales and against a 20% comparison. While this is a solid performance in the current environment, we are not satisfied, and res repaint continues to be our largest opportunity for growth. Property maintenance sales grew by a low single-digit percentage against a mid-20s comparison. New Residential sales were down mid-single digits with volume down high single digits against the mid-20s comparison. As we've previously noted, we anticipated New Residential would be challenging near term, given prior softness in single-family starts. We expect our continued share gains and new account wins to become more and more apparent as starts improve. Our DIY business was down low single digits against a very difficult low 30s comparison.  From a product perspective, interior paint sales were up low single digits and exterior paint sales were flat, both against double-digit comparisons in last year's third quarter. Sales in our Consumer Brands Group decreased by 4% in the quarter, primarily due to the divestiture of the China architectural business and softer DIY demand in North America, which was partially offset by selling price increases.  Sales in North America, our largest region, decreased by a mid-single-digit percentage against a double-digit comparison. The Pros Who Paint category continued to grow, while DIY demand remained muted by inflationary pressures on consumers. We continue to invest here with our strategic retail partners for growth.  In other regions, sales were up high single digits in Latin America and low double digits in Europe. Sales in China were down high double digits as we completed divestiture of the business on August 1.  Adjusted segment margin was 13.8%, which was lower than a year ago, primarily due to lower sales volume and lower fixed cost absorption due to lower production volumes.  Sales in the Performance Coatings Group decreased 1% against a low teens comparison. Volume decreased by a high single-digit percentage, but was partially offset by positive low single-digit contribution from pricing, FX and acquisitions. Adjusted segment margin increased to 19.1% of sales, primarily due to pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs. Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. Sales were strongest in Europe and increased by a mid-teens percentage. Latin America sales increased by low single digits against a mid-teens comp. North America sales decreased mid-single digits against a 20% comp. Demand in Asia remained weak, with sales down double digits against high single-digit growth a year ago. From a division perspective, growth was strongest in our Industrial Wood business, which was up by a low double-digit percentage against a mid-single-digit comparison. This growth reflects our ICA acquisition, share gains and a potential bottoming of New Residential construction. We expect to gain further momentum in this business. As we closed October 1st on the previously announced acquisition of Germany-based specialized industrial coatings holding comprised of the Oskar Nolte and Klumpp Coatings businesses.  We are gaining share and seeing steady demand in Auto Refinish, where sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage against a high single-digit comparison. Sales in Coil and General Industrial both decreased by low single-digit percentages against challenging comparisons and vary widely by region.  Packaging sales were down by a mid-teens percentage against the high single-digit comparison. We anticipated this decline given the near-term destocking by brand owners that we described earlier this year. Packaging sales in the quarter were also slightly impacted by the fire at our Garland, Texas plant. Our business continuity team is executing our contingency plans to minimize customer impacts from this event near term. Longer term, we continue to feel very good about our position and growth prospects in this end market, and we expect to bring additional capacity online at our , France plant by early 2024.  With that, let me turn it to John for his comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the year. John Morikis : Thank you, Heidi. Our team delivered another strong quarter in an environment characterized by ongoing uncertainty. My thanks go to our 64,000 employees for continuing to focus on our mission and for executing on our strategy. Their energy in serving our customers and providing them with solutions remains a true differentiator.  On our July call, we described the anticipated second half demand backdrop across our businesses. The third quarter played out much as we expected, and we believe the environment remains largely unchanged in the fourth quarter. Paint Stores Group will face another strong year-over-year comparison. Demand in commercial, property maintenance, residential repaint and Protective & Marine remains stable with New Residential remaining soft as we expected. We have now annualized prior price increases.  In Consumer Brands, North America DIY demand remained soft. Europe demand has stabilized and Latin America markets remain mixed. Performance Coatings demand remains highly variable by end market and by region. We know we cannot defy gravity in terms of the macro environment. What we can do is aggressively pursue new account and share of wallet opportunities to drive market share gains, we are aggressively focused on doing just that.  Moving to the cost side. We're narrowing our full year raw material outlook. We expect cost to be down by a high single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect other costs, including wages and other input costs to be up in the mid- to high single-digit range. We also continue to see the current market uncertainty as an opportunity to press our advantages through greater investment in solutions for our customers that will drive their success and ours. Our SG&A spend in the fourth quarter will reflect these investments, leading full year SG&A to increase in the high single-digit to low double-digit range compared to last year. This approach has served us well many times in the past. We are highly confident and will again now resulting in continued above-market growth and strong returns.  Now moving on to our specific guidance. We anticipate our fourth quarter 2023 consolidated net sales will be up or down a low single-digit percentage compared to a high single-digit increase in the fourth quarter of 2022, with volume flat to down slightly. As a reminder, we've largely annualized previous price increases across the business.  For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be up a low single-digit percentage with volume down a low single-digit percentage. Our sales expectations by segment for the fourth quarter and the full year are included in the slide deck issued with our press release this morning. We are increasing our full year 2023 diluted net income per share to be in the range of $9.21 to $9.41 per share. We believe this increased range accurately reflects our strong third quarter performance, continued pricing discipline and moderating raw material costs while also acknowledging the ongoing uncertainty in our seasonally smaller fourth quarter. This guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.80 per share and restructuring related net expense of $0.09 per share.  On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $10.10 to $10.30. This is an increase of 16.8% at the midpoint compared to last year's $8.73 adjusted earnings per share. We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. Our slide deck includes additional information on our assumptions for the year.  As we begin the fourth quarter, we continue to expect choppiness by region and end market. More importantly, we continue to see opportunity amid uncertainty, and we are extremely confident in how well our various businesses are positioned. Our strategy is clear. It's working, and it's not changing. We'll continue to provide our customers with differentiated solutions that drive their productivity and their profitability.  Our capabilities, products and services are unique. We remain on offense, growing new accounts and share of wallet in the right markets with the right customers. We also remain focused on developing and retaining talent and improving and simplifying our operations. We expect to finish the year with momentum that will carry us into 2024. I have the utmost confidence in Heidi, Al, our leadership team and our people. Together, we expect to continue outperforming our competitors and the market.  This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from John McNulty from BMO. John McNulty : And first, John, congratulations on a great tenure in the CEO slot. And Heidi best of luck to you as you take on that role at the end of the year.  So I guess the first thing I wanted to just touch on was the strength of the contractor market. Can you give us a little bit of color as to what you're seeing, especially in the residential repaint area. It looks like it's been maybe a little bit stronger than what we would have expected. So just curious your take on how to think about that continuing going forward. Heidi Petz : Yes. I think you make a great point here. I want to take a minute before I jump right into res repaint, which I absolutely will and just put this a bit in perspective. You heard from some of our prepared remarks that when we look at our performance in general, and we're posting some stronger results up against really aggressive comps last year. I think that's an important piece that we anchor in as I get into the res repaints. repaint certainly New Res being up against over 20% comps here and still in this environment, continuing to post. So we're really proud of the team to be able to overcome some of that.  So I think if I just jump right into Res repaint, I'll let you know that yes, we are gaining share in this market. Demand does vary depending on a few variables. I think if you look at this and separate a bit, those contractors that are more established and well-known and are more experienced in marketing their business, they've got the scale and they're confident in their backlog. I would say that's more so true for them than those that have less experience being able to put that type of focus on in marketing their business.  So I'd say there's a bit of a variance there. But we look at this importantly. The adversity that these contractors are facing in this choppiness is also an opportunity where I believe that it makes our stores and our reps even more valuable as we're helping them navigate through a lot of this uncertainty and helping to intercept what it is that they're trying to accomplish in their business, whether it's leads or making sure that we're helping them finding ways to be more efficient in their process.  So I think if we've seen this movie before, we're ready for what's ahead. We're putting investments in. John referenced earlier in the SG&A that you see, and I'll take you back. We saw this coming in 2008 and 2009. And making sure that what came out of that was our desire to be well positioned and New Residential does recover, that we've got all the investments in place here to continue to drive res repaint. So this is an opportunity where, where and I would say when, our model stands out and when we're able to gain a lot of share. John McNulty : Got it. Fair enough. And I guess the second question is just around cost versus price. It looks like raws are coming down, but you've highlighted in the remarks that other costs are definitely still pushing higher and you're also still investing in the business. So can you help us to think about the need for further pricing? I know you've taken a little bit of a pause recently as you normally do in the paint season. But I guess, how should we be thinking about the need for further pricing as you're pushing into 2024? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, John, this is Al Mistysyn. And we're in that part of the year where we're going through our operating plans. We're reviewing really demand outlook with our suppliers. I know we've gotten a lot of questions about oil ticking up, and that has to be up for a period of time before we see that flow through our raw material basket.  I think what you will see is the other cost input items increasing, I think merit increases will get back to a more normal level, but you've got health care, freight, some of the things going on with LTL carriers that are driving our overall costs up. So as we typically do, we push back and look for offsets as much as we can.  And then when we can't -- don't feel like we have an offset and we need to go out with price, we'll tell this to our customers first and, then we'll talk to the Street. So we're going through that process, and we need a little more time to figure that out, and we'll let our customers know and then we'll come back and let the street know. Operator : Your next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Wondering if I could just dig into the SG&A a bit more. Understand completely and appreciate what you're doing this year. But how do we think about that into '24, both in terms of what level of increase is realistic for next year, presumably SG&A is not going to go down, but should it grow a lot less than normal just given the big step up this year?  And then how do we think about from the outside over the next couple of years measuring the return on that? Is it simply going to come through the volume line in Paint Stores Group, or do you think it's going to be about margin or both? As we -- we're here 2 years from now, and we do a look back, what do you want us to see specifically in the P&L? John Morikis : Yes, Vincent, let me start with that last piece because I think it's really important. And again, I want to reiterate the confidence that we have in our strategy and the fact that we've seen this movie before. The investments that we're making, you will see in the P&L, and you will see in market share growth. Our teams are invested in executing on these areas. But I think another important area that's crucial that you won't be able to measure on our P&L is the success that we'll bring with our customers as well.  So if you go back to the strategy that we employ, it's focused on driving the success of our customers. And these investments that we're making will clearly help our customers in achieving what it is that their trying to do. And so I think as you look forward, the expectation should be increased market share and outpacing the market in volume and profitability as well. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Vincent, I would say certainly, as we annualize costs or the investments in our long-term growth initiatives, you're going to see that in the first part of the year. But I'd highlight, if you look at our SG&A sequentially second quarter to third quarter, even though we kept investing in Paint Stores Group and reps, Performance Coatings Group sales and tech service reps and you have investments in the Pros Who Paints. We saw those offset by reductions in our G&A costs or admin SG&A so that we're trying to figure out ways to continue to drive G&A down to offset the incremental cost of those investments.  And yes, we will absolutely measure the return. But as we get into 2024, we're going through our budgeting plan. We're going through key initiatives across each of our functional areas, and we'll keep driving both those costs lower to help pay for the incremental investments. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : I know that the year-over-year price comparisons are less positive than they've been. But when you look at sequential pricing from the second to the third quarter, were your prices down sequentially in any important product area? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Jeff, if you look at our pricing because you annualize pricing throughout each of the segments as we've gone. I know we've talked about Performance Coatings through basically, at some point, through on a 90-day cycle. So price was still up in the quarter, in the third quarter, up low single digit. But if you look at that compared to our second quarter, price would have added a mid single-digit percentage in the second quarter. So -- and as you get into our fourth quarter, you'd be at a lower single-digit impact on our fourth quarter. So that's just annualizing the price increases we've taken throughout '22. But I would argue and say, we have not given that price back. And you can see that in our gross margin performance in the second quarter, up -- 440 up in the third -- third quarter of 490 basis points, and we expect to be up again in our fourth quarter, along with the moderating raw material cost sequentially. Heidi Petz : Jeff, I would add to that as well. I think our effectiveness is at a record high, and I give the team a lot of credit because it's not just about holding it, it's about demonstrating that value every single day with our contractors. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay, great. And your raw materials were down high single digits. I would imagine they would be down low double digits in the fourth quarter, if you're going to be down high single digits for the year. And maybe the fourth quarter is sort of the bottoming of raw materials for the industry in general. Is that fair? Allen Mistysyn : Jeff, I don't know I'd go that far. As I mentioned earlier, I think we have to look at the -- market is still demand, supply driven. We're working with our suppliers to develop what does industry demand look like across each of the regions. And I think that's going to be a bigger driver of raw material pricing as we get into 2024. I think as we mentioned on our second quarter call, we expected our third quarter to be our biggest year-over-year change in raw material costs, but certainly, they're going to be down in our fourth quarter as well. Operator : Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich : I had a couple of questions. One is, how much did the volume decline year-on-year hurt gross margins in the quarter? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. I think Greg, the -- when you look at the volume decline being overall down low single digit, certainly, as I've talked about, that's always typically the biggest driver of operating margin leverage.  When you look at how that mix changes in the quarter, so we talked about Paint Stores Group being flat and then the other 2 segments being down more than that. So it was less of an impact than if Paint Stores was down similar, if that makes sense to you, because Paint Stores Group has a higher gross margin profile. Gregory Melich : So it may have hurt, but not as much as you think, given the mix of where the volume decline was? Allen Mistysyn : Correct. Gregory Melich : Okay. And then I guess my follow-up question is more specifically on architectural. Could you give us some update on what the backlog that you're hearing about or what it sounds like from the PROs, particularly in resi repaint, you mentioned how new residentials weak, but I'd love to hear more on the new res -- I'm sorry, the resi repaint side. Heidi Petz : Yes, Greg, I think on the res repaint side, it's similar to what I mentioned earlier. I think you look at -- traditionally, you're going to see somewhere between 13, 15 weeks out, I would say that, that backlog has come down by 2 or 3 weeks, so a bit more limited in terms of visibility. But outside of that, again, I would look at it in terms of the size of the contractor, the level of experience, again, ability to market themselves. They've got further out site line into '24 versus some of the other smaller contractors that are still trying to find ways to kind of build those backlog. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : I guess with the reversal high on interest rates since you last reported and just sort of building on the last question, how do you think this dynamic will play out for your 6 verticals within PSG relative to what you saw with the first iteration of interest rate increases because it seems like some of that was just dampened -- some of the impact was dampened by the fact that the backlogs were actually very strong coming into this year. John Morikis : Well, I think I'd describe it this way, that there's some uncertainty given the challenges and interest rate can have on our market. And I think Heidi and the team are really focused on one very clear mission. We're going to outpace the market. And we've got confidence in the approach that we're taking, the services that we bring to the products that we are introducing. And quite frankly, we're also taking advantage of other opportunities within the market. We've got competitors that are changing models as an example. And our simplified approach of dealing with 1 Sherwin-Williams stores as it relates to the painting contractor, we believe adds value. So the investments that we're making will enhance that on top of the organic growth that we expect from our stores. And so we're taking advantage of market conditions where Heidi just mentioned some res repaint customers that may not have had experience going through a cycle yet. They are now turning to our people for guidance and support on how do you begin advertising.  In the past, they just park their truck in front of a car -- I'm sorry, a truck in front of a house in the neighborhood and all the neighbors would flock in. They need help right now. And so they're turning to our people, and our people are playing an important role. And so when we look at what's happening with interest rates, there's some choppiness, but we also believe it creates opportunity. And we talked openly about adversity creates opportunity at Sherwin, and we're capitalizing on that. Heidi Petz : The piece I would add to that. I think New Residential specifically relative to interest rates, while the single-family completions have been flat or negative year-over-year for 8 straight months. We are starting to see the starts are positive year-over-year for 3 straight months.  So we're watching interest rates very closely, it may also signal that we're past the bottom. So knowing that this is a choppy environment. Another point that I think is important here, while others are talking, the market are talking about preparing for the slowdown, it's really important that our teams are laser-focused on preparing for taking disproportionate shares. So we went into COVID with a large majority of exclusive arrangements, with multi -- with the national homebuilders, and we've come out building momentum in a number of exclusive contracts that we have with some of these builders. I think that's a testament to the team's ability to demonstrate our value in this environment.  And I'm going to take it a step further here, and this goes back to some of the discussion on working capital. We talk about managing our working capital really closely. And -- but as we're having these partnerships and trying to demonstrate more of Sherwin's value proposition, especially in the New Residential space and in this environment, helping to get in front of -- helping them to streamline and standardize what it is that they're doing in terms of the product that they're bringing to market so they can be as aggressive as possible, helping them look at ways to reduce cycle time, and this all in an effort to, of course, help them drive increased profitability and productivity, but also to be as effective as they can be with their working capital again in this environment with a lot of volatility in the interest rate. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. And then in terms of free cash flow allocation, I guess, going back to the fact that interest rates are much higher. It looks like you have about a little over $2 billion of debt due for refinancing between '24 and '25. How are you thinking about the terminal sort of balance sheet leverage for Sherwin-Williams at this point, given the changed interest rate environment? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Ghansham. I think you remember, coming into the year, I said, I thought we'd keep our total debt flat with year-end 2022. But as you saw at the end of the third quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.2x versus 3.1%, and that was a combination of a strong -- you'll get a trailing 12-month EBITDA growth of over almost -- a little over 28%. But we also reduced our total debt by almost $600 million. I would expect as we kind of forecast the end of the year, would keep that total debt lower year-over-year by about $600 million and will be firmly in that 2 to 2.5x range. Operator : Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC. Arun Viswanathan : I guess, I just had to maybe get your thoughts on Protective and the other markets within Industrial. What are you seeing maybe if you can just run through some of those verticals? Apologies if I missed that earlier, but it seemed like wood was unusually strong. We're expecting some weakness there, but that was actually better Protective & Marine, obviously, strong; Refinish, I would imagine there's still strong; Packaging, weak. Could you just reiterate what you're seeing in those markets? Heidi Petz : Yes. I think, first and foremost, I think it's indicative that our strategy is working. And when we look at this business and this portfolio, it's really important. I'll share with you what we talk about internally, which is we're not trying to be all things to all people. And so when you look across these businesses, making sure that the discipline and how we're thinking about investment, the discipline and when we're investing is certainly a key part of this.  So maybe just a little bit of across some of these divisions on the -- John, rather jump in as well. You start with -- you mentioned Industrial Wood. There's been a lot of wins here against some regional competitors. And while we mentioned earlier, U.S. housing is continuing to soften. We think this is an opportunity for us just coming out of completing some key acquisitions that we mentioned in our prepared remarks, with Oskar Nolte and Klumpp. It feels like we're in a really good position here to continue to drive increased value and return of value to our shareholders.  Our gallons per day appeared to have bottomed out in all regions, again, so as the New Residential swings back, we expect Industrial Wood to absolutely come along for the ride there. I'll comment briefly on Automotive Refinish. I think importantly, we've had some really good share gain here. Year-to-date installs in North America have been up strong double digits, and our core users are growing. We talked a bit about our Collision Core technology and business. That momentum and adoption is continuing. And this is a suite of digital tools and solutions that truly is helping to benefit our business here.  And I would also add along with our North America footprint. Similar think of our Paint Stores Group similar to that footprint. We're really able to have a better opportunity to control a more consistent customer experience beginning to end here with our Auto Refinish, which we think is an incredible differentiator for us.  We talked a bit about General Industrial, heavy equipment market is rolling up, especially in Ag, and we continue to -- we expect to see that continue. Building products, general finishing is soft, but we've expected that the team is laser focused on pivoting and adapting to the market.  In the Coil side, North America is holding up better than the other regions, still soft, but the team is working really hard against some new business wins. And then nearshoring in Mexico continues to create demand for us. So we're managing that across the regions very carefully. One comment on Coil as well. I would say that most of the China coaters are running at about 50% capacity. So we expect there to be some forward opportunity there as well. John Morikis : Yes, Arun, I think you mentioned on your question about P&M. I think the team there is doing a terrific job of really staying focused on the value proposition as we bring into high-value projects. So EV battery plants as an example, semiconductor plants, Heidi, and I were just recently out at one of the largest plants I've ever been on. And our floor coating teams are all over these businesses.  I think the offshore wind and other alternative energy investments as well as water infrastructure. I mean, these are all areas that we're focused on. And I'll remind you, it wasn't long ago, we were talking about our Protective & Marine business at a time when it was under pressure. We reminded our investment -- investors that we take this long-term approach. And I believe these are terrific examples of our continuing to invest, even when times were a little tough, knowing that these projects can be delayed, but they can't be canceled. Oftentimes, you'll find highly corrosive areas that needed to be coated. You might get an extra year or a year or 2 out of those. But they needed to be coated.  And it's those types of high-value projects that are almost kind of a return repeat businesses as you maintain those that add to the attractiveness of these coatings. So we're really proud of Karl Jorgenrud, the entire leadership team within our PCG business for what they're delivering. And importantly, if you -- I'll remind you of the operating margin goals that we had set for this team at 19%. It's come in at 19%. Our goal of getting up into the high teens, low 20s. So they're doing it, and they're doing it by bringing value to our customers and to us. Arun Viswanathan : Great. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the M&A side. Given what you said in those different verticals, do you see the need to add capacity inorganically in any of those areas and similarly divesting businesses or what would you share on that side? Heidi Petz : Well, we've said certainly in our investor call recently and we say this consistently, but we don't need M&A to grow. There's a lot of confidence in every segment that we have for us to continue to take share organically. And so from a capacity standpoint, we've continued to be very strategic about where we are laying that capacity in. And I'll go back to Al's point, all of that is by design. As we look at our 10-year CapEx plans, our 10-year demand plans, certainly, we don't want to put anything that's net new to the system if it's not needed. But where we need that capacity, we're going to do that. John Morikis : The one point I do want to add, I don't know if Heidi mentioned, Packaging or not, but that's an area that we continue to invest. It's not so much needed through acquisition or M&A, Arun. It's more through our investment of a very unique technology, so the packaging business, particularly our V70 product is a very unique technology. And as quickly as we can bring capacity onboard, it's sold out. So I think that's an area that we will continue to invest in. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : On your gross margins, they were near your long-term target in the quarter. And it sounds like it will be above that target in Q4. So given that, how high can it go this cycle? Can they approach or even exceed 50%? Allen Mistysyn : David, one caveat to that, that I would make. When you look at our quarter gross margin because you typically see an -- seasonal architectural slowdown in volumes and sales. The fourth quarter margin may or may not be sequentially improving. It's our smallest quarter. You have year-end adjustments and other year-end adjustments that have -- could have a material impact on the gross margin.  Also, just reiterate that price increases aren't going to be as big of a tailwind in our fourth quarter than what we saw in our third quarter. And the other side of that Paint Stores Group is going to grow faster in our fourth quarter that will help drive gross margin.  As we talked about at our Investor Day, we are at a current range of 45% to 48%. We set aggressive goals for our teams. And as we consistently achieve that current range, we'll adjust the range. I don't think we're ready to sit here today and make a change to any range or talk about 2024 at this point. But we're going to be consistent in our approach going forward. Heidi Petz : David, I would just add, very simply, there is no ceiling. David Begleiter : Very good. And Heidi and John, just looking at past DIY cycle weaknesses, what does it take or what do you need to see, to think to see a reversal of the current DIY cycle weakness here? John Morikis : Well, clearly, the consumer is feeling some pressure from an inflation perspective. And there'll be some normalization, if it's in wages increases -- have wage increasing or the spending patterns of consumers that will take effect.  But the fact is this, that I'll remind you that paint is a relatively inexpensive, yet highly impactful opportunity for people that are interested in their home, staying in their homes to make a difference. And if people decide they're not going to sell the home, they're going to stay in place, it's a very viable option.  I'll remind you the average home age now is over 40 years old. So there's more and more investment in the structures, people aging in place is impacting as well. And additionally, I would say, not only does it help the DIY, but as the population is aging, that generally will turn into more of a res repaint opportunity, which helps our position in that space as well.  We don't want 70-year-old people out there scraping their gutters and eaves of their homes. But inside, yes, DIY is going to be an important part. There's a cycle, and we're playing the long game here, whichever way the table tilts we'll be there. Operator : Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Joshua Spector : I guess two ones, more for macro around the stores group. I guess, first, when I look at U.S. completion data for New Res, it looked like that was kind of flat, you guys reported down mid-single digits. I assume you get some pricing. I don't know if that's a regional divergence or something else you'd call out? Maybe I'll stop with that one first. John Morikis : Well, I think what you're experiencing right now is the delay between housing starts and the -- whatever, 90 days or so, after maybe a little bit longer, after a start before homes are painted. So our view, and Heidi mentioned this. When you look at -- and I think where your question is going is around the share -- our share of New Residential.  Our position here is very strong and getting stronger every day. Heidi mentioned the exclusive arrangements that continue to grow in count. Our relationship with the New Residential builder and our commitment to helping their profitability and success is helping us grow those customers.  It's delayed right now because the more agreements that we are signing right now and with the pressure on the starts, we're not seeing that. But I can tell you with great confidence that, as the new homes continue to rise, and they will. I mean everyone would agree there's a higher demand than there is supply right now. Family formation continues. There's a hole right now that exists in housing availability. When that comes back, we're going to be there coil spring that we've been in the past, and it's exciting actually to see our teams winning at the rate that they're winning, and it will show up on the scoreboard. Joshua Spector : Okay. I appreciate that. And just on the other side of it, when you think about the resi repaint side, not just Sherwin, but maybe the industry. So I mean we still have turnover down about 1/3 from the peak a couple of years ago. Has the industry fully digested that. So if contractor backlogs reflect that, have orders reflected that. And just -- I mean, how are you thinking that plays out into next year? Is there another leg down in the industry to normalize to that, if we don't have a step up, or have we already reflected that in the current run rate? John Morikis : Yes. I think it's been reflected. If you take a few quarters back here, we were talking about res repaint contractors that, in many cases, weren't even returning phone calls. There were many people who were saying that they'd come out and give you a quote in 6 to 9 months. And then it would be about a year before they could get to the project.  So there has been a more normalized reality, if you will, as it relates to the residential repaint contractor. Again, I'll reiterate that this adversity creates opportunity for Sherwin-Williams. You should bet, right now, as we are here, in this moment, that our customers are getting visited with Sherwin-William's representatives. You should also bet that our competitors' customers are getting visited as well. So we're not playing nice here. We're going after some pretty aggressive market share gains, and we expect to win aggressively. Heidi Petz : And I would add to that, too, Josh, I think there's a lot of confusion in the marketplace right now. And our opportunity, John mentioned, adversity is our friend. And I couldn't agree more with that.  Our strategy is working here, and I'll take you to -- we talk about our control distribution platform. We owned the stores, we own the reps, the store manager owns that P&L. The store manager owns staffing, owns the culture of that store. And I think it's really important because when we talk about that relationship and the consistent experience we can offer these res repaint contractors, it's critical that they know exactly what they can get from the experience they can have at Sherwin-Williams.  And so as they're coming in, as they are traveling, as they're trying to grow and take on more, our teams are prepared, trained and ready to get any tools that they need in front of them, to help them to become as productive and profitable as possible. So I'm really confident in how we are prepared to differentiate as we add value to this contractor. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Michael Harrison : You have opened 36 new paint store locations so far this year. Is the target still 82/100? And are you seeing any delays in either the permitting process or the construction process? Heidi Petz : Mike, yes, we expect to build as we said it. And no, we do not expect any delays. I think this is really important. When we look at our commitment to the team, to the Street, we're opening the new store every 3 days, and there's puts and takes in terms of timing. You can imagine our strategy is reflecting our desire to chase the density and the volume. And some of those markets, there's unique nuances where we're timing getting into a certain market in a certain area. But our commitment to getting to those stores is critical because we still continue to see a return on those stores at a rapid clip, and we think there's a lot of opportunities to chase for future density there. Michael Harrison : All right. And then within the consumer business, one of your competitors suggested that sell-in to the big-box retailers have been weaker than sell-out. It suggests that maybe there's been some inventory work down this year. Do you have any thoughts on how point of sale with some of your key customers as compared to your volumes into those customers? And I guess whether big box inventories at this point in the year are below where you would expect them to be. Heidi Petz : Well. First of all, we wouldn't comment on anything specific to our customers. So -- but what I can share with you with our approach that we're taking partners. And again, we do talk openly about making sure that success is our customer success. So when we're looking at making sure that they are at the right inventory levels, helping them thinking through how to manage to optimize our working capital. You can rest assured that those conversations are happening on a daily basis. So we'll let them speak to their specific strategy here. John Morikis : Yes. And I think that's really important. I'd like the way that Heidi frame that, that we gauge our success by how successful our customers are. And so we're actually working with our customers, encouraging them to manage their working capital so that they can put their cash to work and be more successful. And Al, maybe you want to talk a little bit about what the impact of that might be because we're trying to drive reasonable or acceptable working capital, not only for us but for our customers. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. I'd start with, Mike, that as we typically do, we saw our inventory gallons decreased sequentially as we -- we're getting back to a more typical bell curve. We grow inventory into the summer selling season. We see incremental decreases as we go through the second half, and then we'll build inventory in our fourth quarter. That consistency allows our customers to also manage their inventories better because you're back to a more normal environment.  To that point, I would say, we expect our working capital trend towards 11% to 11.5%. We were at 12% coming out of the third quarter. So we're well on track for that. And what it's allowing us to do is drive significant cash flow, and you saw that in our third quarter and that's a combination of strong net income results and working capital management. And we expect to flow that through into our fourth quarter and have a really strong cash year that's allowed us to be very flexible. Ghansham talked about, our ability to pay down debt, but it also allowed us to return cash to our shareholders in dividends and buybacks, and we've returned over $1.4 billion to our shareholders over that time. So in this high interest rate environment, we get back to our more normal operating cadence with inventory, and you'll see us manage our working capital down which then allows that consistency to allow our customers to manage their working capital down. Heidi Petz : And one piece I would add to that as well, I go back to Al's point here. We put by design very intentional capacity to work here so that as we're partnering closely to manage and optimize working capital and inventory with our partners that we've got the confidence that we can have the capacity to build the inventory in time for the season ahead. Operator : Your next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Patrick Fischer : John, you've often talked about things like sprayers being a good leading indicator what you're seeing in your stores with like a 1- to 2-quarter lag. What is that equipment sale telling you today about what the next couple of quarters holds for the store sales? John Morikis : Well, Duffy, I'd say that, what it's telling me now is that we're ending a season. So I'd say, while we talk about that, typically, the greatest correlation between those types of sales and confidence is usually as we go into the season. As we're coming out of the season, we are continuing to see spray parts right now move.  And I'd say right now, as we've talked, there's a choppiness in the market, but we have confidence in our position in the market, and we'll see how this unfolds next year as we go into the paint season. Coming out of it, though, it's typically not the best tool to use to gain a level of confidence of contractors. Heidi Petz : But what we are seeing there too, despite the sprayers is the backlog of projects for our commercial contractors continues to be solid, well through the midpoint of next year. So getting back to more of that normal cycle. So good indicator of some growth there. Patrick Fischer : Fair. And then Heidi, I think you made a comment that your gallons per day had bottomed in your view. I didn't understand -- was that for the company as a whole or was that for Paint Stores Group and that's even inclusive of kind of the seasonal weakness that we generally see in Q4. Heidi Petz : That was just in Wood. Operator : Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, I was wondering if you could comment on your administrative costs. It looks like they jumped up a bit in the third quarter. And in reading the commentary you called out 2 items, namely environmental expense and asset disposals. So a few questions would be, what are the nature and magnitude of those items? And would you expect that line item to come back down in the fourth quarter and beyond? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin. The year-over-year increase, I would say, environmental was a little less than half of that increase year-over-year. And then costs related to our Garland plant fire is a little less than half. And we also are going up against a sale, which benefited our -- gain on sale of assets last year that benefited our third quarter last year. I would say, I'm glad you asked that question because I think, I want to give a little color around our fourth quarter guidance, even though we don't get EPS guidance, it's implied and it's backwards. But I think a better way to look at that is our guidance at the operating margin line, and we're expecting our fourth quarter operating margin to be flattish at the midpoint year-over-year compared to a strong fourth quarter last year with operating profit up to over 60%, and our operating margin was up 450 basis points.  So we're not -- we are expecting gross margin expansion in our fourth quarter, not as much as we saw in our third quarter. We see raw material moderation. We're not going to get as big of a price tailwind that we got in our third quarter. And I do expect higher SG&A year-over-year because of the long-term investments. So then that gets us to these nonoperating costs. And we have approximately a $60 million increase in our nonoperating costs that will be predominantly in our admin segment. And it's due to the credits that we realized last year in environmental and other income in the fourth quarter that we don't expect to repeat and really get environmental and these other expense lines to a more normal level. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And then as a second question, if your raw material costs were to trend flat from here, would it be reasonable to estimate that you could see relief in 2024, perhaps in the negative low single to mid-single-digit percentage range, or how would you frame that outlook for next year as it relates to raw material costs, specifically? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin, I think with the current environment and the volatility we're seeing both in oil, in the choppy demand environment. I know historically, we've given run rates, a preliminary run rate on raw materials. I think that's probably a little too soon for that in the sense that we also have to take a look at the other cost factors in the total input costs.  I talked about the merit increases, getting back to more normal levels. But health care is growing significantly. We have freight costs and there's some things going on in the LTL freight side of the market that are driving our overall cost up. So I think it's a little premature to give that level of guidance. I'd rather wait until we get more line of sight or a better line of sight and give you an update in January. Operator : Your next question is coming from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Al, I wanted to follow up on your comments regarding fourth quarter EPS. I guess, historically, it's hard to find -- in Q4 where sequential EPS fell by more than $1. You're looking at somewhere around $1.50, $1.55, based on your guidance. Is there anything else going on sequentially besides the year-over-year things that you just pointed out? Allen Mistysyn : No. I think that's going to be -- when you -- the bigger driver sequentially you have is the decrease in sales on the seasonality of that. I think what's hard Aleksey is, you look at our last 4 years, it has been choppy, really choppy quarter-to-quarter, including third quarter to fourth quarter. So I think you got to go back pretty far to find a more normal year. I think the -- like I said, the gross margin, I do expect to be higher year-over-year, but sequentially lower because of less of the tailwind in price. I think SG&A growth is probably higher in this year's fourth quarter sequentially than it has in past years because of the things Heidi talked about, about leaning in harder on, investments in our paint stores. And long-term growth initiatives within PCG and CBG. So that probably is driving some of it. And it is our smallest quarter. So some of these year-end adjustments have a bigger impact on our fourth quarter than they would on our third quarter. Aleksey Yefremov : And then quick follow up on your stores. Of course, you have a large competitor who is shifting strategy. But besides that, are there any players who are either slowing investments or outright closing stores kind of in response to you gaining share? Heidi Petz : So I'll take that. It's a great question. I think you're spot on. And I would say that there is -- go back to my comment earlier, great amount of confusion out in the marketplace, and this is an opportunity where our consistent strategy, I think, is on full display.  And I have a lot of confidence in Justin Binns and his organization and the depth of leadership that we have there. This team is well prepared to not only execute our strategy, but to adapt to market conditions around us, and I think we've got a competitive advantage in doing that. And I suppose if we didn't own 5,000 stores and 4,000 reps and have strong customer relationships and data that can help our customers be more successful. I think we too might try to stitch together a strategy that helps to get products placed on the shelf.  But this is really an opportunity for us to do what we do well and to demonstrate to our customers, a very consistent experience with Sherwin-Williams. We're working with them closely to help fight through a lot of the complexity out there and make sure that they're coming out winning. So I do think where we're seeing competitors make different choices on store closings or channels, we think, again, this uncertainty is our opportunity. Operator : Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : Within Pro architectural, you called out strength in commercial. I'm just wondering what drove that. It sounds a little contrary to some of the commercial data points that emerged over the course of the quarter. So just curious as to the outperformance there. Heidi Petz : Well, I think the way to characterize that would be more back to a normal cycle where you're seeing kind of strong backlog front half. And then it would obviously look to soften a bit in the back half. So I would characterize it more as a normal cycle. But I do think that this is an opportunity. We talk about the strength and position in commercial for us is amongst the highest of our segments. So we're going to be hard at work focusing on share gains, making the right decisions, making the right investments, and our people and our resources are aligned and ready to help these customers to respond through the duration of these projects. I think, regardless of the demand outlook, we will take share in this environment. And part of our differentiation is, we are with these contractors at every step of these projects. And so as they're navigating uncertainty and/or changes that come up in every single project. Our team is right there side by side to make sure that they're getting those completed on time. John Morikis : Yes. I think if you look at the commercial piece, that's where we have the longest visibility and the longest lead time. So we feel pretty comfortable about what we're seeing in terms of completions into first half of '24, as Heidi said. I think you might be referencing things like the Architectural Billing Index, which are choppier now. That's why we're saying the back half of '24, we might start to see a little softness, but feel very comfortable again about our ability, if that was to occur, our ability to fill those gaps with perhaps, New Res is starting to come back. We'll put our foot on the gas with the res repaint, property maintenance, et cetera. Garik Shmois : Great. That's helpful. I wanted to follow up on Consumer Brands, just the sequential weakness in margins third quarter versus second quarter? Was it really just the decline in volumes quarter-over-quarter. Is there something else that drove the change in the margins? Allen Mistysyn : No, Garik, it's primarily -- well, it's primarily 2 things. The sequential decline in volume. But also as we have talked about -- and I mentioned on our working capital, we're targeting a year and inventory level so that when we come out into 2024, our inventory is in great shape, which means we tweak our production volumes to make sure we stay in line with that targeted inventory levels. So with production gallons being down sequentially a low single-digit number, that does have -- is a headwind for us in this segment. Operator : Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman. Adam Baumgarten : Just one for me. Just thinking about Europe, it seems like it was a bit better year-over-year across multiple segments. Just curious if that's just comps or maybe you're seeing some kind of bottoming or even improvement in demand on the ground there? Heidi Petz : Well, I'll start, and I'm sure Al will jump in here. I'll go back to -- especially on the PCG side, where we're not trying to be all things to all people I think is a really important point. And we are laser-focused on driving increased operating margins. To your point, proud of the work that the team has done in delivering a 19% margin in Q3. We'll get some benefit from recent acquisitions. But I'll point to 4 of our 6 businesses are up against very strong comps last year. And the team is doing all the right things to ensure that we are taking a very disciplined approach to decision making, investments pacing, et cetera, as we're watching the market closely and making sure that our investments are pacing with the demand in the market. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. I think 4 of the 6 to your point, had some strong comps. But 4 of the 6 had double-digit sales gains in Europe in Q3. And I think putting a bow on what Heidi just said, we're doing it the right way. We're focused on the right segments where we can bring value and that our customers appreciate that value and are willing to pay for it. We're not in this for practice.  And so we're growing and bringing value to our customers, and we're open about the fact that while we bring value to them, our shareholders need to be rewarded as well. That's why we work as hard as we do. So it's a good performance in Europe, and it's driving both the sales and bottom line as a result. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Stephen Byrne : What fraction of your resi repaint volumes would you say the Sherwin-Williams paint was selected by the contractor versus selected by the homeowner. And clearly, you've highlighted a multipronged approach going after that contractor for loyalty. What would you say you can, perhaps do more of to drive loyalty with the homeowner selecting Sherwin that could help you also drive share gains. John Morikis : Yes, Steve, we focus on the residential repaint contractor as the applicator. And that's a very big influencer in the decision tree. Other decision influencers would include color specification, which we've been working very hard at and the homeowner.  But typically, what we see is that the homeowner turns to the professional contractor as the expert. And while in some markets with some homeowners, they don't have a specific brand in mind. But the hard work that our teams do on a daily basis in building relationships with that residential repaint contractor is the largest driver. And it's exactly why we believe we'll continue to grow share at an outpaced rate going forward.  I'll finish with this, that we've had terrific success with the residential repaint contractor. We've had 7 years of double-digit growth. We're just getting started here. And there's a long opportunity and a big opportunity, and that's why we believe investing in Sherwin-Williams is the right approach. Stephen Byrne : And how would you rank the resi repaint end market in Paint Stores as an opportunity to share -- to gain share as compared to new commercial property managements and new home construction. How would you rank those in terms of potential share gains? John Morikis : We don't. They're all opportunities for us, Steve. And the teams that are focused on residential repaint has the greatest opportunity. Then when they get to the property management, they have the greatest opportunity. Then you will get to the commercial, they have.  We need to deliver on each of those segments as that's how we feed our families. Each one of them offer terrific opportunities. So when you look at share gains, we've talked openly about residential repaint offering the greatest amount of share opportunity and our position in these other segments are a little bit stronger, but there's terrific opportunities there.  But our approach, I want to be very clear. If we were boxers, and we're in the center of the ring, we're not looking for -- to get to the end of the bout and stand up waiting for our hands to be raised. We want a decisive knockout as it relates to these segments. And so we're pursuing aggressively each one of these. So I'm not going to parse out which offers great opportunities they all do, and we're very determined to get after them. Operator : Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard : In terms of the investments in '23 to grow share, I'm curious what the current thinking is about '24. And I guess, specifically, I'm trying to figure out do you sustain incremental investments, or does SG&A growth go back to normal trend or perhaps below normal trend? How do you think about that? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Eric, here's how I would think. Here's how we think about it. And as you know, we manage operating margin, not specific to SG&A. And as this year showed, our volumes held up better than what we had planned coming into the year. Our gross margin performance and gross margin expansion was a little bit better than what we had coming into this year. So it allowed us the opportunity to lean in and put more investments in than we normally would. We are certainly going to have growth in investments next year. I would say, back to a more normal level. And then as we see the year unfold with volumes and gross margin and what we see happening going into 2025, that will dictate how much more investments we put into each of those segments. Heidi Petz : Eric, I would add to that. I think going hand in hand, you asked a question about SG&A, and we talk a lot about managing operating margin. I think just talking about how we're thinking about a different approach to working capital is an important element here. That's a very intentional focus on end-to-end supply chain, but also a broad simplification effort that goes across every business unit to make sure we're as tight as possible.  And we talk about our value proposition goes far beyond what's in the can, and we're looking at this through the lens of our customers. And our value proposition can't include idle assets or excessive working capital, and our customers are simply aren't willing to pay for that. So I think it's obviously always going to be room for improvement here, but as we're looking to manage that closely. Allen and I, are locked -- relative to SG&A and working capital to drive those operating margins. Eric Bosshard : Helpful. And then, Al, if I could follow up. In terms of managing the operating margin, is it fair to say as you solve for '24, you're managing these different levers for some degree of operating margin expansion. Again, I'm not asking you to comment on '24. I'm just curious how that thinking can play out. Allen Mistysyn : Absolutely, Eric. I think just color around 2024. I mean we believe the macro environment is still going to be difficult. We're going to see choppy performance on different parts of our business, different segments, different regions, but we absolutely believe that we're going to drive operating margin growth through that whatever environment that we see unfold in 2024. John Morikis : We'll outperform the market. Allen Mistysyn : That's right. Operator : Your next question is coming from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : This is Abigail on for Mike. I just wanted to press further into the raw material basket. Can you speak to which materials you've seen the most deflation in and where pricing might be holding up more? John Morikis : Yes, Abigail, Happy to do that. So as we said, the third quarter was likely the biggest benefit for us from a year-over-year perspective. I would say, as we've commented, the petrochemical side of the basket is where we've seen some relief. TiO2 have been a little bit stickier. But I think Al said it well earlier, as you think about going forward, oil is moving around. And while it hasn't necessarily made its way into those commodities yet, I think it's to be determined of where that heads into next year. So right now, it's again, petrochemical side has been probably the greatest relief. TiO2 a little bit stickier. We feel very good about our ability to hold on to the pricing that we've put in the marketplace given the solutions we're providing our customers. And we'll have a better update on where it goes as we get into January. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then a quick question about your packaging destocking that you were referencing. Is that still persistent? Or has that started to tail off a little bit? Heidi Petz : Well, it's -- I would say this as similar to what we talked about before. We won't get into very specific details here. But I think it really is important that we're in lockstep with the demand environment, making sure that -- John mentioned this earlier, that as our customers are working through some choppiness right now that we've got capacity continuing to come online through our brand site. And as soon as we have that capacity, we're confident not just in our ability to have the capacity to satisfy that demand. But what's behind that are the technology that the market is looking for. So we're very confident that we're going to have that online here shortly. John Morikis : I think there is some destocking. Our customers have spoken about some areas of excessive inventory that they're driving down. And to Heidi's point, as our additional capacity comes back online, we get through the repairs down in Garland. We're going to take this wonderful technology and bring solutions to our customers that allow them to run their plants more efficiently. Operator : Your next question is coming from Patrick Cunningham from Citi. Unidentified Analyst : This is Eric on for Patrick. Given the DIY consumers under pressure, have you seen any relative share gains or losses within PSG or CBG? John Morikis : Well, we're clearly seeing improvement in share gain in our PSG, our stores business. Heidi mentioned the comparisons to last year in the quarter, we're all very strong, nearly 20% comparisons, and we've continued to perform very well even against that backdrop. And the investments that we're making are easy to point to as key drivers for future share, but I drive it back to the core business that we have and the expectations we have for organic growth. Heidi mentioned quickly in one of the M&A questions about that we don't need acquisitions. And in stores, when you look at our business, you could arguably say that this core business in itself is going to be a fantastic show to watch, and it will be.  But our expectations are to accelerate growth even faster. So the investments that we're making will allow us to capture that even quicker. As it relates to our consumer business, we've got wonderful partners. We're committed to their growth. Heidi mentioned things like capacity and helping them to drive down their inventory with the reassurance that we have the ability to respond to them.  So from the back side, we're clearly trying to help position them financially. But more importantly, we're introducing new products. We're bringing innovation. We're adding people in our team -- on our team to help train their team members. And we do believe there is a continued opportunity to convert people that might be in our customers' stores as shoppers, we can help turn them into buyers of products in our category. So we're excited. This is a type of market that most don't hope for, I would say, arguably, we don't hope for this type of market. But we know what to do, and we're going to turn it into advantage to our shareholders. Operator : Our next question is coming from Aron Ceccarelli from Berenberg. Aron Ceccarelli : I have one on product simplification. You have been doing quite a lot of simplification inside and outside the can, reducing formulation and also rightsizing the number of SKUs. Maybe can you help me understand a little bit better where are we in this process? And if you can quantify what has been done, and where can we go from here? Heidi Petz : Yes, Aron, I would say we're early innings. Really confident that there's aggressive road map ahead here. And the way I would characterize this is thinking through this is truly an end-to-end effort across the enterprise. So you mentioned whether it's SKU rationalization, formula rationalization that's really starting with raw materials and understanding the basket all the way through to what it is that we're setting up to our customers.  But I think an important point here is it's a mindset that we have adopted going forward. And so it's part of how we, John mentioned innovation as part of our new product development process. I mean, we're going to make sure that we're always looking at opportunities to take complexity out of the business. And I take it a step further, if you look at our Performance Coatings Group, we still have a lot of opportunity as we think about even rationalization of footprint. So the team is hard at work. This isn't going to be something that we land in the next 12 or 24 months, but I think we're going to be constantly looking at going forward. John Morikis : And I think Heidi's strength here is, and she's a humble person, she won't say this. But I will say this, I am a front row to this show. You've got a leader that is driving the opportunity to the bottom line. She's got a very respectful approach to our traditions and to our norms. Our 157-year-old company, there's a lot of things that we do and have done, and many of them are right.  And we've got an opportunity, I think, to take a look at those traditions and norms and ask if there's a better way to do that. And this simplification effort is a great example of that. I think our company is going to come out much stronger, much more efficient, better responsiveness to our customers, and an opportunity to pursue business in new ways.  We didn't really get into our digital approach, and the approach that Heidi is leading there to our team to better use the data that we have available in ways that we just haven't in the past. We've scratched around the surface but there are some terrific opportunities that she's leading that I think will further differentiate Sherwin-Williams. Aron Ceccarelli : And I have a follow-up on PSG. You touched earlier on the commercial vertical. Maybe can you provide some color on property management because also this vertical has been incredibly strong this year. And again, Q3 very strong against very tough comps. So would like to understand how you think about the momentum in terms of volume growth going into next year, please? Heidi Petz : Yes. The underlying demand is solid. I think we've seen some delayed CapEx and a lot of deferred maintenance that is now being addressed and we'll continue to see that coming into next year. I would say relative to apartment turns are improving, a bit influenced by the return to travel of the school driving some of that demand. But much like our momentum in New Residential, we're demonstrating our unique ability here to really serve the property management segment with a consistent experience that I believe only Sherwin-Williams can deliver.  And regardless of the size or the location of these contractors, our goal is consistently the same. It's -- we want to make it as convenient as possible to leverage our stores, our reps and our segment-specific tools and solutions here. So we're taking share. We're increasing our number of sole preferred or exclusive contracts, if you will. And we're confident that we're going to continue with our foot on the gas going forward. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to President and Chief Operating Officer, Heidi Petz, for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Heidi Petz : Great. Thank you. So I expect to close out this year with momentum. I think you've heard that loud and clear here. We believe that we're growing share and -- we are -- our humility takes us to the point where we're saying, we recognize that there is no finish line. So we're determined to move forward here. Going forward, as we look at 2024, here's what I can tell you, I have clear line of reality. There is going to be some choppiness that we talked about ahead. But we have seen this movie before. And my confidence is in this team, our ability to execute on our strategy that we know is working, our confidence that our key investments that we know will deliver shareholder value. And those combined together is what gives me confidence that we're going to outperform the market.  Any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to Jim and Eric. And we'll conclude with just looking forward to talking with all of you in January about our outlook and our plans and have a wonderful holiday. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

With us on today's call are Heidi Petz, President and CEO; Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Finance; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. James Jaye : Thank you and good morning to everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered solid fourth quarter results that concluded a record year for the company, where sales grew 4.1% to $23.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 18.6% to $10.35 a share. Sales in the fourth quarter increased by a low-single digit percentage against a tough comparison, and we generated significant year-over-year gross margin improvement. As we previously described, we also continue our deliberate and accelerated investments in the business as reflected by the low-double-digit year-over-year increase in SG&A in the quarter. These investments are being made to take advantage of current market uncertainty and are aimed at driving the success of our customers and above-market growth across all businesses. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter decreased by a mid-single-digit percentage related to higher non-operating costs. We maintained our disciplined capital allocation approach and returned $641 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Sales in all three of our reportable segments were within or better than our guidance. In our architectural business, commercial and residential repaint were the strongest performers, while DIY remained challenging. In our industrial business, growth was variable by division. Sales grew in Europe and Latin America with softness in North America and Asia. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our fourth quarter results by segment and a few full-year highlights before moving on to our 2024 outlook and your questions. Heidi Petz : Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, where sales increased 2.3% against a mid-teens comparison. Volume drove the increase as our previous price increase annualized in September. Segment margin improved 210 basis points to 19.3%. Protective & Marine, commercial and residential repaint drove the growth. Strength in these markets was partially offset by decreases in New Residential and property management. From a product perspective, exterior and interior paint sales both increased by low-single digit percentages. Exterior sales grew faster but were a smaller part of the mix. We opened 35 new paint stores in Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter and a total of 76 new stores in 2023. We also announced a 5% price increase to our customers in the quarter effective February 1. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased by 7.1% in the quarter, which was better than our guidance. Sales increased mid-teens percentage in Europe and Latin America. Sales decreased in North America by a low-double-digit percentage as customers managed their inventories lower due to soft paint demand, partially offset by an increase in the pro paint sales. Adjusted segment margin, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and impairment charge related to trademarks in Europe and the negative impact from the significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso in December was 10.8%. The decrease from last year's fourth quarter was driven by lower volume and higher nonoperating costs. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased slightly with continued choppiness across each of our businesses and regions. Acquisitions and favorable FX were offset by lower volume. Adjusted segment margin, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the Argentine devaluation impact, improved to 17.3%. This is the fourth straight quarter this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement. This performance reflects execution of our strategy, moderating raw material costs and the ongoing value we are providing customers. Industrial wood led the growth, including the impact of recent acquisitions. Coil and Automotive Refinish also delivered solid growth. Packaging was down as expected. General industrial was impacted by lower demand in all regions. PCG sales varied significantly by region with growth in Europe and Latin America and decreases in North America and Asia-Pacific. From a full-year perspective, I'll provide just a few highlights before turning to our 2024 outlook. At this time a year ago, you'll recall an environment of tremendous macro uncertainty with single-family housing starts down an average of more than 20% for seven consecutive months, existing home sales down a similar percentage, soft PMI manufacturing indices in all regions and most economists predicting a hard recession. Against that backdrop, we provided guidance that we believed was appropriate. We also said that if conditions improved, our performance would be better than our initial guidance, and that is exactly what happened. I could not be more proud or thankful for the efforts of our 64,000 employees throughout 2023. On a consolidated basis, our team delivered record full-year sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted net income per share and net operating cash. We returned a total of $2.1 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks in 2023. We delivered these results while reinvesting in the business by design and at an accelerated rate to drive continued above-market growth and enhanced profitability. In terms of CapEx, we invested $590 million, including approximately $205 million for building our future R&D lab projects. We expect to begin occupying these facilities by the end of 2024. We ended the year with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3x. Looking at our reportable segment on a full-year basis. Paint Stores grew sales by a high-single digit percentage and expanded its margin. Sales increased in all end markets except New Residential, which was down less than 1%. This New Residential performance was remarkable given the state of the market and reflects our share gains. Performance Coatings also grew its top line while further integrating recent acquisitions and achieving a high teens adjusted segment margin. The full-year adjusted margin performance is the best since the Valspar acquisition in 2017. Consumer Brands had a challenging year on the top line with lower sales resulting from soft DIY demand, but adjusted segment margin expanded. We're confident our aggressive portfolio adjustments completed during the year, including the divestiture of noncore aerosol product lines and the China architectural business, should result in improved future profitability. I am confident that we further separated ourselves from our competitors in 2023, and that's exactly what we intend to do again in 2024. Our success in 2023 stemmed from executing on our strategy, which remains unchanged. We provide differentiated solutions that enable our customers to increase their productivity and profitability and for which they are willing to pay and stay. These solutions center on industry and application expertise, innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution. We also have momentum in the enterprise strategic priorities that are illustrated in our slide deck and I first described at our Investor Day last August. I am confident the continued execution of our strategy and our enterprise priorities will spur the next era of profitable growth for Sherwin-Williams. So turning to our outlook. We entered 2024 with confidence, energy and a commitment to seize profitable growth opportunities in our targeted end-market segments. We expect to outperform the market just as we have in the past. And while the macro environment feels better today than it did a year ago, it still contains a number of uncertainties. On the architectural side, U.S. New Residential sentiment has improved. Single-family starts have been up year-over-year for six consecutive months. Mortgage rates are expected to begin moderating but will remain well above historic levels. In residential repaint, existing home sales drove a portion of our sales and have declined year-over-year for 28 straight months. The trajectory of recovery is not clear here, and the LIRA index is forecasting negative remodeling spend in 2024. However, there are numerous other drivers for repaint, and our investments and our model give us confidence that we will continue to grow share. In new commercial, starts slowed considerably in 2023, which we expect will impact completions starting midway through 2024. Commercial lending standards have also tightened, and the Architectural Billing Index has been negative for five consecutive months. On the DIY side, we'll remain in share gain mode as we do not currently see a macroeconomic catalyst driving meaningful improvement in consumer demand, though any improvement in existing home sales could be a tailwind. On the industrial side, the PMI numbers for manufacturing in the U.S., Europe and Brazil have largely been negative for multiple months with China being slightly better recently. We expect Automotive Refinish to be our most resilient business in this environment, and we expect to see ongoing benefit from recent share gains. Industrial wood is likely to benefit from recovery in New Residential given the furniture, flooring and cabinetry end markets it serves. We expect Coil will grow driven by significant new account wins over the past year. Protective & Marine should continue to have momentum but will face challenging comps. We expect general industrial demand to remain choppy. In packaging, we expect industry volume for food and beverage cans to be flat to down in 2024. We will also see a negative short-term impact related to temporary volume shifts, which occurred as a result of our Garland production plant incident last August. We fully expect to recover this volume in stages in 2024 and 2025 while also winning new business. Longer term, we remain bullish on our packaging business and our differentiated non-BPA solutions. Our Garland plant is fully back online, and we are bringing on additional capacity in other locations during the first half of the year. We continue to have excellent new account and share-of-wallet opportunities in every business and in every region. The continued growth investments we have made over the past year give us tremendous confidence in pursuing these opportunities and gaining share. Moving to the cost environment. Our outlook assumes our raw material costs will be down by a low-single digit percentage in 2024 compared to 2023. We expect to see the largest benefit occurring in the first half of the year as comparisons become more challenging in the back half, where the entire basket decreased low-double-digits. While raw materials will likely be a benefit for us, other costs, including wages, health care, energy and transportation are expected to be up in the mid- to high-single digit range in 2024. I will remind you that these categories also inflated in 2023. Working with our customers, we delayed additional Paint Stores price increases last year given the pricing actions that we took in 2021 and 2022. We cannot however ignore these escalating costs indefinitely. As I mentioned earlier, Paint Stores Group is implementing a 5% price increase effective February 1st. The Performance Coatings and the Consumer Brands Group are also likely to have some targeted pricing activity in 2024 though at a more modest level than Paint Stores. As for our specific outlook, the slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the first quarter of 2024. The deck also includes our expectations for the full-year, where consolidated sales are expected to be up a low to mid-single-digit percentage and diluted net income per share is expected to be in the range of $10.05 to $10.55 per share. Excluding acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.80 per share, adjusted diluted net income per share is expected in the range of $10.85 to $11.35, an increase of over 7% at the midpoint compared to 2023's adjusted diluted net income per share of $10.35. We've provided a GAAP reconciliation in Reg G table within our press release. Let me provide some additional data points and an update to our capital allocation priorities. Given incremental 2024 pricing, raw material deflation and Paint Stores Group, our largest and highest gross margin segment, growing sales faster than the other two segments, we would expect full-year gross margin expansion. We expect SG&A dollars to increase by a more typical level and increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2024, a moderation from the low-double-digit percentage increase we reported in 2023. We expect the investments we made last year and those we plan to make this year will enable us to grow at a multiple of the market. We plan to control costs tightly in noncustomer-facing functions. And we have a variety of SG&A levers we can pull, depending on a material change to our outlook up or down. We expect to open 80 to 100 new stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2024. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity, system improvements and product innovation. Next month, at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 18.2% to $2.86 per share, up from $2.42 last year. If approved, this will mark the 46th consecutive year that we've increased our dividend. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. We have a manageable $1.1 billion of long-term debt due in 2024 and expect to refinance the debt at higher rates. We expect to be within our current long-term target debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x. In addition, I will refer you to the slide deck issued with our press release this morning, which provides guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. Our team is operating with great confidence as we begin 2024. We are extremely well positioned to continue delivering shareholder value. And I want to thank John Morikis for the incredibly strong foundation he leaves with us as he moves into his role as Executive Chair. I'm also grateful for the outstanding executive leadership team surrounding me. Given that there is still a considerable amount of uncertainty in the global economy, we believe our initial 2024 outlook is an appropriate one. Should the demand environment prove to be stronger than we are currently assuming, we would expect to do better than the guidance we are laying out today. Our first quarter is a seasonally smaller one. For that reason, we will not be making any updates to full-year guidance until our second quarter is completed and we have a better view of how the painting season is unfolding. Our strategy is clear, our priorities are focused, and our people are ready. We will continue to win by providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and more profitable. We expect to deliver meaningful earnings growth in 2024. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question for today is coming from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. Heidi, I'm wondering if you could sort of break down the Paint Stores Group top line guidance for I see low single to mid-single-digits, and maybe there's 3% of net pricing there. And I guess, what I'm really trying to get at is where do you think that sales guidance would be if you hadn't made the significant growth investments in 2023. What are you anticipating you're going to get from that this year? Heidi Petz : Well, I'll tell you right now -- I'll start this off, and then I'll hand it over to Al to give some color commentary as well. I would start by, you said this beautifully. As you look at kind of the drivers of what's making us effective in the investments that we're laying in, we'll talk to this in a minute, but we've made some very significant choices relative to some of these segments. And I'll start with Residential Repaint. We talked about despite some of the choppiness out there, we are continuing rather to take share based on some of these investments that we laid in. It's interesting, in this environment, there's a lot of people that are out there talking about market share gains. And I would say that no one's really posting the mid-single-digit gallon gains that we're seeing versus our mid-teen comparison last year. So not everyone will be able to grow share. I'm confident that we are. And I would also say, given some of these investments, no one is better positioned in the market than we are to help these contractors. Specific to residential repaint and some of these investments, we're really able to demonstrate our model. We're interacting with these contractors that are looking to move beyond just painting but becoming business owners. So if you can imagine some of the investments that are allowing our teams, our reps to help them in real time in terms of marketing, customer acquisition, even as they look to expand into different substrates. We launched our Gallery Series last year, helping these contractors move from just walls into other surfaces in the home while they're there, kitchen cabinets being a great example. And all of these areas are really our sweet spot. So in this environment, while we're laying these investments in and we're clearly posting results, I'd also say and characterize this as the residential repaint contractor has never been more receptive to all that we can bring them in terms of our consistent store-to-store experience as they're traveling and growing, access to our highly trained reps that are helping them not just plan work, but helping them in real time to troubleshoot. So the accessibility, that's really important. So there's a list of items here that are really paying off. I'm going to hand it over to Al to give a little bit of specific color on the numbers. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Vincent. This is Al Mistysyn. Yes, when you look at the 2024 volume number, up low-single digits. If you go back to -- coming out of the second quarter of 2023 and looking at the indicators that we were, we were talking about our volumes really being flat. And as John and Heidi like to say, we got to influence the numbers. So with our line of sight being better than -- or better, the investments we made in Res Repaint and what you'll see is we expect Res Repaint to be at the high end or above the high end of that range. In the fourth quarter, you saw a low-single digit volume growth. And again, our Res Repaint volumes were up mid-single digits. So even in the short term, we're seeing the benefits of those investments, and we fully expect to realize those benefits in 2024 to accelerate our volume growth in Res Repaint. Operator : Your next question is coming from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So there's a lot of focus on the SG&A jump and administrative jump. And I guess, when you think about the roughly $300 million of the 20% investment that you had there or growth that you had there, I guess, how would you break it out in terms of just general inflation versus investment for growth versus management comp? Because primarily, the team did pretty darn well this year. So I guess, how would you break that out? And can you help us to think about on the growth investment side, the types of investments that are, I guess grabbing those costs or grabbing those dollars? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. John, if you look at the adjusted -- I'll use the adjusted increase in SG&A. Almost 70% of that is attributed to our operating segments with the majority of that being in Paint Stores Group. And as Heidi mentioned in her opening remarks, we added 35 new stores in the quarter, 76 new stores for the year as well as additional reps, which with the additional investments that we've made in the second half, our rep count is up a multiple of that. The remaining increase is evenly split between our Consumer Brands and the Pro Paint reps increases and also with our Performance Coatings Group sales and tech service reps. And John, I believe the teams have done a really good job at driving the metrics and monitoring the metrics to make sure we're going to get a return for those. And then as you mentioned, the remaining portion of the increase is really related to the admin segment and primarily compensation, including stock-based comp, which as you know is typically heavier in our fourth quarter. It's really driven by the stock price. We had some deferred comp and wage inflation. But I'd say those are the primary drivers of the SG&A. And I'd just add one more comment to that. Those will annualize in our first half next year. But we do expect, as Heidi mentioned in the opening, to be back to more typical investments and SG&A investments in 2024. So we'll see a bigger increase in our first half and at or below the range in our second half to get to that mid-single-digit range for 2024. Heidi Petz : John, one thing I would add to that, too, I think when you've got significant points of differentiation and you believe in your strategy, you're going to invest in them. So while we're growing faster than the market, then we're confident, as Al pointed out, on the return we're going to get here. Our heads are not in the sand. We absolutely know that it's an expense, and we expect to get a return. There's no doubt about that. But we do see this also as an investment to make sure that we continue to outpace the market. James Jaye : Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. In your remarks, you said that your raw materials, I think in the second half of 2023 were down more than 10%. And that makes sense. Your cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter was down 10%, you have higher people costs. But next year, in the first quarter, you have your easiest raw material comparison. The second quarter is pretty easy, too. So if the first quarter continuing the pattern we've seen is down again low-double-digits and the second quarter is down high-single digits, shouldn't your raw material base case for next year be down mid-single-digits rather than low-single digits? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Jeff. The way we have the raw material benefit rolling out in 2024, about 85% of that benefit is in our first half. And the assumption we're making is that we're not going to see another material drop as the year goes on. So essentially, we're annualizing the benefits that we saw through the second half of 2023. That being said, the market is driven by supply and demand, and the raw material costs are driven by supply and demand. And as we see how demand unfolds, certainly, there's plenty availability of supply in the market. That may change. But that's based -- our low-single digit outlook is based on the indicators we see today. James Jaye : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Hey, good morning. Nice end of the year. Heidi, I think you noted that resi repaint would be up or is tracking mid-single-digit volume growth in '24. And at this point, I suspect that's what you're looking at for the first quarter. I just wanted to be clear, so the market for resi repaint, would that imply it would be flat or maybe slightly up and that mid-single-digits is your outperformance? And then what are you looking for in terms of any indicators that would help you -- would suggest that the market growth could be better or worse than '24? Heidi Petz : So just to clarify, the mid-single-digit reference was relative to '23. So I think, yes, we would expect it to be flat. Now having said that, I'll go back to my earlier comments that the investments that we placed in, we're not waiting for the market and we don't think the market is going to help us this year. So the team was very diligent. We were very clear on putting those investments in long enough ago last year so that we were in a position to take advantage of this. So in this environment, while I would characterize the demand as flat, you can absolutely count on our ability to take share. We've got the right positioning in the market. We've got a model that allows us to absolutely understand largely not just through our stores and our reps, through our data, our ability to follow these customers to partner with these customers and helping them not just to get by with their current projects, helping them travel, helping them grow and really helping partner with them as they're looking to grow their business. So the characterization would be flat, but I would expect us absolutely to outpace the market there. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Mike, the only thing I would add to that is, you talk about indicators that might help drive the market, existing home turnover would be one of those. As interest rates moderate, and we do expect that to happen as we progress through the year, existing home turnover does have an impact; as well as home price appreciation, which is still up; the aging housing stock in the U.S.; baby boomers staying in place. All of those are driving Res Repaint. But your comment about the market being flat, we believe that could be true. But if existing home turnover would pick up, that would be a tailwind for us and likely second half view of that. James Jaye : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi, everyone. Good morning. I guess, first off, on the Paint Stores Group pricing, maybe you can give us a sense as to how to think about the time line, the price realization specific to the segment. And I'm just asking because historically, it took a couple of quarters to realize increases. And then during the COVID supply chain chaos, it was of course, much faster just given the extent of inflation. And then also related to that, what do you expect productivity to be in 2024 in context of the non-commodity inflation, such as wages and also with all the investments you have been making? Thank you. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Ghansham. The 5% effective February 1, I do think there is a lay-in that will be similar to past price increases. I do expect to get to a similar effectiveness. Mind you, at a consolidated basis, we talk about price being up low-single digits. There's some headwind for customers that are on contracts with index pricing, small amount but a headwind. And I do expect our -- and Heidi mentioned this, the raw basket is down low-single digits. Still highly elevated over the three year period that we're looking at. We didn't go out with a price increase in 2023. And if you look at wage inflation, the health care, energy, transportation cost on that two-year stack is mid- to high-single digits. So to continue to offer the services and -- that we do and the convenience and the differentiated solutions, we need to recover some of -- recoup some of these costs. James Jaye : Thanks, Ghansham. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I just wanted to ask you about the Property Maintenance subsegment. You're showing negative low-single digit number there, down from double-digit growth earlier in first half '23. Can you just address what's going on in this segment? Heidi Petz : Yes, property management right now, I would characterize this similar to how we look at New Residential. So this is going to be a segment, that's going to be extremely exciting to watch. We're growing share through some additional agreements with customers that at all sizes, all the way through. So it's been I think clear out in the market there's been some incremental capacity that's been entering the market, which we benefit from during construction. And then these turns become an annuity for us which is a significant part of our business. So we're looking at this on both sides. There's another piece of this. And I think if you look at the dynamics between what's happening with kind of new commercial property management, we're also benefiting from the upgrading of properties that are competing with these new units and investing in keeping their properties current and fresh. So our teams are touching certainly both the CapEx projects and maintenance as well as color and design support, trying to make our customers successful. So we're going to catch them on either side. They're -- people are going to live somewhere. So we're going to make sure that we're meeting our customers where they're at regardless of what's going on with the economy. And you can expect that we'll take share in this current environment. James Jaye : Yes. Aleksey, you mentioned the fourth quarter. So property maintenance was down low-single digits in the quarter, but that was against a really strong fourth quarter a year ago, where we were north of 20%. If you look at property management for the year, I mean, it was up mid-to-high single digits. So we continue to feel good there. And the investments that Al and Heidi are talking about, many of those are aimed at growing our position there and continuing to add to what we're doing in that property maintenance segment. Thanks, Aleksey. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Michael Leithead : Great. Thanks. Good morning team. Allen Mistysyn : Hey, Mike. Michael Leithead : Good morning. I wanted to ask on the 2024 EPS outlook. It looks like you're guiding for low-to-mid single digit top line growth. You mentioned you expect some degree of gross margin expansion, and you should also have a good amount of cash flow to deploy. So even with SG&A up a bit, I would think that leverage itself through the P&L, maybe greater than 7% EPS year-over-year. So can you maybe just walk through some of the key offsets or other items there that maybe I'm missing? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Mike. The biggest variability is on volume. And we talked about the choppiness in demand across different segments, different businesses, and different regions. And if you -- an example of paint -- well, I'll use Paint Stores Group and you look at what volume assumptions we kind of have embedded in our guidance. And I mentioned, I think Res Repaint, the market being flat with the investments we make being at the high end of our low single-digit volumes, so low-single to mid-single digits. You'll get New Residential. You've seen the positive new single-family starts for the last six months. That takes time to get through the market. And our expectation is going up against a really strong first quarter last year, our first half will be softer, and then improving in our second half. And that will be timing more than anything. Conversely, commercial, we expect to be exactly the opposite of that, where we have a line of sight to a stronger first half and then softening in the second half based on the dynamics and the indicators that we see. We just talked about property maintenance and the CapEx side being softer than we have. And as interest rates improve and lending standards get a little more open, we'd expect that to continue to improve. And P&M, we expect growth to continue. When you get into industrial, we feel very good about Auto Refinish, Coil, Industrial Wood returning with new res. But there is choppiness across each of those and including GI, and we talked about packaging in the opening. So I think, as I've mentioned in the past, volume is the single biggest driver of operating margin and leverage. If the volume is better than what we have in our guidance today, we would expect to do better than that EPS. Michael Leithead : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Heidi and Al, in terms of your plans, I believe you ran your plans below your volumes in 2023. If so, what was your earnings hit from that under-absorption? And should they all reverse in '24? Thank you. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, David. I would say that we saw the bigger impact of that through the first three quarters of 2023. Our expectation is we're going to see a headwind in the fourth quarter. And even though we had volume down low-single digit, I think the team did a really nice job of controlling their costs. And we actually saw a little bit of a tailwind in our fourth quarter, which allowed us to be a little bit stronger in gross margin in our fourth quarter. For 2024, my expectation is that because we're getting back to what I would call a more normalized bell curve when you look at inventories and how we build inventory coming into the spring selling season will drop inventory in our second and third quarters, and then build inventory again in our fourth quarter. It really allows -- and I'll talk specifically about our architectural plants. It really allows us to schedule those plants more efficiently plan our staffing the right way. And I do expect to see an improved performance from our global supply chain and our supply chain in general in 2024. We're not going to talk specifics on dollars in that, but we certainly expect a better performance as we get into '24. James Jaye : Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Michael Harrison : Hi, good morning. Within the Consumer Brands Group, curious if you can talk a little bit about your expectations around customer order patterns into the spring paint season. It sounds like as of Q4, they were maybe still managing their inventory levels lower. But I'm just curious if right now you're expecting kind of a more normal seasonal improvement or if there's still going to be some caution on inventory management. Heidi Petz : Yes, Mike. Normal is exactly how I would characterize that. And I think as we've all come through the last few years, I would also say that the alignment and the partnership has never been at a better place. Allen Mistysyn : Mike, can I just add one thing about that that we're talking specifically DIY. On the Pros Who Paint side of that, I know it's not a huge portion of that business. But I think the team has invested in that, working closely with our partners. And we have been taking share and growing faster than the market, and we expect that to continue going into 2024. James Jaye : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. James Jaye : Hey, Greg, might be on mute. Greg. Operator : Greg, your line is live. James Jaye : Come back to you, Greg. We'll come back to you, Greg. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : Good morning, everyone. Great quarter. When you look at the do-it-yourself business at the Paint Stores and Consumer Brands, you marked that it was weak in both areas. Can you sort of contrast the reasons for that weakness, especially at Consumer Brands, because it's the bulk of the business, whereas the Paint Stores, it's a smaller part of the business, but still significant? Thank you. Heidi Petz : Yes. Chuck, it's certainly an interesting environment right now. I'll start with our stores. I know you want to get to the consumer piece. As you know, in our stores, it's a small part of the business, and we are catering to a unique, I would call it a subsegment, which is a higher end customer that really values more of that high touch that we can provide. And candidly, this time of year, it's even smaller. And we'll need to see how the consumer is going to react to the macro conditions during the paint season. So I would say that it's early, and we're certainly watching that. But you talk about the Consumer Brands Group, which is obviously our focus on circling the market from every angle. So you've got more price points certainly within that environment. And Al mentioned the Pros Who Paint already. But in terms of the DIY, it certainly is -- it's a choppy market right now. We're trying to stay really close to it and being in lockstep with our retail partners to look for opportunities to continue to build strength in that end segment. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Chuck, the only thing I would add is we beat guidance in the fourth quarter. And I would say that a couple of things that drove that is less destocking than what we expected. As you typically see in the fourth quarter architecture, the seasonality, you see some destocking in the fourth quarter. But also, I give our Latin America and Europe teams, they grew low teens in the quarter, which was better than our expectations. So a little bit of positivity there. James Jaye : Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Your next question is coming from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg your line is live. Greg Melich : Hi, hopefully, this is working now. Heidi Petz : Yes. James Jaye : Welcome back, Greg. Greg Melich : Okay. Great. No, it's good to be back. So I just wanted to frame a little bit differently how important mean the gross margins back up to the middle upper part of your range. And if I take your guidance, it seems like there's another 100 bps of gross margin expansion assumed this year. How important is volume versus price raws and mix for that 100 improvement this year? And I guess that, how long do you wait before you end up raising that long-term goal? Heidi Petz : Well, first and foremost, it's volume. I'll go back to Al's comments earlier. We certainly are looking at the margin expansion and ultimately operating margin, but volume is no doubt the key focus. Al, I know -- Al and I are both sitting here wanting to jump at this answer. So I'll share this with him. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. No. And Greg, in 2024 price will be a little heavier than raw materials. As we talked about, raw materials will be down low-single digits, certainly nowhere near where it was in 2023. But I think Heidi said it, volume and specifically our pro architectural volume in our Paint Stores Group is what's going to drive that gross margin. It's our highest margin segment. It's growing the fastest and has the biggest opportunity. Don't get me wrong, all our segments have great opportunity in the targeted segments they play in. But certainly, Res Repaint, as we've talked in the past, largest segment, fastest growing, biggest opportunity. And like we've talked about in the past, we -- historically, we challenged the teams pretty hard. We set a tough goal for them. And as they have consistency achieving or above that goal, we'll raise the target. And we've done that in the past, and I need to get some comfort and consistency. But yes, we'll take the target up when appropriate. James Jaye : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions about price mix. When you look at your Paint Stores and you look at your end markets, which of them do you think you have the greatest ability to drive a mix shift? If you stroll through any of your stores, one of the characteristics that just jumps out is the huge range of price points. And I'm curious, do you see the ability for your investments to not just drive share gains in volume? But can you drive a mix shift up in price? And just conversely to that, is there any risk that you've seen in the past when you raise pricing, does it cause any of your pros to shift down to a lower price point? Heidi Petz : Well, Steve, I'll start. And I would say that there's absolutely opportunity to drive some improvement here in terms of mix shift. And if you look at this through our view, it's very much segment driven. And I'll go back to my earlier comments on the Res Repaint. That is such a -- and Al said this just a few moments ago. We have opportunity to gain share in every one of our targeted segments, and Residential Repaint in particular. So as you think about the opportunity for us to help this contractor, we talk a lot about helping them be more productive and more profitable. But your point is spot on here that it is our best interest to help partner with them to make them as productive as possible. So the role of premium products, making sure that they understand that the time saving, the labor cost saving that correlates to the use of some of those products is a great -- it's a win-win for them and for us. That's a great example given where the macro is right now. So we absolutely expect mix to be a significant part of that. Having said that, as we watch New Residential come back, the teams are working hard on our simplification efforts there to ensure that we continue to put the right products in the hands of the right contractors on those jobs as well. So I would expect across the board, a focus on those premium products is a critical part of our strategy. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Steve, the other part of your question, we typically do not see contractors go down in quality in an inflationary environment. Typically, in an inflationary environment, and we've talked about this in the past. We tend to do better on converting contractors to a higher quality product with the idea they're going to pay more for the product anyway. So try this better quality product. And to Heidi's point, it's going to make you more efficient and effective, and you'll get on and off jobs faster. James Jaye : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Your next question is coming from Josh Spector with UBS. Josh Spector : Yes, hi. Good morning. So I wanted to ask on Resi Repaint, kind of revisit that a little bit and maybe just kind of test the downside scenario there. So if you look over the last couple of years and say, existing home sales are down 30% plus, typically, that has some impact on Resi Repaint. Your volumes look like, generally, they haven't declined at all over the last couple of years. So I know initially that was higher contractor backlogs, and then it was remodel people put in place are stuck in their homes. In a scenario where you don't see a decline in interest rates, how do you think that that will play out for Resi Repaint? Is this a new higher base where you don't see the downside risk? Or would you see some catch-up there? Just curious on your thinking there? Thanks. Heidi Petz : I will tell you that we don't see a downside here and the level of -- again, if we didn't have access to, we talk about leading indicators, the data that helps us to really understand our contractors. And I'll give you a little bit of color here without going too far is what they're buying, what they're not buying, what their projects are, current and their future pipeline, where they're looking to travel as they're looking to grow and expand in the different territories. And so we're able to then, Josh, take our data, sit down with our reps and our sales managers and make sure that they are armed to truly help bring value to these contractors in a way that a competitor that doesn't have a specialty paint store just doesn't have those levers to pull. So I don't see a downside in this environment. James Jaye : Thank you, Josh. Operator : Your next question is coming from John Roberts with Mizuho. John Roberts : Thank you. Heidi, I think when on John's first earnings call as CEO, he used the [indiscernible] meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Is that still on the playlist at Sherwin-Williams? Or you do think you came up through a different career path than John. So do you bring a different perspective to the role? Heidi Petz : I do. And I also think, I really find your question very interesting, because I think there is a commonality of, certainly, first and foremost, the belief that our strategy is working. I think John has contributed, we say his fingerprints are all over this company, and they absolutely are. So I have the fortune of inheriting an incredibly rock-solid foundation on which to build. And when we talk about just getting started, I couldn't agree more that we are just getting started. I think in terms of having a different background and bringing perspective into the business, I think it's important to share that my values and John's values are spot-on in terms of culture, customer focus, desire to grow, determination to win. And so bringing a perspective from outside of only a paint category, I think, only helps to continue to put our foot on the gas on what's working. And I would characterize it more maybe as a healthy challenge on where we might have opportunity to strengthen our model and just continue to grow. James Jaye : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I guess I had a couple of questions around Paint Stores Group. So first off, is there any way that you could help us understand the magnitude of share gains? It would seem that given the strong growth in Resi Repaint that you've enjoyed share gains for a little while. So is there any mechanism to keep those going? Or maybe you can just help us understand how much share you've gained over the last couple of years. And then furthermore, on the sales guidance, low-to-mid single digits, usually PSG is at the upper end of that. So is that still your expectation for '24? And would you expect that to improve as you go through the year, i.e., maybe second and third quarter at the upper end of that mid-single digit range or even above? Thanks. Heidi Petz : Yes. Hi, Arun, I'll start with your first question, and then I'll kick it over to Al for your second one. You mentioned Res Repaint, so I won't touch that. But in terms of -- I won't get into the numbers, but you asked about the magnitude of share gains. And I would point to, candidly, the rest of the segment. So New Residential here is where we're obviously playing a long game, but we're continuing to take share by expanding the number of agreements that we've secured. Even in these very challenging times, we've been able to secure incremental agreements. And we're doing that at a time when there's a lot of pressure on starts. And so as you fast forward and play this out and as the cycle plays out, and it will, our position here is going to be even more significant as these new agreements begin to really pay off with the acceleration of housing starts. Property management, we hit on that a bit -- I hit on that a bit earlier. But I would say that it's very similar in terms of our ability in this environment to demonstrate our value and secure some of these incremental agreements, again, in property management, that will be true, certainly at the national, regional, and the local level. Our teams have been able to really penetrate based on a lot of the data that we've got access to there. Certainly, a lot of benefit Commercial, Protective & Marine, two segments that I would say are largely focused on product technology, specifications, and really great distribution. These businesses are both strong, and we're working very hard every day to put distance between ourselves and our competition. And I would go maybe a step further on commercial, where we're confident is we're well positioned in every subsegment within commercial. So when Al mentioned, we've got stronger view in the first half, it might look more soft in the second half. We're prepared to meet our -- these contractors where they are as they're looking to shift and transition within subsegments. So I'm confident that even despite where the market goes, we're going to intercept them. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. So Arun, with our consolidated forecast being up low-to-mid, that would tell you on a consolidated basis, we expect volume to be flat to up low-single digits. And to your point, Res Repaint certainly would be above the high, be up low to mid. But where we think the second half will play out and could we be above that range is really what Heidi just said on New Residential, the timing of that recovery and the timing of projects on Commercial through our first half into our second half. And that will dictate how our second half outlook will be determined. James Jaye : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. A question on SG&A. So historically, you guys have had positive leverage on growth in SG&A growth that changed last year. It still seems like it's going to be negative in the first half of this year, maybe going to neutral in the back half. Structurally, has something changed in the market or with your model? Or will that revert back to positive leverage in '25 and '26, and what this will be is just kind of a short-term bump maybe to kind of push through the high pricing that you've put through on raw materials? But just structurally, SG&A versus sales longer term, do we get back to a positive leverage there? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Duffy. I think what you've heard us talk about in the past and going forward is our focus at driving operating margin leverage, and that's either going to come through gross margin expansion or SG&A leverage. And you're right, as we see a stronger top line, stronger gross margin expansion than we were planning, we are going to take the opportunity because of our confidence in our strategy to add incremental investments or accelerate investments in our long-term growth strategies, because we know based on our history from our data, from our metrics that we're going to get a return for those investments. And ad nauseam, you've heard me talk about 2008 and '09 a continued investments through that cycle in the high-single, low-double digit 10-year compounded average growth rates. And we believe we're in a very similar environment. So there are years where we are going to get SG&A leverage. And I believe you're right, we're going to annualize the investments, the strong investments we made in the second half and maybe have some deleveraging in our first half. But as we get back to the more normal cadence of investments, we'll see deleveraging. And then as the market normalizes and demand normalizes and we take an outsized share of that demand, we'll see leverage on our SG&A going out. James Jaye : Thanks, Duffy. Operator : Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, thank you and good morning. About two weeks ago, the trade press reported that one of your competitors Kelly-Moore, is essentially going out of business as I understand it. And so my question would be, does that open the door for Sherwin to gain a little bit more share than you otherwise would perhaps on the West Coast? And if so, are you allocating resources any differently? Or might anything change operationally to take advantage of that void before your competitors act to do so? Heidi Petz : Well, Kevin, I would tell you that that void is absolutely our opportunity. And I won't get into details here, but I can share with you that you should expect us to be very competitive with that announcement. James Jaye : Yes. I think a very aggressive approach, as Heidi says. We've been making the investments. And I would tell you, Kevin, Kelly-Moore, amongst all of our competitors, we're competing with all of them all of the time. And so they've certainly been on our radar, certainly been aggressively going after them for many years. We're going to continue to accelerate here and see that as a great opportunity. Thank you, Kevin. Operator : Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : Hi, thanks. Just a clarification question for me. It sounds like you have the Paint Stores price increasing your guidance in advance of the Feb 1st implementation date. Just hoping you could confirm that. And then maybe just speak to the pacing of gross margin expansion as the year unfolds? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Garik. We absolutely have the price increase for Paint Stores as well as targeted price increases across each of the other segments in our full-year guidance. The -- when you look at our gross margin and the expansion, we expect it's probably going to be a little heavier in our first half with, like I talked about, the stronger raw material deflation that we're going to see in our first half plus the pricing in our first half. And so we'll see a little bit more expansion in our first half. And then although we do expect our second half to continue with the expansion, it just won't be as much year-over-year. Plus we're going against a tougher comp on our second half when it comes to our gross margin. James Jaye : Thanks, Garik. Operator : Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Adam Baumgarten : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just on the new res market, can you maybe remind us what the typical lag between a start and when the paint sale gets made? And I guess, beyond that, have you at least been seeing the declines in that market for you guys to moderate as you move through the back half and into the first half of next year? Heidi Petz : Yes, Adam. The lag that we've traditionally described would have traditionally been about four months. And I think that's elongated a bit, probably in another two months, largely due to labor shortages and some other factors that are weighing in there. In terms of the other piece, Al, I'll hand it over to you. You can make some comments on that. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Adam. I think what our expectation is as new single-family starts, it continued to improve. Our first half will be -- one, just to be clear, if you look at 2023, the new single-family up starts were down significantly. As Heidi talked in the opening, we were down only slightly, which tells you we're taking share in that market, and we expect to continue to take share in that market. Our national account team, along with the field of Paint Stores Group field organization, do a terrific job at servicing those customers and adding tremendous value to those large national, regional builders and even local custom builders. So that being said, we are going to go up against a tougher comparison in our first quarter. So we do expect to be not as strong in our first half. But then as we see these completion -- starts coming to completion where painting is at the end of that project or that house, we expect to see a stronger second half. James Jaye : Thank you, Adam. Operator : Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Eric Bosshard : On the price increase, I appreciate the headline. Al, you're pretty clear on the price increases in the guidance for Paint Stores and then the other segments. I'm just curious in terms of implementation of this, Heidi, as you get started and take a price increase to market. The feedback on that, and I'm also curious related to that, I know over the cycle that the mix gets better. But I'm curious if you have any observation of a different mix experience in any of the areas now in the current environment? Heidi Petz : Yes. I would say the conversations, as we mentioned in the earlier prepared remarks, we do this with our customers. And so as we took this out towards the end of last year, it was making sure that they understand why we're going out with this, but also making sure that they're prepared to pass this along and make sure that they're not absorbing that. I think the conversation here quickly becomes making sure that there's a greater outcome here for a focus on the premium products. And that's what we're going to continue to focus on. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Eric, I think to your point on the mix, I mean, we can point to across each of the segments and the opportunity that each of our painting contractors have. As you know, paint is a small portion of a painting project, and that goes for -- when you think about the cost of painting a new house or cost of painting a commercial job. So it's like really a small portion of the overall cost. But if you -- as you elevate to the higher qualities, they get such a great efficiency improvement. They can get on and off jobs faster. And over the last three or four years that we've been talking about labor shortages, it really is a big driver of that mix shift. So again, opportunities across all of the segments. And our painting contractors are understanding, boy, I can get more top line and bottom line growth with the same number of workers by moving to a higher quality product. Heidi Petz : The other piece I would mention on that is we talk about value and that we're out demonstrating our value to these contractors every day. And so when we bring a price to them, Eric, it's -- we're not having a price conversation. We're making sure they understand holistically. Again, I'll go back to my earlier comments in terms of access to the rep, the store-to-store consistency and our ability to help with them with leads, help them with bidding activity. So it's a very different discussion than I think many others in our industry are having. James Jaye : Thank you, Eric. Operator : You final question for today is coming from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Eric Zhang : Hi, this is Eric Zhang on for Patrick. Can you provide an update on contractor backlogs and repair and remodel activity for the quarter? And where do you see levels for both in 2024 relative to 2023? Thank you. Heidi Petz : I would say they're normalizing. I don't have a lot of color. I think as you look at some of the visibility into backlog, it's not as long as we have with other segments such as commercial. So to Al's earlier comment, we'll -- like everybody else, we'll know more in the next quarter or two. But at this point, it's pretty limited in terms of future visibility. So the base characteristic would be that it's normalized at the current state. James Jaye : Thank you, Patrick. Eric, I'm sorry. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'll now turn the call over to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. James Jaye : Well, thank you again, everybody, for joining us today. I hope you heard today that we're very confident in our strategy, and we're going to deliver an increased sales and earnings this year even as an environment continues to be choppy. So as always, we'll be available to answer your questions over the next few days, and thanks for joining us today. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

With us on today's call are Heidi Petz, President and CEO; Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Finance; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. James Jaye : Thank you, and good morning. In what is a seasonally smaller first quarter and with continued demand choppiness in several end markets, Sherwin-Williams delivered consolidated sales within our guided range, gross margin expansion and diluted earnings per share and EBITDA growth. Throughout the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategy, demonstrate our value proposition with current and prospective customers and position ourselves to take advantage of disruptions in the market. While our results were at the lower end of our sales expectations, we remain confident in our full year outlook and there is no change from the guidance we provided in January. We also remain highly confident in our differentiated business model and we are well positioned as the painting season begins. While uncertainties persist in the macroeconomic environment, we see opportunity. We are encouraged by pro architectural sentiment in April and customers in several end markets are optimistic about an improving demand environment as the year progresses. Competitor decisions coupled with our recent growth investments are enabling us to continue penetrating our targeted end markets at multiple levels. We expect share gains and returns to become more and more evident as the year progresses. Consolidated sales in the quarter were at the low end of our range, driven by lower than anticipated volume, primarily in Paint Stores Group against the strongest comparison we will face this year followed by Consumer Brands Group in North America. Contributions from price were modest, as expected and we are now seeing our recently announced increases in Paint Stores beginning to ramp more fully in our second quarter. Gross margin expanded 270 basis points year-over-year to 47.2%. Higher SG&A in the quarter reflects the deliberate and accelerated investments in growth we made in the second half of last year and which have not yet annualized. EBITDA margin improved by 60 basis points to 16.7% and adjusted diluted net income per share increased 6.4%. We also maintained our disciplined capital allocation approach and returned $728 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, an increase of 59% year-over-year. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our first quarter results by segment before moving on to our outlook and your questions. Heidi Petz : Thank you, Jim. We are successfully implementing our strategy, which at Sherwin-Williams we do with a very forward looking and aggressive approach. While market conditions are choppy and may give others in our industry a moment of pause, let me be clear, we are not pausing. So this morning, I'm going to talk as much about our results as I am about what we're doing to ensure the momentum of our company not only continues but accelerates our ability to widen the gap between us and our competition. So let me start with the results of the first quarter. As Jim mentioned, our first quarter is a seasonally smaller one and our results do not necessarily dictate how our full year will unfold. While our sales came in within our guidance, it was at the lower end of our range. Going forward, I believe in our differentiated strategy, our deeply experienced leadership and our team's ability to execute in lockstep with our customers to deliver above market growth. Here are several of the leading indicators that give me great confidence that we continue to strengthen our position. For example, we increased the number of exclusive national contracts we have with homebuilders and property management customers in the quarter. New accounts and active purchasing accounts in our stores are up significantly from a year ago. Paint Stores Group rep call activity and unique accounts calls are also up in the quarter. Foot traffic in our stores is up and our net promoter score is at an all-time high. And we're seeing multiple share of wallet and meaningful new customer wins across our industrial businesses. These are just some of the factors we expect will translate into strong performance as the year unfolds. As far as specifics on the first quarter, I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, where sales increased by 0.5 percentage against a mid-teens comparison. We are not satisfied with this level of performance as volume was basically flat in the quarter. Exterior paint sales were exterior paint sales were pressured by challenging outdoor painting conditions in some geographies. As we've demonstrated in the past, we expect to see the benefit of our focused investments unfold throughout the balance of the year. A few strong weeks in June can more than offset first quarter challenges. Price was up modestly related to our February 1 announced increase. We are now seeing a ramp to typical effectiveness as our second quarter moves forward. Segment margin decreased to 17.2%, reflecting flat volume and the higher year-over-year planned growth investments. As a reminder, Paint Store sales were up by a double-digit percentage in every customer segment in the first quarter a year ago. In this year's first quarter, pro sales were led by residential repaint where gallons were up mid-single-digits. We see this above market growth as evidence that our increased investments in this segment are already beginning to deliver a return. Commercial and protective and marine grew modestly in the quarter. New residential was down as expected, but there is momentum in single family starts that will increasingly turn to completions as the year progresses. Property management was also down driven by delays in CapEx projects even as apartment turns remained steady. From a product perspective, interior paint sales increased by a low-single-digit percentage while exterior sales decreased modestly. Encouragingly, spray equipment sales were up mid-single-digits in the quarter. We opened seven net new stores in the quarter and expect to open 80 to 100 for the full year. Our doors are open. We are laser focused on the momentum we have created serving both existing and new customers. We'll continue to win business and take share based on our differentiated solutions. Moving on to our consumer brands group, sales decreased by 7.1% in the quarter. Lower volume and the impact of divestitures were partially offset by selling price increases primarily in Latin America. Sales in North America decreased by a high single-digit percentage, as our strategic partners manage the timing of their seasonal inventory build. Outside of North America, sales increased by a double-digit percentage in Europe and a low-single-digit percentage in Latin America. Adjusted segment margin which excludes acquisition related amortization expense expanded to 20.9%. This was primarily driven by improved manufacturing and distribution fixed cost absorption, moderating raw material costs and improved results in Latin America and Europe, partially offset by lower North America sales volume. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group were in the range we expected with continued choppiness across each of our businesses and regions. Lower volume was partially offset by growth from acquisitions. Sales growth in Europe and Asia was offset by decreases in North America and Latin America. Adjusted segment margin, which excludes acquisition related amortization expense improved to 17.1%. This is the fifth straight quarter this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement and again reflects the disciplined strategy to growing operating margin in the industrial business to mirror that of our architectural business. Industrial wood led the growth including the impact of recent acquisitions. Coil also delivered solid growth. Auto Refinish was flat against a mid-teens comparison. We are confident recent share wins driven by our differentiated service and technology will begin to show up more meaningfully as the year progresses. Packaging was down as expected with improvement expected in the back half of the year. General industrial was impacted by lower demand in all regions. Moving on to our guidance for the second quarter and full year. First, I want to talk about our global team. It always comes down to our people. Our team is highly engaged, aggressive and acting with determination and urgency. They are focused on the right priorities and this will become more and more visible in our results. I would bet on this team all day every day. Second, on our January call, we acknowledged there are uncertainties in the economy. We don't expect to get material help from the macro environment this year, but a few bright spots are emerging. Single family housing starts have improved and this will increasingly turn to completions as the year progresses. Existing home sales are unlikely to get much softer. Last week's LIRA report from Harvard indicates that the remodeling outlook continues to improve with declines easing and momentum building later in the year. On the industrial side, the manufacturing PMI has stabilized or improved in several regions. Third, we are tilting the table in our favor by controlling what we can control. Year-to-date, we have signed 56 new exclusive national account agreements in Paint Stores Group primarily in new residential and property maintenance. We also have increased sales rep call activity and unique accounts called significantly. We have a robust plan and aggressive field activity to engage customers of competitors who have recently closed their doors or are otherwise distracted. As I said earlier, our doors are open. We are not distracted. You can expect us to be very aggressive here. In addition to our stores platform and team of experienced reps and store managers, we're driving customer stickiness through our digital initiatives. In March, we had the highest number of pro plus users ever engaging with our platform, along with a near record number of new registrations. We have opened our Tournus France packaging plant which will support customers converting to non-BPA coating to meet the European Commission's 2026 mandate. We expect on multiple new infrastructure and mega projects that are gaining momentum. And we're introducing multiple new products in both the architectural and industrial businesses to drive our customers' success. Obviously, we're not going to share everything that we're doing for competitive reasons, but you can be certain that there's a long list of actions that we are taking in addition to these items. The key takeaway is this, at some point the demand logjam in multiple end markets is going to break. We will be there to capitalize. We're very confident it's a matter of when, not if. As for our specific outlook, the slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the second quarter of 2024. The deck also contains our full year sales and earnings per share outlook, which again is unchanged from what we provided in January. We expect to provide an update on our 2024 full year outlook when we report our second quarter results in July. Our slide deck also provides guidance on our expectations for raw material costs and other items helpful for modeling purposes. All of these remain unchanged from our January call as well. As you can see, we have high expectations of ourselves. Our team is aggressive, determined and focused on the right priorities. I want to be clear, we are playing to win. We know our strategy is the right one and we have demonstrated for decades that it works. We expect to outperform the market and we are confident our differentiated solutions will continue to drive our customers' success, while also rewarding our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to thank you all for joining us this morning. We'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Heidi, I know historically the company doesn't like to talk about weather and use it as an excuse, but maybe you could comment on it a little bit since it was in your deck and you brought it up. Just curious how much you think you may be lost from an exterior days perspective and how much you think you might make up in 2Q? And related to that, you did mention that you were disappointed with results in the quarter and PSG did come at the low end of your range. So I just want to clarify whether that was all weather related or whether you felt like the execution could have been better in the quarter and you're looking to course correct as you move into 2Q? Heidi Petz : I would tell you weather is a part of it, but certainly there's no excuse. But the last thing we're going to do is sit back and point to weather. We're trying to create our own weather here at Sherwin-Williams. So I would say not so much with return -- with relative execution, but I think in some regards, a lot of this is delayed activity. Let me just take a minute here. If you look broadly at stores and I'm spending as you would imagine, a lot of time out in the market right now with our team and with existing customers, also with potential and newly acquired customers and the theme that we're hearing over and over that I'm getting a lot of validation is that our differentiated strategy of distribution, certainly with our paint store, unique specialty paint store model, our quality of people, the availability of our products, the list goes on. That is really critical right now in this environment. And I'll point to a few areas that give me a lot of confidence as we head into the balance of the year. The ability to be accessible, to be dependable, the consistent execution that our contractors are experiencing store to store with us, certainly is really critical going forward and important launch pad. I'd point to a few areas relative to the quarter. Weather certainly is part of it. The choppiness in the market, you're going to see that ranging by segment. I'm going to ask Al to jump in here and give you a little bit of color and then I'll come back with some additional points. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. We did talk about in the opening about softer than anticipated exterior sales, which were pressured by that challenging outdoor painting conditions. And we saw it, if you looked at our slide deck, Southeastern division, which is our largest sales division in the first quarter was a laggard, which is typically not the case. Commercial, we saw slower exterior sales, property maintenance and then protective and marine got off to a slower start than we were expecting. All of these three segments, we have confidence that these jobs and projects have just been moved and not all of them will get done in the second quarter, some will be pushed into the balance of the year, but certainly have a high level of confidence there. One highlight I think -- that I think is worth mentioning and Heidi mentioned in her opening remarks. We talk about res repaint market being flat for the year but with the investments we've made, we were up mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter, we're up mid-single-digits in the first quarter. And I think if you look at how the quarter unfolded on a same day basis, March was the strongest month for Paint Stores Group in the first quarter and we see that continued momentum in April. Heidi Petz : One piece I would add just on the residential repaint side, I'll said this, but remind all of us obviously that we not only do we think it will be flat and we had mid to high in the range. But we're looking at our comparisons are not only indicative of now, but also previous year with a pretty aggressive comp last year. And I do think it's evidence that we're making the right investments here. Delivering this above market growth, we expect to continue to do so here. We're taking this segment very seriously as you can think about the value proposition that we have designed specific for this segment, not just the products but certainly the services, everything that we're doing to try to continue to help this contractor be as successful as possible. And I think that's what you're seeing now in this above market growth relative to the resi paint. Operator : Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : I wanted to follow-up on the margins, specifically gross margin. I think you mentioned that there was some operating leverage in the Consumer Brands Group, but volume was flat or disappointing. So just like could you put that together and maybe help us understand, was there any benefit to gross margin from manufacturing or was it all price versus raws in 1Q? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Greg. It's primarily moderating raw material costs and modest price increases in Paint Storage Group. And also as another tailwind is that Paint Stores Group volumes were higher than the other segments, which has a higher gross margin in the company. So those are the primary drivers of the year-over-year improvement. The call out on the higher fixed cost manufacturing affected the Consumer Brands operating margin and including the gross margin, but that was offset by other segments. And if you recall, I did talk about this on our year-end call that I expected our global supply chain to improve performance throughout the year in 2024. I also if you recall, I talked about it on our financial community presentation last August that our consumer operating margin was under pressure and underperformed due to the supply chain inefficiencies. We've experienced choppy production swings that negatively impacted our cost plus higher wages, energy and other costs. And so as we typically do And so as we typically do annually, we update our product costs. As we do expect to continue to see improvements in incremental cost per gallon with our global supply chain, continuous improvement and simplification efforts. There is an impact on Paint Stores Group and PCG. I talked about not getting into the detail of that on our year-end call and it's really not a material impact in the quarter. It is on consumer because it's a small quarter for consumer. But if you look at Paint Stores as we talked about that's volume driven and the incremental investments in SG&A. On PCG, we're still in the high teens performance, nice improvement year-over-year and we'd expect that kind of performance as the year goes out. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : In the first quarter in Consumer Brands, you earned roughly $170 million in EBIT adjusted. And normally the Consumer Brands business is seasonally weak in the first quarter, that is your sales, whether they grow a little bit or whether they shrink a little bit are higher in the second and third quarter. So from a logical standpoint, should it be the case that you earn at least as much in the Consumer Brands Group in the second and third quarter as you did in the first? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Jeff. Even though we don't give operating margin guidance by segment, I will add color that yes, we would expect sequential margin improvement in the second and third quarter because of the seasonality -- seasonally higher architectural sales in 2Q and 3Q. I do expect North America sales volume to be less of a headwind in our second quarter compared to our first quarter with our guidance being our second quarter guidance for consumer sales being down low-single-digits. I do expect that the higher fixed cost absorption in manufacturing and distribution operations will continue in our second and the remaining quarters of the year. But I agree with that. We should be back to our more typical bell curve with the seasonality of architectural going into 2Q and 3Q and then dropping as it typically does in our fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Heidi, you mentioned you won 56 new exclusive national account wins. Is that a big number? Is that a small number? What was it last year or maybe the average of the last three years? And is there a dollar amount associated with that 56 win number? Heidi Petz : I won't share the numbers, but I appreciate your question. What I would tell you it's material. And I would also tell you that it was also, it's evidence of our ability to put on display what it is that only Sherwin-Williams can do relative to servicing these contractors, certainly both from a new residential and a property maintenance standpoint in a way that only a specialty Paint Store can do. And so it's a function of our footprint of our team, of the expertise that we have, not just on a broad base nationally leveraging that platform, but our ability to be nimble and local and support the needs of these local contractors. So I think what you're seeing, it's a material pickup, but it's evidence of our value proposition and what we're able to do uniquely in the market. Operator : Your next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Maybe we can speak to the raw material environment. You've left the outlook for the year unchanged. It does seem like we've kind of got a mixed bag out there with the oil having run up, but a lot of the derivatives not really moving. TiO2 is kind of a little bit of a question mark. So I guess, can you give us color on how you're seeing your raw material basket at this point, if there are -- if everything is kind of stable, if you're starting to see things from an inflationary perspective go higher or are some still falling lower? I guess maybe you can just give us a little bit more color behind the raw material basket? Jim Jaye : Yes, sure. This is Jim. Yes, maybe I'll just talk start with the first quarter our basket was down year-over-year mid-single-digit percentage and that's likely the biggest benefit of the year also down slightly sequentially. Where we saw the biggest benefit in the first quarter was monomer, resins, solvents and TiO2, I would say was flattish year-over-year. You look out for the rest of the year, 2Q raws still down probably low-single-digits year-over-year, a little bit less benefit than what we saw in 1Q. And then in the back half of the year, I think it's just down slightly flattish in the back half year-over-year. So that full year right now, we're still looking at down low-single-digits for the year. We'll see if there's some upside as the year progresses, but right now we're still in that down low-single-digit. Your question about some of the commodities specifically, John, crude right now $80, $81 a barrel, that's up year-over-year and since December, but it's still down from where we were in the fall when it ran up into the 90s. Propylene has ticked up sequentially here. Now it's sort of flattish year-over-year. And then I'd say on TiO2, we're seeing some of the producers do a little bit of restocking, but the true end demand in some of these markets is still choppy. Their utilization rates are picking up a little bit. They're seeing some lower input costs. I'd say for us, we expect to still see a little bit of moderation in TiO2 and the other thing that's out there always is China. And with their domestic demand in China being softer, they're exporting a lot of that and I think that's going to continue to put some pressure on the demand environment for TiO2. So summarize it, still down low-single-digits for the year, a bit in 2Q and then flattening out. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Chris Parkinson : So can you just give a little more highlights on your projected market share gain? All of us obviously have a thesis across the sell side community as well as the buy side community. But it seems three things are going on. You have the inflection of historically low single family inventories potentially. Obviously, rates will have to do with that. You have a demographic advantage in many ways. And then also you have the underlying share gain narrative versus not one, but now 2 of your competitors. So has your spending plans actually evolved or changed over the last 6 to 12 months? Or is this something where you're kind of further positioning and further thinking about things as it relates to an eventual inflection in your outlook for \u201925 or \u201826 and onwards. AIlen Mistysyn : Yes, Chris, I don't think our spending thesis has changed yet. I think you look at what we talked about on our second half and our year-end call, leaning in with additional investments or accelerated investments to influence the share gains and accelerate the share gains that we expect to see and we saw that with res repaint. I think as we get through the second quarter, as we've typically done, we'll look at the indicators, market indicators and what we see happening not only in the second half of 2024. But to your point looking at the first half of 2025 look at the trends and volumes, the trends in our growth margin and as we have done not just in 2023 but in the past, we believe that we have upside in our volumes, upside in our gross margin we will lean in and add more investments than we would normally do or typically do. Because of the confidence we have in our strategy, because of the confidence we have in long-term new single family construction and need for housing in this country and as interest we talked about this on our first quarter call. As interest rates moderate, we would expect to see existing home sales improve. We'd expect to see an acceleration in new single family starts and in property maintenance improved CapEx. And we will be better positioned as those turn to get a greater share of that market. Heidi Petz : Chris, I would add to that as well. Just to reiterate what we said earlier, it's not a matter of if it's when and spending a lot of time strengthening our position in the market. We pointed to a few examples. I shared some of the indicators that gave me a lot of confidence. I'll just give you a bit more color here. If you think about the short-term, executing some actions here. You mentioned increased call activity but the other way to think about this is because of our controlled distribution model. As you well know, we own that data. We're unleashing our selling team right now on the world's largest database of painting contractors. So the team is out hunting in a very surgical and a very targeted fashion. We're not guessing where to spend time or energy. We're being very prescriptive in terms of where we want the team focused. So I think in terms of my confidence relative to how the team's hunting. Our new account activation and mentioned earlier on the unique accounts, but also a significant increase in our active accounts, we're also working hard in the store and with our reps and our managers, getting paint out of the bucket, getting products into the hands of these painters and the pro who paints. So in the short-term, making sure we're very clear and deliberate about how we want to go into the painting season. And when you think about some of these actions that are going to impact the long-term, that give us a lot of confidence in market share is investing a lot in these activities, such as specifications, applications and then working with owners to make sure that the projects are meeting their expectations. So there's a lot of factors here that we're making sure that we're continuing to control what we can control, which is strengthening our position coming out of this, we will be in a position to take Alpha's gross share. Operator : Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Josh Spector : I wanted to ask a question on pricing and first, I guess, what was the realized price in the Paint Store Group, specifically in first quarter and how do you expect that to roll into the coming quarters? So it sounds a little bit more phased in your description of that. So do we see in 2Q or 3Q kind of the full impact of that pricing rollout? AIlen Mistysyn : Yes. Josh, we talked about this on our first year end call, we went out -- just as a reminder, we went out with 5% February 1, and we said we would realize the increase -- the full price increase over the next few quarters -- the next couple of quarters as we typically have done, I would say, prior pre-COVID, so it's more typical. As we talked about, we had a 0.5% increase in our first quarter split pretty evenly between price and volume and we'd expect that price to ramp up and get fully realized as we exit the second quarter. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global. Mike Harrison : One of your competitors announced a strategic review of their architectural business. I think you guys have alluded to their challenges, helping to drive some customer wins. But I'm just curious, are there parts of this business that you will consider looking at and have you ever acquired paint stores as part of your store expansion efforts? Where are you always new builds or kind of new storage rather than acquiring? Heidi Petz : The answer is no. And I would tell you the way that we're looking at this is an acquisition without the cash outlay. We got a lot of excitement in terms of the opportunity to demonstrate our value proposition in the market. I think there's a lot of confusion out there as a result of some of these decisions. And -- but frankly, this -- again, this is our opportunity to reinforce the consistency and the reliability of Sherwin-Williams. So when customers want to partner with us and choose to partner with us, they know and they trust that we're going to be there with them every step of the way, whether it's product or project or planning or bidding, helping them with leads, we're going to help make sure that without a doubt that they are successful. So there's the stability and the continuity of our strategy, I think, is on display here, and it's our opportunity to go out and continue to demonstrate that. AIlen Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, we have purchased store chains before. The last one I want to say was PPI, which was a part of COMEX, and that was back in 2010. I think as Heidi mentioned, we're confident in our strategy in opening 80 to 100 stores is like acquiring a small store chain in the U.S. as it is. So we're happy with that strategy, and we'll continue executing against that. Operator : Your next question is coming from Patrick Cunningham from Citi Investment Research. Patrick Cunningham : There still seems to be quite a bit of choppiness in general industrial and packaging. What are your expectations for volumes for the year? And how much do you expect to outperform from share gains? And then maybe just across Performance Coatings broadly, what are your expectations for pricing for the year, given there might be some indices rolling off, but maybe some targeted price increases as well. Heidi Petz : Yes. I'll take the first piece of that relative to the segments and some of the outlook, and then I'll hand over to Allen on some of the pricing. I think if you look across the board, packaging, auto refinish, industrial wood, coil and P&M. I would say there's upside to all of that there's absolutely choppiness. If you look at this a bit more by geography, I would say that that's true. GI certainly continues to be, as we said last quarter, the most under pressure segment. But if I just start with packaging, we said this in our prepared remarks, while the sales were down in the quarter as we expected. There were some customers, some of our customers out there that were required to make a short-term commitment proud and we\u2019re really proud and excited that our plant in Texas is back up and running. As Allen mentioned earlier, plant in Europe is now to regain these customers through the use of our non-BPA coating, which is a superior technology allows our customers not only to be faster and more efficient more profitable, but also to be more sustainable as a result of this advanced technology that we have in the market. So there's a lot of excitement in terms of what we can do to take this technology and a more global basis to support our customers and their sustainability agendas. Automotive refinish, we've talked about this our installed continued to be up double-digits in North America. We are taking share. There's a unique technology and service that we're offering together. So it's the package along with our ability to leverage our automotive branches, much like our Paint Stores Group to provide that consistent and reliable service. So another point of differentiation is something that we're really proud of. And I don't think everyone can say that they're taking share here. We know the customers that we're winning. We know the competitors we're taking business from. And we certainly know the volume we're gaining. So these numbers will clearly evident as the year unfolds. We've got a lot more work ahead but we're winning with small customers. We're winning with medium-sized customers, and we're finally winning with large customers here. Just briefly on Coil, mentioned this earlier but North America is holding up a bit better than other regions. We have had some significant new business wins in North America. There's some positive tailwind as it relates to nearshoring. Mexico is helping to create some demand here. Industrial wood, another positive story here for us. We believe that the market has bottomed out in all regions to your point demand does continue to be choppy going into the second quarter. Some of the recent acquisitions, Sika and Oskar Nolte, EBITDA dollars and percent continue to be ahead of plan. So we're seen this is very accretive to the industrial wood program and we're chasing new accounts pretty aggressively and we expect a lot more as, again, as the year unfolds. And I won't go into much detail on general industrial that that's choppy and down in all regions, and we're continuing to fight hard to make sure that we best position ourselves as we recover there. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Patrick, on the volumes with our second quarter guidance to be upper down low-single-digits. That would tell you our first half volumes will be down low-single-digits. Full year guidance is flat to up low-single-digits. There was no change to that which tells you that our volume in the second half has to be up -- flat to up low-single-digits. Operator : Your next question is coming from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : You mentioned momentum in homebuilding as homebuilding customers and new residential. To what extent have you sensed any the change among this set of customers was latest volatility in rates. Has the optimism basically maintained the same level or has it moderated perhaps? James Jaye : Yes, I'll take that, Aleksey. I think the sentiment among our homebuilder customers continues to be very positive. Matter of fact, I was in Texas traveling with our national accounts team earlier in the quarter and spoke to several of our customers down there. And they remain optimistic about where things are heading. The rate environment, we'll see how that plays out. It seems to change month-to-month of what's going to happen there. But I think Al started to hit some of the demographics that are there driving people to need a place to live are intact. And I think also what you're seeing a little bit is people may be adjusting some of their expectations around what type of a home they might be able to afford or buy and the homebuilders are working to drive affordability and we're part of that as well. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Heidi just follow-up on the last question. You gave us a fair amount of color on how Sherwin is positioned based on your various internal initiatives, but has your outlook for any of the various PSG verticals changed in any meaningful way versus your initial view coming into the year? And then just a second question, maybe for Al in terms of free cash flow allocation in context of a fair amount of debt coming due between this year and next year and how are you kind of balancing buybacks versus debt pay down? Heidi Petz : No, I don't think anything has materially changed. Again, as you look segment by segment, I'd point to Protective & Marine was a segment certainly that we see upside. And I think I'll use them as an example because there continues to be demand strength in all markets. Some of the projects have been delayed, so there's been some timing issues here. But think when you look at the visibility that we're gaining relative to some of these mega projects, we're launching some pretty significant new technology into the market this year in fire and flooring and protective coatings, which is an indicator not just of our incremental investment, but I think some good upside. Having said that, I want to go back to where I started which is there's nothing that's materially different from where we came in last quarter. But again, as rates fluctuate as some of these jobs pick back up, then we'll be back out in July if there's any more upside than what we're at today. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Ghansham, I would say that I feel very good about our strong net operating cash flow generation for the year. You saw us return a big increase in shareholder cash and dividends and buybacks in our first quarter. I think when you look at our debt, I do expect our total debt to remain flat in 2024, and we'll refinance to your point the $1.1 billion of debt maturing, albeit they'll be at higher rates, likely will take out short-term debt and then mature it out as we see fit. But just to reiterate, I mean, we're going to stick to our capital allocation philosophy. We've been very disciplined about that. We invest in CapEx. We paid the dividend, which was a nice increase of over 18% our first quarter. We expect that to continue. And then absent acquisitions, we're going to buy our stock back. And I do expect to be in that 2 to 2.5 debt-to-EBITDA target range by end of the year. Operator : Your next question is coming from Michael Leithead from Barclays. Michael Leithead : On SG&A, I think first quarter was up about 6% year-on-year. Is that roughly in line with the rate of wage inflation you're incurring? Or how should we think about wage inflation relative to other growth investment drivers in that year-over-year increase? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, I think about it this way. The wage inflation is for 2024 is more typical to prior years. So think about a low-single-digit impact. I think what you're seeing in our first quarter, the start of the annualization of the accelerated long-term growth investments we made in the second half of last year. As you recall, on our year-end call, I said I thought SG&A would be up a mid-single-digit percentage for the full year with the first half being above that range because we're annualizing the investments that we made in the second half and then that will level out in the second half of this year. Operator : Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman. Adam Baumgarten : I just say I don't know if you mentioned this, but could you give us an update on how the Pros Who Paint business did in the quarter? I know you mentioned DIY was soft, but maybe some color on Pros Who Paint. Heidi Petz : Yes. I think certainly, there's bit of a challenged quarter, I would say, is maybe the best way to characterize Pro Who Paints in the first quarter, which was below our expectations. But we have a lot of confidence in our investments and I would also say a lot of confidence in our strong alignment with our retail partners. I don't know that the alignment has never been in a better place, gives us a lot of confidence that we are going to continue to grow share in this space for the balance of the year. But no doubt, we've got some work to do here. Operator : Your next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Duffy Fischer : Can we drill down our margins in PSG I would assume you got a little price, raw material was a meaningful benefit. So I have a hard time attributing to decline from those increases to the negative margin wholly to your growth investments. So were there other things besides the growth investments that were negative in that segment, maybe the transfer from segment to segment on the paint, which was basically the benefit you saw in consumer? Or anything else that's pulling down the margin other than the growth investments? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Duffy, it's primarily volume. As we have talked about in the past, volume is the single biggest driver of operating margin leverage in, I'd say, all of our segments, but for sure, in our Paint Stores Group. So that's going to be the majority of it. And then yes, we also have an impact from the investments we made but we do expect to continue to get a return for those investments as the year progresses. Operator : Your next question is coming from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : I guess sort of a follow-up on that is as you get into 2Q, 3Q, 4Q for PSG, do you expect segment profit to turn positive? And for the full year, will segment profit growth? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, on all of that. Operator : Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Maybe a two-part question, if I may, on Paint Stores Group. First, with a few more months in the rearview mirror, would you comment on where you think U.S. architectural industry gallonage came in for 2023 and where you think it might track for this year? And then the second part would be to do with Protective & Marine coatings. Crafting your segment guidance for PSG, do you think Protective & Marine is likely to grow faster than your paint stores sales or slower or on par? How would you characterize that given the commentary around timing and slower start and so forth? Heidi Petz : Yes. I'll start with the P&M piece, and then I'll hand it over to Al. We look at some of the gallons year-over-year. I think you said it in your question, it is timing. And I think with some of these project delays we don't believe in any regard that they have gone away, it's simply timing. And as I mentioned earlier, what gives us confidence is our increased visibility into some of this project work. So again, the team is working hard to make sure that with some of these launches, we are best positioned in the industry. So when the timing does recover, we're at the front of that line. And then I'll hand it over to Al to talk about your question relative to. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Kevin, I think the P&M, we do expect to grow faster than architectural just because as we talked about new res, we expect it to be softer in the first half and stronger in the second half. We commented that commercial. We had a better line of sight to the first half being strong and then likely softening, I think that maybe has changed a little bit with the first quarter project delays that we're experiencing. So some of that will probably find its way into our third quarter this year. So -- but we have a lot of confidence in P&M and the strength in that. I think that when you talk about industry volume, I think 2023 is likely down maybe low-single. And I think \u201824, we talked about because the new res was down so much. But I think in \u201824, with bettering coming into the year, we talked about it probably being flattish. Operator : Your next question is coming from John Roberts from Mizuho. John Roberts : Is the delayed property maintenance activity delayed into the June quarter, so that's in your guidance for the June quarter? Or are there more significant delays going on because of the mortgage issues with some apartment buildings and commercial properties? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. I think from project delay relative to what we saw from weather in the first quarter, we'll see those pick up in the second quarter and into the third quarter. As far as CapEx projects, we talked about this on our first quarter call. As rates moderate, we do expect to start seeing CapEx projects improve both rates and lending gets easier at lending standards ease up a little bit. John, we don't have material growth impact in our forecast for property maintenance CapEx growing a significant amount in our second half. So turns are going to continue to improve. And then as CapEx returns will benefit with that as a slight tailwind. Operator : Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : You mentioned there was some impact in Consumer Brands in the quarter due to limited inventory build. Is there any way to size if that was material to the quarter or would you expect any restocking in 2Q and maybe speak broadly to any opportunities for restocking across your network? Heidi Petz : I'll start with that and ask Al to jump in. I would say we're not going to obviously comment on materiality because that's certainly something we would ask our customers to comment on. But I think it goes without saying that as we've all come through the last few years, wanting to come into the season in a very strong position is a signal that there's opportunity ahead. And Alan, anything you'd want to add to that? Allen Mistysyn : Garik, I mean, think about our first quarter is a small quarter for consumer in North America and it ramps up as the architectural season ramps up. So we have seen this in the past and it's not overly material. You think about a couple of percent on $800 million, it's not huge. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Steve Byrne : You made the comment about your sales forces out there hunting for new accounts. And clearly, that's been the model. My question for you is, how are you incentivizing that or driving that with your investments. Is it headcount related? Or are you doing something to drive more servicing to existing accounts? And is this really to drive share gains? Or can this also drive mix shift to higher-performing products? Heidi Petz : I would say a few things. I think if you look at we use the word ecosystem a lot to talk about what it is that we're trying to bring to our contractors. So it's basically everything you said. When you look at the reps and certainly our suite of digital tools, the goal here is, regardless of where these contractors are at -- in their business maturity, their selling cycle their growth plans, we are going to intercept them exactly where they are in that cycle. And so it differs by segment. The needs, obviously, of those contractor is different by segment, if it's residential repaint versus new res versus commercial. So the readiness of our team and the digital tools to support them to intercept these contractors is where we're investing. We obviously won't go into a lot of details on that for obvious reasons. But when we're out hunting and I mentioned the word surgical, it is just that. We've got the data. We've got the team prepared. We've got the right set of tools to help make our team more efficient to help make our customers more successful. Allen Mistysyn : Steve, the only thing I would add to that is we often talk about surveys painting contractors and the number one driver of their loyalty is who helps them make the most money. So the more reps we have in the field and our ability to spend more time with those painting contractors and doing demos with higher-quality products we can show them the efficiencies that they can gain so that they can grow their top line and their bottom line with the same number of painters because the labor markets haven't improved dramatically. So that's a value add that I think we can provide. Operator : Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Just maybe two questions on Paint Stores Group. So first of all, historically, I think you've been underpenetrated on the West Coast. And given one of your competitors now there has shut at stores. Is that something that you could maybe pivot and increase your store openings towards? And then my second question was basically on growth and margins. So it looks like you face your easiest comps in the second half in Paint Stores Group. Last year, you were up 2% to 4% or so in those quarters. So would you expect to be up kind of mid-single-digits in Paint Stores Group in the second half of this year towards the upper end of your full year guide for sales? Heidi Petz : Yes, Arun I'll start with the first one, and then I'll hand it over to Al to cover your second one. And by the way, nice job getting two questions into the one question. You did that really gracefully. So on the first one, yes I think your point on what was happening in the West. We've recognized the Kelly-Moore closure. And I would tell you that we have long and aggressively competed against Kelly-Moore with a lot of respect for them as a competitor. We are well positioned and are already beginning to serve some of their former customers. We expect to gain continued share here. We're not going to comment on the potential size of the gains. But as I said earlier, you can expect us to be very aggressive. And I wouldn't look at this through the lens of opening new stores necessarily there. I think when something like this happens in our industry, we want to make sure that we're very thoughtful about where real estate makes sense for us, talent that we've taken the steps and the actions to take the best of and we're ready to go. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Arun, I think you're right. We would expect that our second half would be in that mid-single-digit range. Of course, as we see the summer selling season unfold. We'll look at those trends, look at indicators and certainly give an update to the street on our July call as appropriate. Operator : Your next question is coming from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Just a quick one on industrial coatings, can you just characterize the landscape for bolt-on M&A how appealing it is currently and our multiples in discussions starting to drift down? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Laurence, as you said, I think in this type of uncertain environment, you do see multiples start to decline. You also see maybe a smaller pipeline than you would typically see in a growing market. That being said, I think we're out -- we know our -- we're confident in our strategy in industrial. We are actively pursuing bolt-ons that fit that strategy and accelerate that strategy. And as the markets turn and as there's better line of sight to growth and that will be certainly well positioned with our balance sheet to make any acquisitions that we want to make and that fit our strategy. Operator : Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Eric Bosshard : I wanted to ask about SG&A that you're making to gain share. Al, you talked as rates moderated and there were some conversation earlier about improving remodel in the second half. And obviously, I think Heidi you said it the question is when. In a scenario where perhaps rates don't go down and the remodel doesn't improve. Do you sustain the investment? Is there a point where you tap the brakes a little bit on the investment that you're being made and what is in that scenario, a bit of a slower environment? And then the second is, once we cycle this incremental investment, do we get back to where SG&A grows lower than sales? Heidi Petz : So Eric, no, we don't see a situation or an environment where we pull back. We're confident again in our strategy. The comment we made earlier is these are very focused investments. And so we're not trying to be all things to all people, water all the trees. But where we know we've got points of differentiation that are meaningful in the market. You can expect that we'll continue to be very bullish there. So no, I don't see us pulling back in any regard there. And Al, I'll let you speak to the rates relative to the what\u2019s in. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Eric, as you know, I mean, we're focused on growing operating margin and sometimes that's through gross margin expansion. Sometimes that's in SG&A leverage whenever we see outsized gross margin expansion, we take that opportunity to accelerate the investments, again, because it's the confidence you have -- we have in our strategy. But yes, as rates start to come down, existing home sales improve, new single-family starts improvement in the CapEx that I talked about with property maintenance. And we see those volumes improving. I would expect to start seeing leverage on our SG&A into '25 into '26 in the go forward. Operator : Your next question is coming from Aaron Ceccarelli from Berenberg. Aron Ceccarelli : If I understood correctly, you mentioned that traffic in your PSG was all-time high in March. What part of your retail network in your view has the largest upside in terms of sales density or traffic? I mean, is there any part of your stores -- retail stores that is not running yet as you would like to? Where is the opportunity, I would like to understand. Heidi Petz : It's a great question. I would say the opportunity continues to be first and foremost. While there's opportunity in every segment, the biggest opportunity for us, as we've said historically is res repaint where we've got more share there. And I would say that it's on top of already very healthy growth. So I don't think in any way this incremental traffic is going to help correct think this incremental traffic is going to continue help us to outperform kind of the flat environment that res repaint sits in today. So it will be accretive, and it's something that we're confident that this is an opportunity, as you mentioned -- as I mentioned earlier, an increased call activity and increased unique accounts rather and active accounts, so this is evidence that we're taking share. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead. James Jaye : Yes. Thank you, everybody for joining our call today. I think you heard that the team is very aligned, very confident in our strategy and what we're doing. We've made the right investments, and we're driving those solutions for our customers. And we're pretty confident that you're going to see as the year unfolds, those share gains and those returns become more and more evident. The other thing I would do is just remind you, we will have our annual financial community presentation this year in Boston. That's on August 29. And in addition to Heidi and Al, you'll hear commentary from our group presidents as well. So additional information on that will be coming out some time soon. So look for that, please. And as always, thanks for your interest and we'll be available for your follow-up calls over the next several days. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

With us on today's call are Heidi Petz, President and CEO; Allen Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Finance; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U. S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open up this session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you, and good morning. Sherwin-Williams delivered a strong quarter, driven by continued execution continued execution of our strategy and with little help from what continues to be an uneven global macroeconomic environment. Led by Paint Stores Group, consolidated sales were within our guided range, gross margin expanded and diluted earnings per share and EBITDA grew by double-digit percentages. Margin improved sequentially and year-over-year in all three reportable segments. We continue to make progress on our enterprise priorities and we are clearly seeing returns from the heightened investments made in the back half of last year and which have now annualized. We also maintained our disciplined capital allocation approach during the quarter, returning $613 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases an increase of 57% year-over-year. Our second quarter performance ends our first half on a strong note and coupled with our current visibility into the back half of the year, we are increasing our full year earnings outlook. We remain highly focused on executing our strategy, demonstrating our value proposition to win new accounts and increased share of wallet, and taking advantage of disruptions in the market. We are well positioned to deliver in the current environment and highly confident that our actions and investments will result in even stronger performance when end market demand eventually becomes more robust. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will comment on our second quarter results by segment before moving on to our outlook and your questions. Heidi Petz : Thank you, Jim. First, I want to thank all 65,000 of our employees around the world for their efforts in the quarter and for their ongoing passion for our company and for our customers. I continue to be humbled and inspired by all that you do. I believe our second quarter results demonstrate three things : One, we have the right strategy. Two, our team continues to execute and adapt. And three, we continue to see returns from our ongoing investments in the business. At the same time, we're not content with where we are by any means and our team understands that we must continue to operate with determination and urgency. We're delivering strong results in a choppy demand environment while executing on initiatives that will put our customers and our company in position for even greater sustained success. As far as specifics on the second quarter, I'll begin with the Paint Stores Group where sales increased by mid-single digits against a double-digit comparison. Volume and price were both up low-single digits. As we expected, price realization improved as the quarter progressed. Segment margin increased to 25.1%, driven by higher sales and moderating raw material costs. Pro sales were led by residential repaint which was up by a mid-single digit percentage. Strong evidence that we are continuing to take share in a down market. We're clearly seeing a return here from the investments in dedicated sales reps we made in the back half of last year. New residential returned to growth in the quarter as we are seeing improving single family starts turn to completion. Commercial grew by low-single digits against a double-digit comparison. Property management was down less than 1% with continued delays in CapEx projects. Protective and marine was up mid-single digits against a low-20s comparison. And while we acknowledge that there have been project delays, we feel very good about the pipeline. DIY increased low-single digit increased compared to a high-teens comp. From a product perspective, interior paint sales grew faster than exterior paint sales. We have opened 26 net new stores year-to-date and expect to open 80 to 100 for the full year. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group, sales underperformed our expectations in a market that was softer than we anticipated. Lower volume, the impact of the China architectural divestiture and unfavorable currency translation were partially offset by selling price increases primarily in Latin America. Sales in North America decreased by a high-single digit percentage where weakness in existing home sales remains a headwind. Inflation, depleted savings and household debt also continue to pressure consumers who currently appear to be spending their modest available discretionary dollars elsewhere. We understand where we are in this cycle and eventually expect to see an upturn in DIY demand. We're confident that we are well positioned with our growing partnerships over the long-term. Outside of North America, sales decreased by a high-single digit percentage in Latin America and a double-digit percentage in Europe. Adjusted segment margin expanded to 26.1%. This was primarily driven by improvements in manufacturing and distribution fixed cost absorption within the segment and moderating raw material costs partially offset by net sales that were below expectations and higher employee related costs. In the Performance Coatings Group, modest sales growth was driven by an acquisition which was partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Adjusted segment margin improved to 19.4%. This continued strong margin performance reflects our ability to drive our customer success in end markets that value differentiation. It also reflects the ongoing hard work of our team to optimize this business. We continue to see choppy demand by division and region. Industrial wood led the growth including the impact of an acquisition. Coil also delivered solid growth driven by share gains. Auto refinish was up low-single digits in North America and down less than 1% overall. Share gains are offsetting softness in our core business where consumer reluctance to pay deductibles is resulting in lower insurance claims. Packaging was down less than expected and we have a good line of sight to improvement in the back half of the year. General industrial demand was lower in all regions. Heavy equipment and transportation were down more significantly, while energy infrastructure was a bright spot. Regionally, sales in the group were down low-single digits in North America, but positive in other regions. Moving on to our guidance for the third quarter and full year, it's clear that the macroeconomic environment has been softer for longer than many economists anticipated at the start of the year. We don't expect to get material help from the market in our back half. We are unwilling to simply accept these conditions and you can count on us to continue being very aggressive in our pursuit of new business and share of wallet gains. Sherwin-Williams have incredibly well positioned in each of our targeted end markets. Comparisons ease in our second half, competitive dynamics are a tailwind and we are confident share gains will become more apparent over time as market conditions improve. As for our specific outlook, the slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the third of 2024. For the full year 2024, consolidated sales are expected to be up a low-single digit percentage compared to our previous guide of up low- to mid-single digits. Full year sales guidance for the Paint Stores Group and the Performance Coatings Group remain unchanged. We have reduced our Consumer Brands Group guidance meaningfully following the softer than expected first half and continued weak demand in the North American DIY market. We are increasing our full year earnings guidance given our better than expected results in the second quarter. The midpoint of our previous guidance now becomes the low end of our revised guidance. On an adjusted basis, we are now guiding diluted EPS in the range of $11.10 to $11.40 a share, an increase of 8.7% at the midpoint over the prior year. As we have often said, should our sales prove to be better than we are currently anticipating, we would expect EPS to be better. Our slide deck also provides guidance on our expectations for raw material costs and other items helpful for modeling purposes. As we enter our second half, we know that we are not immune from choppy market conditions. This leads us to focus even more intensely on our strategy. In periods of uncertainty and competitive disarray, customers are looking to Sherwin-Williams for consistency, reliability, dependability and differentiated solutions that will drive their productivity and their profitability. We have a deep and experienced team that knows how to do just that. We believe in success by design and we do expect to win. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is from Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Heidi, could you talk to us a little bit about the quarter in paint stores? It seems like 2Q, not unlike 1Q, had at least a month where there were some challenging weather conditions that probably pushed some volume out. So could you talk a little bit about whether the quarter progressed, you started to make up a little bit of 1Q and then maybe May hit and got a little challenging? And what are your customers saying in terms of where their backlogs are as a result of this? And what are you baking in, in terms of being able to make up some of this push out in the back half of the year? Heidi Petz : I'm going to -- I'll start here and then hand it over to Al to give a little bit of commentary as well, but I think you characterized it well. I think if you look across segments here, certainly there were some challenge. We don't hide behind weather. We're also obviously not immune to having to make sure that we've got the right paint and application conditions for our contractors, which ultimately benefits our customers and our shareholders in the long run. But let me be really clear about the controllables and where we are laser focused here. If you look by segment, starting with residential repaint, we mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but very confident that we're going to continue to take market share as you've seen over the last few quarters, especially to your point in Q2 where we're posting up mid-single digits in a down market. I would expect to continue to see us doing that. I think it's also a clear signal that we're getting a return on the investments that you'll remember we laid in last year. So by design, we often talk success by design is a great example of how that's playing out in stores. And, it's worth repeating this segment, there's incredible upside as it relates to market share opportunity. My time out in the field with our team and our customers gives me a lot of confidence that what we're doing is working and we're getting a lot of positive feedback from even our new customers, ultimately helping them make more money. That is the reason we're in this. If I then take you over to new residential, again, Q1 to Q2, I'm going to let Al kind of come in and give a little bit of color commentary. But we are encouraged by the growth that we're seeing here. Single family starts are turning to completions. I have been personally spending a lot of time with our builders and the team here and they're ultimately after optimizing cycle time and profitability. So our opportunity, not only do we see momentum here in the back half, we look at that as some solid tailwind but I'm very confident that we are, I would say, best positioned in our industry, specifically within this segment as the market recovers. If I move on to property management, I think we all have seen this interest rates certainly have put this segment on pause both in new construction and renovation. But we're not waiting here. And Vincent, I think this is an area where much like new residential, the teams are hard at work demonstrating our value and securing additional exclusive agreements with plenty of opportunity ahead for us. So we're going to be continuing to focus on helping our customers manage through this pause. We got a lot of discipline in these management companies as they're really taking a look at understanding how to prioritize their investments and helping them try to upgrade older properties, competing with new properties and the like. Allen Mistysyn : And so the only thing I would add is just to take a quick look at the second quarter, up 3.5% compared to a strong low-double digit comparison last year. Volume was up low-single digits. Price was up low-single digits, and I would say it was probably slightly below where our expectations were as we were coming into the second quarter, but we exited the second quarter at our targeted run rate, which leads to the second half, third quarter and second half guidance to be similar up low to mid-single digits and that'd be really just broken out between price up low-single digits and volume up low-single digits with as a reminder, we talked about Res Repaint being up at the high end of that range in our second quarter that happened and we expect the same in our second half. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Chris Parkinson : When we take a step back and think about your longer term gross margin opportunity, there's still a lot of moving parts and perhaps some things in the housing market which are out of your control. But when we break down volume, price raws versus labor, and just kind of all the other things that could affect that outlook, how should the investment community be thinking about that, not even for the second half of '24, but \u201825, \u201826 onwards based on all the initiatives including investments you've already been doing? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Chris, this is Al again. I appreciate the question, but we're not going to talk to that specifically that long-term target today. I think FCP gives us -- within the next 30 days gives us a really good opportunity to talk about each of the financial metrics and the targets longer term. And today I think we want to focus on the strong second quarter that we delivered in a tough market environment and also with our second half -- our full year beat and raise for the EPS -- adjusted EPS. Operator : Your next question for today is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Congrats on the strong results. Maybe if I could just get your thoughts on how to frame the share gain opportunity as you look into '25 and \u201826. Obviously, there's a couple competitors who are going through some of their own changes and maybe that could benefit you guys. I think there's a perception that, that's on the several hundred million dollars of potential gains for PCG. Is that correct? And when you do onboard those customers, you talked about new customers earlier, what's the margin profile look like? I know that there's been traditionally, kind of get them up and get them going and get them further up the mix line mentality. Does that still prevail? Maybe you can just kind of frame some of those thoughts for us. Heidi Petz : Let me start with your last question, in terms of new customers coming in. Yes, this is certainly positive mix for us. So new customers, existing customers in this segment tend to value more of the premium product premium experience that we provide. So I would say that that's a fair characterization across the segment. Obviously, we won't get into any \u201825 certainly not any \u201826 outlook, but what I would tell you is the confidence in the momentum that we have here relative to the run up we're already experiencing in a few segments. And again, I'll go back to this idea of success by design, the luxury of a very tenured management team that is very astute when it comes to reading market indicators and signals. So, the timing in which we're laying these investments in, at the right point in the cycle, so that we are best positioned for the run up. Res paint is a great example. I point to automotive refinish, is another really good example where you can see, I know you asked specifically about stores, but that same discipline, holds across the portfolio. So we're seeing some positive signals from a market share standpoint. I'm very proud of that team and that organization is as you well know that automotive refinish model very similar to our stores model and our ability to have direct relationships with these customers and end users puts us in a really unique position. So, while we're still putting in the investments here, we've got record high installs. And candidly, I would say that not everyone's getting the penetration and the acceleration that we're seeing. But that's another example outside of stores, but Al, let you pick up anywhere else you want to jump in here. Allen Mistysyn : I think some of the things you're seeing in the market, and I think we've talked directly about this Kelly-Moore is a more immediate opportunity, more typically -- basically because of the type of customers that they were supporting at Res Repaint and they're out of business. And I think we've talked about taking more than our fair share and we see that in our districts out in the West Coast in California. I think PCG, we'll see what happens but longer -- maybe more mid-term, longer term opportunities. And it all goes back to this consistent investment thesis that we've talked about, we're very confident in our strategy. We know that the investments that we're making are paying off and I point to Res Repaint being up mid-single digits each of the last three quarters in a down market. And then Chris alluded to this on the previous question about mix shifts. And it really is about getting customers in understanding the services and products we offer that allow them to make more money. The products and services that get them to be more efficient to get on and off jobs faster, grow their top-line and their bottom line, it really drives that customer loyalty. Operator : Your next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Could you talk about your regional performance in paint stores? And once you're done with your R&D capital expenditures and some plant expansions, should your normal capital expenditures be between -- be under $500 million? Allen Mistysyn : I'll take the second one on CapEx. And as you know, we are very consistent in our capital allocation philosophy. After you get past the building our future projects, which as a reminder will help us attract and retain world class talent to allow us to continue to drive above market growth, ROS and RONA improvements and drive strong cash flow. And then we'll take that cash flow and we'll target CapEx below 2%. So depending on where the growth rates are, we may have years where we have to add capacity and I'll point specifically to the packaging capacity that we've come online with into our new France with the idea we have a lot of confidence in our market share opportunities there. We continue to build out our Statesville architectural plant net capacity again with our confidence in our growth opportunities both in the Southeast on the architectural paint stores and I would argue in consumer brands group that's facing some short-term headwinds, but certainly a lot of confidence in the outlook. And then we will keep the dividend at approximately 30% of prior EPS and then absent acquisitions we will buy our stock back. Jim Jaye : And Jeff, this is Jim. From a regional perspective on stores, we don't typically give too much commentary, but I would tell you that in this current quarter, our Southwest division was the leader in the clubhouse. And I'd point out too that that was an area where we've seen one of our competitors close their doors. And so you can read that a little bit as some of the share gains that we've been talking about. Operator : Your next question is from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : So on the gross margin front, you put up this [488] number really high despite some soft volumes. I guess, was the bulk of this price versus raws in terms of the improvement? And if not, how should we be thinking about some of the efficiency and some of the simplicity measures that you've been making? Because obviously, volumes really didn't drive this one entirely. So I guess, how should we be thinking about the big drivers there? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, John, we had a couple of things driving our better gross margin performance in the quarter. Moderating raw materials, certainly is part of that. The price realization that we saw in the second quarter being better than what we saw in the first quarter, along with mix. We did have some global supply chain efficiencies outside of the higher fixed cost absorption that we have talked about in the first quarter, again, was really the entire driver of the consumer brand improvement in the second quarter. But you also have our Paint Stores Group growing faster than the other segments. We've talked about that as that happens, that a higher gross margin it will drive our mix better and continue to drive our gross margin. And really carry that momentum into the second half. And I do expect to see gross margin expansion in the second half, maybe not as much as we saw in the first half, driven by higher Paint Stores Group sales Res Repaint being at the high end of that range. We're going to see moderating raw material costs. But we also should see better price effectiveness in our second half versus our first half. So continuation of what we've seen in the first half, just not as heavy because of the raw material tailwind won't be as high. . Heidi Petz : And then, John, I would add to that, you lay in additional volume when we're not in such a choppy environment and that's only going to help continue to stretch us. Operator : Your next question for today is from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Just curious, I think your outlook for the stores was market demand not getting better in the second half. What do you think happens if demand gets worse? Or do you see that as a possibility? I mean would your share gains actually accelerate in that environment? And then -- more importantly, how are the colors for the Guardian selling these days? I would hope really well. Heidi Petz : Well, I'll start with the first question. You know what, I think, first and foremost, we have to be prepared for any environment, which is why we're taking a very realistic approach within a choppy environment. But I think as you look by segment is where some of those answers lie. So in terms of Res Repaint, again, we've continued to talk about this because by design, this is an area of incredible market share gain opportunity for us. And I think we've demonstrated that in a down market, we've continued to take share. So I think that's a really good litmus test of how we will operate in the down market. Having said that, as we -- without repeating what we did cover in the prepared remarks, we're going to be very thoughtful where we see the indicators that are driving growth by segment and make sure that we're pacing our investments to what that growth looks like. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Mike, the only thing I'd add to that is if you look at our second half guide for Paint Stores, it's in line with what we expected coming into the year with Res Repaint outperforming, commercial property maintenance about where we thought new res certainly improving in the second half. And then P&M with the delayed projects was maybe a little bit softer, but certainly not too far outside our guide or our expectations coming into the year. I missed the Guardian question other than they're not hitting the baseball and they're not going to win it. Jim Jaye : Still in first place, though, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Adam Baumgarten : Just curious if you can give some color on how the Pros Who Paint business performs relative to the overall segment in the quarter? Heidi Petz : Yes, the -- certainly, we're continuing to be a bit under pressure here, just in North America. Pros Who Paint continues to be a really important segment for us. As you know, this is a segment that we've also continued to talk about making sure that we're investing at the right point to continue to partner with our retailer customers relative to reps and all the other things that we think are really important in this segment. Al, I know we had talked about a little bit on the Pro Who Paints and you were going to jump in on some color commentary relative to outlook. I think there's a balance here in terms of making sure that we're working in lockstep with our strategic partners. Allen Mistysyn : I just think that the -- when you look at some of the leading indicators that we're following LIRA, we expect to bottom out here in the third quarter and improve in the fourth quarter. And even and that's made up of the higher ticket projects and the lower ticket projects. And I think what we've seen in the past is if you're not remodeling a kitchen, you still have to feed your family. So you revert to maybe some smaller ticket projects to fill in those gaps, and that's what we expect to see going through the second half. Clearly, DIY is where we're seeing the most pressure through the first half and into the second half. And this is why I think the investment -- we're confident in that Pro Who Paint strategy, the investments we made and our ability to get a return on that. And we're looking longer term. We're not looking just to run for the second half of this year. We're looking out '25 and '26 and being best positioned to gain share as that channel and piece of -- segment of the channel comes back. Heidi Petz : Adam, one piece I want to add in here, and Al said this, I think, really well. But the Pros Who Paint strategy is a critical part of our strategy. We are very confident this is going to create not just a nice financial but a strategic win for our shareholders. This is a segment that we are just not set up to serve in our stores organization. It is a segment that has high growth high-margin opportunity, and it's strategically very important that in our strategic partnerships that we also have access to this important and growing segment. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Michael Leithead : Just on your income statement, you recorded a $32 million other income net in the quarter, which is a bit large versus prior year last quarter. What is that? And is that allocated to the administrative segment or one of the businesses? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. When you look at that line specifically, and it's really the move in FX goes through there. You know what Mike, what I just address is all the other general other income. We did see credits in the quarter environmental FX and then gain on sales. If you look at it net year-over-year versus it's about a $0.12 tailwind. We did have a higher effective tax rate, which was a headwind of about net $0.07. So if you net those out, we're still up a low double-digit percentage. Not expecting that size of credits going through our second half, even though as expected coming into the year, a beat on non-operating costs year-over-year in our second half was expected. I still expect that because we had some higher environmental and some other charges in our second half last year that I'd expect environmental and other income lines to get back in line as it typically has been in the past. Operator : Your next question for today is from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Patrick Cunningham : I'm curious on your outlook for the key performance coatings verticals. Where do you see underlying markets trending in the back half? And where do you see the most upside from share gain opportunities? Heidi Petz : Yes, Patrick, I'll start with that. Let me first start at the portfolio level. I think if you look across PCG in total, our margin performance is demonstrating the value that we're delivering. And those that are value what we do, which is helping them make more money or certainly rewarding us for some of these share gains. So if I look at kind of by division here, packaging, I'll start here. We're gaining share outside of the U.S. And per our second half guide, we do expect the progress to continue relative to United States. If you look within packaging, there's -- we know that the technology that we bring to the market is unique. We know it's solving a lot of issues for our customers and our brand owners. We're putting some investment, as you know, into new capacity, preparing for this growth, and we're confident that we're going to continue to see a run up here. Coil is a really good example of our strategy at work. We're winning. We're taking share, and I would attribute that to the team and their excellent execution at the fastest response time delivering customizable solutions, very consistent quality and we've got our tech service team there to support production. I hit on auto refinish, so I won't repeat that. And we did mention industrial wood. As you look certainly with new residential improvements, we would expect that to be a potential tailwind for us in the back half, still choppy, but we're building on a good foundation as we've been up last quarter in all regions. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : A two-part question for you on DIY demand. First, could you just speak in general terms about how you would expect your professional contractor sales versus DIY sales to trend in the stores moving forward? And then the second part would be, if I look at your DIY flowing through company owned stores, it's comfortably positive year-to-date. And in the consumer segment, of course, DIY has been quite challenged well into the red. Can you talk about that disparity? And what are the, I don't know, two or three most important reasons behind that? Heidi Petz : Yes. It's a good observation, Kevin. And I think you've characterized that well. We often talk about this segment, it's having slightly two different segments. If you think about the DIY consumer in our stores, they're looking for that specialty paint store experience and candidly expect the service that goes along with that, little bit less sensitive in the current macro. The DIY that prefers a home center environment tends to be more value conscious and is certainly feeling the pressure as we talked about prepared remarks early relative to inflation, depleted savings and household debt. So those pressures are very real for that consumer. Having said that, I do want to kind of run right at this question because this is an area that I would tell you, we absolutely do not have our heads in the sand relative to our performance in DIY and certainly relative to our expectations, in the segment. This is a very important segment for us over the long-term. Al referenced that earlier as part of our overall architectural strategy. And when you look at the importance of making sure that we are well positioned here, we understand that there are cycles, certainly in the DIY consumer space. Fundamental belief that we're in a log jam in housing that is going to free up. And so our focus on ensuring we are best positioned with the best strategic partners including our exclusive and growing partnership with Lowe's, among others. So as the market begins to recover, we're very confident in our ability that we will continue to deliver above-market growth. But again, our heads are not in the sand right now and we're going to be laser focused on making sure that we are locked up with our partners. Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin, the comment on DIY through our Paint Stores Group, but part of that is the price increases or the price increase that we took in our stores that is certainly impacting the DIY customer as well as the Pro. Operator : Your next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich : I'd love to follow-up on two things. First, understanding volume price mix and FX, both in the second quarter and what's implied from your back half guide? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Greg, if you look at our second quarter with our sales up 0.5% volume and price were up slightly, acquisitions at less than 1%. And we also had the headwind of the divestitures and FX. But really the driver in the quarter was our Paint Stores Group up 3.5%, both segment that segment of PCG segment was where we expected, and we talked about the miss on consumer. If I look at the second half, kind of a little bit up low-single-digits guide compared to low-single-digit comparison last year. I think price is expected to be up low-single-digit percentage. And when you look at -- that would tell you that volume is expected to be up or down low-single-digits. And then all the other impacts are, I'd say, immaterial, less than 1%. FX is unfavorable. A little bit of tailwind in acquisitions and again, a little bit of a headwind on the divestitures, but not material. I'd call out Paint Stores Group, just to be clear, and I said this before, second half, we expect volume and price to be up low-single-digits. Consumer down high single to low-double digits, really the continued softness in DIY. We do expect the price to be flat and that's primarily increases we see in Latin America. FX will be a headwind of about [1.5] and then the remainder is volume down high-single-digits and then within PCG for the second half, I expect up low-single-digits. Acquisitions will be a tailwind of the low-single-digits and then FX, about 1% headwind in price because of the small number of accounts we have on index will actually be a small headwind. Operator : Your next question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : On the slide deck and also in your prepared comments, you alluded to consumer affordability impacting portions of your business such as Consumer Brands and also parts of Performance Coatings, I think you cited ought to refinish as it relates to deductibles. Switching to the Paint Stores segment, are your customers citing incremental issues as it relates to the same consumer affordability dynamic relative to the baseline of what you've already seen over the last 18 months or so? Heidi Petz : Ghansham, I would characterize it maybe a little bit differently that there are always going to be value conscious, I would say, more so than focused on maybe the true price affordability piece. And so it's incumbent upon us that every day we are doing what we say we will do is delivering a consistent, reliable service disease, more discerning and very habitual contractors that candidly just expect that from us. And so making sure that we're delivering that value every day, I think, is clearly on display for us and it changes their understanding, we are not having price conversations with them. We're talking about helping them grow their business and helping them make more money. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Stephen Byrne : Can you help me understand what led to the higher fixed cost absorption in consumer? Your volumes were down year-over-year. And Al, you mentioned improved efficiencies. What was there an operating rate improvement that in spite of lower volumes that led to that lower cost structure? Can you quantify that for us? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. Steve, as I talked about on our first quarter call, this is consistent with our first quarter. We talked about the choppiness in production volumes that we experienced over the last four or five years and updating our cost our standards to match those higher costs on the conversion side. I talked about this at SCP last year that, that's really been a drag on our Consumer Brands Group. And we thought we could get efficiencies out -- to offset those costs, so we wouldn't have to do a reset to our standard costs like we did coming into this year. It's really not an impact on our overall gross margin because it is offset between Paint Stores Group and Performance Coatings Group, both of which I said on our first quarter call, we're not going to detail that out. We don't think it's material. And you can certainly see that with our Performance Coatings Group performance up to 19.4%, which is an all-time high first half is 18.3% an all-the-time high. And then certainly, we see the improvement in our Paint Stores Group. So you're going to see that phenomenon continued through the second half, I did call out that the entire improvement in Consumer Brands Group operating profit is due to those higher fixed cost absorption really partially offset by a decline in profits when you look at it related to the volume -- sales volume, North America DIY sales volume shortfall that we experienced in the second quarter. So like I said, we're going to continue down this path. My expectation is we'll get more consistent. Think of it as a base to build off into the future on consumer operating margin. Operator : Your next question for today is from Josh Spector with UBS. Josh Spector : So I wanted to ask on Res Repaint. It's obviously been a source of strength for you this year. I mean in the event that you don't really get any improvement in housing turnover next year or maybe it ticks down. I'd be curious if you'd characterize if you want to think about either your backlog or your opportunity to win in that scenario, basically meaning have we been perhaps still over-earning from a slew of projects coming completion with lower turnover or is that a zero or low risk in your view relative to the market? . Heidi Petz : I think it's zero. I mean, I think, Josh, it's a good question. I think the health of those backlog is real. And certainly, we're making the right investments at the right time to ensure that we're well positioned. When you talk about kind of the source of strength here, there's certainly opportunity to take share across the market. This has been an area of strength for us because we understand how to do something. I truly believe that no one can do with this segment. And I take it back to the controlled distribution model that we have. So not only are we investing and laying in reps at the right pace in the right geographies, but we're arming these reps with the world's largest database of painting contractors were laser focused on from day 1, ensuring they have the tools, the understanding what they need to go in and help our contractors to grow their business, to travel to be more successful. So when I think about success in this space and the upside, I don't think that there's a finish line here. We've got -- we're early innings in my opinion here, and we've got a lot of upside. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Michael Harrison : Another question on the Performance Coatings Group. You said that in the general industrial portion of that business, demand was lower across all regions. Can you kind of walk us through those regions and comment on how things are trending, your expectations for the second half? I guess, are there some signs of improvement in any regions or at least lapping some prior year weakness in general industrial? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, I would say on the -- I'd say on the positive side, starting with that, you do see less of a slowdown in North America. And let me take a step back. It all starts with share gains in this type environment, share gains, share of wallet and differentiation. I think North America will be less of a headwind. I think Europe, again, is we don't expect a lot coming out of Europe in the second half. We do expect Latin America and Asia to -- I'm sorry, Asia Pacific to be positive, more so in Asia against a really soft comp but Latin America holding up. So I think across the regions, North America, as you know, is our largest region across all of PCG and do expect it to moderate as we get through the second half. Heidi Petz : And Mike, I think to the team's credit, I would say our focus here, given the fundamentals of the core has been laser focused on new account growth. And I would tell you that that's holding up better than the market. So the team is focused on the right activities here to offset some of the pressure. Operator : Your next question is from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Duffy Fischer : If I could, just a clarification. Al, I thought you said that pricing didn't do as well in the second quarter as you had hoped. Can you just kind of walk us through of the 5% that you announced earlier this year? You kind of usually talked about 60% being realized within a year. How do we trend from where we're at now to getting to that, let's say, 3% of your 5%? Allen Mistysyn : Yes, Duffy, we mentioned that the price increase effectiveness improved as the quarter went on, and we exited the quarter at our targeted effectiveness rate. So I would expect to see that kind of realization. We have built into our forecast that kind of realization, low-single-digit and then volume low-single-digit in the second half. . Operator : Your next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Heidi, can you talk to the cadence of earnings in the back half of the year? And specifically on CBG margins, Al were you implying that they would be up in Q3 versus Q2? Allen Mistysyn : No, David, I didn't mean to imply that if that's the way it was taken. It really -- where we're at from an operating margin standpoint within CBG, it will be dependent on where we're at in the sales range and what volume does through the quarter and really through the second half. As you know, we still will expect to see a seasonal architectural slowdown in our fourth quarter. But whether we see sequential improvement in our operating margin, it's really going to depend on sales -- North America DIY sales volume. Operator : Your next question is from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Al, I wanted to follow-up on your CBG comment that you made earlier that this is the margin level you can build on. So if we think about 2025 or 2026, can we think of this low 20s operating margin plus some volume levers, perhaps in the pace of recovery? So this could be a mid to high-20 margins with volume leverage? Or are there any offsets and perhaps some part of this margin story is not sustainable longer term? Allen Mistysyn : No. Like, we have talked in the past, our expectation for Consumer Brands, operating margin is high teens, low 20s. And certainly, we challenge our group and divisions to continue to raise that bar. Volume is the #1 driver of operating margin performance in all our segments, as you well know, and that clearly showed itself in 2020 during the pandemic when we had really strong volumes in consumer out-the-door sales, that drove the operating margins higher. And I would expect that as we continue -- as we see a turn in the market and we start seeing volume to grow, we'll get leverage on that volume. Operator : Your next question is from John Roberts with Mizuho. John Roberts : DIY is mostly interior, I think. So was it unusual for interior to outgrow exterior this quarter? Or was that the weather effect and painters switched to interior when the weather is unfavorable? Allen Mistysyn : Yes. John, I think that's the case. They'll work on jobs where they have the opportunity and they have just lined up. I'll use Res Repaint six \u2013 eight weeks backlogs in advance so they can take advantage of really good weather and do exterior projects. And then again, if it's a wet rainy week, they can pivot and move to interior products -- projects. Operator : Your next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Nice quarter. You explained the price sensitivity of customers purchasing architectural in the CBG group, why does not extend to residential projects in the Paint Stores Group? I know some of those projects are bigger and maybe higher end, but you seem to clearly buck that trend in the Paint Stores Group. Allen Mistysyn : Yes. I think Chuck, within consumer, we've talked about a different kind of DIY customer and that's where the bulk of the volume is they are more sensitive to inflation, the amount of debt they have. You look at some of those headwinds that Heidi talked about in her opening remarks. It's less so on the DIY side in our stores. And like we talked about, there is a price impact on DIY in our stores. And I think if you look at our Pro, specifically in Res Repaint, we've mentioned this. I think the teams have done a really good job about driving new business through our stores to drive that mid-single-digit growth over the last three quarters in a down market. So it's not that the Res Repainters are immune or those end consumers are immune to higher cost, it's just we continue to take share because of the investments we've continually made and being very consistent about that. HeidiPetz: I think it also points to the value of a specialty paint store model, which is certainly on the DIY side, an expectation of premium product, but it is an equally high expectation of that premium service and the willingness to pay for that service and the homeowner color selection, all of the things that go along with us being innovating in and out of the can is a great example of a consumer that values that type of solution. Operator : Your next question is from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Garik Shmois : I wanted to ask about raw materials. How much were raws down in 2Q and is flat in the back half of the year, still a good assumption. I think that was the outlook previously. Allen Mistysyn : So raws, the basket was down mid-single digits year-over-year in the second quarter. And for the full year, we're still picking or saying that the full year will be down low singles. So that tells you the back half is flattish year-over-year. Operator : Your next question is from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Eric Bosshard : A question on revenue in two different areas, if I could. The consumer mix, just curious versus 90 days ago, what is so different that is driving the magnitude of the shortfall there? And then on the store side, I'm curious on Res Repaint, the market down and you up mid-single digit. I'm just curious to dive into both of those a little bit, if you would, in terms of the momentum of the market into the back half and then the ability to sustain the magnitude of the share gains of up five in the down market? Heidi Petz : So let me start with your first question on the revenue, the CBG mix or kind of what's changed in 90 days. And I would simply put it as -- again, we said this in the prepared remarks, but characterizing this as it's just simply been softer longer. If you look at just the DIY North America market being under pressure. So the fundamentals are not -- have not recovered at the pace that we'd like to see. As it relates to stores and Res Repaint, sustainability of our performance there being up mid-single digits in a down market. I would point to a few things, again, on the fundamentals. First and foremost, it's the segment where we have the greatest upside. So the market share gain runway is material. I would also point to, again, going back to the investments that we have made. And as our team is watching the market very closely and we know the indicators to watch. We'll get as aggressive as we need to be and as realistic as we need to be based on what we see in the market. So our ability to ramp that up. I think we've proven that we can respond pretty quickly to be best positioned for that upside. Operator : Your next question is from Aron Ceccarelli with Berenberg. Aron Ceccarelli : I have a question on Res Repaints. Maybe can you talk a little bit about the profitability of new accounts as you continue to bear market share. If I understood correctly before, you mentioned that usually new accounts came at premium, so the higher margin. I was a little bit surprised. So I would like to ask if you can maybe dig a little bit more into that? And how this should pan out as your market share gains continue? Heidi Petz : Yes. Let me start with that, just based on my earlier comment. If you kind of picture a bell curve of a new Res Repaint contractor coming in new versus kind of a more mature Res Repaint contractor, where we've earned over time, more share of wallet. My comment is relative to kind of first and foremost, making sure that we're getting them in and getting them set up on the right products. So when we talk about making sure our customers are making more money, oftentimes there, and that is a conversation of getting them in the right premium product that's helping them get their crews on and off the job site faster, less touch up required. So when you look at the total cost of a project, they're making more money. So making sure that we're helping our teams to help set our customers up for success at the very beginning. And then again, along that bell curve, where there's more maturity of this particular contractor, they could be bigger in size, they may be traveling our teams are meeting them exactly where they are and helping them if they're looking to travel and grow work from store to store or repo playing the role proactively help set them up again and then we're able to leverage our data and our database to put our reps in position to help these contractors kind of optimize what it is their how they're leaning in on us for products, services, all of our digital tools, et cetera. Operator : Your next question is from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Just very quickly, will your raw materials in your base case? Will your raw material cost be up year-over-year in Q4? Allen Mistysyn : Flattish. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Heidi, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I think you heard today that while the macro is certainly very choppy, we're very confident in our strategy. We're very well positioned and we're acting to continue outperforming the markets. The global team is aligned and we're focused on our strategy of driving that profitable growth by providing solutions for our customers. Today, you heard we've increased our full year guidance. And as Heidi mentioned, and we've often said, if our sales do prove to be better than what we've outlined today, we would expect our bottom line performance to be better as well. I'll close with, I just want to remind everyone, we have our financial community presentation, which is scheduled for August 29 in Boston starting at 1 :30. You'll hear from Heidi, Al and other members of our management team, along with our typical Q&A session. So you can register for that on our IR website or feel free to e-mail our Investor Relations team. They'll also be webcast, and that date again is August 29. So with that, I will thank you again for your interest in Sherwin, and have a great rest of your day. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company Review of the Third Quarter 2024 Results and our Outlook for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2024. With us on today\u2019s call are Heidi Petz, President and CEO; Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Finance; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under US Federal Securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statements speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company\u2019s earnings release, transmitted earlier this morning. After the company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you, and good morning. In our third quarter, characterized by ongoing choppy demand, Sherwin-Williams grew consolidated sales, expanded gross margin and grew diluted earnings per share and EBITDA. Sales in all three segments were within our guidance range. We also returned $631 million to our shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. We remain highly confident in our strategy and importantly, our team's ability to execute consistently. We continued to invest in the quarter to capitalize on what we see as unprecedented long-term share gain opportunity. We expect these continued near-term investments in stores, sales and technical reps, incremental services and digital capabilities to drive sustained and profitable above-market growth. We also expect the pace of investment to moderate in the fourth quarter resulting in second half SG&A growth in the more normalized low to mid-single-digit level we have previously described. As far as our outlook, we are maintaining our full year EPS guidance. We recognize the current range is wider than typical entering the fourth quarter. This range accounts for several variables that are hard to forecast precisely over the next two months, including timing of demand related to recovery from hurricanes Helene and Milton and the potential for extended holiday shutdowns among our industrial customers. Our team continues to navigate these and other near-term challenges while executing on multiple initiatives to drive our long-term success. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will comment on our third quarter results by segment before moving on to our outlook and your questions. Heidi Petz : Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Before I begin my comments on the quarter and our outlook, please know that thoughts and sympathies go out to all those that have been impacted by the recent hurricanes in the Southeast US. Our priority has been the safety of our employees, our customers and their families. We've been working hard to provide our people with appropriate support and I'm amazed at how our teams on the ground have come together to help each other. Approximately 200 of our stores were closed for some period in the third quarter following Hurricane Helene and nearly all were back online by the end of the quarter. Similarly, approximately 225 stores were closed for some period following Hurricane Milton at the start of the fourth quarter, and most of those stores are also now back online. The perseverance and resiliency of our people are inspiring. I could not be prouder of the personal and professional support they are providing our customers as recovery and rebuild efforts begin. At our recent financial community presentation, I described our success by design approach. We deliberately make the right choices and the right investments at the right time to drive sustained above-market growth and returns over the long term. It's an approach that has worked for us for decades and is exactly what we are doing right now. The current opportunity to gain market share is nearly unprecedented, and we will continue to take full advantage of it. While competitors are distracted or inconsistent in their execution, we offer consistency, stability and reliability. We are a predictable partner. We're doubling down on our strategy because we know it works. Our team is focused, determined and aggressive. We continue to provide our customers with solutions to make them more productive and profitable. We have great confidence in what we are doing, and we believe our results will continue to demonstrate outperformance over time. As far as specifics on the third quarter, we'll begin with the Paint Stores Group, where sales increased by low single digits. Volume and price were both up low single digits. Pro architectural pricing realization was in the range we anticipated but was partially offset by unfavorable mix. Segment margin decreased to 24.5% due primarily to higher investments in long-term growth opportunities and mix the quarter. Protective & Marine was up high single digits against a low double-digit comparison and has a solid pipeline of projects extending into next year. In Residential Repaint, our prior investments continued to pay off, as we delivered the fifth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit growth in a flat to down market. New Residential also grew at a mid-single-digit rate in a choppy but improving market. Commercial grew by low single digits against a high single-digit comparison. Property Management was flat with continued delays in CapEx projects. DIY remains soft. From a product perspective, interior paint sales grew faster than exterior paint sales where outdoor conditions caused delays in some of our largest regions. We have opened 45 net new stores year-to-date and expect to open 80 to 100 for the full year. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased by high single digits, inclusive of an approximate 4% impact from unfavorable FX. Sales in North America decreased by a high single-digit percentage, where weakness in existing home sales and inflation continue to pressure the DIY market. In Europe, sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage. In Latin America, volume and price were positive, but were more than offset by unfavorable FX. Adjusted segment margin expanded to 22.9%. This was primarily driven by higher fixed cost absorption in the manufacturing and distribution operations within the segment and effective cost control, partially offset by lower net sales. In the Performance Coatings Group, net sales were effectively flat as volume was offset by unfavorable FX. Adjusted segment margin decreased to 18%, primarily due to lower sales in North America and unfavorable FX. This high teens margin level demonstrates the continued strong performance that reflects our differentiated customer solutions and business optimization efforts. We continue to see choppy demand by division and region. Packaging delivered high single-digit growth with sales up in every region. Coil also delivered solid growth, driven by share gains. Industrial Wood grew low single digits, driven by an acquisition. New account wins in Auto Refinish have been masked by softness in our core business where consumer reluctance to pay deductibles is resulting in lower insurance claims. General Industrial continued to face headwinds in heavy equipment and transportation markets. Regionally, sales in the group were positive in all regions except North America, which decreased by a low single-digit percentage. Moving on to our guidance. The slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2024. The deck also includes our updated guidance for consolidated and segment sales for the full year 2024. Our full year diluted net income per share guidance is unchanged. Our adjusted diluted net income per share growth remains at 8.7% over the prior year at the midpoint of our guidance. We are absolutely focused on executing our plan in the fourth quarter and delivering full year EPS results in the range we provided July. I also recognize that many of you are beginning to formulate your views for 2025. While we're not providing any specific guidance until January, I can share some high-level commentary that may be useful as a preliminary framework. The single largest variable heading into next year is the timing and pacing of a true inflection in the demand environment. We stand by our FCP commentary, but it's only a question of when, not if. However, trying to peg this to a specific quarter, let alone a specific month or a week, it's not something we can do with precision. Our forecasting models incorporate a wide variety of indicators, including LIRA, existing home sales, housing starts, housing affordability, interest rates, consumer spending, and industrial production among many others. Direct input from our customers is a critical data point that also informs our outlook. While several signals are beginning to move from red to yellow and some from yellow to green, our initial view is that demand is likely to remain choppy in the first half of the year. What is certain is our strategy. We deliver differentiated solutions that make our customers more productive and more profitable. The good news is that in a macro and a competitive environment like the current one, approach becomes even more valuable to our current customers, while also attracting many new ones. We will continue being very aggressive in pursuit of new business and share of wallet gains. Sherwin-Williams is incredibly well-positioned in each of our targeted end markets. We are confident we will outperform the market in all environments and significantly so when demand becomes more robust. We are committed to driving success by design for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Certainly. Everyone at this time, we're conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. If I could just ask on the SG&A spend, it seems like there was a tactical decision made in the third quarter just based on the cadence of the spend that you anticipated for the back half. It seems like all of a sudden, you pulled more into 3Q than in 4Q. Could you talk about what precipitated that and exactly what you did? Just to give us a sense of what's going on there? Heidi Petz : Yes. Let me start. Vincent, appreciate the question. I'm going to hand it to Al here to talk a bit about cadence and timing. But a few things, I think, that that are really important playing out and as you heard in my prepared remarks, I would tell you we see this as the ideal time to invest in our long-term strategy, and candidly, an opportunity to widen the competitive moat. We're going to continue to capitalize on this, making sure that we are best positioned in areas where our competitors aren't even seeing some of these opportunities. So we're not waiting for the market to recover fully or to tell us it's time to invest. We're going to continue to keep our head down and make sure we're getting rewarded for these efforts. We will tell you amount in front of customers often and they're sharing with us that competitors are out-promising some of these investments and making all types of commitments to try mirror what we're doing at Sherwin-Williams. But because we are confident we've got the best assets at the absolute best people in industry and best technology, we're going to continue to lay in these investments now well ahead of the cycle, well ahead of what's coming into next year. And one more comment before I hand this over to Al, I would very much tell you that I would do this 10 out of 10 times. I think there's no doubt about it, we're confident in our strategy, but we are absolutely going to invest, we're going to win and we're going to continue to deliver for our customers. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Vincent, this is Al Mistysyn. As we have typically done, we're managing growth and operating margin, and we expect a higher gross margin in the second half of the year than we forecasted coming into the quarter. So as we normally do and I reaffirm this at our Investor Day, we take some of that improvement invested in the long-term growth opportunities, particularly in Paint Stores Group that Heidi mentioned. And just to reaffirm what I said on our second quarter call, we are confident in our strategy. We have a consistent investment thesis, and I'm confident we'll get a return for those investments that we are making. And we can point to that like in res repaint up mid single digits over the last five quarters, showing the returns that we're getting for the investments we made in the second half, I think your comment is right. If I look at our second half forecast, it's in line, SG&A is in line with where I thought coming into the quarter. So there's a little bit of timing in that. So right in line with what we're expecting for the second half. And then the only other piece on that is the continued investments in our digital initiatives and our system modernizations that we've been undertaking. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. Chris Parkinson : Great. Good morning. Could you hit a little bit more on the pricing dynamics for 2024 and then 2025 on a preliminary basis in terms of how we're thinking about realizations, whether or not just the current sluggish environment, even though you're selling a lot of share is holding back from perhaps better realization 2024 and whether or not we could potentially see a bit of a constructive or positive pendulum in terms of those realizations as the market further improves in 2025? Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Yeah, Chris. As Jim talked about, we announced the 5% price increase in stores, effective January 6th. And the reason behind that is we're feeling pressure and increased feedstocks. We have wage inflation, which is more of a typical increase that we're expecting we're expecting in 2025, but also health care to be significantly higher year-over-year. And I think you're right. The price increase is about where we expect it to be. It's offset by mix and we talk about P&M being stronger, DIY being weaker, which weighs on that overall average selling price. I think when you look into 2025, I think we're going to get into this historical range of 50% to 60%, I'd say. And that's really driven by timing of a number of our national account contracts. We fully expect to get increases. But there's also a new competitive dynamics in the North America architectural market, and have to see how that plays out. But we're committed in this -- you know as we have discipline in getting price when we need it and our expectation is we need it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Roberts from Mizuho. Your line is live. John Roberts : Thank you. In consumer, there was an interesting divergence between the sales change and the earnings change there. Did the change in inter-segment transfers was that significantly different than the change in the externally reported sales? Al Mistysyn : No, John, we did -- the allocation that I talked about in the first quarter and second quarter is the same. Global supply chain with a little bit better volume did perform better in the entire increase and our segment profit was due to that dynamic. If you look at -- on the commercial side, our North America business actually went backwards in PBT because of volume. And that's been a consistent theme over the last three quarters and even into last -- going back to last year. So no real change to the allocation. It's just they performed better. The team -- I give the team a lot of credit. They're managing their costs tightly and operating more efficiently in a more stable demand dynamic with inventory and production. Heidi Petz : And John, I would add to that as well. I give the team a lot of credit for a continued focus on refining that portfolio. I'll take you back to some of the key decisions that were made over the last few quarters and years relative to the China divestiture some non-strategic aerosol business. There's a handful of categories and businesses that the team absolutely was focused on where we can get strong organic core growth, and we walked away from some of those. So a new and improved baseline going forward. This business we talked about at our Analyst Day has really been by design built for speed and profit. So a leaner, meaner or fighting machine, if you will. So excited for the volume to come back so we can realize that [indiscernible]. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO. Your line is live. John McNulty : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, when you think about the competitive landscape and some of the changes that have taken place. I think, Kelly Moore and PPG are pretty well understood, I think, at this point, in terms of where the opportunities are. But it does look like there are other changes throughout the industry. I mean you've got BSF kind of unloading some assets and AXO [ph] potentially doing the same. So I guess, can you speak to the other competitive parts of your environment in terms the store's business -- or excuse me, in terms of the consumer business, and the PCG group and if you see opportunities there? And then I guess also maybe tied to that on the consumer side, can you speak to how that that customer landscape is looking right now in terms of destocking and where inventories may be at this point as well? Heidi Petz : Yes, good morning, John. I'll start with your first question relative to some of the competitive moves and then I'll hand this over to Al to talk about your question on PCG. I think you nailed it. And I think, first of all, let me be really clear there are always opportunities. There's certainly been a lot of shift. In fact, the way that we look at this and take you back to some of our focus on believing in our long-term strategy, our differentiation investing ahead of the curve, we do see this as a unique moment in our industry, where we are being laser focused on simply doing what we say we will do. It's amazing. I'm out with customers. The feedback I hear is you guys are consistent, reliable, dependable, it's amazing what a differentiator that is. So we're holding very firm there and making sure that in a down market in an environment where there is a moment in our industry, we're going to invest. It's a hallmark of Sherwin-Williams. I think you're seeing that playing out in real time. But we're always going to continue to look and assess. And if there are opportunities for us to strengthen or accelerate our strategy, we're always open to those reviews. Al Mistysyn : Yes, John, I think, in particular, the consumer, I think inventory levels have been pretty stable. We certainly do not or don't believe that the impact on our sales in the quarter for consumer was due to destocking. I think it's just been a soft -- continued soft DIY market. And I think you alluded to maybe some of the other opportunities -- if there's opportunities for M&A, we certainly take a disciplined approach to that as we always have, and we look at how different assets accelerate our strategy. And if they're in the right segments, in the right regions, then yes, we'll take a look at them. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Heidi, now on the PPG business, it's roughly $2 billion in sales in North America. How much of that business do you think is potentially up for grabs? Or are you targeting going forward? Heidi Petz : Well, I'll start with -- we're focused, first and foremost, on the quality sales there very consistent, as we've talked about relative to all of our portfolio. We're not interested in commodities. We want to simply focus on the premium segments at value what it is that we do and what we deliver every day. I will tell you maybe a better way -- I don't know if it's a better way or the way that we're framing that same question, David, would be Kelly-Moore, I would characterize as more of a short-term share grab opportunity. PPG, I would characterize as more of a long term where there was a lot of respect for that company and we've got to get out in front of these customers and earn every gallon every day and make sure that they understand when we bring them into Sherwin-Williams that we want to work hard to service them and build a lifelong customer. So in terms of quantifying the exact number, I can tell you it's more about making sure it's the quality sales that we want to earn and keep over time. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Your line is live. Mike Harrison : Hi. Good morning. I was hoping that you could speak to your view on remodeling demand and how that could trend? I'm just curious with interest rates coming down and maybe more homeowners potentially tapping into that home equity that they have as we've seen home prices go up, do you see that as something that's going to be an important driver next year? What are your -- I guess, internal indicators suggesting about the remodeling side of the market? Thank you. Jim Jaye : Yeah, good morning, Mike, this is Jim. Yeah, I think your question is very timely. I mean if you look just this morning in the Wall Street Journal, there was an article about America being primed for a home renovation resurgence. So I think that fits in with our longer-term view where that market is going. We've often talked about some of the indicators that we look at, Lira being one of them, and that's going to start to tick up sometime probably second, third quarter next year. I do think there is some pent-up demand on the existing home sales. Those numbers, as you know, have been down year-over-year for a long period of time. But as the economy improves, inflation wanes a little bit, people feeling good about the equity in their homes, I think there is a great opportunity for us. Al mentioned and Heidi mentioned the investments that we've laid in ahead of that, right? And you're already seeing it in our Res Repaint numbers being up mid-single digits in a period where the market is flat at best. So once we start to get some help there, we feel very good about where we're headed and expect our res repaint business to be very solid, and that will also help our DIY piece as well. Heidi Petz : Mike, I think this is a -- it's a great question. It's a really good example of -- of this idea success by design. I give Justin Binns and his organization, incredible credit here. I mean you've got a lot of changing in the landscape and the team has been head down at the right point, focused on our differentiation, focus on our -- the value that we can create here. So we're not waiting for the market. To Jim's point, when we do see more moderate recovery, we'll absolutely be best positioned to take advantage of that. But the team is not waiting and making sure that we're out solving some of these needs for these contractors and building loyalty with a lot of new contractors coming into this res repaint space, we're primed for a nice run up here to follow as the market does come back. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Patrick Cunningham from Citi. Your line is live. Patrick Cunningham : Hi. Good morning. You mentioned a couple of variables on the wider range for the guide implied for 4Q. I guess, first, can you help size the hurricane impact in 3Q and sensitivity for 4Q? And then on the holiday shutdowns in industrial, is this something customers are hinting at? And is it broader? Or is it more concentrated in equipment and transportation? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Patrick. If you look at -- I'll start with the third quarter impact because having two -- it's bad enough having one major hurricane, having two major hurricanes and one in the third quarter, one in the fourth quarter, really adds to the speed of the recovery, and that's what makes it a more uncertain outlook in our fourth quarter and why the higher range. And it's not necessarily just our stores being able to be open. It's the time it takes for customers to get back to work, to assess the damage, homeowners reviewing insurance claims, and the type of damage that will dictate the speed of recovery, if it's flooding versus really structural. And I'd say, historically, we've taken about four weeks before you start seeing your primers start to pick up, sundries start to pick up and then paint that follows, I just think in this environment with the small quarter that we have in our fourth quarter, and the dynamics that we're talking about with two major hurricanes, it's hard to predict the timing of it actually coming back online. The impact for Helene in our third quarter was a little less than 1 point. It's primarily stores. If you exclude the impact of that stores, it'd be pretty right in line with guidance. And then probably cost us about $0.05 in the quarter. We didn't call it out. I think we expect to get those sales back in our fourth quarter. It's just -- it's going to ramp up as the quarter progresses. Heidi Petz : And I'll touch briefly on the customer shutdown piece. The way that we're looking at this, and there have been a few examples of more of a temporary shutdown over the holidays and not a lot of noise outside of that. Could that extend potentially, but we're obviously seeing really close with our customers. Karl Jorgenrud and his organization are making sure to stay in lockstep relative to the true demand environment so that we can be the best partners on the other side. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I want to circle back on two things. One is the price increase, the 5%. It sounds like you're getting what you expect, which I would imagine is probably, what, 3% in Paint Stores Group. And then should we think it's a little less not the mix? Is that a fair way to think about it? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Greg, I think when you -- we look at price, we're getting the effectiveness. It's just because you have a lot of different segments and some are performing better than others, it could dilute that price mix because we look at it as price mix in one bucket. And so it's not going to be quite 3% in the quarter. But as we talked about, volume and price are both up low single digits in the third quarter. And as we roll out next year, as an example, as a new res starts to improve like we saw in our third quarter, that mix change versus Res Repaint and DIY is going to dilute some of that price impact. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Park Markets. Your line is live. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning. Could you comment on the backlog trends for pro contractors, please? Jim Jaye : Yes. Sure, Aleksey. I think if you look at the backlogs I'd say, beginning maybe with Res Repaint, a little bit choppy here because of what we've seen with the hurricanes coming in. But overall, I'd say fairly normalized. I mean they're seeing fabs out there. I think the bigger thing for us is the share gain opportunities that we're aggressively pursuing. You look at some of the other verticals that we're in new Res, we're cautiously optimistic, seeing some pick up there. Commercial would be the one where I would say we've hung in there pretty well this year despite there being extended period of slower starts, but our completions, that backlog is being worked through, and we're still up in our commercial business, but our expectation is that commercial, that backlog will start to start to diminish as we get into next year. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Michael Sison : Hey good morning. For the fourth quarter -- yes, can you hear me? Al Mistysyn : Yes. Michael Sison : Yes. Sorry about that. Yes. So, for the fourth quarter, with the growth you're going to see in stores, you've done a nice job there this year. Will segment profit start to turn the corner and grow? And then for 2025, I know you don't want to give the specifics, but if you generate -- what type of, I guess, store growth do you need to sort of get back to positive segment profit growth? And any thoughts on SG&A next year? Or do you think you're done in terms of increases? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, concerning the fourth quarter and we typically don't give detailed guidance, but I would say this, we expect all our operating segments to show margin improvement year-over-year. Obviously, we still expect to see a seasonal slowdown in in architectural sales the fourth quarter that we have historically seen. So, I don't expect to see operating margin expansion in our two architectural businesses. I think as you get into 2025, I think the plan will be very similar to other years. I realized this year because our first half had an outsized growth because of the investments we made in the second half of last year. I think we'll moderate SG&A without giving full guidance today, we'll give a better guidance in our first -- in January, but the expectations are going to be the same. If we believe volume in the second half of the year, and/or gross margin is going to be stronger in the second half of the year. We take advantage of those situations just like we did in the quarter, and we'll put more investments in to accelerate our growth when some of these headwinds that Jim and Heidi have talked about ease up, and we'll take more of a market share than a higher percent of market share as the market turns. Heidi Petz : And I just want to add one piece to that. Al said this really well as we think about more of a moderated SG&A profile next year. I also want to articulate and be very clear that no one's head is in the sand here. While we have had a heightened level by design, we absolutely want to get that return. We owe that to our shareholders, and we expect outsized volume growth. We're going to be relentless until we deliver that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning guys. Just a question on raw materials. I think, Al, you mentioned that see increased cost for feedstocks. So I was wondering if you kind of break it into different buckets. So one, just being inorganics and pigments and the other kind of the oil derivatives? Oil is down 20% from the first half into the third quarter. Why aren't you seeing some relief actually on that front? And what is it that's driving the increased feedstock costs that you're seeing going forward? Jim Jaye : Yeah, Duffy, I'll take that one. So let me just start maybe with what we saw in the third quarter where our raws were flattish year-over-year. We're also looking for them to be flattish year-over-year in the fourth quarter and will come in right around that down low singles that we talked about in our forecast. I think if you look at TiO2 going forward, supply is readily available in the market. And I'd say pricing right now is stable, not seeing a whole lot of impact from tariffs right now. But you also have producers who are evaluating their production levels, et cetera. Ultimately, what's going to drive TiO2 is demand, and we'll see how that plays out. On the oil derivatives, yes, we have seen oil come down here recently. But if you look at propylene, which I know, Duffy, that you know that's the key feedstock for us. If you look in the third quarter, propylene was up year-over-year, almost 50% in the third quarter, and that was really driven, I think, by a planned and unplanned outages. Epoxy resins were also up in the quarter, and there's some additional tariffs that might come in that might impact that. So we're looking at -- we haven't seen that propylene or epoxy necessarily impact our basket meaningfully yet. But we're watching it very closely, and we'll see where it goes as we get into the next year. You know we have maybe a quarter or two of visibility. So we're watching those things. That propylene move is meaningful. Ultimately, it's going to be demand though, which is the big driver. We'll give you our official view in January. We'll continue to watch it. And we look at the entire basket, as you know, not just our raws. We look at our other costs. Our health care continues to be a major headwind for us, et cetera. So that's kind of our view right now with more to come in January. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Leithead from Barclays. Your line is live. Michael Leithead : Thanks. Good morning guys. Actually, Al, I did want to follow-up or circle back on sort of the Paint Stores price increase. It seems like you said raws are, again, uncertain but readily available, demand is fairly choppy right now. So curious how you're positioning this price increase to your customers? And relatedly, I know a lot of the Paint Stores is tailored towards, say, the larger contractor national accounts. But just given some of the ongoing DIY weakness, retail promo activity, are you seeing any customer swing activity over to the big box or not really an impact that you've seen thus far? Al Mistysyn : Not an impact we've seen thus far. As we've talked about, we continue to invest in products and services that help our customers be more effective, grow their top line and grow their bottom line because of the efficiencies they gain by moving up in quality. And when I talk price, I typically include mix in that, and we're consistently working with our customers to provide better service, to provide supply chain resilience, so that we can be their supplier of choice, second supplier of choice on down. So there are other input costs that we're taking into account, as Jim just mentioned, on why we need the price increase and the discipline we have to go out with price when we need it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is live. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Heidi, just in terms of your engagement with major customers specific to PSG, how would you characterize sentiment at their level? It's just more optimism for 2025 as it relates to aggregate activity? I'm just asking because there's been so much noise on volatility with interest rates including the most recent increase in mortgage rates post the Fed cut. So, just curious as to where sentiment stands for 2025? Heidi Petz : Yes. Ghansham, I would say it definitely pertinent by segment. And Jim covered some of that just a few moments ago. I think if you look broadly across in aggregate, there is -- everyone is reading the same macros. Everyone's hoping that these rate cuts are going to have a faster, more material impact. But I think as everyone's pragmatic here and trying to plan for what the reality is into next year, broadly speaking, it is more of a modest back half potential, what I would say is the broad sentiment. You do cut that by segment and Jim alluded to this a bit earlier, where some of these other signals relative to their existing home sales and the like. We're obviously getting a lot more bullish as we have been on Res Repaint. And I would say the Commercial is probably -- the Commercial segment is probably the area where we know that we've got the biggest challenge even throughout the year as some of these projects based on all the reasons you said before, CapEx, labor constraints, kind of live on, I think that's a reality that we're all navigating and I would say, is reflective in our customer sentiment. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is live. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, thank you and good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on the outlook for 2 businesses within the Performance Coatings Group, namely Refinish and Packaging. On the Refinish side, it looks like you've gained some share, but if I understood your commentary correctly, it sounds like that's being masked by lower insurance claims and diminished reluctance to pay deductibles. So, my question would be, do you view that as more a structural or transitory? And would you expect it to reverse at some point in 2025? And on the packaging side, it looks like you had nice acceleration there. Do you expect that to continue in coming quarters? Heidi Petz : Yes. Kevin, I'll start with the Refinish piece. And I think one of the reasons -- one of the big reasons that I wanted to highlight this at our recent financial community presentation is exactly what you said. I think some of that is mass. I love how we're positioned here in this business. If you look at Q3, our sales were impacted by negative low mid-single-digit FX and Latin America, we have more exposure there, just given our mix relative to some of our peers, so you would expect that weight to play out. But if we just take the big approach to your point, is it structural and more kind of transitional. We look at this business over time. You're going to see swings quarter-to-quarter, our sales year-to-date, they are down low single digit against a high single-digit comp. So if you exclude FX from that, our sales are flat which is in line with where our competitors are at in their recent calls. So I want to be really clear that we are not satisfied with this year-to-date number, but it is an environment where claims are down double digits in North America, again, which is our largest region. And having said that, as you look at what is working, and we do expect improving claims, share gains to be a tailwind in next year -- the team has done some fantastic work on our collision core program. We're gaining both momentum and adoption here. And I think it's really important that we continue to look at strengthening what we're doing here. out early November of this year with a high single-digit price increase for our direct customers, and we'll be out with others as necessary, but continue to get paid for what we're doing, but confidence that the team is laser-focused on new accounts and share gains, which I think is absolutely sustainable and systemic. If I go to your second question on Packaging, you mentioned the word acceleration. I think that is a perfect word. Again, this is a business I love how we're positioned. Our sales in our third quarter were up high single digits, all of which was volume. So we're positive in all regions, and our volume was actually up low double digits, which was a bit offset by some of our index pricing agreements. We've got some great momentum. The team has done a fantastic job. So while we're flat year-to-date, if you look at the balance of the year, I would expect to see very strong performance in the fourth quarter leading into next year. We've recaptured some of the temporary share loss that we saw from our Garland, Texas plant event, work is not done. The team's heads are down. They're out earning this business every single day, but strong -- when I say strong, very strong line of sight to additional recovery over the next 12 months and many of these customers have -- again I'm out spending time with they're eager to return back to Sherwin-Williams. And I would characterize that as just a better appreciation not only of our technology, but the service that we're providing to these customers is world class. We continue to invest. We believe in our model here. Some recent new wins across other regions, including North America, Latin America and APAC and was just over in our France plant a few weeks ago for ribbon-cutting ceremony and just couldn't be more pleased with the expansion here. This is going to be the backbone of serving our customers as EFSA, as there ban on BPA rolls over into Q2 of 2026 and there's already some customers that are looking at pacing to that beginning in 2025. So I think we're very well positioned where -- certainly where the category and the market is going here. And last, but not least, really excited that we've just added to our capacity. We just closed on our Henkel metal packaging business October 1. So, of course, we're very excited to welcome about 130 employees at our production sites across both Germany and Mexico and the Sherwin family, but big expectations of where this business goes. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. So it sounds like Q4, the hurricane impact was not going to be that large since it was about $0.05 for Q3. So glad to hear that. I guess, my main question is just around 2025. When think about the opportunity for Paint Stores Group, it does sound pretty encouraging when you think about the share gains that you already achieved from Kelly Moore, maybe I think you sized that in the past is when they exited about $300 million in sales. So assuming a good portion of that potentially that you were able to achieve, maybe you can get a similar amount from PPG, and then if you factor in maybe a 3% price increase as well. Looks like the stores group has line of sight to high single-digit growth next year. Is that how you're thinking about it? Maybe there could be some further gains from lower interest rates, maybe benefiting the second half of next year as well. Is that kind of how you -- we should think about framing up PSG in 2025? Thanks. A \u2013 Allen Mistysyn : Yeah, Arun, I'd temper that. We've been talking about it taking a longer period of time for things to filter, like interest rate reductions and things of that nature. I mean, we're not -- I'm not guiding for 2025, and I know you're not asking that. But I'd temper with all the things we've gone through over the last year and a half and how long it's taken to get certain things moving, I would just temper that expectation. And again, we talked about, we expect choppiness in our first half, and then we'll see. In this environment, a line of sight of three quarters out is pretty far. So let us get to January. Let\u2019s -- we're going through our operating plans here coming up with the teams, and we'll get a better line of sight to that, and then we'll certainly share that with you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Q \u2013 Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. A two-part question. In your discussion of elevated SG&A costs in the quarter leading to long-term market share gains, perhaps, what you said is that in the fourth quarter, the spending will come down, maybe to 0% year-over-year, and your direction is to lower your SG&A spending. So what exactly happened in the third quarter, where spending was elevated by $50 million, and then it's going to go down in the fourth quarter? And then, secondly, in Consumer Brands, like order of magnitude, your margins are up maybe 900 basis points in the quarter, and your margins in the stores business are sort of flattish. Can you talk about what's keeping the margins constrained in the stores, and what is it this year that really opened up this sort of 800 or 900 basis point improvement in Consumer Brands, with sales being lower? A \u2013 Allen Mistysyn : Yeah, Jeff. I think when you look at our second half, there's investments going in, as well as we're controlling G&A tightly, and sometimes the timing doesn't align exactly in a quarter. So that's why I point to the second half and say our expectations of SG&A are in line for the second half, as it was coming into the third quarter. And I would just say we take a disciplined approach to our SG&A. We want to invest in the selling side and driving productivity for our customers by convenience of our stores, expertise in our reps, low turnover in our stores, so they have the same face at the counter, delivery, innovation, all goes into the investments we're making. On the other side of that, on digital and modernization, we want to allow our employees to be more effective in more consistent data, better systems that allow them to be more effective when they get to the field. And so there's other G&A that we're trying to control very tightly and manage that down. So we can help pay for those while we're waiting for market dynamics to help with the overall demand environment. That being said, I go back to res repaint and the 5% mid single-digit growth that we're getting. So the confidence is there in getting the returns. On Consumer, again, it goes back to higher fixed cost absorption that's being -- we're passing that through because global supply chain sits in Consumer Brands, and it's been a headwind for a number of years, and we thought we can get our efficiencies back up to offset it. We chose to readjust our standards and when I look at the GSE allocation, it's really no impact on our overall margin. But what you're also seeing is global supply chain has improved year-over-year. So Consumer Brands is getting a big increase from the allocation to stores and to PCG. But on top of that, they're also getting a tailwind from better operations within our global supply chain. Heidi Petz : And Jeff, if I go back to your first question on the elevated SG&A leading towards long-term share gains, which is absolutely the intent. And I just want to free visit, I think you used the language around keeping margins constrained in stores. I would take a different approach there. I think back to Al's earlier comment, when we see these expanded margins, we absolutely want to take advantage of that as an opportunity. So it did give us an opportunity Q3, Q4 to accelerate some of these investments. And I'll take you back to the six priorities that I laid out at our Financial Community presentation, all designed to deliver this above-market growth. So some of the digital priorities that that will absolutely pay off those six priorities, simplification that Al mentioned, helping to make sure our teams have what they need to go faster and add more value to our customers. So it absolutely was by design. And I think an important -- it was opportunistic on our part. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is live. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning everyone. In looking at the market share opportunities out there, I'd like you to maybe talk about what's going on at true value and do it best as well as Heidi mentioned better quality sales, can you talk about that given what market share opportunities are available and whether it's DIY sales or contractor sales, res versus commercial? Thank you. Heidi Petz : Yes, you bet. I'll start with the true value do it best. Certainly, we won't comment on our customer strategies. But I think again, as I go back to the point earlier, this is a bit of a moment in our industry. I think there's been a lot of pressure across the category broadly for the last few years. So we'll continue to work in lockstep with our customers as they make shifts and decisions relative to the brands and the banners. Move on your quality sales question. Within that, there's kind of two prongs to that. One, and I'll go back to my earlier comment, where we want to -- it's in our core DNA. We're not interested in being all things to all people there. So we're not going to play in the commodity spaces where we're not getting paid, we're not returning -- delivering return to our shareholders. What is of interest in those quality sales, certainly by the premium sub-segments that we serve and making sure that we are focused back to Al's point, how do help make them more successful, so premium products, opportunities to upgrade them, so they're getting on and off of job sites faster. They're saving time and money on labour with some of these premium products that or easier to apply, less touch up. So when we look at the quality sales, it's who we're targeting and how we\u2019re trying to service those with the right mix of products. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is live. Josh Spector : Hi. Good morning. Two quick ones, if I may. Just CapEx, can you just explain what's going on with the year-to-date already being at your target versus your full year guide? And just within performance where you talked about customer slowdowns and really that's a watch point for you. Can you just be specific on which submarkets you're seeing that as a bigger risk? Thanks. Al Mistysyn : On the CapEx, Josh, year-to-date CapEx was $7 billion, including about $415 million of BOF CapEx. And what happens is we get reimbursed because of our financing arrangement for our new headquarters. So we've really net is about $200 million. So core CapEx is $355 million. So we guided to the $700 million less $180 million, gets you into that $520 million, around 2% of sales, which is where we want to be at. That's just the noise in our new buildings. Heidi Petz : And then, Josh, on your -- the question relative to PCG and some of those temporary shutdowns, it's broad-based for sure in the general industrial point more to heavy equipment with some of the ag slowing down. Again, we see this as very much transitory point in time, end of season, and there's no signal yet that, that would be widespread or any signal that, that would be extended at this point. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is live. Steve Byrne : Thank you. Can you comment on what drove the 2% decline in COGS? Jim, you mentioned raws were flattish. Was that a general comment and what were volumes in the top line, does that contribute to the lower COGS? And maybe just secondly, in your outlook for your stores business, are you seeing any aggressive pricing from any of your competitors as you're gaining share? PPG indicated they actually picked up share in the third quarter. So where are you gaining share? And do you see risk that they could get aggressive on price? Al Mistysyn : So Steve, on our cost of goods sold decreased, the decrease was primarily due to supply chain efficiencies on our Consumer Brands Group with global production volumes up low single digit with the team doing a nice job of controlling costs. The other impact was FX lower cost of goods sold in the quarter. Those are the two main drivers. On the volume side, stores was up low single digit. We -- Performance Coatings was flattish and then more PCG was more than offset with lower volume in our consumer. Heidi Petz : And Steve, on the store side relative to any competitive aggressive pricing, I would say that we typically look at our industry is, by and large, it's a very disciplined industry, which was why we have a lot of confidence when we do come out, we generally take a leadership position as it relates to price. We want to be out first. We want to be transparent with our customers. We want to deliver this in a way to our customer that helps to set them up for success, at a key partner in the bidding season, helping to -- where needed, if needed, coach them through how best to pass that along, so that they understand how to best kind of pass that through. Typically, the cost of the actual cost of the product itself is somewhere between 10%, 12%, 15% and then the balance would be the cost of labor. And so if we're able to do what we've continually focused on, which is at these crews on and off of job sites that ultimately is a positive to make sure that we continue to focus on upselling customers, especially in some of these environments. Have not seen -- we've not seen a lot of activity, I would tell you, because this is an unprecedented moment in our industry. We're certainly paying very close attention. We're staying extremely close to our customers to be competitive in a mix of environments, but we're confident that we're going to hold on to this recent -- this price that we just announced, and we'll be back in our 50 to 60 kind of historic run rate, and we don't plan to come off of that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman. Your line is live. Adam Baumgarten : Hey good morning everyone. Just on your kind of initial thoughts on the first half of next year remaining choppy from a high level. Is the way to kind of interpret that, that it's a continuation of the trends you're seeing here in the back half of 2024 at this point? Al Mistysyn : Yes. That's exactly what we're seeing. Heidi Petz : And if I could, and Adam, Al just nailed it. but I had to jump in here because I go back to this idea of it's not if, it's when. And so this kind of slower longer is playing out in real time, and we are absolutely prepared to manage that situation. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is live. Garik Shmois : Hi, thanks. Just on the SG&A and the potential increase in the back half of next year, it sales ramp. Just maybe bigger picture, just how you're thinking about SG&A leverage? Is there a kind of investment of sales you'd be managing to over time? Or is it may be a situation right now? Al Mistysyn : I think, Garik, it's situational with -- as we've talked about, our focus is on driving operating margin. And some years, that's gross margin expansion in other years like 2021 and 2022, it's on SG&A leverage. We're -- as Heidi mentioned, I mean we're really being opportunistic to set ourselves up for when demand returns because our gross margin has been stronger because our global supply chain with a more normal production and inventory cycle this year building inventory leading into the summer selling season. We saw our inventory drop through the third quarter, and we expect to build inventory, architectural inventory in our fourth quarter. That bell curve and being more standard helps us with how we schedule our factories, how we're able to produce the right products at the right time and we get efficiencies out of that, and we're realizing those and taking it taken some of the benefit and putting it into these long-term investments. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is live. Eric Bosshard : Thanks. If I could follow up. Al your comment, I think you just talked about the focus is driving operating margin earlier. How do you talk about achieving above-market growth. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is where does the curve of investment moderate, the market share growth sustains and operating margin expands? Or is that not the target that you're aiming for? Al Mistysyn : No. We're -- we absolutely are aiming to -- we'll moderate on the G&A side. I think to help pay for the selling investments because we're confident in our strategy because we've been consistent in our investments and because we know we can get a return on those investments. I think as SG&A -- I'm sorry, as the macro demand environment improves, you will see us get leverage on SG&A going out in the future. It's just not -- going back to -- it's not if, it's when. Because as your volumes start growing and mix improves, you can invest heavy enough to not get leverage on SG&A. So we absolutely are focused on managing gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage at the appropriate time to get our operating margin to grow at a faster pace. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Matthew, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. As we've often said, we don't run the business for the perfect quarter. But what we do do is run the business to drive that long-term above-market growth and the returns. And that's exactly what we're doing right now. We believe in our strategy. We're investing in it. Heidi mentioned a couple of times, we're at a very unique place in our industry right now. The current opportunity to gain market share is nearly unprecedented, and we're going to take full advantage of that. We're very confident in our approach and our people, the trends favor us long-term and our team is very motivated to get after it. So thank you again. As always, myself, Eric Swanson, will be available for your calls over the remaining week and coming days. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company's review of Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results and our Outlook for the First Quarter and Full Year of 2025. With us on today's call are Heidi Petz, President and CEO, Al Mistysyn, Chief Financial Officer, Paul Lang, Chief Accounting Officer, and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by issue or direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under the U.S. Federal Security's laws with respect to sales, earnings, and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date to which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye. Jim Jaye : Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered strong fourth quarter results that concluded a record year for the company. In what remained a very choppy demand environment, full-year consolidated sales increased slightly, driven by our deliberate and targeted investment to gain share and overcome softness in core accounts. Our gross profit dollars and margin expanded, EBITDA dollars and margin expanded, and adjusted earnings per share grew by a near double-digit percentage, to $11.33 a share. Consolidated sales in the fourth quarter increased by a low single-digit percentage, and gross margin improved slightly over a very strong level a year ago. As we expected and previously described, year-over-year growth in SG&A moderated to a low single-digit level. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased by 15.5%. In terms of our segments in the fourth quarter, paint stores group sales increased in the range we expected, led by high single-digit growth in residential repaint and protective and marine. Consumer brands group sales decreased in the range we expected, all related to unfavorable FX, as volume and price mix were slightly positive. Within performance coatings group, sales were slightly below expectations, as strength in packaging and coil was offset by softness in other divisions. Adjusted margin expanded year-over-year in all three operating segments. The slide deck accompanying our press release this morning provides more detail on fourth quarter segment performance. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide a few full-year 2024 highlights before we move on to our 2025 outlook and your questions. Heidi Petz : Thank you, Jim, and Happy New Year to all those that are listening. I hope you had a wonderful holiday season and are geared up for the year ahead. I know you're eager to get to our 2025 outlook, but first I want to take a moment to reflect on what our 64,000 dedicated global employees have achieved over the last year. I'm proud of what our team has delivered in 2024. We entered the year amidst an extremely choppy demand environment that, quite frankly, never improved meaningfully. We knew this was a possible scenario, and we doubled down on controlling what we could control. We stayed true to our strategy. We made targeted investments, focused on share gains, and executed on our enterprise priorities. We continued to deliver innovative solutions for our customers, and in a disruptive competitive environment, Sherwin-Williams stood out by being a consistent, reliable, and dependable partner. In addition to the strong margin expansion and earnings growth that Jim described a moment ago, it was another very good year of cash generation, which was $3.2 billion, or 13.7% of sales. We continued to execute our disciplined approach to capital allocation during the year, including $2.5 billion, which we returned to shareholders for share repurchases and dividends. In terms of CapEx, we invested $1.1 billion, including approximately $532 million for our new headquarters and R&D center, which we expect to begin occupying this year. We ended 2024 with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.2x. Looking at our reportable segments on a full-year basis, paint stores grew by a low single-digit percentage. Residential repaint drove the segment growth and increased by a mid-single-digit percentage. This was strong performance, given anemic existing home sales, and is the clearest example of a return on our prior investment. New residential and commercial both increased by low single-digit percentages in a challenging rate environment. Flattish year-over-year segment margin reflects our continued growth investment, which we are confident will continue to drive above-market sales over the long term. Consumer brands had a challenging year on the top line, with lower sales resulting from soft DIY demand and unfavorable FX. Adjusted segment margin expanded back to our target level due to higher fixed cost absorption in the manufacturing and distribution operations within the segment. At the same time, we maintained our investments to support our customers, despite weaker-than-expected volume in North America. Performance coating sales varied by division and geography. Acquisitions added a low single-digit percentage in the year, but was offset by unfavorable price mix and FX. Coil was the strongest performer, driven by new account wins. We're also pleased with packaging, which returned to growth as we won new accounts and recaptured the majority of previously lost share, just as we indicated we would. Industrial wood was up mid-single-digit, driven by an acquisition. Accelerated share gains and auto refinish were not enough to overcome softness in core accounts, driven by lower insurance claims. General Industrial, our largest division, remained under the most pressure during the year, with softness and heavy equipment demand. Adjusted segment margin expanded to 18%, the highest level since the Valspar acquisition in 2017. Throughout 2024, we continued to operate from a position of strength. In fact, our confidence in our strategy, along with our team's ability to execute, led us to increase several of our midterm financial targets at our Investor Day this past August. I am confident we will achieve those targets over time, given a more consistent demand environment. As we begin 2025, I am also highly confident that nobody is better positioned than Sherwin-Williams. During our October earnings call, we were among the first to describe the demand environment as softer for longer, with an expectation that the first half of 2025 would likely remain choppy. Three months later, we have seen little evidence to change that view, and given the indicators that we do see, several end markets may not improve until 2026. On the architectural side of the business, residential repaint demand has become slightly more encouraging, as existing home sales have begun to show modest signs of recovery, and Harvard's LIRA index shows a return to very slight growth. Residential repaint remains our single largest share gain opportunity, and we significantly outperformed the market in 2024, given our targeted investments in sales reps, training, and digital tools, just to name a few. We would expect similar outperformance in 2025. Looking at new residential, year-over-year growth and single-family starts has been choppy over the last several months. Rate cuts have had little impact, and mortgage rates remain well above 6%. We would expect to continue strengthening our homebuilder-customer relationship to outperform the market. In commercial, we've been clear that we expect completions to be soft in 2025, as year-over-year multifamily starts have been mostly down by double-digit percentages since the middle of 2023. Even if commercial starts do pick up in 2025, which seems unlikely given a consistently soft architectural billing index, they won't turn into painting incompletions until well into 2026. Property maintenance spending still appears to be idling and neutral. On the DIY side, we do not currently see a macroeconomic catalyst driving meaningful improvement in consumer demand. On the industrial side, the PMI numbers for manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe have been negative for multiple months, with Brazil and China being slightly positive. We expect coil to grow again, driven by significant new account wins over the past year and a continued focus on new accounts this year. We're also confident in packaging growth, as we gain share and support customers' conversion to our industry-leading non-BCA coatings by 2026 to comply with European Commission mandates. In protective and marine, the project pipeline remains solid, though the timing of starts remains variable. We expect auto refinish demand to remain choppy, driven by continued softness of insurance claims, though our share gains should become more evident. Industrial wood will likely track with new residential, given the furniture, flooring, and cabinetry and markets it serves. We expect general industrial demand to remain soft throughout the year. In summary, the market is not going to give us a lot of help this year. We'll continue to remain very aggressive, with a focus on helping our existing customers grow, as well as focusing on targeted share gains. Against this backdrop, we are providing guidance that we believe is very realistic. Should the market be better than we are currently assuming, we would expect to outperform the guidance we are providing to start the year. Moving on to our specific outlook, the slide deck issued with this morning's press release includes our expectations for consolidated and segment sales for the first quarter of 2025. The deck also includes our expectations for the full year, where consolidated sales are expected to be up a low single-digit percentage, and diluted net income per share is expected to be in the range of $10.70 to $11.10 per share, excluding acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.80 per share, and restructuring expense of approximately $0.15 per share. Adjusted diluted net income per share is expected in the range of $11.65 to $12.05. This is a mid-single-digit percent increase at the midpoint compared to 2024's adjusted diluted net income per share of $11.33. We've provided a gap reconciliation in the Reg-G table within our press release. Our slide deck contains several additional data points that provide important context that I'd like to touch on here. Any comparisons described are year-over-year. From a sales perspective, I'll remind you that the paint stores group implemented a 5% price increase effective January 6th. We would expect this to ramp up to typical 50% to 60% effectiveness over the next quarter. We also are implementing very targeted price increases in specific areas within our other two reportable segments. We expect the market basket of raw materials to be up a low single-digit percentage in 2025. We expect to overcome these raw material headwinds and deliver full-year gross margin expansion, driven by incremental 2025 pricing, simplification efforts across our supply chain, as well as our paint storage group, which is our largest and highest gross margin segment, growing sales faster than the other two segments. We expect SG&A dollars to grow by a low single-digit percentage in 2025. This is a more typical level for us and less than last year's 5% increase. This year's increase includes $80 million of operating expenses for our new buildings, which will be weighted to our second half. We'll also continue to have some operating expense for our current buildings until we have fully completed our move. As always, we plan to control costs tightly in non-customer-facing functions. And we have a variety of levers that we can pull depending on a material change to our outlook, up or down. As we've previously described, interest expense will be up this year. This increase includes $40 million related to refinancing of debt at higher rates, including $850 million in 2024 and approximately $1 billion expected to be refinanced in 2025. It also includes $20 million of interest related to financing activities of our new buildings. We expect to end the year within our current long-term target debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x. Other general expense items are expected to return to more historic levels in 2025 and increase approximately $75 million due to a gain on sale or disposition of assets of approximately $50 million in 2024 that we do not expect to repeat in 2025 and an increase in our environmental provision of $25 million. We expect to open 80 to 100 new stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2025. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements, systems and product innovation. Next month at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 10.5% to $3.16 per share, up from $2.86 last year. If approved, this will mark the 47th consecutive year that we've increased our dividends. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit into our strategy. In addition, our slide deck provides guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, expected tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization. Finally, I'll remind you that our first quarter is a seasonally smaller one. For that reason, we will not be making any updates to full year guidance up or down until our second quarter is completed and we have a better view of how the paint coating season is unfolding. Our team is operating with great confidence and accountability as we begin 2025. As we've consistently said, it is only a matter of when the demand environment returns to greater strength, not if. And when that shift occurs, we expect to significantly outperform the market. In the meantime, we are not waiting. We often talk about how we operate, success by design. We have a clear and winning strategy. We have the best team in the industry, and we've made the right investments targeting specific markets and subsegments. We know how to deliver solutions for our customers that will make them more productive and more profitable. We continue to have significant new account and share of wallet opportunities in every business and region. We expect to continue winning more than our fair share of these opportunities. I also am highly confident that our enterprise-wide efforts related to talent, simplification, digitization, supply chain responsiveness and sustainability will continue to deliver above market growth. We get rewarded by overcoming obstacles, finding solutions for our customers and delivering results. We are extremely well positioned to continue delivering shareholder value. And that's exactly what we intend to do in 2025. This concludes our prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to thank you all for joining us this morning and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Gregory Melich from Evercore. Your line is live. Gregory Melich : I wanted to follow up on the raw material expense as part of the guidance, expecting that to rise this year. What commodities or areas are driving that? Are tariffs in any way a factor? Jim Jaye : Yes, good morning, Greg. It's Jim talking. Couple different things to think about there. Yes, there are some tariffs that are embedded in that. Those are tariffs that are already in place, mainly related to Asian imports of epoxy, which came into effect September and November of last year. We're seeing inflation of low single digits in the raw basket. I would tell you that that is related to industrial resins, TiO2 is up a bit, solvents up a bit, packaging up a bit. In addition to that tariff that I described, we have potential for others. Those aren't in the guide right now on the raws. We'll see how that unfolds. I think you have to also think about some other factors. You have suppliers with capacity rationalization and decommissioning of their plants, which puts pressure on price as well. So we'll see natural gas is up as well and trending upwards, which is another pressure point. So I think up low single digits to start the year and fairly spread out across the year evenly and fairly spread out across the different commodities. Al Mistysyn : And Greg, this is Al Mistysyn. The one thing I would add is the additional tariffs that we're tracking very closely that are not in our guidance. If those were to occur and they're significant, we would need to go and we're prepared to go out with additional price in specific markets and segments as required. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Vincent Andrews : Can I ask about a couple of the special items that are in the guidance, particularly the 80 million associated with the new headquarters? I know we've talked a lot in the past about the CapEx and the sale leaseback associated with the HQ, but I think this is the first we've talked about there being such a substantial incremental cost to using this new facility. So I'm just curious if you can help us understand what those are. I don't know, in my head, I would think the new facility would be more efficient from an energy and a water and all that type of thing. So what's driving the 80 million and how much of it is one-time in nature versus non-recurring? And then you also have a step up in the environmental spending. And I know that can fluctuate year-to-year. So is there something special about the spend this year that may not recur next year or is this a new baseline? Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Vincent. I'll start with the new building. And the way I think about it is this is a transition year for us as a company, as we're not moving into the -- we're going to start occupying the building as the year goes on. And as we talked about, this is predominantly second half loaded. I thought I'd be remiss if I didn't include some estimate in our cost base to say that as we get better line of sight on the timing of the occupying the building, we can refine that estimate on our July call. About 20, I'd say a quarter of that 80 are what I call transition costs, whether that is moving costs or decommissioning costs related to our old buildings. And yes, they are more efficient. However, I've got a headquarters building that I've been in for 90 years that is fully depreciated. We've made, I'd say we made measured repairs to the existing building knowing we were going to get out of this building. But if you look at the ongoing service costs and depreciation and things like that, we'll get a better line of sight of that when we're completely into the building, new buildings we're operating and we can kind of figure out what's working, what's not working. So these are estimates that need to be refined. The other comment I would make on the non-operating. Our assumption is we're going to get back to a more normal environmental cost. These are going to be more first half of an impact because we had credits last year. We don't expect to repeat those. I don't think I would consider it a step up in environmental provision. I think we've made good progress on remediation and the further we get with remediation, the environmental provisions will get much clearer. So I think that's more of a, hey, back to normal expense in environmental versus maybe some credits in 2024 that I don't expect to repeat. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. David Begleiter : Heidi, on the share gain opportunity, can you help frame how that looks to you in terms relative to the PPG business? And looking back to the last year, how much of the Kelly Moore business did you end up picking up? Thank you. Heidi Petz : Yes, good morning, David. Let me start with Kelly Moore just because sequentially obviously that's, I would say, largely or significant behind us. I don't know that we shared a number and I'm certainly not prepared to share a number today, but I would tell you, given how complimentary that business model was to us relative to some of the key segments, I'll point to res repaint. We were able to, I think, be very well positioned. The team was very aggressive to make sure that we were focused on customer continuity and that we were the house that they wanted to transition to. So we're in a good position there. We expect that to continue into the run rate. As I look at the PPG sale, I would first describe that as an opportunity that we just came out of our national sales meeting and was able to address over 10,000 of our store managers, our reps. And I would tell you, ripe with opportunity is the general sentiment. When you think about breaking that down in terms of how we look at the share gain opportunity, I think you have to start by segment and also a little bit by region, in size of contractor. We're largely focused with the crossover between property management, certainly commercial, new residential. So we're going to continue to be very aggressive to make sure that we are best positioned across those segments. I will also tell you, we are very focused on quality sales and making sure that we're targeting the customers that candidly value what it is that we do and what we bring to bear with our reps, our stores, our delivery, our tools. Everything that we can put in front of them to make these contractors even more profitable than they are today is where we're going to focus. But there's a bit of a time lag. If you think about the speed in which we're able to pick up a res repaint contractor, while that's not easy and the team's working very hard to do so, you kind of see that return more quickly versus someone more in the property maintenance commercial space will be working on projects that just simply have longer lag periods or could be bigger size projects in play that are already committed to. So we're working really hard to really try to sync up as the market does recover. We'll see how the back half of 25 goes. But as we look into 26, we want to make sure that we are absolutely best positioned to take that share. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is live. John McNulty : So I guess you sounded like there was at least a little bit of optimism in some of the paint store group and markets, particularly res repaint. I guess, can you help us to think about what your customers are saying about their backlog? I know it's a seasonally kind of odd time or early time, but where is that optimism coming from? Can you help us to think about that? Heidi Petz : Yes, John, I'll start here. I think you're right. I mean, we did indicate that there's moderate optimism, if I could kind of even moderate the word optimism. We're aggressively partnering with these contractors that are in the current environment where while the market is still kind of choppy, you've seen, I'm sure, certainly the LIRA indicators that paint's likely going to hold up overall over everything else. But I would tell you part of this is making sure that our teams are looking to intercept. As you look at our current res repaint contractors, our existing contractors, helping them growing their business, helping them market their business, helping them get more leads, close more leads so that they can become more profitable. And then in terms of pursuing, sharing gains and new customers, there is a lot of disruption out there. And we are going to continue to be consistent laying in stores, reps, tools, making sure that they're prepared. But I'll hand it over to Al. Any additional comments you want to make here relative to some of the indicators? Al Mistysyn : Yes, John, I think I just reinforced that we do expect that the demand environment will improve as the year goes on. And I'd highlight that as we've talked about on our third quarter call, as we've talked about on this call, the first half is going to continue to be choppy and a continuation of what we saw in our second half 2024. Our sales guidance, if you will, for the first half would be up or down, low to single digits. And then up, low- to mid-single digits in the second half with our paint storage group being at or above the high end of those ranges. And we do expect some macro improvement as the year goes on. But we also expect to annualize some of the bigger headwinds on our core business that we saw throughout 2024 that we should, with the aggressive new account activity and share wallet activity that each of the teams have completed, we should start seeing more volume as we go into the second half. And as you would expect, our earnings will flow in a similar fashion. We expect to be up year-over-year in our first half, but not nearly as much as we'd expect to see in our second half. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. Chris Parkinson : So in addition to some of the growth spend in terms of stores and sales associates, you've also been spending a decent amount on product breadth and some new products and PSG and kind of getting up on some of the price points. And it sounds like you're pretty enthusiastic on some stuff in PC as well. Could I just ask, what are the two to three largest growth or opportunities that you see in '25 and '26 when you step back as CEO, just regardless of what the macro environment does, where are you the most excited? Thank you. Heidi Petz : Yes, great question. I think there's a number of items. I would point to where we see continued strength. We would expect to outperform res repaint. And again, I'm going to point to that as an example. You mentioned how we're looking at product introduction. It's a really good call out because when you think about not only the mixed benefit that we see from a margin standpoint, but our ability to bring solutions to these contractors that value productivity above all, the cost of labor being a significant part of the total cost of the job, we're able to bring technologies. They are more in the premium space because they are absolutely helping these crews to save time, ultimately money on these job sites. And so there's mixed favorability, certainly which we love because we want to continue to stay kind of cutting edge as leaders and innovating in that space to help these contractors. So that would be the biggest piece. I think if you look on the performance side, similar to what I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well, I would point to coil and packaging as the two, three there. You've got a lot of focus here. Again, the market's not going to help us, but the team's been relentlessly focusing on new accounts, new business wins, fully expect us to continue to do that in both of those segments. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Roberts from Mizuho. Your line is live. John Roberts : Do you expect non-resi to be down all 2025, or do we have easy comps in the back end of the year where you might actually have some positive comps? Al Mistysyn : Yes, John, it's possible that we could have positive comps. There's obviously a number of macro things that have to improve to help us. The biggest being as you get into interest rates and we've talked about property maintenance and the CapEx shortfalls that we've seen or the lack of investment, I should say, that we've seen. We're, again, cautiously optimistic as the year goes on. You see some of that improve. I think commercial, we've been very clear. We do expect to see that drop in our second half knowing that we've been really aggressive at pursuing new opportunities to try to mitigate that. As the market goes, we're not immune to that macro slowdown, but we certainly are doing everything we can to mitigate it with these other segments, including P&M and trying to accelerate our res repaint to help minimize that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is live. Josh Spector : I wanted to ask on the CapEx guidance. So, I mean, a few things there. One, I guess the 200 million of building spend, is that because the cost of the headquarters is higher or are you now doing more or something different there? And then X that, even the 700 million guide is a bit higher than probably the 500 that we're modeling longer term. Is there more growth investments that you're doing that is worth calling out now? Or is there some reason why your sustainable CapEx should be higher looking two, three years out? Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Josh, the new buildings, 200 million, is just the combination of finishing up our R&D center in our headquarters. As you know, we will get reimbursed for a portion of the headquarters CapEx in financing, but it all sits in CapEx. And I'm happy to say this will be the last year you'll hear us talk about CapEx for our new buildings. On the core CapEx, we targeted 2% of sales. I expect to be in that target long-term. In 2025, we are investing in additional architectural capacity that we've talked about, about our Statesville factory, with our confidence in our long-term growth initiatives within paint stores group, within our consumer grants group. We'll fill that capacity up in a fairly short period of time. And then, we're also investing in warehouse automation. As we've talked about with labor constrained in manufacturing distribution, we continue to look for opportunities to automate in those areas to take more weight off the back of our people. So long-term, we'll see the benefits of that. The last thing I'd say is approximately 60% of our CapEx has a return on it, and we expect to continue to see efficiencies out of our global supply chain related to that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Duffy Fischer : Question on price. So last year you asked for five in February. This year you asked for five in January. So can you do the after action review? How much did you get last year? What was the shape of that kind of throughout the year, would be one. Then two, how much of that old price still gets anniversary this year? And then does the shape of this year's price look different because you asked for it earlier, would you guess? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Duffy, I think what we talked about price last year, let me start with that. It improved as the year went on, and we had talked about coming into our second half that we'd see a more typical effective rate. So I would say it probably took us longer than we had planned. I would think learning from that, we really let in with a lot of discipline, training in the field, making sure we gave our customers enough lead time to get ahead of it. And I would expect that our effectiveness in price will be better earlier this year than it was last year. It still will take over the next quarter to get to the effectiveness we want, but you'll see a much better effectiveness in our first half this year than you saw last year. And then the annualization, yes, there's some annualization on the increase last year. And obviously, because we went out earlier this year, we'll see more effectiveness in the first quarter. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is live. Ghansham Panjabi : Heidi, as you kind of think about the six verticals within PSG, has your 2025 outlook changed in any material way versus your view when you reported 3Q earnings back in October, especially in commercial, maybe? Heidi Petz : No, it hasn't. And I think Al characterized that really well just a few minutes ago relative to how we're looking at commercial in general. If the market does fare better than we're expecting, we expect to outperform the market, but I think this becomes a softer for longer with eyes toward 2026 at this point, Ghansham. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Ghansham, I would just add, I think maybe the rate cuts that the Fed have been doing have not had the effect on the longer-term rates that we were expecting. Mortgage rates are still up in that high 6% range. All things that, you're talking nuances related to where we were in October and today, but I think we're in line, if you will, across each of the different segments to say, plus or minus a little bit, but we're right in line. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is live. Mike Sison : I wanted to get a better feel for maybe some of the headwinds in '25 in the sense that it doesn't sound like demand is going to be much better in '25 versus '24, yet in 24, you generated pretty good APS growth of 10%. So if you think about '25, the SG&A increase is going to be a little bit less year over year. Demand doesn't get much worse. So just curious what else is sort of impeding better EPS growth and maybe hoping your momentum this year would be kind of mirror our guardians, so. Al Mistysyn : Yes, I don't know we're going to be that good as the guardians. But yes, Mike, I think we do have some headwinds additional to what we maybe would have saw in 24. We try to call those out, one with higher interest expense with the higher rates. We refinance 850 million and third quarter of 24 at a higher rate. Our expectation is the billion dollars we refinance in third quarter of '25 will be at a higher rate plus the financing of our new building is a headwind. The non-operating costs getting back to a more normal level is a headwind and we're not hiding behind those, Mike. We fully, we saw it coming. We expect that our performance with, you know, price, volume, managing our SG&A to your point, getting on top of the low raw material and other cost basket increases, which year-over-year is going to be a little bit of a headwind. But I think, the incremental new building costs on our second half, so I'm carrying that, plus I'm carrying my existing building, granted the existing buildings at a lower level, that $0.30 gets you to 12.15 at the midpoint up about 7%. So I think that's kind of where we were coming into 2024 and then we saw a little bit better improvement in gross margin. We did manage our SG&A tighter in 24 than what we had planned. So we got a little bit more of a lift in '24 and I think coming into 25, we're in a similar place if you could take out the incremental new building costs. Heidi Petz : And Mike, I would add, just from an operating perspective, I think two of the macro headwinds that certainly we're not immune to, single family housing starts have been down year over year, you know, for three consecutive months and five of the last eight months that we're managing through that. And then the multi-family housing completes are slowing given some extended periods of soft start. So there are dynamics that we're going to continue to fight through and compete within them, but I think there's certainly no lack of headwinds as we enter the year. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Jeff Zekauskas : Some building products companies have talked about adverse weather and certainly it's been cold. When you look at your first quarter or you look at January, is that something that's affected you relative to last year? And then for Al, in the consumer brands group, the margins for the first three quarters year-over-year relative to last year were up about, 10 percentage points. And in the final quarter, they were up maybe two. Were there LIFO true ups or some LIFO dynamic that led to the sort of change in margin differential in the fourth quarter? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Jeff, let me start. You know, the cold weather, we expect that in January. It's our smallest quarter of the first quarter, I think, where we kind of focus our views is more in our Southeast and Southwest. And yes, we had more cold there, but I think there's time as we ramp through the quarter to get that back to be, we believe we're within guidance, if you will. Right now, I think when you look at consumer, and that's a very good point that, we saw in the first three quarters and talked about the fixed cost absorption adjustments that we made between GS, our global supply chain, which is embedded in our consumer to stores and our paint performance coatings group to true up those costs. No impact on gross margin, but yes, that impacted the first three quarters. We annualized those adjustments in our fourth quarter. And if you look at our fourth quarter, the increase was primarily due to good cost control. I think that team has done a nice job managing their costs as the year has gone on to the tighter volumes. However, without really sacrificing service and offer, options to our customers, and it partly offset by lower gross profit dollars related to the lower sales. We did still see some benefit in supply chain efficiency, but going into 2025, our expectation would be those will be incremental improvement because those one-time adjustments, if you will, are no longer happening. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is live. Chuck Cerankosky : We've got some very favorable demographic indications for future housing demand. And Heidi and Al, how might you expect it to evolve on the existing home sales and new housing starts without substantial changes in mortgage rates because they just don't seem to suddenly move. And as you indicated, they haven't been responding to Fed cuts as expected. So what might be the scenarios you see that the housing markets could improve on the supply side? Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Chuck. I think you're absolutely right in the sense that as existing home turnover has been backwards over 36 months in a row, there's pent-up demand that, because household formations continue to be strong, they're still over a million, million one, we've started this, life goes on. People get married, people have children, and that just creates more pent-up demand, which may mean, Chuck, which may mean that interest rates don't need to get back to, we were thinking if we'd have to get back to 5% before you start seeing some movement, we saw interest rates drop into that, or 30-year mortgage drop into that 6%, 6.5% range, and we saw a nice uptick in existing home turnover. So I think we might see a different view of the world, a slightly higher interest and mortgage rate gets people to start moving and turning homes more, which would then really impact res repaint, industrial wood or coil business on the appliances side and things of that nature. I just think it's, as we see it, as we put it out in our guidance, more second half kind of impacts. It just takes, even when an existing home starts to turn or sale or new residential picks up, it just takes time to filter through to the painting side of that. Heidi Petz : And in the meantime, I think what's really important in terms of kind of what we can control in this environment, and I'll take you back to where we started last year with this, it's when, not if. In the meantime, as we focus on partnering from an existing home sales, res repaint contractors, and I'll take you to our national builders or regional builders on the new res side, making sure that we are partnering with them in new and innovative and creative ways to really help them solve for their biggest pain point, obviously, which is affordability, as we all know. So I do think that there's, it's masked now because the market hasn't moved, but when the market does move, Chuck, I'm very confident that we're going to be able to demonstrate a different level of partnership with these builders as a result of the team's effort. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Your line is live. Mike Harrison : We haven't really talked at all about labor costs here today. I was wondering if you can comment on how changes in immigration policy should impact your business, as well as that of your paying contractor customers to the extent that changes in policies could lead to some impacts on labor availability. Heidi Petz : Yes, good morning, Mike. Well, I tell you that this is a great question. It's not a new topic for us. I think, you know, 150 year old company, we've certainly seen a lot of administrations. And I do think with what we're seeing here, we've been looking at solving for helping our contractors work through some of these challenges that might be, it's too early to tell how this is going to impact, you know, the country, let alone our industry and our company. But I would tell you what's most important for us, regardless of where that does go, is we're going to continue to stay laser focused on helping our customers be productive. And so if I take you to a job site and you think about a constrained labor, we've got the crew on site, our number one job is to get these contractors and applicators on and off the job site as quickly as possible. So that impacts everything from application to touch up, avoiding having to come back on the job site. And so the controllables, again, what we are already doing and will continue to do are focusing on the right technologies that help these contractors be efficient. We are investing, of course, in our delivery and our service so that we can be accurate and precise in terms of delivery timing. So we're not putting contractors in a position where their crews are idle and waiting. Certainly our field reps that we've laid in, this is really critical in terms of problem solving in real time, contractors having access, again, so that they're not waiting idly and have crews waiting. So there's a whole host of investments that we've been putting behind this. Now, if and when and how this impacts us, again, too early to tell, but we're going to make sure that we're best positioned to help our contractors to be prepared and for them to win in this environment. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Leithead from Barclays. Mike Leithead : I just wanted to drill into the paint store's 2025 sales guidance of low to mid singles. Is it fair to think of price at sort of the higher end of that low single digits and then maybe volume probably at the lower end of that low single digits? And then within that volume, is there a meaningful dispersion in your expectations between say the five or six different verticals within the segment? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Mike, I think you're correct. I think price will be stronger than volume, especially as you ramp up going through the year. I would say res repaint, we'd expect to be at or above the high end of that range, continuing the market share gains and momentum we experienced in the second half of 2024, which was actually up a high single digit number. I think Heidi talked about the other verticals. We do think new res maintains a positive momentum and throughout the year. And then I think commercial property maintenance, she touched on both of those. The two that I would also touch on, P&M within our paint stores group, I do think up low, low to mid. And then DIY, I mean, I think is going to be flattish in the first half and then possibly improve as existing turnover improves. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live. Arun Viswanathan : Curious, if you think about Q1, obviously impacted by weather, maybe you expect kind of the Q2 to Q4 kind of sales growth to be above Q1 levels. And if so, would that be the same for all of the segments or mostly for PSG? Thanks. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Arun, I would say it's not, I wouldn't point to the weather in our first quarter. Our first quarter is a small quarter. I think it's a continuation of the choppiness we saw in our fourth quarter. And then as the year unfolds, you're going to see varying degrees across the segments. Let's be clear, res repaint, we are very confident you're going to see consistent mid-single digit growth if not improving. I think between the other paint stores group segments, I think we just touched on those, that new res I think is pretty consistent and the others will improve except for commercial as the year goes on. I think within our industrial businesses, we're very excited about our packaging group and the improvements we saw in our fourth quarter and the continuation of that, not to mention the European standard and regulation that goes in the first half of 26. So we are going to see customers converting to our non-BPA epoxy which we believe is first in class. I think we've talked about auto refinish and our optimism and we talked about claims being down double digits. I think when you look at North America in our fourth quarter, you're seeing the new account wins that got us into a low single digit improvement and we expect that to improve as the year goes on in 25, as you annualize some of these claims data, you'll see improvement in that area. We're also, we've talked about coil, the new wind gains there and that consistency of that team and that's going continue in 2025. And then industrial wood, we've talked, as new residential improves, existing home turnover improves, it really impacts cabinets, flooring, furniture and the expectations that improves as the year goes on. I think general industrial has seen the biggest headwinds. They take longer to come out of that and I'm not expecting that we'll see improvement throughout 2025. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alexey Yefremov from KeyBank Capital Markets. Your line is live. Aleksey Yefremov : Hopefully sales and demand improve in 2026 or perhaps later. Can you tell us what kind of demand improvement can your current footprint of stores and associates accommodate before you need to ramp up as G&A investments? So would it be 5%, 10% and then you need to ramp up as G&A or perhaps a higher number? Heidi Petz : I'll start and I'll ask Al to come in. I would tell you we have the capacity I think the fact that, again, the market's not going to help us we're out aggressively focused on taking share. We've got the capacity relative to stores having said that we're going to continue as part of our capital allocation that Al laid out laying in 80 to 100 new stores throughout the year and that will be largely focused on geographies where we know we have opportunity to grow and win. But by and large, I don't know that there's a magic number per se, I mean, our ability to help these contractors to grow is within our capacity. Our ability to help our contractors travel from store to store is well within our capacity. Al Mistysyn : Yes, the only thing I would add to that Aleksey think of it as from a rep standpoint it's a really variable kind of cost that we can ramp up as we see volume improving one to two quarters out with our forecasting model. I think Heidi said that we're adding 80 to 100 stores a year that gives us great capacity to handle any res repaint or other segment increases. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is live. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, thank you and good morning. I have two questions, one for Heidi and one for Al. Maybe to start off with Heidi on the subject of pricing. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks you're pursuing increases in consumer and performance coatings in addition to the paint store hikes that we already talked about. How would you, can you elaborate on that? How would you characterize prospects for positive pricing contributions from those two segments in 2025? And then for Al, what is the level of foreign exchange drag that you're baking into your guide in light of the recent dollar strength? Thank you. Heidi Petz : Yes, thanks, Kevin. I'll start. The comment that I shared relative to pricing for the segments is that it would be very targeted within the segment. And so you look at that through the lens of regions and geography. Obviously, we're not going to announce here today what the specific actions are, but where we know we need to get priced, we're going to be very aggressive and make sure that we do so. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Kevin. I think in a consolidated basis, FX, we expect to be a headwind of about 1%. But when you really break that out, it's more pronounced in our Latin America teams in which case you'll see maybe mid-teens impact on Latin America, which translates to about a mid-single-digit impact on consumer, and then roughly a 2% impact on our performance coatings group. Jim Jaye : Kevin, I would just add, you asked about the specific pricing. I'd point out in the slide deck, there's a slide that may be very helpful in there that for the year breaks out volume price FX buy segment. So you might want to use that as a guide. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Adam Baumgarten from Zelman & Associates. Your line is live. Adam Baumgarten : You talked about gross margin expansion in 25. Can you maybe put a finer point on the magnitude you're anticipating and that's embedded in your guidance? And also, should we think about that as relatively even across the quarters or more second-half weighted? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Adam. We'll not give you an exact number, but you would expect our gross margin expansion to be, let me put it this way. It'll be less than it was that we saw in 2024 on a year-over-year basis. As the year progresses, I would expect to see our gross margin get stronger in our second half versus our first half because of the expectation that volume improves. The price increases are meant to offset raw material costs of inflation of the low single digits. Other cost basket increases of low single digits. And I view that as probably about 75%. Of the increase. We're also continuing as we've talked about self-help initiatives with simplification. We expect acquisition synergies to continue to progress. Both sales synergies, but also on cost synergies. And then we do expect low single digit production volume increases that with the cost control that our supply chain teams have put in place that we get some efficiencies out of that and get some small improvements and a tailwind on supply chain efficiencies in 25. Those wrapped together, probably about a quarter of the improvement. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is live. Garik Shmois : In consumer brands, just wondering if you could speak to how DIY and propane volumes were in the fourth quarter and any color on how you expect them to trend in 2025 would be great. Heidi Petz : We'll start with DIY. I think we've covered this earlier. Certainly weaker than expected. I will share, given from a CVG standpoint, the importance of these customers, strategic partnerships that we have. Continuing to invest in making sure that we are taking their success and our success. And this is really important that we're laser focused on ensuring that as the market does recover, that we and they are best positioned on that run-up. In terms of propane, I'm going to jump, let's leave it over to Al here. Al Mistysyn : Yes, I think the propane, we are under pressure in our fourth quarter. I think, that being said, we've maintained our investments in the propane, understanding that we don't react to a short-term headwind. We stay focused on the longer term and fully expect as, think about it as the paint stores or, I'm sorry, as the existing home turnover improves, we ought to see propane improvements in that segment and also DIY improvements in that segment as the year goes on. And that's kind of how we laid out the plan from a top line standpoint for consumer grants, really similar to how we were looking at paint stores group, first half, second half. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Patrick Cunningham from Citi Investment Research. Your line is live. Patrick Cunningham : I'm curious on the latest thoughts on the M&A pipeline. Should we maybe expect less of a focus on M&A this year, given some elevated capital spends end market's relatively challenging? Any update to your thinking on some of the more sizable coatings businesses that are coming to market? Heidi Petz : This is a really consistent approach that we take here. We're always going to be looking. I don't know that I would characterize this as more or less within the year. I think it would be a very steady hand at understanding where our portfolios are, where we want to drive growth within the portfolio buy segment. And if there is opportunity, to accelerate our strategy, whether it's a technology, a brand, or a region, we're always looking. But we will go back to our capital allocation policy in general, absent all the items that I'll walk through. We'll look at that, but we absolutely do not need M&A to grow. We're going to continue to focus on putting our foot on the gas where we know we have a right to win today. But should something attractive come along, you can assume that we're going to take a look at that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is live. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. Had a follow-up on the labor pool. Just curious whether you're hearing from your paint store customers anywhere in the country in particular where they're already seeing an impact of the deportation initiative on their labor pool. And if this is a realistic impact this year, do you think that it might be more impactful on the pro who paints and, maybe shifts more to the paint store's business or might it shift more to DIY? Any thoughts on that and/or regional impacts in your view? Heidi Petz : Steve, I think it's too early to tell. We're not hearing, by and large, we're not hearing, frankly, a lot of commentary about this impacting contractors on the store side or the pro who paint side relative to their labor pool. It does certainly reinforce, I think, our position in the market to be able to get ahead of these issues and focus on productivity. I think this just continues to put us in a leadership position there. In fact, I can tell you, I've been out with over a dozen customers since the start of the year. And if there's one theme that's consistent, it's an acknowledgement that, you guys are, you're there when you say you're going to be there. Who would have thought simply doing what you say you would do would be a differentiator? But the fact that we're staying true to our focus on solving for their profitability and their productivity, I think that positions us very nicely to be able to help when, if and when, and how this does impact them. In terms of any kind of toggling or switch between stores and consumer and propane, I don't see that happening in any material way. I think that that's going to be a dynamic that will impact everybody kind of equally. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Steve, the only thing I would add to that, to think that there'd be a shift back to DIY, it's just hard to see that when you look at, over a long period of time, the trend from do-it-yourself to do-it-for-me, because of some of the macroeconomic situation we have in the U.S. with an aging demographic, the average age of a home in the U.S. is 40 years old, which makes for more complex type of renovations or projects that there's a lot of equity in homes that allow people to view it as an investment to improve their homes for future value. And there's this trend of baby boomers staying in place longer and doing upgrades to their home because they know they're going to be there longer, and typically they've got more equity that they can hire out a contractor. So it's hard to see a flip from back to do-it-yourself over the longer term. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Aron Ceccarelli from Berenberg. Your line is live. Aron Ceccarelli : Perhaps, can you elaborate a little bit on the level of profitability of your market shares gains? Would it be fair to assume that these new accounts come at least at the beginning, at the lower level of margins? Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Yes, Aron, I wouldn't classify -- I wouldn't make a broad statement like that. I think there's a lot of different activities around new account activation, and depending on where that account is in their maturity level, and they may come in from a competitor and want a similar price point until they understand all the benefits, services, quality, delivery, that ecosystem that we talk about, our PRO+ app, and then those are the accounts that we're able to move up because they begin to sense and value what we have to offer. But I would not make a blanket statement, say all new accounts are that way. Heidi Petz : In fact, I would go so far as to say, with Al made a great point on the maturity of the contractor. Residential repainting, a great example where oftentimes coming in new, trying to learn. And our teams are able to intercept them early in that maturity curve, even all the way through to helping them present themselves, a professional bid, making sure they've got the yard signs, they're marketing their business. And when they see the value, everything that Al talked about, our focus then on selling them and putting them into better product and technology that they're going to make them even more efficient, certainly benefits everybody as well. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is live. Eric Bosshard : Two things. First of all, I'm curious in terms of price mix. If you're seeing any sensitivity across the architectural business on the pro side or on the consumer side, trading down or anything you're doing in an environment where there's greater price sensitivity, I know that people pay for value and productivity. That's a given with Sherwin. Anything different you're observing or planning for in that area? Heidi Petz : No, Eric, I would tell you, if anything, it's the opposite, and you said it really well, the value and productivity. As we continue to launch new products, as we continue to focus on getting our contractors on and off job sites, I think it works, candidly, the other way. And I would say that's true, certainly on the pro side, pro who paints and the consumer side. Eric Bosshard : And then, secondly, in terms of the incremental spend on reps and on the selling effort, helpful to see that that spend is moderating a bit in '25. In terms of the payback, any sense or guidance you can give us in terms of the payback curve as you've added them and invested in them? Are they up at full impact in '24 [Technical Difficulty] payback effort that shows up in '25. Any thoughts about how you think about the return dynamic from that investment? Al Mistysyn : Yes, Eric. You kind of broke up, but I think what you're asking is the timeliness of getting a return on our reps. And as you know, they're predominantly res repaint reps. And I think we get a return on those in one to two quarters as -- and I think about a density within a market because what we're able to do in our densest markets is take an existing res repaint territory that gets up to a high number of accounts, high level of sales, terrifically successful. We're able to split that territory, seed some of those accounts that maybe weren't getting the attention that quite honestly they deserved. We put a new rep in there and they both grow quickly back to where they were at a higher level. So the return on our rep, especially res repaint rep is really short. And we are getting a return and we expect to see those returns continue into 2025. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is live. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. This is [Karen Jung] [ph] for Laurence Alexander. Maybe just come back to a more general question for the full year 25. What has to go right for you to hit the high end of the guidance and what might go wrong given the softer for longer environment? So we look at the lower end of the guidance. Thank you. Al Mistysyn : Yes, I think where we're going to be within the guidance is going to be dependent on where paint stores group volume is within our high and low end of the range. And I could say that also about the other segments but really paint stores group is our fastest growing segment, our most profitable segment, and where they are in that volume range will dictate where we are from an EPS standpoint. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I'll now hand the conference back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Jim Jaye : Yes. Thank you, Matthew. As we outlined today, we expect the macroeconomic environment to remain choppy in 2025. No surprise there. But at the same time, and I think Heidi said it very well at the beginning, we're not waiting, we're relentlessly pursuing those opportunities that we do see. It's all about success by design. And we have a very proven track record here. Got a clear and winning strategy, the best team, we've made the right investments, and we know how to deliver the solutions for our customers that are going to make them more productive, more profitable, which is really important in this environment. Nobody's better positioned than Sherwin-Williams to win in the marketplace and deliver that consistent shareholder value. And that's exactly what we plan to do here in 2025. As always, we'll be available for your follow-up calls. And thank you again for your interest in Sherwin-Williams. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Everyone, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
