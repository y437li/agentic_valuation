These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay. Thanks, Brian. Good morning. This morning we reported first quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.41 above our guidance range. Operating margin exceeded our target and sales increased modestly in the quarter in line with our expectations as Tom will discuss in more detail in a moment. We are confirming our full year 2014 ongoing earnings per share guidance which is for double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range. Going forward we continue to expect accelerating sales growth as the year progresses and double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth starting in the second quarter. We are recovering share in our international and Nutrition business. We are continuing to drive above market sales growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics. We are launching new products to capture share in our Medical Devices business and we are on track to expand full year operating margin. I\u2019ll summarize first quarter performance before turning the call over to Tom and Brian for more detailed commentary. Diagnostics sales increased 5% in the quarter driven by continued momentum in Core Laboratory Diagnostics in both developed and emerging markets. In Molecular Diagnostics sales increased strong double digits in our core infectious disease testing segment where our best-in-class assays provide the opportunity for significant share expansion. In our Diagnostics pipeline we are investing in the development of multiple new instrument platforms that we will launch over the next several years. Our Medical Devices includes Vascular, Diabetes and Vision Care businesses. In our Vascular business, international sales representing 65% of our global business increased nearly 4% in the quarter, growth has been driven by a number of new products including our new peripheral stent Supera and our structural heart device MitraClip and in our drug-eluting stent product portfolio we are driving increased penetration of our Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold ABSORB. In the international markets where ABSORB is approved and actively promoted, it\u2019s now approaching 20% of our drug-eluting portfolio revenue. We are making significant progress to bring it to three major markets where it\u2019s not yet available, the U.S., Japan and China, which represent more than 50% of the world\u2019s coronary stent market. We\u2019ve recently completed patient enrollment in the ABSORB randomized clinical trials required for approval in these geographies. Vascular sales in the U.S. were lower in the first quarter due to trialing of a competitive drug-eluting stent, we anticipate better U.S. performance in the coming quarters as we recapture drug-eluting stent share focusing on the superior profile of XIENCE Xpedition and accelerate growth of our broad vascular portfolio including MitraClip and now Supera. Supera received U.S. FDA approval last month and expands our endovascular portfolio with the best-in-class stent technology. It treats blockages of the superficial femoral artery or SFA one of the largest and fastest growing segments in the peripheral stent market. In Diabetes Care sales were in line with our expectations. In the U.S. as we\u2019ve discussed, the market has been impacted by the implementation of the CMS competitive bidding program. Our management team has navigated this environment well versus the competition remaining focused on gaining share in the more attractive market segments. Outside of the U.S. emerging market growth was strong in the quarter and we are making progress towards CE Mark in the second half of this year for our next-generation sensing technology. And in Vision Care, sales increased 10% in the quarter driven by above market growth of our cataract lens business. We expect double-digit sales growth for the full year with continued positive momentum from new products, including our TECNIS Toric Intraocular Lens in the U.S., our TECNIS OptiBlue Lens in Japan and our new Catalys laser cataract system and several additional product launches throughout this year In Established Pharmaceuticals total operational sales performance was roughly in line with our expectation, in our key emerging markets for EPD strong growth in Brazil and India was offset by a temporary decline related to an expected plant shutdown for capacity expansion purposes to meet increasing demand. At the same time, EPD leadership is making progress on initiatives to accelerate growth by further aligning its commercial strategy with the opportunities these emerging markets represent. We continue to expect better momentum in EPD in the second half of this year with improved market growth in India and the benefit of additional plant capacity to meet sales demand for key products. And over the next several years we anticipate continued improvement in EPD\u2019s growth rate as sales and emerging markets become a larger component of these business. In Nutrition, as I mentioned, we are recapturing share in our International Pediatric Nutrition business following the supplier recall initiated last August. As I discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, we are executing on a recovery plan and regularly monitoring our progress. We remained on track to return to pre-call levels in the third quarter. In the second half of this year we are well-positioned in Nutrition for double-digit sales growth and operating margin expansion as we begin to anniversary the supplier recall. We opened three new manufacturing facilities to support strong global demand for both adult and pediatric nutrition. We continue to execute on our margin expansion initiatives and launched a number of new products into the new market segments across several key geographies. In the coming months, we'll launch new adult nutrition brand in Japan, our largest adult market outside of U.S. and over the course of the year we are launching several new pediatric nutrition products in fast-growing market segments in China and other emerging geographies. This includes a new infant formula product Eleva we launched in China just last week. These innovations bring advanced nutrition to meet the needs of our customers, drive share expansion and grow the market. So in summary, our first quarter ongoing earnings per share results were better than our expectations. We continue to expect accelerating sales growth as we progress through the year, particularly in the second half and we\u2019re on track to achieving another year of double-digit earnings per share growth. I will now turn the call over to Tom and Brian. Tom? Tom Freyman : Thanks, Miles. Today, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of $0.41, above our guidance range. As we forecasted in January, first quarter sales increased modestly on an operational basis. Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 3% on sales in the quarter, also consistent with our previous estimates. As a result, reported sales declined 2.5% in the quarter. It\u2019s important to keep our first quarter sales growth in perspective. As we indicated in January, we expected modest growth before exchange as we recover from the 2013 supplier recall nutrition and work through certain sales comparison. We are right on track with the sales progression we expected in January with sales growth before exchange essentially on our planned forecast. And exchange was close to the forecast we provided as well and what should be the most challenging quarter of the year for currency. So as sales are progressing as we planned, our full year forecast for sales growth remains unchanged. First quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 54% of sales, also in line with our guidance. Our overall spending levels in the first quarter were below forecast we provided in January. Ongoing R&D came in about $20 million below our expectations, which was simply a result of timing. We expect to fully fund our R&D initiatives over the remainder of the year. Ongoing SG&A spending was around $80 million lower than we planned. Approximately half of this was timing, which we expect to balance out over the last three quarters. The remainder reflects our continuing focus on managing down G&A costs and is available to either reinvest in the business or carry through the earnings for the year. So, as we factor first quarter ongoing EPS of $0.41 into our thinking on the full year, around half of the over delivery compared to our guidance is attributable to the timing of spending, which we expect to balance out over the remaining three quarters. Regarding our full year 2014 outlook for the P&L, we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 1% on our full year reported sales, with most significant impact in the first half of the year. This would result in reported sales growth in the low-to-mid-single digits for the full year 2014, consistent with our forecast in January. Operational sales growth is expected to be driven by continued strong growth in Diagnostics and Vision Care and sales growth accelerations in nutrition and established pharmaceuticals. We continued to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% of sales for the full year, which reflects the negative impact of around 50 basis points from foreign exchange. We also continued forecast ongoing R&D, somewhat above 6% of sales, ongoing SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales and an expansion of our full year adjusted operating margin by approximately 60 basis points in 2014. Turning to the outlook for the second quarter, we are forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52, reflecting double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range. We forecast operational sales growth in the low-to-mid-single digits in the second quarter. At current exchanges rates, we\u2019d expect a negative impact from exchange of approximately 1.5%, resulting in reported sales in the low single digits. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 54.5% of sales, ongoing SG&A expense of approximately 30.5% of sales and ongoing R&D expense somewhat above 6% of sales for the second quarter. We project specified items of $0.29 in the second quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release. As previously indicated, we expect the pace of our sales and ongoing EPS growth would accelerate throughout the year, as product launches and key initiatives ramp and as comparisons become more favorable. For the second half of 2014, we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid to upper single digit and steady operating margin expansion, supported by our continuing efforts to manage G&A expenses. So in summary, sales in the first quarter were in line with our expectations. We exceeded our ongoing EPS guidance and we are confirming our full year ongoing EPS guidance range of $2.16 to $2.26. As we start the year, we are well-positioned to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2014. With that, I will turn it over to Brian to review the business, operating highlights, and outlook. Brian? Brian Yoor : Thank you, Tom. This morning, I will review our first quarter 2014 performance and second quarter sales outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. Overall, our first quarter sales increased modestly and sales in emerging markets grew mid-single digits both in line with our expectations, as we work through a couple of year-over-year comparison items, one in International Nutrition and one in our Established Pharmaceuticals division. We estimate that these items impacted Abbott\u2019s year-over-year emerging market sales growth by approximately 4.5 percentage points in the quarter. I will now discuss each of our businesses. In our Diagnostics business, sales increased 5% in the first quarter, slightly ahead of our expectations. Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased more than 5% in the first quarter, as if that it continues to deliver above market performance in both developed and emerging markets. U.S. sales increased 11%, primarily due to several large health system customers selecting Abbott\u2019s integrated and flexible solutions to manage their testing volumes and increase operational efficiencies. International sales grew 4% in the quarter, driven by continued growth in emerging markets. We continue to broaden and differentiate our ARCHITECT assay menu and launched a new diabetes test in the U.S. in April. To address the growing prevalence of diabetes in the United States, our new test provides fast, accurate results to help laboratories manage the anticipated increase in demand for testing. This test aids physicians with diagnosing and monitoring diabetes as well as identifying people at risk for developing diabetes. In Molecular Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 5.6% in the first quarter with international sales up 12.6%, led by continued strong growth in infectious disease testing and double-digit growth in emerging markets. In the U.S., growth of infectious disease testing, which is our largest segment, where we have best-in-class assays, was offset by the expected timing of the conclusion of a distribution agreement for a respiratory test. In Point-of-Care Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased nearly 3% with international sales growing double digits as this business had increased its focus on expanding in select European and emerging markets. In the first quarter, the U.S. business experienced somewhat slower -- somewhat longer, excuse me, purchasing cycles and reduced utilization rates in the hospitals. We started to see stabilization of U.S. order patterns in March and April and continued to focus on building momentum in international markets. For the second quarter in our global diagnostics business, we are forecasting mid-to-high single-digit operational sales growth. In Medical Devices, sales in our vascular business increased 1% in the quarter. International vascular sales increased nearly 4% driven by continued momentum of our drug-eluting stent product portfolio, including ABSORB and double-digit sales growth of MitraClip as well as our endovascular products. We expect a number of new product launches to drive improved performance over the next several quarters. As Miles mentioned, in March, we received U.S. FDA approval for our Supera peripheral stent which treats blockages in the superficial femoral artery or SFA. The global SFA market is growing at a mid-to-high single-digit pace. With the approval of Supera, Abbott now has one of the most comprehensive and competitive portfolios in the peripheral market. We are also making good progress to bring ABSORB to the United States, China and Japan over the next few years. ABSORB clinical data demonstrating positive long-term outcomes was presented at the American College of Cardiology Medical meeting. We expect to present one-year clinical result in the second half of this year from ABSORB II, which is the first randomized trial to compare ABSORB to standard of care. As we look ahead to the second quarter 2014, we expect sales in our global Vascular business to increase in the low single digits on an operational basis. In Diabetes Care, global sales in the first quarter decreased 9.5% in line with our expectations. International sales which represent approximately 65% of total Diabetes Care sells grew for the sixth consecutive quarter increasing 4%, lead by double-digit growth in the emerging market. As Miles mentioned, we are also moving our new investigational next-generation sensing technology through development and expect to receive European CE Mark in the second half of this year. In the U.S., as anticipated, sales were impacted by the carryover effect from implementation of the CMS competitive bidding program for Medicare patients in July of last year. For the second quarter in our global Diabetes business, we continue to forecast a low double-digit decline on an operational basis. In Vision Care, we achieved 10% sales growth in the first quarter above our expectations, with double-digit growth in both emerging and developed markets. Sales of our cataract products increased double digits and represents more than 65% of our Vision Care business where we are capturing market share with multiple new products. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, we continue to make good progress with the launch of several new cataract lenses in both the United States and Japan. In addition, our new Catalys laser cataract system has received very good feedback from our customers as it continues to penetrate high volume cataract centers. We expect continued double-digit performance in our Vision Care business throughout this year as we introduced more new products. This includes first quarter launches in Japan of TECNIS Toric lenses for patients with the stigmatism and TECNIS OptiBlue preloaded lens, which improves the ease of use for the cataract surgeon and enhances predictability of the procedure. For the second quarter of 2014, we expect our global Vision Care business to continue to grow double digits on an operational basis. In our Established Pharmaceuticals business or EPD, sales in the quarter decreased modestly. Sales in our developed and other market segments decreased 1.5% in the quarter. Developed markets performed largely in line with our expectations, partially offset by better than expected performance in a number of emerging markets that are included in this business segment. Sales in our key emerging market segments were relatively flat in the quarter. As we expected, year-over-year sales comparison in this business were affected by the timing of supply of key products in our women\u2019s health portfolio, primarily due to an expected plant shutdown for capacity expansion purposes. As Miles mentioned, we expect sales growth in key emerging markets to accelerate over the course of the year. For the second quarter of 2014, we are forecasting sales in our Established Pharmaceuticals business to grow in the low single digits on an operational basis. And lastly, our Nutrition business, where global sale decreased 1.7% in the first quarter, in line with our previously provided guidance. As expected, international pediatric sales were impacted by the unfavorable year-over-year comparisons created by the previously reported 2013 supplier recall. The impact of this event is estimated to have reduced international pediatric operational sales by approximately $75 million or 12 percentage points in the quarter. We are recovering share in the affected market and expect to launch a number of new products in China and other emerging markets to help drive sales growth. Late last year, we launched our Similac simple pack into the online channel in China and just this month we launched a new product Eleva that will further enhance our competitiveness in the premium segments of the Chinese and some formula market. International adult sales increased nearly 12.5 percentage points in the quarter driven by strong growth of our Ensure brand along with execution of several market development initiatives. We continue to shape and grow priority international markets and expect to launch several new products this year, including the launch of a new adult brand [Enavo] (ph) in Japan, our largest adult nutrition market outside the U.S. [Enavo] (ph) is a next-generation follow-on product for our market leading Ensure brand. In the United States, the severe winter weather did have some impact on Ensure, PediaSure and performance to nutrition brands in the retail segment. As a market leader, we partnered with retailers late in the quarter to launch demand-creation programs to boost consumer demand and are seeing positive early results. In our infant nutrition business, we recently launched Similac with OptiGRO, which contains Abbott\u2019s exclusive blend of DHA, Lutein and Vitamin E to support brain, eye and immune system development. Lastly, on a global basis, we continued to expand our manufacturing presence in nutrition to be closer to our customers and at the same time, further expand operating margin. We expect to open three new manufacturing facilities in the second quarter this year in China, India and the United States to support strong global demand for our products. And we remain on track to achieve an operating margin ratio of more than 20% sales in our nutrition business by 2015. For the second quarter, we are forecasting mid single-digit sales growth on an operational basis for our global nutrition business. So in summary, in the first quarter, sales were in line with our expectations and we delivered ongoing earnings per share of $0.41 ahead of our guidance. Moving forward, we remain on track to deliver continued margin expansion and expect sales growth acceleration in our nutrition, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. We are well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. David Roman : Thank you and good morning everyone. First, I had just one strategic question and a follow-up on the financial side. Maybe Miles, you could touch, just talk a little bit more about your evolving views around capital allocation. As I sort of think about how the Abbott story has gone over the last year post the spin. I think we\u2019ve sort of seen an evolution in the growth rate as it relates to the topline. And correspondingly, a sort of change in the way you thought about capital deployment with the big dividend increase last October is followed by a fairly big buyback announcement at the beginning of this year. But maybe you can sort of help frame for us, how you are thinking about using cash from here in the context of how you\u2019re seeing growth play out, because even with the buyback and dividend you still sit on a pretty healthy net cash balance and if you believe any of the analysts\u2019 forecast out there, it should grow pretty meaningfully in the next several years. Miles White : Yeah, you noticed that, did you? Thank you, David. Let me take you back a little bit at the time of the split. When we split, we split with AbbVie, the balance sheet to debt, et cetera. And we did all that proportionately with cash flow at the time and we set our dividend rate on each side proportionately as well. And so AbbVie ended up with a very healthy dividend, somewhat disproportionate to what Abbott had paid prior to that. And Abbott dividend as a percent of EPS was lower and we started out that way primarily and the combined dividend as you\u2019ll recall was higher than Abbott in the past. And we started out the year, I would say, waiting to see how the split was going to progress, cash flows, et cetera. And debating the appropriate cash return, et cetera because Abbott as you know has had a long history of healthy dividend, dividend growth, et cetera and so in the fall made the decision to increase the dividend back to a percent of EPS. It was around 40% I think at the time. And that\u2019s dividend being paid now. So, we made that adjustment because I think that the identity of this investment to stock has always been both growth and cash return. And it\u2019s been a very stable, reliable performer that way because of the combination of the growth and the cash return. As far as share repurchases have gone, we\u2019ve been steady share repurchasers year-to-year. There have been some times when we\u2019ve taken it lower, sometimes we\u2019ve taken it higher and so forth because there is a limit to how much cash you want to accumulate because cash generally isn\u2019t earning much on your balance sheet these days. So we look at where our own deployment of that cash will go. And if it starts to accumulate at some level beyond, the company\u2019s good use of it, then we think about combination of either dividend or share repurchases. And that\u2019s always our thought around that. We keep our debt in a proper balance, we believe. As you note, our cash flow is strong and in no way, have we changed strategy. I think there is plenty of ammo on the balance sheet, should we see opportunities in acquisitions or licensing, or whatever deals maybe out there that can enhance or add to our business, I don\u2019t feel constrained at all by the balance sheet. So I think investors expect us to steward the assets well and if there are say excess cash or excess assets that we don\u2019t foresee an immediate use for that we can invest at a better rate, I think a return to investors is always kind of a first priority. So we have a steady policy around dividend. We have a steady policy around share repurchases. We\u2019ve had significant share repurchase earlier in the year this year and I still feel like I have got plenty of cash for M&A activity and not much constrained on borrowing capacity should something significantly larger come along, et cetera. So I would say that there has really been no change in philosophy. I do believe in a strong cash return to investors and we will keep looking at our dividend and our share buyback that way and I continue to look at M&A activity. Are you there? David Roman : Fair to say continued balance use of cash but no necessary urgency that sort of up big M&A as we have seen elsewhere sort of in healthcare over the past couple of months? Miles White : Well, I never feel push for M&A because of accumulation of cash. I would say M&A is driven much more strategically by opportunity that fits our business. And I think in the last couple of calls with investors, I have commented that I haven\u2019t seen a lot on the radar screen and I would say during the split, there is only so much integration or disintegration activity that an organization can absorb or sustain. So during the time of the split, some of the M&A or deal activity we did was rather modest or smaller deals that we are particularly focused on our Medical Device business. And while a fair amount of the disintegration activity is ongoing in a lot of our back office areas with AbbVie. It\u2019s also coming to a conclusion here in the coming years. So without forecasting anything specific, we have always been opportunistic about a lot of different opportunities we have been interested in in different geographies. And tracking those and it\u2019s possible that could kind of find its way back to the radar screen here. David Roman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just a quick financial follow-up for Tom. On the P&L understandingly, the gross margin has a lot of moving parts in their FX, you have got the plant shutdown? You did mention in your prepared remarks a tight G&A control and focus on that line. Could you give us maybe some senses to where we are sort of in the sort of self-help type or cost cutting that you can do to help improve the margin profile here? Tom Freyman : Certainly, we factored some of that into our original plan, we worked hard last year to identify areas of efficiency and I would say, we made some initial steps when we put the plan together and as you know, in the second half of the year in our forecast, the SG&A ratio gets better and that\u2019s due in part to some of those initiatives starting to benefit the P&L. But I think we have created a culture here and people understand what we are trying to do in terms of focusing on this G&A area. I think a little bit of what we saw in the first quarter is that playing out and people are really working hard at it. I would say, perhaps, we are a little bit ahead of what we would have thought when we put the plan together. So we are building on that and it\u2019s something that we are going to continue to build on during the year and certainly as we roll into 2015. David Roman : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Maybe just a quick one here for, Miles, and one for, Tom. Miles, I think for most investors they view this first quarter as certainly the most challenging quarter of the year and yet margin and earnings were certainly better than expected? So I wonder from here, could you help us understand the margin story and momentum from here? And then related your confidence in Nutritional margin is clear, but should we be thinking about opportunities at Abbott on a segment basis, on a corporate cost basis or both? Miles White : Okay. Yeah. Let me back up to the bigger context of the year and the quarter. As you know, because of something that happened in the second half of last year, we have got an optical challenge here, more optical than operational really, because, Nutrition recall we had in the second half of the year was significant. Exchange went disproportionately against us in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. There is a bunch of comparative things I can tell you. But at the end of the day it makes for a tale of two halves and when you are lapping the impact of those it makes this first half look depressed than the second half look like a huge ramp and the truth is neither is true. And it\u2019s really a comparison issue in a lot of cases. I would love to say, gee, but for these things, the growth rate this quarter would look like X. But the fact is that\u2019s the truth. And so the first half of the year looks one way, the second half looks another. And I would recall, I\u2019d say first of all, I\u2019d remind you when we gave our guidance, we gave double-digit guidance, which we\u2019ve done every year for last seven years I think. And we come into the year knowing the first half doesn\u2019t do that, but the second half then looks like this big ramp and the optics to that have -- some people say, gee, can you really get there and I say, well yeah, it\u2019s really more comparison than anything else. The underlying fundamentals of everything I\u2019m looking at looks solid to me. I don\u2019t see any trends or anything that are concerning me yet. Now that said, I\u2019m not a forecaster of exchange and last year exchange went the wrong way in the second half and not sure I could have forecasted it to the degree that it happened. But and I certainly couldn\u2019t have forecasted the recall. But in any case, one of the challenges is that, that quarter-to-quarter, look because you\u2019ve got to constantly remind investors about the elements that are affecting the oddness of this comparison. And I\u2019d say the first half is trending better than I expected. We do have a number of cost and expense initiatives and I would say they are focused partly because of the separation with AbbVie, and partly focused on just greater efficiency and the shaping of our business. And they happened to be a lot of the same areas. So as you work through the separation of back office things and so forth, would that be, it\u2019s the opportunity to kind of get things resized, reshaped, located in the right places and so on. That\u2019s all going pretty well. And there is a lot of initiatives that way inside the company that are coming along. So as Tom, I think pointed out, the beat here, the $0.06 beat is partly timing because -- and I\u2019m happy about that because otherwise that optical comparison of the first half and second half does look pretty dramatic and there is a timing issue in this. Part of it\u2019s in R&D. Part of it\u2019s in SG&A, et, cetera. But at least the optics look a little better. And part of it is not timing, part of it\u2019s real. And I know at some point, somebody is going to ask me here, gee, why didn\u2019t you raise guidance and I\u2019m waiting to see if we get to that and I\u2019m sure Mike\u2019s going to ask me pretty soon. I will explain when I get there. But the point is there is a lot of opportunity here in real cost. We\u2019ve seen a lot of improvement in our gross margins. First of all, above the discretionary spending line but I think most of you realize whether it\u2019s been price pressure in Europe, or exchange itself that all that benefit of the gross margin improvements has largely offset, what otherwise would have been deteriorating margin because of exchange or pricing, et cetera and we haven\u2019t deteriorated. In fact, we\u2019ve improved gross margin anyway. Then on top of that -- and I think there's still quite a bit of opportunity there for us and we are well planned in going after it. On the other hand then in expense, there is good spending and they are spending that you would rather not spend too much on. And in a lot of our G&A categories, I think there's opportunity for us to spend less and be more efficient then that\u2019s real money too. And some of that will improve margins at the bottom line and some of it will allow us to spend more either in SG&A or R&D. But the fact is our SG&A spending, I think is pretty healthy as it is. We are up 31%, 32%, something like. We are at 31% or 32% as a percent of the P&L. And it\u2019s a pretty healthy spend. Now, could you spend more? I\u2019ve never asked the general manager yet that if they needed money, would they take it to spend more and of course they would all take it and spend more. But I think we\u2019ve got healthy spending. I think the P&L is healthy. I think that the balance is right. We\u2019ve got opportunity to improve spending and improve gross margin. And as we work through the things we're doing to improve our topline growth and our share gain and our expansion in the number of markets, I think it\u2019s good for investors that they can count on a certain amount of margin expansion and profit growth, while we wait for the topline and the economies and other things to improve. So, I hope that answered your question. David Lewis : All right. Thanks, Miles. And I think one additional question for Tom here. I think I may have missed in the commentary, Tom. But historically when you do a buyback, your buybacks were heavier in the first half than the second half. Can you just talk about the pace of the buyback in the first half of the year, how active you were in the first quarter and should we expect a historical Abbott practice of buybacks to occur here again in \u201914? Thank you. Tom Freyman : Yeah. Well, as you saw in the release, our average shares were about $19 million below the prior year, which was about 1% below. We were pretty aggressive in the first quarter on the share buyback and I think David, your comment is pretty accurate. We are pretty much through the vast majority of what we\u2019re going to do in that area. We like the price of the stock and we felt that it was a good time to execute. So we\u2019re down about 1% on average in the quarter. But as you know, that improves after the first quarter, because we bought throughout that period, and the second and third and fourth quarters will benefit even more from the share buyback. So you\u2019re right the vast majority of it was done in the quarter. David Lewis : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : Thank you for taking the questions. And Miles I\u2019m not going to ask why you didn\u2019t raise guidance. So I\u2019m sorry I will stay that for someone else. Let me focus on the International Nutrition business, because if our math is right, if we back up the 75 million from Fonterra and you back out FX, you still got a business that\u2019s only up by 4.5%, which is kind of well below that it was growing prior to Fonterra. So, can you spend a minute on that? So, we\u2019re not getting impacting on it that from backing out the 75 million from Fonterra and International Pediatric Nutrition is kind of 4.5% there. Miles White : Yes. I\u2019m going to let Brian answer as he is dying to answer that for you, go ahead. Brian Yoor : Thanks, Miles. So Mike, yes, I\u2019d say math, I mean, you get about 4%. I think you need to go back to Q1 and look at what we had said in Q1 last year in our Pediatric International Nutrition business. I think we grew somewhere around 21%, and historically we have been saying more, think of this business kind of sustainably performing in the mid-teens. So we\u2019re up against the comparison last year which is worldwide. We launched a lot across our dollars portfolio and adjusting for that, it puts you more back up into to the double digits. So as we move forward, we are in a good position. We continue to recover in China, so we are seeing the recovery there. You see where we just launched a new product, if you will. They will help us to further compete as we segment the premium market over there. There is opportunities for there for us with our new product that I mentioned with Eleva and even more opportunity to come here as we open our plant in the second quarter, which will also provide further capabilities there as well and will also bolster our return back to our historical growth rates there. But basically, when you look at the first quarter, you do have a comparable that you\u2019re facing in Q1 where we\u2019re launching a lot of tolerance across the portfolio. Miles White : Mike, I would add to that. And I keep answering questions this way, this is not a business, it\u2019s also smooth quarter to quarter, even though you think it should be. And so sometimes the comparisons are choppy in the past when we had the pharma business with us, so much attention was paid to pharma and HUMIRA and other things that people didn\u2019t really notice the choppiness of the nutrition business and factors like what Brian just highlighted had made a difference from time to time. I would say that there a couple of things are clear. The economy has definitely pressured the business some, particularly the U.S. and I think in emerging markets as well. I think we see that slower underlying market rates like everybody else does, and yet that emerging market rate is still much higher than developed markets, but we\u2019ve seen that pressure. I note that a lot of companies have pointed at the harsh winter in the U.S. and so what, I don\u2019t know whether winter affected us or not. I suppose it stands to reason that it could have in the U.S. And internationally, the single biggest thing, as you know, that has affected us has been this recall and lapping it, because it affected more than one country. But that said, if you ask me, am I satisfied with the growth rates in some of these countries anyway? The answer will clearly be, no. So I think there is more potential to do better, I do. And I think we are making the right investments and the right changes and so forth to address that. A lot of our attention is currently being paid to the countries that were impacted by the recall. And I would say the teams are doing a really great job in terms of the recovery, given the dynamics of the infant formula market. We still got tremendous opportunity there and we are investing to secure that opportunity. We got tremendous opportunity in the adult nutrition in some markets where we are not present and China always is a big opportunity that way. So I\u2019m not discouraged I think at all, I\u2019m never very satisfied, but I am discouraged. I think that sometimes this business looks like 20% in the quarter and sometimes it looks like 10% or 12% or 8% or 9% or whatever and it does kind of roll in humps. But underlying I think it\u2019s still very robust and strong market, all of us would benefit from little tailwind of economy, but you never take that for granted. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Let me couple of quick follow-up. So, one, I wanted to ask just on the adult nutritional business in the U.S. Paragon announced in the quarter that they will enter that market with a store brand Ensure and you dominate that market with Ensure, you have about 70% share. Can you just talk about how you view the competitive landscape and agree to which we should be watching how this plays out with Paragon being a real competitive potentially coming in? And then just lastly, Tom, can you just spent a minute on the timing issue expenses they thought that it was so different than your guidance in January caught us all off-guard? So what surprised you that the expenses didn't occur this quarter that they slipped into later parts of the year? Thanks. Miles White : Well, let me comment on the decision first. First of all, I would say, Paragon is a fine competitors and I admire a lot of accomplishment Paragon had in the market that they serve. That said, we've had private label competition for Ensure for sometime in the Wal-Mart which is one of our biggest distribution outlets has its own private label to compete with Ensure. So that's not new for us. And we've already had that kind of competition in these categories for a year, so whether a new entrant in the category makes a difference or not is, I guess, to be seen, it's not a new thing. Our share position with Ensure hasn't been impacted significantly by the existence of the private label competition that\u2019s already there and I think it's in the mass outlets that you would expect we have the greatest impact. So I would never like to predict how a fine competitor is going to do, but I think we're in a very strong position with our brand and our product in the way our customers view it. And now let, Tom, address your expense question. Tom Freyman : Yeah. Mike, it was really interesting in the quarter usually the challenges is getting sales forecast accurate and as I indicated in my remarks, we were incredibly accurate on our sales forecast and right on track. Usually in the spending areas when you look across our businesses and across the functional areas, everyone forecast the rate of spending and usually when you look at the actual there are few puts and takes, and you're usually pretty close to your forecast which is very unusual this quarter that virtually every unit was under spending in the same direction and when we worked with them and talk to them about their plans and initiatives and the importance of that spending relative to achieving commercial objectives in the businesses and in terms of some of the project work in some of the other areas it was still very critical that we continue to invest in those programs despite the fact that we didn't forecast to spending as accurately as we should. So, I think, to your question, historically, we've been very good at forecasting this, so it was just a very unusual quarter and everything just kind of move the same direction and really this is spending we should be doing. We've got lots of good opportunities. And I'm just talking about the timing piece of this from my remarks. We've tons of opportunities in the new product areas and the things that we should be investing the business and will be investing over the next three quarters. Brian Yoor : Mike, I'd say, from my part, I was also caught a little off-guard by being ahead so far in the quarter. And we have looked at it, how much of it is real timing and how much of it is real? And I think, the fact to the matter is, we went into the year with the double-digit target, our original guidance was double-digit. We did not constrain SG&A, R&D spending in the settling of those targets relative to the goals we have, the new product launches, the expansion opportunities and so forth. And frankly, I'm favorably pleased -- I am pleased that we are ahead on a number other things that we wanted to do. I think even though you didn't ask me, I want to see another quarter play to see what those underlying trends are. I still think it's early in the year to be making adjustments to expectations. But frankly it's possible. I think at the end of the second quarter we will have a pretty good feel for how things are trending for the year and into the second half. I don't really have any desire to constrain spending, but I don't have any desire to constrain what the bottom-line does either, I mean, if, even though we forecast that arrange to give us 10% growth at the midpoint of the range, that's actually low for us in terms of double-digit growth over the last seven years. We\u2019ve been higher than that in our overall growth in the last seven years every year. So I think there is a pretty good chance, some of this is sustainable. I think we\u2019ll see another quarter played in if we get a little boost from gradually improving economy and so forth. I feel pretty good about the second half. I feel pretty good about the profiles of the businesses. I feel good about our spending capacity. I would like to spend more, but I know that\u2019s always a trade-off with investors you like to participate to. So I think that\u2019s possible in both directions. And I\u2019m pleased that we can balance this timing a bit, but I\u2019m also pleased that I think we\u2019re ahead. I\u2019d just like to see how ahead we are and what kind of sustainable basis and make sure that we are robustly funding everything we want to do. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeff Holford : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So just on the non-cost phasing part of the EPS beat. So can you just give us a bit more color on which division about $40 million of the non-phase part of the SG&A was, just which division that was probably being focused on? And then you keep reiterating the original mid-term guidance in 2015 for nutrition of more than 20%, but that could lead investors generally think that once you get above 20% for that division, that\u2019s kind of your ceiling on margins. When do you think you will be able to update the market on what more of a real long run rate of margin performance could be in that business? Thank you. Miles White : I never give forecast out through the following year and I don\u2019t constraint margin when I look at. I mean, actually I\u2019d say interestingly, it\u2019s a rare debate that you think you got too much margin or too much margin growth. I think it\u2019s a fair call. There is, our diagnostics business, for example, as you probably aware has enjoyed great improvement in gross margin over the last several years and that drops through to the bottom line in operating margin and so forth. And there\u2019s kind of a point where you would say, okay, it\u2019s making enough money, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re spending enough in SG&A and R&D, which we are. And they\u2019re in a fairly heavy investment phase in R&D because they\u2019ve got multiple systems in development, all of which remain on track and timing and so forth. And I think it\u2019s somewhat unprecedented that way. But at some point you say, look we can make something too profitable, I haven\u2019t had that problem. Although I think as we\u2019ve noted in the improvements in diagnostics over time, they\u2019re getting up there to first best-in-class profitability in that business. And I think nutrition has a way to go. There\u2019s still an opportunity there. It doesn\u2019t constraint spending, there is no limit. I mean, we\u2019re not operating against some limit, now would I forecast one for you because I don\u2019t have one. So I would say, we\u2019re always kind of a relentlessly pushing forward in the improvement of the profiles of the business. We want to be efficient users of assets and expenses. And while there is opportunity for margin expansion, there is also no substitute for top-line growth and you\u2019ve got to investigate that top-line growth, so we got to find that balance. Tom, there was a question there about the mix in the division. Tom Freyman : Jeff, it\u2019s kind of the same of the answer I provided to Mike. I mean it\u2019s pretty much across the board, relatively small amounts across the various divisions, but we added it all up. It\u2019s just turned out to be a fair amount of timing in the quarter. So, no one division really stands out. Jeff Holford : And now sort of quick follow-up on EPD if I can. Just could we expect some sort of restocking that business in Q2 with the plant manufacturing coming back on board again? Miles White : Probably. Yeah, Brian. Brian Yoor : Thanks, Miles. Yes, I think, Jeff, to think about that over the Q2, Q3 timeframe, as the way this works is you had inventory with the distributors, those distributors will be working off inventory to meet the end consumers demand. And likewise then we would be coming back and just working with our distributors to restore them to their ongoing normal inventory levels here in established pharma. Jeff Holford : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Josh Jennings : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just first, just a follow-up on the EPD business, understanding that the reacceleration of the back half is going to be pushed by continued mix shift towards emerging markets. Can you talk this and give us an update about some of those new SKUs or new products that you\u2019re getting registrations in, in new countries that you\u2019re entering into and where we\u2019re in terms of those metrics? Brian Yoor : Yes, Josh, I\u2019ll kick this off and let, Tom or Miles add more color. Really this business is more going to be about our portfolios that we are building, not really one SKU matters, but I would say, the team is making progress, as it evaluates where it wants to be strong, for example, in women\u2019s health or in gastroenterology in spaces like this, where they have a very rigorous first to go, looking where there is might be gaps in the portfolio that they can easily augment or going through LNA. So there is a lot of activity going on there. I would expect as part of the acceleration in the second half, we will continue to see a strong growth in India. We mentioned Brazil earlier. India has returned to, I guess a more healthy market growth versus what the market saw last year, recall last year we saw this market slow as it implemented what we call this drug pricing control order, which cause a little bit of channel disruption if you will. We are coming out of that. We are seeing the market return to nice growth rates. Our growth rate is well. So that sets us up as well for some acceleration as we move through the second half in one of our largest -- our largest country if you will in the established pharmaceutical business. Miles White : Hey, Josh. I would add to that, on the emerging market side in particular in this business, there are 14 countries or so that we put extra emphasis on and focus on and each has a plan that\u2019s very detailed about the build-out of its key therapeutic categories in that country or that market and the depth or breadth of product line within each therapeutic category and there is a plan there, that\u2019s a combination of two things in each country. First is, our internal registrations from our own creation of pipeline or existing products and second is an LNA budget for filling gaps or opportunities that they see in their country. It\u2019s the one place where we have decentralized the bit of the LNA activity into the hands of the President of that business and his staff, so that they can more rapidly go after this smaller, say, product or product line opportunities that can enhance our position in a lot of these markets. I can\u2019t give you a lot of detail or background about how that\u2019s going, because frankly, its dozens and dozens of products and opportunities in countries and so forth. But it\u2019s pretty comprehensive, pretty detailed and it\u2019s tracked very closely by them and it\u2019s getting a lot of attention and you build it out a little bit of a time. This is not a business of blockbusters, although, ironically the product for which we shutdown the plant for expansion here in the first quarter, it\u2019s a significant product for EPD, a very significant product, which is why we needed the plant expansion. And I figure if we are going to have a plant expansion or suppress a quarter, this is the one to do it when we knew it is going to be a tough comparison anyway. So it\u2019s going to get that out of way. We have got some products like that that are fairly big sellers, but generally this is the base hit business, a lot of base hits and so everyone of these countries has a got plan around whole portfolio base hits to enhance this business and we are going out a lot more in the product maybe we did it first. Josh Jennings : Thank you. And just one follow-up on the devices unit, just specifically in diabetes, with the headwinds that you are facing here in the U.S. market, you\u2019ve committed on next-generations sensing technology platform? But what other strategic initiatives can you put into play to help with the risk the competitive bidding could continue and pricing could continue to be headwind in the out years, what are the strategic initiatives can you manufacture to support the diabetes unit? Thanks a lot. Miles White : Well, I would say, this is one unit, I am actually, I am very excited about, I am studying about the innovation coming here. I think that our team there did a wonderful job segmenting this market in a way that minimized the damage we took from competitive bidding. We took hit just like everybody else did. But I think to a lesser degree, because I think we focused on segments that, frankly, we are more profitable and less vulnerable in a way than what the overall targeted competitive bidding was. Now, that said, I think, we play great defense and what is more challenge market right now. But going forward, innovation that\u2019s coming here, which we will launch in Europe late this summer is pretty significant and I think a pretty unique product that I expect will be very well-received by diabetic patients. And it hasn\u2019t had a lot of visibility yet. It will in the coming months. We keep referring to what is next-generation. But, frankly, it\u2019s quite a creative product. And I think that, I think it\u2019s going to have a lot of impact on the business. I have got great hopes for this. And I think that the diabetic community in particular both physicians and patients are going to think it\u2019s a terrific product. So I have got some great expectations for that and I think that as that mode of testing progresses over time this is going to be a fairly good business, pretty good business for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start off with M&A, Miles you made some penalizing comments earlier I think in response to David Roman\u2019s question. Could you talk a little bit about, whether you focus is on technology versus geographic expansion, large versus small deals? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks. Miles White : Yes, Larry, I am afraid all I call tell you is, yes. Yes, the answer to that is, yes. It\u2019s geographic, it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know where you define big, I mean\u2026 Larry Biegelsen : Can you hear me? Miles White : Almost all of this, some people would consider small and we might consider big, I mean in the context of this company has seen. Some of this is really significant to us. And what we\u2019re looking at is nicely enhancing to our businesses and our positions. Nothing has ever done till it\u2019s done. So I think it\u2019s dangerous to forecast anything in particular, but at least like what\u2019s on the menu and like what I see hear in a few places and it\u2019s across a couple of our sectors. There is -- if you\u2019re looking for deals today, I think it\u2019s a difficult deal market, because in some cases valuations are very high or there is not great quality in the assets in some cases. It\u2019s -- I think we\u2019ve said this several years for the last 15, I mean I think the deal gets a little tougher over year. And yet, we\u2019re looking in the places that can really enhance our positions, our businesses and so forth. We\u2019ve always had a pretty difficult or tough hurdle for the quality of deals. We\u2019ve had a fairly good track record that way. And I like what\u2019s on the menu right now. We will just have to see how plays out. What I am cautious about, it\u2019s hard to forecast until something is done. But if I tell you there is nothing on my menu, then there is nothing on my menu. And now I can\u2019t tell you that, I can\u2019t tell you there is nothing on my menu. So I don\u2019t want to surprise you by telling there is nothing on the menu and next week I certainly had a great idea or great possibility and it won\u2019t -- it's not going be next week. But I would say couple of things coming here that would be nice additions to the business, I guess that\u2019s about all I can tell you. Larry Biegelsen : That\u2019s very helpful. And then just as my follow-up, the nutrition on mid single digit growth in the second quarter, is there pretty big improvement from what we saw this quarter, I think in the down 1.7%? So, can you talk or give us a little more color where you expect those improvements to come from just because that\u2019s a big part of what will drive acceleration from this quarter in the overall business? And just lastly, the added emerging growth rate this quarter, you\u2019ve given us that in the past, can you give that to us this quarter? Thanks. Brian Yoor : Let me start with the first one and then I will come back to nutrition. With respect to the emerging markets overall, if you take the couple buck for adjustments that we talk about in my scripts that refers to the plant capacity expansion affecting our Established Pharmaceuticals as well as where we\u2019re at with respect to our recovery, it puts you closer in the 8% to 9% operational growth worldwide in the emerging market growth. So still very solid growth, Larry. Coming back to nutrition, I will go back to my first comment that remember Q1, first of all, we did have a lot of launches in Q1 of \u201913 that made for a little bit more difficult comparison as I was taking to Mike there. But secondly, our recovery is going well in China and Vietnam. And so as we move through time and we look at our ramp there, where we\u2019re gaining share back in the markets, we would expect that impact to moderate as we move into quarter two, that will have a significant impact on our step-up. The other thing I would add is as we saw overall in the United States, we saw a retail environment that was quite slow, I think not only did the companies who serve retailer feel but the retailer themselves felt it. We have been out there and it\u2019s a great opportunity for us as the category leader, as the market leader, as Miles mentioned, particularly in adult, and even in brands like PediaSure to work with our retailers to generate demand for the consumers through some retail activation programs and those are generating some nice early results. They are marching early into April. We will continue to watch that, but we definitely would expect a step up in the United States. I will also comment too in the United States that this was the last quarter of our getting through the transition where we were exiting the non-core, what I\u2019d call device or tubes and sets business in the United States. So that also will drive some step-up sequentially as we look at the U.S. results. So the combination of those two things Larry, the recovery, the U.S. and just continued underlying strong demand in our nutrition business worldwide, both pediatric and adult will cause us to move up to chain there as we expect. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the question. Brian Yoor : So [Ella] (ph), we have got -- have time for one -- we're going to one more question here. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first question for you, Miles, the back-end acceleration, a lot of it is going to be driven by nutritionals and a lot of it's going to be driven by the recovery in China. And one of the push-backs I get and one of the concerns I've been hearing is the China economy slowing. And I know Miles you're in China several times a year or so, I'm wondering if you could just take a moment and just talk about what you're seeing in the China nutritionals market and how Abbott's positioned there so that some of that concern can be (indiscernible)? I had a follow-up on the U.S. infant business. Miles White : I suppose it's fair to say in a general sense the economy or the market in China has slowed some, but they're slowed and then they're slowed. And China is not a slow market, China is not like Europe or the U.S. or Japan or developed markets, it's by comparison a robustly growing market. The fact that it\u2019s not growing double digits may disappoint some people, but I think the high single-digit growth rates in the Chinese economy are pretty attractive, and then our business opportunity on top of that pretty attractive. And I suppose it depends on which competitors you ask and how damaged we were by the recall or the dynamics that changed in the market or whatever. I see the market that's worthy of a significant investment and great opportunity, and we are gaining our share back. Growth rate is good, very good. I think if I expand that to the second half of the year, the reality here of our business is we just have the quarter that we didn't want to have, but had to have as a transition in the year because the optics and the comparison and so forth. Next quarter gets better and it\u2019s still part of that first half, but I'd say the second quarter is a transitional quarter for us and second half of the year is pretty robust. There is nothing heroic that has to take place for that second half of our year to be robust. We are well ahead on our own margin initiatives, haven't seen any significant speed bumps around the sales growth rates or the fundamentals of the market. We just have the quarter we forecasted and we're ahead. In my mind, we're well ahead of where we wanted to be and we are well ahead going into Q2 and I think we're going to be well ahead going into Q3 and Q4. When we set our guidance at the beginning of the year, that dramatic difference between the first half of the year and the second half of the year had a number of people cautious about the second half of the year just like you just said. And I thought if we raised guidance here in the first quarter and raised the second half of the year even more, nobody's going to particularly think that that's credible because they're already cautious. Well, I am not cautious, I know what we're going to do, I'm pretty confident other than things I can\u2019t predict and nobody can. I'm pretty confident about our performance, and I think we'll wait and see how the second quarter goes, but I think the second quarter is a transitional one to robust second half, that then takes us a strongly into \u201915. And I think the underlying fundamentals of our primary geographies around the world are improving, people may be looking at China and say, gee, it's declined. I think that already happened. And at this point, particularly given the business we're in, we're not mining, we're not in other things where you can say, wow, it really slowed. We're in a segment that frankly isn't slowing, and it's just as robust it's been. And I think it's a terrific opportunity for us, which is why we're going to put a fair amount of investment there not only in China, but in the number of markets around the world. Glenn Novarro : And the birth rate should increase next year and the years after, is that correct? Miles White : Well, I don't know. I suppose so, I'm not counting on birth rates, I don't even get that macroeconomic about it. We're looking at it. Frankly, I'm not even counting on just a tailwind of market growth, I want share gain and I'm targeting share gain from competitors and share presence in that market, in a lot of these markets. We are measuring ourselves on share. And that translates as you might guess into fairly healthy growth but you can fill yourself with healthy growth when it\u2019s the market. I want share gains. And so that on top of whatever the market may give us in terms of birth rate and so forth, I think we\u2019ve got a very long-term market in China that\u2019s a very healthy robust market. And I think we had an unfortunate setback last year that it was nobody\u2019s intention to have it happen. It certainly wasn\u2019t our partners\u2019 intention to have it happen but it did. And we\u2019ve had great cooperation from Fonterra in resolving what happened there, and they remain an incredibly important partner to us and a valuable partner to us. And I\u2019d just say look, the two of us as companies have some great plans and thoughts for China and other market. It\u2019s an important one for us and we remain very committed to it because I think that all the growth that we forecasted in the past is there. One of the things I always caution investors about, we get so obsessed about our quarter in the United States because that\u2019s how we are. We are quarterly driven, CNBC driven economy. And our investments and progress in some of these markets, you can\u2019t measure in quarters. I know we need the feedback every quarter but to know that everything is okay and everything is on track and so forth then I would say everything is okay and everything is on track. I expect speed bumps out of the emerging markets. I don\u2019t expect not to have them. I mean, who could forecast that you will have issues with Russia and Ukraine and so forth that who could forecast as you would have devaluations in given countries. You can\u2019t forecast some of that stuff. There is always going to be that. But the long-term fundamentals of investing in a lot of these countries in their healthcare systems and their need for the products that we make are strong and that\u2019s where we are going. It may be bumpy from quarter-to-quarter. It\u2019s particularly bumpy this time in the first and second quarters because of this recall we had last year which was significant and the adjustment and exchange in the second half. But the long-term fundamentals of these markets are very strong and we\u2019ve been careful to select geographies where we know those fundamentals remain sustainable and frankly, I\u2019m pretty upbeat about the rest of this year, even the second quarter. I think there is great opportunity here and I see nothing but upward ramp, probably with some speed bumps to be unpredictable but nevertheless pretty strong year ahead of us. And I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve got a head start on it. We are well ahead in this quarter. I\u2019m not ready to change our guidance because I want to see another quarter play it, because it\u2019s a transitional quarter for us. But second quarter call should be an interesting call. Glenn Novarro : That\u2019s helpful. Can I just ask also in the U.S. infant business? As that business came in softer and I think Brian on the call mentioned a little bit of weather, but is there anything else going on underlying in the U.S. infant business? Miles White : Share is very stable. Our shares are strong, very stable. I have a hard time blaming weather on this one because babies got to eat. I can\u2019t -- I just cannot come up with a weather reason for that. I think the U.S. market has always been pressured, the pediatric market. We haven\u2019t lost share. So, I have to say it\u2019s probably economy phenomenon to some degree. We are not losing share to private-label or anything else. We are not losing share. So, I don\u2019t know if there is much more fundamental I can say about it other than I think the underlying fundamentals are good and it was lesser quarter than we might have liked. But I don\u2019t think it presages some long-term direction. Tom Freyman : Yeah. Glenn, I\u2019d just clarify in Brian\u2019s remarks. He was referring more to the adult segment, which as you know as to Mile\u2019s point, infant is less discretionary and the adult segment is little more discretionary and while overall there was a modest impact on the company in the quarter, that\u2019s the one area where we saw little bit. Miles White : Yeah. I think it\u2019s a fair comment. The adult is more discretionary. But look, the bottom line is, the quarter was forecasted to be a very low growth quarter. Well, we met expectations. It was a low growth quarter on the topline. It didn\u2019t miss our expectations. It is what we expected. It ins and outs are a little different but you could sit here and say, there is a whole list of things, comparisons and other things that make it a low growth quarter. All right. Some of that is pretty significant and true, but at the end of the day it was a low growth quarter. I don\u2019t expect that to be some sustainable growth rate. I think this gets constantly better over time and I\u2019m glad to be ahead. Glenn Novarro : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Brian Yoor : Thanks, Larry. Okay. Thank you, [Ella] (ph). Thank you all for your questions or Glenn, excuse me. Thank you, [Ella] (ph). Thank you for your questions. That concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call.

It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations. Brian Yoor : Okay, good morning and thank you for joining us. Joining me today on the call will be Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President \u2013 Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2014. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1(a), Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Note that any sales or earnings per share guidance provided today on the call will continue to include the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business in our forecasts. Tom will discuss in more detail how we expect to report the results of this big business beginning with the third quarter. In today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings new release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay, thanks Brian. Good morning. This morning we reported second quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.54, above our guidance range and representing growth of 17%. As expected, sales increased 3% on an operational basis. This was a sequential improvement from the first quarter and we are on track to accelerate sales growth in the second half of the year. We are ahead of our expectations through the first half of this year and we are raising our full-year 2014 ongoing earnings per share guidance to $2.19 to $2.29 from $2.16 to $2.26. At the same time, we\u2019re actively shaping Abbott for durable, long-term growth. Part of our growth strategy is to build critical mass and leadership positions in key emerging geographies across our diverse portfolio. In diagnostics, we were early to establish our presence in the geographies of China, Russia and Brazil. In devices, we have significant opportunity in the cataract lens and diabetes markets given demographic trends, as well as in our vascular business with innovative devices such as Absorb. In established pharmaceuticals and nutrition where we already have large and growing businesses in emerging geographies, we\u2019ve taken a series of steps over the last few months to further shape these businesses for the long term. As I discussed on our conference call on Monday in our branded generics pharmaceuticals business, the recent acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia, as well as the sale of our developed markets business to Mylan, accelerate our strategic intent to drive balanced and sustainable growth in emerging geographies. The net proceeds from the sales of Mylan\u2019s shares over time provide us with a number of choices and possibilities to pursue opportunities that continue to build Abbott for higher growth. Following the close of these transactions, our established pharmaceuticals business will operate entirely in emerging geographies where the growth of branded generics are driven by favorable demographics, including growing healthcare systems and a customer base that largely pays out of pocket for high quality, trusted brands. Abbott will hold leading positions in many of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets for branded generics in the world, including India, Russia and Latin America. In nutrition, we\u2019re similarly building this business for sustainable growth by continuing to invest in our global infrastructure, including our supply chain. Last week, we announced a strategic alliance with Fonterra to develop a diary farm hub in China to invest locally in China\u2019s milk supply. Fonterra is the world\u2019s largest dairy cooperative and has been a supplier to Abbott for many years. This strategic alliance leverages Fonterra\u2019s expertise in dairy nutrition and farming and Abbott\u2019s continued commitment to business development in China to ultimately help meet the growing demand for high quality dairy ingredients in China. This strategic alliance is the latest in a series of investments we\u2019ve made to build our local presence and capabilities in China over the last decade, which includes our R&D center in Shanghai and the opening last month of our nutrition manufacturing plant in Jiaxing. A stronger footprint in country will allow us to be closer to our customers and work faster to create and customize new products for their needs. Our new plant is one of the most technologically advanced nutrition plants in the world and will manufacture high quality nutrition products for Chinese consumers, including a new infant formula brand that we\u2019re launching now, called Similac Chintea (ph). This new product launch is one of several in both our adult and pediatric nutrition businesses across numerous geographies this year. The transactions we\u2019ve announced over the last several weeks proactively build and shape Abbott in emerging geographies. At the same time, we\u2019re executing on the substantial organic growth opportunities across our company. I\u2019ll briefly review our second quarter results, and I\u2019ll start with nutrition where we anticipate returning to double-digit sales growth in the second half of this year as this business anniversaries or laps the sales disruption in international nutrition and launches new products. Our innovations bring advanced nutrition to meet the needs of our customers, drive share expansion, and grow the market. We\u2019ll open three new manufacturing facilities in total this year to support the strong global near and long-term demand for adult and pediatric nutrition. Two weeks following the launch of our China plant, we opened our new state-of-the-art aseptic liquid plant in Ohio and we expect to open our manufacturing operations in India in the second half of this year. In diagnostics, sales growth was driven by continued above-market performance in core laboratory diagnostics, including double-digit growth in the U.S. We\u2019re funding investments in growth and advancing multiple new system platforms across core laboratory, molecular, and point of care that will launch over the next few years. In medical devices, we continued to launch differentiated new products to capture share. In vascular, we\u2019re continuing to see market adoption of our breakthrough structural heart technology, MitraClip, as well as our new peripheral stent, Supera. Both our structural heart and endovascular businesses increased double digits globally this quarter, and in our drug eluting portfolio we\u2019re driving increased penetration of Absorb in Europe and several key emerging geographies as we work to bring it to the U.S., Japan and China, which represent more than 50% of the world\u2019s coronary stent market. In diabetes care, performance was in line with our expectations and we\u2019re on track to receive CE Mark in the second half of this year for our next generation sensing technology, called Freestyle Libre. In vision care, above market growth of our cataract lens business drove another quarter of double-digit sales growth. We expect double-digit sales growth for the full year with continued positive momentum from new products. In established pharma, as we anticipated, second quarter operational sales growth improved sequentially versus the first quarter. In key emerging markets, sales increased nearly 10% driven by double-digit growth in India, Brazil and China as a result of improved commercial execution and continued expansion of product portfolios in several of our therapeutic areas of focus. We expect continued momentum in EPD in the second half of this year with improved market growth in India and the benefit of additional plant capacity to meet sales demand for key products. So in summary, we\u2019re ahead of our expectations through the first half and we\u2019re raising our full-year ongoing earnings per share guidance. We delivered a sequential improvement in sales growth this quarter and continue to expect accelerating sales growth in the second half of this year, and we\u2019re actively shaping the company with the shareholder in mind as we build Abbott for long-term growth and healthy cash returns. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Freyman : Thanks Miles. Today we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.54, exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 3% on an operational basis; that is, excluding an unfavorable impact of around 1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased approximately 2% in the quarter. Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in diagnostics and vision care and improved growth in nutrition and established pharmaceuticals. Sales growth in emerging markets approached 8% on an operational basis in the quarter. Excluding the estimated impact from the previously reported sales disruption in our nutrition business last year, sales in emerging markets increased closer to 10% in the quarter. The second quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.3% of sales, ahead of our previous guidance due to continued underlying improvement in diagnostics and better vascular gross margin as a result of the resolution of an intellectual property matter that lowered product costs this quarter and will continue to benefit this business going forward. In the quarter, ongoing R&D investment was 6% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense was 30.5% of sales, in line with previous expectations. Before I review our financial outlook, I\u2019d like to explain how we expect to report the results of our developed markets branded generics business going forward. As you know, we announced on Monday an agreement to sell this business to Mylan; therefore, beginning in the third quarter of this year, the sales and earnings from this business are expected to be reported as discontinued operations in our income statement. However, guidance for the third quarter and the full year 2014 that we provide today will continue to include this business in our forecasts. For the third quarter call, we will reconcile the combined results on both a GAAP and adjusted basis to the guidance we\u2019re providing today. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2014, today we\u2019re raising our ongoing earnings per share guidance range to $2.19 to $2.29, which reflects double-digit growth over 2013 at the midpoint of the range. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year 2014. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 1% on our full year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the full year 2014. Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes. We continue to forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% for the full year. We forecast ongoing R&D somewhat above 6% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales, supported by our continuing efforts to manage G&A expenses. Overall, we now project our full-year adjusted operating margin ratio to expand by approximately 100 basis points in 2014, above our previous guidance of 60 basis points of expansion. Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2014 we\u2019re providing for the first time, we\u2019re forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.61. We forecast both operational and reported sales growth in the mid-single digits, reflecting a neutral impact of foreign exchange on sales in the third quarter based on current exchange rates. We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% of sales in the third quarter. We also forecast ongoing R&D around 6% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense of approximately 29% of sales in the third quarter. I\u2019d note that in 2013, we experienced a below trend tax rate in the third quarter, while in 2014 we expect the ongoing tax rate to again be around 19%. We project specified items of $0.27 in the third quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release. This forecast excludes specified items to be provided at a future date related to recently announced transactions. So in summary, second quarter sales growth improved sequentially over the first quarter of 2014. We\u2019re on track with our expectations for accelerated growth in the second half of the year, and we\u2019re raising our full-year ongoing earnings per share guidance. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Brian? Brian Yoor : Thank you, Tom. This morning, I will review our second quarter 2014 performance and third quarter sales outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I\u2019ll first discuss our nutrition business, where global sales increased 3% in the second quarter, a sequential improvement versus the first quarter and on track for second half acceleration as we anniversary the August 2013 sales disruption in our international pediatric nutrition business. In our international pediatric nutrition business, we\u2019re on track to return to double-digit sales growth in the second half of this year as we continue to recapture share in the affected markets and launch new products across several new segments and geographies. This includes Similac Chintea, a new infant formula we are currently launching into China. It\u2019s the first product to be manufactured in our new China facility and is available in our innovative reclosable packaging. In addition, to further enhance our competitiveness and capture share in the Chinese infant formula market, Abbott launched a new infant formula, Elova (ph) in the second quarter and Similar Simple Pack late last year in the online segment of the market. Sales of international pediatric nutrition increased modestly in the second quarter, impacted by the unfavorable year-over-year comparison created by the previously reported 2013 sales disruption. The impact of this event continues to decline as we recapture share, and is estimated to have reduced international pediatric sales in the quarter by approximately $40 million or 7 percentage points. We also experienced some recent government-initiated pricing changes in Vietnam and Saudi Arabia, which we\u2019re managing. International adult sales increased 10% in the quarter driven by strong growth of our Ensure brand and double-digit growth in the emerging markets. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of high single to double-digit sales growth in this business. Abbott continues to shape and grow its priority adult nutrition market as it launches several new products this year, including the recent launch of a new adult brand, Enevo, in Japan, our largest adult nutrition market outside the U.S. Enevo is a next generation follow-on product to our market leading Ensure brand. In the U.S., nutrition sales increased low single digits in the quarter driven by pediatric nutrition as Abbott remains the market leader in the non-WIC segment of the U.S. infant formula market. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect global nutrition sales to return to double-digit growth on an operational basis as this business laps the international pediatric sales disruption and executes on its strategic priorities, including launching new products, opening a new manufacturing facility in India, and expanding its full-year operating margin. In our diagnostics business, sales increased 5.5% in the quarter, including double-digit growth in emerging markets. Core laboratory diagnostic sales increased 7% as this business continues to deliver above-market performance in both developed and emerging markets. U.S. sales increased 11% as we continued to build momentum with our enterprise account commercial model to capture significant contract wins as customers select Abbott to increase their operational efficiencies. We\u2019re also broadening and differentiating our Architect Assay menu and launched a new diabetes test in the U.S. in April to address the growing prevalence of diabetes. International sales increased 6% in the quarter driven by continued growth in emerging markets. In molecular diagnostics, worldwide sales were impacted by the timing of tenders in our infectious disease business in several emerging markets. We expect improved growth in our molecular business going forward with a favorable impact from the timing of expected tender wins in the second half of this year. In point of care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 4%, representing a sequential improvement from the first quarter as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted European and emerging markets, and as the U.S. market continues to stabilize. For the third quarter in global diagnostics, we are forecasting mid to high single digit operational sales growth. In medical devices, vascular sales increased low single digits in the quarter, in line with our expectations. International vascular sales increased 3.5% driven by double-digit sales growth of MitraClip and endovascular products, which includes our new peripheral stent, Supera, for the treatment of blockages in the superficial femoral artery, or SFA. In the second half of this year, we expect new products to continue to drive share expansion and sales growth, including Supera, MitraClip, and Absorb. At the same time, we continue to make good progress to bring Absorb to the U.S., China, and Japan markets over the next few years. Data presented at international medical meetings continues to reinforce strong clinical results for Absorb in a broad range of patients. In the second half of this year, we expect to present one-year results from our Absorb 2 clinical trial, which is the first randomized trial to compare Absorb to standard of care. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales in our global vascular business to be relatively flat. While we expect to continue to show sequential improvement in our base business, we\u2019ll also experience a difficult comparison versus the prior year third quarter when we realize the final sales true-up related to a third party agreement. In diabetes care, global sales in the second quarter decreased 10%, in line with our expectations. Outside of the United States, diabetes care is focused on driving continued growth and expects to receive European CE Mark for its new Freestyle Libre next generation sensing technology in the second half of this year. U.S. sales continue to be impacted by the carryover effect from implementation of the CMS competitive bidding program for Medicare patients in July of last year. For the third year in our global diabetes business, we forecast some moderation in the sales decline and expect a mid to high single-digit decline on an operational basis. In vision care, we achieved 12% sales growth in the second quarter, which represents the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Sales of our cataract products represent nearly 70% of our vision care business and increased strong double-digits, outpacing the growth of the global cataract market driven by market share gains of our recently launched products. These products include the Tecnis OptiBlu and the Tecnis OptiBlu preloaded lenses in Japan, and the Tecnis Toric lenses in the U.S. and Japan. In addition, the adoption of our new Catalys laser cataract system is exceeding our expectations due to strong customer interest in our technology. During the second quarter, we received European CE Mark for Tecnis Symfony extended range vision intraocular lens. Tecnis Symfony is a premium lens that provides patients with continuous range of vision, including far, intermediate and near distances, but with reduced incidence of halo and glare. For the third quarter of 2014, we expect our global vision care business to continue to grow double digits on an operational basis. Lastly, our established pharmaceuticals business, or EPB, where sales increased more than 2% in the quarter and also demonstrated a sequential improvement versus the first quarter. Sales in our key emerging markets segment increased nearly 10% driven by double-digit sales growth in India, Brazil and China. Improved market dynamics coupled with commercial execution in India, expansion of product portfolios in Brazil, and stronger growth in China, including the replenishment of a key women\u2019s health product, contributed to strong sales growth in the quarter. Sales in our developed and other market segments decreased 5% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. In the second half of the year, we expect further improvement in the sales growth rates of EPB driven by improved market growth coupled with commercial execution in India, as well as the benefit from the recent plant capacity expansion to meet demand for certain key products, including those belonging to our women\u2019s health portfolio. For the third quarter of 2014, we continue to forecast sales growth in our established pharmaceuticals business in the low single digits on an operational basis. So in summary, we\u2019ve had a pretty active second quarter, executing on several transactions to further shape Abbott for the long term, and we\u2019re ahead of expectations through the first half of the year, resulting in our raise today of our full-year ongoing EPS guidance. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question today is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Miles, I wanted to start with a question on nutritionals. It\u2019s good to see nutritionals getting back to positive growth. We tend to focus so much on pediatrics, but what caught me by surprise was the strength is adult, particularly outside the U.S., up 10%. So I\u2019m wondering if you can spend some time talking about adults \u2013 is that 10% growth sustainable, and how should we be thinking about that growth beyond this quarter, and what could be the key drivers? Thanks. Miles White : Sure. You know, the direct answer to your question is yes, I think it is sustainable. I mean, it might go up a point, down a point \u2013 who knows? \u2013 from time to time, but the general direction at that magnitude I think is sustainable. You know, as you know, Glenn, we are the world leaders in that category in almost every country, and there\u2019s still enormous amounts of opportunity out there, given the demographics of the world not just in developed countries but also in emerging countries. There\u2019s a big opportunity for us, I think, in China in particular, and part of our expansion in China will address that over time. We\u2019ve got a big opportunity to enter that market, build that market, create it and do in China what we\u2019ve done in a lot of other countries around the world. So I think there\u2019s still a lot of opportunity. There\u2019s always room for innovation, whether it be in the form\u2014you know, we have a product now, Clear, in the United States that\u2019s not a milk-based product that I think will be popular with consumers, and I think that given different flavors, different forms, different packages and so forth, I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to expand the market and grow the market where we\u2019ve already got pretty strong share. That\u2019s an important part of our business. And you\u2019re right \u2013 the pediatric segment tends to get a lot of the attention, but I think a lot of the growth and opportunity here remains in the adult segment. Glenn Novarro : And just as a follow-up, if I\u2019m looking at the operating margins for the nutritional business, about 20%, yet some of your peers are closer to 25%. Now that you\u2019re at 20%, is 25% the next goal? Miles White : You know something? My management in that business will say if we reach 25, are we done? And I\u2019ll of course say no \u2013 30 would be the next goal, and if we reach 30, would 35 be the next goal. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ever going to be satisfied, but I\u2019d say this \u2013 we\u2019re not done, and we\u2019re not stopping. There\u2019s a lot of things that go into determining what the margin is in the business and in terms of our cost to deliver. A lot of the moves that we\u2019ve made in the last year with our supply chain globally, including some of the things that we\u2019ve done with Fonterra with other suppliers, are aimed at lowering our cost to deliver. Some of the products that we\u2019ve had manufactured by third parties, we\u2019ll bring in house and do ourselves. Part of our plant strategy here with not only our liquid plant in Ohio but our plant expansion in China and India is to do that. There is obviously large freight savings when you manufacture in key markets as opposed to ship from the U.S. or Europe or other locations. So there\u2019s a number of things that go into the overall cost structure, and I\u2019d say there\u2019s still plenty of room to improve our margins in this business, and the team has been very focused on that. Some of them take a little longer than others to realize because of structural or infrastructure changes in our whole supply chain system, but I\u2019d say there is more room there. Glenn Novarro : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC. Mike Weinstein : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Tom, I want to spend a minute just on the operating line. If I look at the first half of the year, most of the incremental growth is coming from your work on controlling operating spending. Even if I adjust for\u2014add back (indiscernible) down low single digits, and it looks like for the year the boost in the guidance is a function primarily of your operating spend coming in. So could you spend some time talking about where those reductions are coming from and how we should think about the trend, not just this year but going forward? Thomas Freyman : We\u2019ve talked about this off and on over the last few quarters, Mike, and when we exited the separation, it was clear to the entire organization that our G&A levels in particular were higher than they should have been, and we\u2019ve been working very hard to address that through process improvements in the back office, basic efficiencies, only providing the appropriate services to the businesses. It\u2019s been kind of a steady progress we\u2019ve made on that \u2013 you know, every quarter we\u2019re able to change the trend of the run rate and just been steadily chipping away at that. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re done \u2013 we still have a few things we want to do. We\u2019re getting more efficient in the IT areas and some of the finance and accounting areas, and even\u2014especially in the purchasing area where we\u2019ve invested a lot of time and we think can drive savings as well. So it\u2019s a very broad-based approach, I\u2019d say a very steady approach; and to your point, it\u2019s really contributed to the flattening of the SG&A. What we have not been doing is tuning back on productive SG&A \u2013 you know, things that really drive sales and growth. We\u2019ve tried very hard to sustain and even increase investment in those areas while we\u2019re tuning back in the other areas. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Can I just ask about one of the businesses that has struggled, and that\u2019s the diabetes business and the impact of competitive bidding. Can you spend a little bit more time on the strategy of that business? I think everybody is aware that you\u2019re working on coming out with this novel product in Europe later this year, but more broadly than that, what\u2019s the plan for the U.S. business going forward? It is to largely run that business as a meter business and run it for cash and try and just maximize profitability? Miles White : Mike, this is Miles. I\u2019d say for a transition period, that\u2019s probably an accurate comment. I think that business has done a great job of managing its costs and its expenses and so forth. We still have a very healthy gross margin in the business, and so it\u2019s sort of tale of two businesses, and particularly in the U.S. I\u2019d say that because it remains profitable and cash generating, et cetera, you\u2019ve got this older legacy circumstance of strategy market channels, products, et cetera that clearly is under pressure from competitive bidding and what CMS has done. Then you\u2019ve got very new innovative products that, frankly, really matter and make a significant difference for patients, like Libre which is coming first in Europe. That, we believe, will be a significant growth driver for this business here over time, and it will come to the U.S. and it will be a global product, just like our core base business. So you\u2019ve got a transition here of the core base business as we grow the more innovative future product and future forms of that product, because while it\u2019s launching as a single product, there\u2019s actually a product line coming here. So I think that will continue to drive the business and have a very different proposition for the patient. Mike Weinstein : Okay, thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. So first, Miles, I just wanted to ask about the nutritionals business. You made some commentary in your prepared remarks about the strategic alliance with Fonterra and also opening up the new manufacturing plant in China as well. I just wanted to see if you could provide just a little bit more color on how important these two initiatives are in returning pediatric nutritionals to a sustainable higher growth trajectory, and can you also talk a little bit more about the ongoing broader strategy in China? One of the questions was on the adult opportunity there too, but just hoping to get a little bit more color. Miles White : Okay. First of all, I\u2019d say Fonterra has been a partner and a supplier of ours for a very long time, and it\u2019s no secret that a year ago they had a recall that impacted us, impacted other competitors as well, and nobody tried to have a recall, nobody tried to have a problem, but it set us back for a period in China, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, some other countries. Out of our discussions came a number of ideas for the companies going forward. You can spend your time arguing about something nobody wanted to happen, or you can look ahead and say, where are our opportunities? The fact is China is an opportunity for us, as is the global supply chain in general because as we look at the growth prospects of both the pediatric and adult business worldwide, as I said, China is not the only growth opportunity. There\u2019s a lot of countries out there where there is still a lot of opportunity for both companies. So we very constructively looked at what the companies could do together, and out of that came the notion of this dairy hub idea in China, which I think and they think will be very important for serving China. China is a big market and it\u2019s big for pediatric nutrition, and it\u2019s big for adult nutrition, I think. I mean, I think it will be \u2013 it\u2019s not well established at this point, but I believe it will be. One of the key points of this business is you\u2019re a lot more economically able to serve if you are in market or close to market and responding to the desires and the needs of local consumers. We have R&D in Singapore, we have R&D in Shanghai, we have manufacturing there. We are now going to vertically integrate and supply from there in addition to the supplies we take into China and other countries from New Zealand and other milk suppliers in Europe and other places. So overall, we\u2019re looking at this as a comprehensive global network of access to very high quality milk and where we process it and then how we tailor the product to given local markets. So I think while somebody won\u2019t pay a lot of attention to some of these steps with Fonterra or the plants that we\u2019ve put in place today, within a few years we\u2019ll look back and say, boy, that was really key to do that because now we\u2019re in a very strong position to immediately serve in those markets. Now further, I would tell you \u2013 and this is speaking more globally, not just specific to China \u2013 having our manufacturing in countries helps us in effect self-hedge exchange as currency fluctuates in countries around the world. It\u2019s clearly a strong commitment to the country, which helps us from a regulatory standpoint, it helps us from a cost to serve and freight standpoint. There are a number of things that\u2014you know, countries expect today that companies or businesses that are doing business in their country make rooted commitments in those economies, and that\u2019s what in effect we\u2019re doing. I think it will put a very, very strong foundation under this nutritional business in a lot of countries around the world. China obviously is one of the largest right there with the United States in terms of size and potential, and therefore a very important one for us to commit to and make the kind of investments we\u2019re making. Josh Jennings : Great, thanks for that. And just to follow up, the ability of large corporations with breadth and scale, a product portfolio being better positioned to partner with hospitals and win contracts and gain share has received a lot of attention \u2013 we see this in the medical device industry. I know you spoke to this on the call on Monday to a degree. I just wanted to return to your strategic outlook for the medical device division \u2013 you know, with vascular, diabetes and ophtho units. Is the strategy for the divisions to build breadth and scale there, or is that enough to bolster the growth profile of the entire unit, or do you need new divisions in medical devices to compete more effectively as the healthcare delivery systems in both developed and emerged markets evolve, and just where are your priorities there strategically? Thanks a lot. Miles White : Well, the first part of your question, I\u2019d say the answer is both \u2013 not only do we want breadth and scale, but I\u2019m open to expansions that are in new areas, provided we believe that we can add value or do better than with them than they might stand alone. So there\u2019s a delicate balance. There are times\u2014you know, when we acquired AMO in the ophthalmology business several years ago, a lot of people kind of raised their eyebrows and said, gee, what do you guys know about ophthalmology? You might say, well, that was an expansion into a different area \u2013 it was one that we had very carefully studied for some years. It was very intentional and it\u2019s one where we believe the demographics, the economics, the future of the business is frankly very favorable for us and for that particular segment. So we made that step to expand, and I think that was a good addition for Abbott. The first couple of years of performance with that business were a little less than anybody really wanted, and right now it\u2019s probably the fastest growing division in the company. So I think that there are times when adding to the company that way will make sense, and I think there\u2019s times when clearly if we can broaden our footprint, expand our position in a business, whether it\u2019s diagnostics or pharmaceuticals or whatever, I think that\u2019s to our advantage \u2013 I think that\u2019s good. So we look both ways, I guess is the point. And what was the second half of your question? Did I get that? Josh Jennings : You did. Thank you very much. Miles White : Okay, good. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify \u2013 I know you had talked about how you\u2019re going to be reporting going forward for the third quarter with respect to the, I guess now discontinued operations, so you\u2019re going to report both, I guess? And then thinking ahead to 2014, will you have to do anything in terms of the ownership that you\u2019ll have with respect to the Mylan business since it\u2019s going to be a\u2014 Thomas Freyman : Well again, today the guidance we\u2019ve provided is on a consistent basis with the way we started the year and continued through the first quarter, and it\u2019s the combination of both the continuing operations starting in third quarter as well as the discontinued operations of the EPB established developed markets business. We\u2019ll just very simply show those two pieces and reconcile it back to the guidance provided today, and I just think this is cleanest way to bridge to the new reporting. Obviously for 2015, since we will also be reporting that business as discontinued until it\u2019s actually\u2014the deal closes early in the year, we\u2019ll more likely be giving guidance obviously on that basis. And what was the second part of your question, Kristen? Kristen Stewart : I was just wondering if since there will be a 21% ownership interest, I guess, if I understand it correctly\u2014 Thomas Freyman : Yes, I mean, we\u2019ll be basically carrying this investment at cost, and when it\u2019s sold hopefully at gains, those gains will be reflected as specified items throughout the period during which we sell it. Kristen Stewart : Okay, perfect. Then any color just on the performance of the MitraClip program? Miles White : MitraClip continues to progress nicely. We had a very good progression in the second quarter. We still are on track for this product to approach $200 million in sales, which would be up 50% over the prior year, and we\u2019re getting better coverage in Europe, more reimbursement in Europe, and we\u2019re making very good progress through the U.S. reimbursement process and we hope to have some good news on that in the second half of the year. Kristen Stewart : And then more broadly, I guess, just on transcatheter valves, can you comment on whether you feel like you need a whole portfolio to be more\u2014to more effectively compete within that space? Miles White : Okay, that\u2019s one I probably wouldn\u2019t answer directly for you, even if the answer was no. You know, I\u2019ll put this in the context, Kristen, of yesterday I saw an article in the media where many buy side and sell side analysts speculated on what the next steps would be that we\u2019d be interested in, of course which was very interesting. It was interesting to know the thoughts of a lot of people, but what I almost never do is try to telegraph where we might be interested, because a lot of times that\u2019s going to affect other companies and stuff, too. So if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m just going to avoid that question. Kristen Stewart : That\u2019s totally fair. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Bedford from Raymond James. Jason Bedford : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just on EPD, you witnessed a pretty strong acceleration in growth from your key emerging markets, and I just wanted to get a little more detail on some of the factors that drove the acceleration in the second quarter, meaning how much was just better execution, contribution from new products, or just stronger end markets? Brian Yoor : This is Brian. How are you doing, Jason? I think I\u2019d start\u2014you know, first of all recall with India, which is our largest market, last year I think we all experienced a little bit of a slowdown in that market when they implemented what was called the Drug Price Control Order, so the whole industry, which is good news for us \u2013 I mean, this is our largest presence, the market has come back up into what I\u2019d say is more high single digits. It had actually reached low single digits through some of the disruption around the implementation of this control order last year. But that also with execution is serving very well for us in India, driving double digits growth. We\u2019re set up very nicely for the second half of the year as well, both from our execution as well as nice comparison in terms of that market\u2019s rebound. As I move to Brazil, that was one that was more about portfolio expansion. We had expanded out our products along the therapeutic area that we refer to as our women\u2019s health, so that\u2019s going very well. As I mentioned in China, again, execution but also coupled with\u2014recall in the first quarter, we talked about a plant shutdown to build out capacity for one of our most successful products in the women\u2019s health arena. That\u2019s starting to come back. It doesn\u2019t come back all at once, but I talked about seeing some benefits in the second quarter and third quarter now that that plant is online. So we expect the key emerging markets to continue to do well for the rest of the year, and when you look at this thing globally with the developed markets business, it\u2019s still that nice, steady sequential improvement that we were talking about from the beginning of the year. Jason Bedford : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I guess just sticking with EPD, and it may be a little premature, but lingering question from Monday \u2013 from a management perspective, you\u2019re bringing on a couple new businesses, shedding another one. So my question is who is going to lead the new and refreshed EPD business? And I realize the end markets are growing a little faster here in emerging markets, but is the business going to be run any differently than it is today? Thanks. Miles White : Well, it already is being run differently, and the management that\u2019s going to run it is already there. There were a number of changes that had been made in the last year and a half or so and some new folks brought into the company, some others moved. I\u2019d say no change anticipated in the management team, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be glad to hear that; but that\u2019s already in place. We\u2019re executing against the plans we have, expanding our product lines and our depth in various therapeutic areas. We\u2019re rolling out our branding strategies in a number of these countries, and I think while it\u2019s difficult when you have a whole portfolio of a lot of countries to see the specific needle move in general, we track them all pretty individually and by detail, and we\u2019re seeing progress on the initiatives that we have in place. So I think the management and I both expect to see continued improvement in those countries, and I think even this year in the third and fourth quarter, so I think you\u2019ll see that play out in the second half of the year here. Jason Bedford : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Ben Andrew : Great. Two questions for us. I guess first, can you talk about where the adult and infant nutritional businesses will sort of settle out over the next several quarters as we annualize the one-time and, you know, a bit easier comps here with all the manufacturing capacity increases, and what that does for gross margins over that window? Brian Yoor : Once we get through the second half of the year, where again you\u2019re going to see strong double-digit growth for the nutrition business, we believe that when you weight the two businesses, which as you now we\u2019re 55% pediatric, 45% adult, this should be an upper single-digit growing business. Interestingly in all the forecasts we look at, the adult is growing at roughly the equivalent rate as the pediatrics. So as Miles indicated earlier, it\u2019s an extremely important business to us strategically. So once we\u2019re through\u2014as you know, with this kind of being a first half, second half story this year with the recovery, I think that upper single digit range is one that we view as sustainable for a business that has great demographics on both the pediatric and adult sides, and obviously we\u2019re well invested in a broad range of more rapidly growing markets around the world with our emerging markets strategy. Ben Andrew : Okay, and then on the diabetes side, you talked about Libre being a family of products. Can you give us some more insights into what that looks like beyond the initial flash version, and what sort of time frame we might think about as well as what the regulatory requirements may be for those products, given some of the claims you\u2019ve been talking about. Miles White : I\u2019d probably say it\u2019s little premature for us to forecast that. I would only say it\u2019s not a one-off product. There will be other manifestations of it, other versions of it over time. I think our first priority is to get this first one launched. I think it will be very well received and very innovative, and then it will be followed by others, other versions for various segments of the market. I think it\u2019s just premature for us to comment on what that might be. Ben Andrew : Okay. Maybe I can sneak in another one on the diagnostics side. You all have talked about kind of a handful of instrument systems coming. Obviously core labs has been great, but within molecular it\u2019s just been a bit weaker. We haven\u2019t seen those new platforms launched. Can you give us a bit of an update on any of those and when we might see those? Thank you. Miles White : There\u2019s kind of an unprecedented number of systems in development in our diagnostics business broadly defined. There\u2019s a new family of hematology analyzers, new family for blood screening, new family for core lab immunoassay and chemistry. We also have a program underway in our molecular space. There is our Ibis system in addition to that in molecular, a second system there; and then next generation for our point of care business, so across the board literally, new systems and updated systems in development for all of these businesses. They obviously can\u2019t all launch at exactly the same time, so I\u2019d say there\u2019s sort of a, call it a three to five-year frame here where they will all sequentially roll out, God willing and everything staying on time. I think as I said, it\u2019s unprecedented for that much to be done in a similar period of time, but when and as complete, I\u2019d say our diagnostics business will have the most up-to-date delivery platforms in their various spaces across the board in the industry and we\u2019ll be very, very well positioned. Ben Andrew : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeff Holford : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ve got three questions, the first on gross margins. So you\u2019re flagging that you\u2019re going to have a drive on purchasing going forwards, and obviously you\u2019ve been putting out some new manufacturing facilities, so it sounds like you\u2019ve got quite some opportunity to increase gross margins going forwards, unless there\u2019s something in the mix that\u2019s going to pressure that against some of that. So maybe you can talk about opportunity for gross margin expansion maybe over a two, three-year period. Then second, just wondering if you can help\u2014 Miles White : Would you mind holding the second and third question until we answer the first? I\u2019m finding I don\u2019t remember the third by the time I get done with the second. Jeff Holford : Sure. Miles White : Let\u2019s answer that one first, and then we\u2019ll go right back into the second question. You\u2019re right \u2013 you characterized it well. I think that our manufacturing and supply chain and distribution initiatives and so forth will in fact improve our margins across the board. That\u2019s been the case for the last three years as well in nutrition, and I think that\u2019s primarily what we\u2019re talking about here. All of the business is focused on margin improvement, and as I said, there are a number of things that will improve margins; but that has been the case. Some of that, as we\u2019ve seen, has dropped into gross margin improvement in the overall company P&L. In some cases, that gross margin improvement has offset either currency fluctuation in the wrong direction, or in some cases price pressures in markets or other things from time to time. I think we call it out pretty well when it occurs where the gross margin improvement has occurred and so forth, and as you know price is part of that, and price is generally not going up in our businesses around the world. It\u2019s usually under some pressure somewhere. So that improvement in gross margin also preserves margins where we do have price pressures, and every now and then there\u2019s some country that determines it\u2019s going to have a pricing action of some kind \u2013 you know, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, others from time to time do that, and our gross margin improvements have either offset that or further added to the bottom line, and I think as we said earlier, there\u2019s opportunity here going forward and there continues to be margin expansion opportunity with it. Second question? Jeff Holford : So the second one is really if you can help us a bit more about the base cost of developed EPD from the perspective of just thinking how much net cash will drop through for share repurchases as you dispose of the Mylan shares. Miles White : Well first of all, there\u2019s an assumption there that I would use it all for share repurchase, which I\u2019m not. So I would just call out the fact that it gives me a lot of optionality in terms of cash disposition, but I\u2019m probably not going to tell you today what that\u2019s going to be. Jeff Holford : Okay. The third question \u2013 and just to be clear, this is related to a wire that\u2019s come up this morning saying you may have talked with Sanofi about their mature products business. Just a little bit more general question off the back of that, do you think there is significant opportunity for you to add significant more product breadth to EPD, because in the past you\u2019ve talked just about geographic bolt-ons and infilling, but obviously a transaction like that \u2013 I\u2019m not saying that you are doing it, obviously \u2013 would add significant product breadth. Would that be something that was important for the business? Miles White : Well, I\u2019d answer that two ways. First of all, I saw the report on Sanofi, and my understanding is that\u2019s a reference to their European-based business, and we just are in the process of selling ours, so I think these are two completely different questions here. Would I be interested in broadening our emerging market portfolio? Sure. Yeah, we\u2019re always interested in broadening or deepening our portfolio in our EPD business, but for us going forward, that\u2019s going to be an emerging market business and so consequently businesses that are similar products but in Europe or the U.S. would not be of interest to us. Jeff Holford : That\u2019s great, thank you. Brian Yoor : Okay, we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Our final question today is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. Miles, just a quick kind of maybe trip down memory lane for you here. As nutritionals approaches normalcy, I wonder if you can provide us some perspective 18 months post-spin. If you go back to the time of the spin, you talked about the Abbott growth story. I think you discussed upper single digit growth. As we sit here sort of 18 months later, I wonder are you getting the growth contribution from the areas you expected, and do you still think you have the access to get back to upper single digit growth here? Miles White : I do. I think if I look at the single biggest event that was a setback for that business, it was the recall in Asia approximately a year ago in that nutrition business, which clearly impacted us in China and other countries, as I mentioned earlier. When that happens, it\u2019s a year to recover because the consumer is an incredibly quality conscious consumer that once that consumer has shifted to another brand, it\u2019s very difficult to regain them. That wasn\u2019t something anybody anticipated, it wasn\u2019t something anybody wanted to happen, including Fonterra; but when that happens, it does set you back a bit. I think we\u2019ve recovered about as well as we could have within that year time frame. I like the progress that our team is making in China and other countries. The world is volatile. The great thing about emerging markets is they represent, I think, terrific growth. The unfortunate thing about them for businesses that measure their success every 90 days is that they can be pretty volatile, and in our case we are in a number of emerging markets, like a portfolio, which one hopes over time dampens the overall absorption of volatility, and I think it does. I think you have to kind of learn how to shape your portfolio and shape your approach to minimize volatility of markets, whether it\u2019s currency driven, politically driven, whatever the case may be, and deliver that growth on a more consistent, durable basis for investors. And of course, that\u2019s our intent and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. So if I look at our businesses across the board, I always think we can do better. I think we\u2019re getting back to the track we want to be on with nutrition. I think we\u2019re getting back to the track we want to be on with our pharmaceutical business. The pharmaceutical business, as I\u2019ve said in the past, is two very different businesses \u2013 there\u2019s the developed market business which is low growth but still attractive and profitable, and then much higher growth emerging market business. And since we\u2019ve defined the company around durable growth, our emphasis and focus by strategic intent is on those emerging markets, and we think that given the scale necessary for the consolidation that\u2019s happening in those developed markets, that at least in our case, Mylan was a better home for our business than we were; otherwise, we were faced with the possibility of having to expand and consolidate still further in those markets. For us, that wasn\u2019t the same in terms of strategic intent and growth as what we\u2019re trying to do in emerging markets. So I think that as two of the large businesses in the portfolio, I think they are getting back into the shape and direction and top line growth that we intend. I think as we\u2019ve said, everything we\u2019re doing is directed toward that. I see that evolving in emerging here. Our first quarter with EPD, as you\u2019ll recall, we had a plant shut down because we were expanding the plant, so there\u2019s a number of factors at work here that I think we\u2019ll see play out in the third and fourth quarter here that will give our investors much more confidence in the ongoing trajectory of our pharma business. I think the nutrition business will evolve that way over time, too \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s already a very strong business. It\u2019s doing well, and the infrastructure and so forth that we\u2019ve put in place and the recovery that we\u2019ve seen in China and other countries shows, and frankly we will have lapped it in the second half, the issue we had last year, and you\u2019ll see that those growth rates are back where you\u2019d like to see them. David Lewis : Great. Maybe just a quick follow up for Tom. Tom, your guidance for gross margin remains unchanged but it still implies that back half recovery. I guess where you sit now, what are some of the factors that give you the confidence that you can get back to that gross margin improvement in the back half of the year? In general, I feel like investors are very focused on the Abbott SG&A story and a little bit less focused on the GM story. What are some of the opportunities for Abbott, both in the back half of the year but more specifically over the next couple of years? Thank you. Thomas Freyman : Well you know, the guidance I provided on gross margin was pretty steady really from the second quarter through the fourth quarter. You know, it\u2019s a situation \u2013 and we talked about this at the very beginning of the year, it was a particularly acute exchange year on the gross margin ratio, and that\u2019s playing through\u2014you know, it played through in the second quarter, it was a bit of a headwind, and it\u2019s playing through a little more in the third quarter. So I think on the gross margin level, pretty much all the guidance is steady the rest of the year. Certainly we\u2019re going to work hard to do as well as we can in that area, but I think once we\u2019ve lapped through this year of exchange challenges, we\u2019ll be back on the fundamentals and it is something that we\u2019d like to see some steady improvement over time, even taking into account some of the challenge Miles outlined in his earlier remarks. So I think the second half is really more of a sales acceleration story and continuing to drive down these G&A costs to ultimately deliver on the forecast. Brian Yoor : Okay, well thank you, Operator, and thank you for all your questions. That concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 am Central time today on Abbott\u2019s Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com, and after 11 :00 am Central time via telephone at 203-369-0489, pass code 3332.

We also provide in the release a reconciliation between continuing and discontinued operations for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013 and 2014. For the remainder of 2014, our earnings per share guidance will include results from both continuing operations as well as discontinued operations associated with the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business being sold to Mylan. Our commentary and guidance for sales and other P&L line items will be for continuing ops only. In today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay, thanks Brian, good morning. This morning we reported adjusted earnings per share above expectations and another quarter of sequential improvement in total company sales growth. We\u2019re also raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS guidance range which is now $2.25 to $2.27 representing double-digit growth. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 increased approximately 13% including discontinued operations which is above our previous guidance range. Today I\u2019ll focus my comments on results from Abbott\u2019s continuing operations for sales increase 6.7% operationally. Emerging market sales will now represent nearly 50% of Abbott\u2019s total sales and increased 15% in the quarter with double-digit growth and establish pharmaceuticals, nutrition and diagnostic. In the quarter, we also advanced number of transactions in our branded generics business to accelerate our ability to drive balanced and sustainable growth in emerging geographies. We remain on track to divest our developed markets business in Mylan in the first quarter of next year. Mylan is well positioned with its global scale and capabilities to do well with this business over the long-term. We completed our acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals at the end of September, which establishes Abbott as a top 10 pharmaceutical company in Latin America. CFR provides scale and a product portfolio that strongly compliments Abbott\u2019s presence in Latin America and more than doubles our branded generic sales in the region. CFR also brings a network of manufacturing plants and R&D facilities in Columbia, Chile, Peru and Argentina, which further diversifies our cost base in emerging markets. And most importantly CFR adds top talent with strong local market knowledge and a proven ability to quickly develop manufacturing and bring new products to market. We expect our announced acquisition of Veropharm to close by the end of the year. Veropharm positions Abbott to become a top 5 branded generics company in Russia providing us with income for manufacturing and a broad portfolio well aligned to our therapeutic areas of focus. Following the close of these transactions, our established pharmaceuticals business will operate entirely in emerging geographies where the growth of branded generics are driven by favorable demographics, including growing healthcare systems and a customer base that largely pays out of pocket for high quality, trusted brands. Moving forward, we would expect this business generates sales growth in the upper single to double digits. We are also executing on our organic growth opportunities including the launch of a number of new products and innovations across our businesses I\u2019ll briefly review our third quarter results. And I\u2019ll start with nutrition, where sales increased double digits this quarter. We\u2019ve largely recovered from the sales disruption in our international business at the same time we\u2019re executing a multiple new product launches across key geographies. We continue to invest in our global infrastructure to support the strong global demand from adult pediatric nutrition. As we discussed last quarter we reinforced our footprint in China to the opening of our new manufacturing plant in Jiaxing and our strategic alliance with Fonterra to invest locally in China\u2019s milk supply. And last week in India we announced the opening of our third new manufacturing facility this year in nutrition, a stronger footprint in our key geographies will allow us to be closer to our customers and work faster to creating customized new products for their needs. In diagnostics, we delivered 6% operational growth in third quarter of sequential improvement from the second quarter driven by continued above market performance in core laboratory diagnostics and point of care diagnostics. We are funding investments in growth and advanced multiple new system platforms across all three of our diagnostics businesses. In medical devices, our vascular business is performing below our expectations primarily related to sales of our drug eluting portfolio. We remained focused on improved execution and increasing penetration of absorbing Europe and several key emerging geographies. MitraClip, our structural heart technology delivered strong double digit growth in the quarter and we expect continued adoption in the U.S. following improved reimbursement national Medicare coverage. Our peripheral stent, Supera also contributed the growth of our new vascular business in the quarter. In diabetes care, we launched our next generation flash glucose monitor FreeStyle Libre into the nearly $4 billion blood glucose monitoring market in Europe. Libre is a revolutionary new glucose sensing technology which generated very positive feedback early in its launch; it eliminates the need for routine finger sticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes. And in vision care, 70% of our sales are generated by our cataract product, which increased double-digits again this quarter. Our new cataract lenses and the uptick of our catalyst laser cataract system are driving above market growth to support the growing global demand for our cataract lenses we recently booked ground on a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. In established pharmaceuticals, as we expected, sales improve sequentially again this quarter. The emerging market branded generic business increased double digits as a result of improved commercial execution and continued expansion of product portfolios in several of our therapeutic areas of focus. We expect continued momentum in EPD as we exit the year including CFR where sales have been growing consistently at a double-digit pace. So in summary, we\u2019re right on track with our expectations that we communicated at the beginning of this year. Operational sales growth has improved sequentially each quarter. We\u2019re particularly pleased to see that type of improvement in our branded generics business and nutrition as well as steady global performance in diagnostics and vision care. We again exceeded adjusted earnings per share exceptions for the quarter and increased the midpoint of our EPS guidance range which results in another year double-digit adjusted EPS growth. And we\u2019re continuing to build Abbott for global growth over the long term including the CFR acquisition in the third quarter and working toward our first quarter 2015 close of the sale of our developed market branded generics business for Mylan. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Freyman : Thanks, Miles. As Brian mentioned upfront because guidance previously provided for the third quarter and the full year 2014 included the developed markets branded generics business for the Mylan, we will continue to include the contributions in this business and our EPS guidance for the remainder of 2014. However, our commentary and guidance for sales and other P&L line items this quarter and for the fourth quarter forecast will be for continuing operations only that is excluding the business being sold to Mylan. Today, we reported third quarter diluted earnings per share excluding specified items of $0.62 above our previous guidance range. Sales from continuing operations that is excluding the developed markets branded generics business increased 6.7% on an operational basis and 5.8% on a recorded basis during the quarter. Including the contribution from discontinued operations sales would have increase 5.6% on an operational basis in line with previous guidance. Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in several businesses including double-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals and nutrition and steady growth in diagnostics and vision care. Total company sales in emerging markets increased 15% on an operational basis in the quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.4% of sales from continuing operations. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2014, today we\u2019re raising the midpoint and narrowing our EPS guidance range excluding specified items to $2.25 to $2.27 which includes results from our developed markets branded generics business now presented as discontinued operations and reflect double-digit growth over 2013. We forecast operational sales growth from continuing operations in the mid-single digit for the full year 2014 based on current exchange rates we expect this change to have a negative impact of approximately 2% on our full year recorded sales which is somewhat more negative than previous expectations driven by the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This would result in reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the full year 2014. Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 65% of sales adjusted R&D investment of somewhat more than 6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30% of sales from continuing operations for the full year 2014. Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2014, we forecast double-digit operational sales growth from continuing operations. As Miles mentioned earlier, we recently completed the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals and expect this business to contribute approximately $200 million to sales in the fourth quarter. Based on current exchange rates, we expect this change to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 2.5% on sales in the quarter. This would result in recorded sales growth in the high single digits for the fourth quarter. We forecast on adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment approximately 6.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 28% of sales from continuing operations in the fourth quarter. So in summary, our sales and earnings progression for the year is playing out as we forecasted back in January as we continue to forecast another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Brian Yoor : Thanks Tom. This morning I\u2019ll review our third quarter 2014 performance and fourth quarter sales outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I\u2019ll start with our nutrition business where global sales increase 10% in third quarter. In our international pediatric nutrition business, sales increase 14%. We\u2019ve recaptured our share in China and Vietnam following the previously recorded 2013 sales disruption and continue to drive uptake of new products. This includes new infant formula products Similac QINTI and Eleva that we recently launched into the premium segments of the Chinese market to further enhance our competitive position. International adult nutrition sales increased strong double digit in the quarter, represents the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in this business. Sales growth is led by continued strong performance of our Ensure brand and double-digit growth in emerging markets. Last week Abbott announced the opening of our new nutrition manufacturing plant in India, the third plant we open this year to increasing demand for our nutrition products. This new manufacturing plants is one of Abbott\u2019s most technologically advanced nutrition plants in the world and sourced up to 80% of ingredients locally in India. We will work together with Abbott\u2019s nutrition R&D center in India to deliver innovations to address unmet health needs in pediatric and adult nutrition while also meeting specific local tastes and processes. In the U.S., nutrition sales increased low single digits in the quarter in line with expectations. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect global nutrition to deliver double-digit sales growth on an operational basis. In our diagnostics business, sales increased 6% in the third quarter representing sequential improvements from the second quarter where sales in emerging markets growing double-digits. Core laboratory diagnostics sales increase nearly 7% as we continue to outperform the market. In the U.S., sales growth was impacted by comparison to the third quarter of 2013 when sales were higher due to the timing of equipment sales. Year-to-date growth of 7.5% better reflects the underlying performance of the U.S. business where we continue to build momentum with our enterprise account commercial model. International sales in the third quarter increased 8%driven by continued strong growth in emerging markets. In molecular diagnostics, our core focus and largest business is infectious disease testing where year-to-date sales increased mid-single digits. In the quarter, growth in our infectious disease business was offset by decline in some of our smaller businesses as well as timing of tenders in several emerging markets. In point of care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 6.7%, representing a sequential improvement from the first two quarter of the year. International sales increased 17% as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted developed and emerging markets. For the fourth quarter, in global diagnostics we\u2019re forecasting mid-to-high single-digits operational sales growth. In medical devices, vascular sales decreased low single digits in the quarter. Sales growth was relatively flat excluding the impact of the third quarter 2013 sales through up related to a third-party agreement. We continue to see strong market adoption of MitraClip, our breakthrough technology for the treatment of mitral regurgitation and growth from Supera, a peripheral stent for the superficial femoral artery or SFA. As Miles mentioned during the third quarter, MitraClip received national Medicare coverage and an improved payment rate for the procedure, which will help drive adoption of MitraClip in the U.S. Both structural heart and endovascular products grew double digits in the third quarter globally. In our drug eluting portfolio on September, we presented the first randomized clinical trial result for Absorb our Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold. One year results from the Absorb II study demonstrated that Absorb provides comparable results to science and lower rate of angina or chest pain. Also in the quarter, we launched additional XIENCE for expanding the potential for Absorb used in more coronary procedures. As we look ahead, we expect to see improvement in vascular sales growth driven by commercial execution and contribution from new products as well as further Absorb penetration as we exit the year. So for the fourth quarter, we expect to see a sequential improvement in growth in the third quarter with relatively flat year-over-year sales on an operational basis. In diabetes care, global sales in the third quarter were somewhat ahead of our expectations as the rate of decline in the U.S. was moderating. Outside of the U.S. we\u2019re focused on driving growth in both emerging and developed markets in our diabetes care business and recently announced European launch of our revolutionary new glucose sensing technology called FreeStyle Libre. It eliminates routine finger pricks and finger-prick calibration, and with glucose levels discreetly through a sensor that can be worn on the back of the upper arm. In the near term, we\u2019re working to obtain reimbursement for Libre in Europe as well as breakthrough market in a number of additional countries next year. For the fourth quarter, in our global diabetes business, we expect a mid-single digit decline on an operational basis with international growth offset by the later stages of the market transition in the U.S. in line with our forecast earlier this year. In vision care, sales increased 9% in the third quarter. Sales of our cataract product which represents approximately 70% of our vision care business increased double digits, outpacing the growth of the global cataract market. We continue to capture market share with our recently launched premium intraocular lenses including our TECNIS OptiBlue line of lenses in Japan and our TECNIS Toric lenses in the U.S. and Japan. In addition, we continue to see strong adoption of our new CATALYS laser cataract system. We are also receiving strong feedback from early adopter of our new TECNIS Symfony extended range of vision intraocular lens that we launched in Europe in the second quarter. TECNIS Symfony provides patients with a continuous range of vision including far, intermediate and near differences but with reduced incidence of halo and glare. And last week, we announced the distribution agreement in the U.S. with Carl Zeiss Meditec, a leading ophthalmology diagnostic company. The Zeiss product line of diagnostics and visualization systems combined with Abbott's intraocular lenses, lens removal systems and laser cataract systems provide surgeons a comprehensive portfolio of cataract products to maximize the visual outcome and streamline patient flow. For the fourth quarter of the 2014, we expect our global vision care business to grow double digits on an operational basis. And lastly, our established pharmaceuticals business or EPB where sales from continuing operations that is excluding the developed markets branded generics pharmaceutical business increased nearly 13% in the quarter. This strong performance was driven by double digits sales growth across several emerging markets including India, Russia, Mexico, and Vietnam. This business continues to make meaningful progress and becoming a more consumer oriented organization and is focused on expanding products portfolios in key therapeutic areas. Implementing new branding initiatives across the portfolio and increasing its focus on marketing to the pharmacy channel. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we forecast double-digit sales growth on an operational basis from continuing operations in our emerging markets branded generics business. This includes CFR pharmaceuticals, which is expected to contribute sales of approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. So in summary, sales growth improves sequentially this quarter as we expected and we exceeded earnings-per-share expectations, raising the midpoint of our full year guidance range. We are on track for another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2014. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC. Mike Weinstein : Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on a nice quarter. Miles I wanted to really start with the EPD business and first the updated agreement today with Mylan could you spend a minute on that? Because obviously there was some question about whether that transaction as it was initially constructed. So A, could you comment on that? And then B, the EPT performance of this quarter up 12.9%. Can you just talk about the sustainability of that performance? It seems like a very high number so can you just talk about how we should think about that business going forward, thanks. Miles White : Well, I assume there is one of the question this morning was some clarity on whether or not that transaction with Mylan is going forward I think that\u2019s clear we reported discontinued operations, - financials et cetera and as we very clearly said in the earnings release yesterday tracking forward no change probably that\u2019s what comment on that. So that was special takeaway some speculation on certainty there and that\u2019s all tracking according to schedule. The performance of the remainder of EPD actually it\u2019s both halves, we\u2019ve actually seen improvement in the developed markets part of the business which is good thing that\u2019s the part that we\u2019re divesting to Mylan. And we've seen improvement in the emerging market piece. I think some improvement in market and economy in few of these markets like India but overall let\u2019s say improvement in the overall performance of the business which we\u2019ve been expecting and waiting for and that was kind of what we intended and what we planned and we\u2019re seeing it. So, that\u2019s gratifying, I think everybody around the world, every company I have seen reporting as expressing caution around economies everywhere and currencies everywhere so forth and I think one issue that I continue to track closely which we\u2019ve obviously less control of then the operating performance of these businesses is just the overall currency volatility around the world and that of course effects this business because it\u2019s purely an ex-U.S. business but other than that I think what we\u2019re seeing here and gradual improvements in our performance in the business is good, that\u2019s good and I\u2019m feeling pretty good about that because as you know earlier in the year we were projecting sequential improvements in this business as the year went on and you guys directly ask about it every quarter and we\u2019re seeing that. Your greatest fear is that you don\u2019t see that so we\u2019re pleased with that now in addition we add CFR to that, CFR\u2019s performance in Latin America has been consistent double-digit growth and that\u2019s also a plus and going forward. So, I think if you look at the underlying performance of the business we exceeded double-digit growth and there is very little CFR in here because of the timing close there is not a lot of CFR in the numbers and even without it business is going double digit. So I\u2019m pleased with what I see in emerging markets when we\u2019re done with the Mylan transaction with the developed market business this business will be purely an emerging market business which has been our strategic intent to focus on because we see the conditions in those markets and the developing economies quite favorable to the business over time. So that remains an important strategic focus for us and I think the investors now will have a much clearer visibility of transparency to the opportunity in those markets. One of the great things about emerging markets is the growth potential there of these economies and the healthcare systems and that\u2019s why we\u2019re focused on that, that\u2019s a very important source of growth, it comes with volatility which means you got to be diverse, you got to be diverse in geographies you\u2019re in fortunately we\u2019re well spread out I think CFR helped us even further with that. So, I like the prospects for the business and I\u2019m glad we\u2019re seeing the fundamental improve. Mike Weinstein : So Miles, just two quick follow ups if I can. So one obviously one you're confident that the transaction is going to go through. Two, the piece that we talked about that you didn't really address in all of your opening comments of this call was the vascular business which obviously had a difficult quarter. So can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that business strategically and how you turn that business around given your success now in turning around EPD? Thanks. Miles White : Well first of all back to your original question about confidence. We\u2019re right on track with our transaction with Mylan and I\u2019m superstitious enough not to want to speculate or hypothesize or whatever. I would say we\u2019re on track with what we said, what we expected and everything we\u2019re doing is pointed at the conclusion on time, on schedule as described. And I don\u2019t know what else to say about it I don\u2019t really want to get into a lot of speculation about other stuff, but I think it\u2019s, as I said, tracking exactly where we wanted to be. So, that\u2019s about as much as I can say and only thing I should say. The vascular business is a disappointment. There is just no question about that. And this is our performance. You know to a degree, I think all of us competing in this business can look at a slower market, but this isn't about slower markets this is about us. The part of this business where I am most disappointed is the US in us and our performance there. There's a lot of price competition, but you know when there is price competition that price affects everybody, so the whole market is experiencing price competition. I think that there's a fair amount of commoditization that's happening here, its customers returning more and more towards value and less and less toward differentiation and performance of products. And I think when that happens your competitors begin to sell on price and other factors. I think this market has definitely changed. The dynamics, the competitive dynamics have changed and our approach to it needs to change as well and that's just a fact. For us, you know, if you look at the performance is primarily the stent business and it's primarily the US. Now is there a residual effect in Europe, there is, is there a residual effect in Japan? There is. I\u2019d say in both countries, both geographies, that is Japan and Europe its price. But in addition, I think that there's a definitely a share war going on where the leaders in the category and as such, we\u2019re targeted by everybody else. And we all seem to be dealing with that as well as we should. And I think that's pretty clear. So, at this point, I don't have any projections to make to you other than you've got our full attention. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. David Roman : Thank you good morning everybody. I wanted to sort of follow along the train of thought on the vascular business. And Miles if we make the comparison to the turnaround you may be able to execute on EPD, it seems like it's not completely analogous. And the reason I say that is EPD operated in very attractive end markets largely in the emerging markets. Whereas in vascular the vast majority of the business is in stents which I think would be hard to call an attractive market. So as you think about this business strategically do you need to rethink the business mix or the potential to engage in more aggressive portfolio modification to really change the growth portfolio of that vascular franchise? Miles White : Well, first of all, let me tell you, I don't see an analogy between this and EPD other than there's been a time when both have performed below our expectations and we frankly - which in the pro forma at or above our expectations, so there is the comparability. Other than that, you\u2019re right. They\u2019re different. The answers to the device business or the stent business are clearly different. The dynamics of the market are different and so on. In our case, I think, there is two things. One is we clearly have to deal with our competitiveness in the stent category and in particular in the US. We simply have to figure out here how to be a lot more competitive than we apparently have been. So that's point number one, point number two beyond that, I think for this business to be a contributor to growth it's got to be broader. We've got to broaden our footprints here. We've got to broaden into new areas and new innovations. Now, in our case, MitraClip, the peripheral, the longer term prospects for Absorb and frankly any other expansion beyond that, they're all considerations here. We can't just sit here and be a drug-eluding stent company and rely on that. So it's clearly our intent to broaden the business and grow other dimensions of it in the device area. But you have to do that on strong foundations, so we've got to fix the competitiveness of the underlying business first. And we\u2019re clearly looking at how we expand and shape this business going forward. I have no intention of being out of the business, I've no intention of shrinking, I have no intention of any other changes other than full steam ahead, but I\u2019d say the underlying competitiveness and then expansion from there is what's on the table. David Roman : Okay that's helpful for perspective and then maybe just on the underlying business, maybe you could talk a little bit more about adult nutritionals that that is a franchise that looks to be doing reasonably well and it obviously looks to be a pretty big opportunity in China on a go forward basis. Could you maybe just help us understand the adult opportunity that exists in front of you? And then how we should think about the impact that has to the global growth of that nutrition business on a go forward basis. Miles White : I\u2019d tell you, I think this is a great business and again I always think we can do better at it. And in this case, it\u2019s very different dynamic. We are the adult nutrition business worldwide. And its one where - it's not about riding growth or competing with particular competitors because we're quite large I guess, I would say in the area. So we have to drive the growth and create the demand as well. And the single biggest uncreated opportunity thus far is China. And we\u2019re recently launching into that arena with powder-based products and so forth. We\u2019ll learn our way in here. We think we understand the dynamics of the market, but you always think you understand the dynamics of the market then the market teaches you more. In this case, we\u2019ve launched. I think there's a big opportunity there. I think there's a future opportunity beyond that, beyond the powder-based business in liquids. And we\u2019re prepared for that as well, but I think we\u2019ll go at this - I don\u2019t want to say cautiously because that's not the right term. But thoughtfully, progressively we\u2019ll establish our distribution, establish our brand, establish our products, establish us in the categories. The dynamics in China are different than the dynamics in the US or other countries of the world their own behaviors and practices as consumers are different and so it\u2019s not like you can just take up a U.S. or European or Latin American model and apply China, you can\u2019t. But I think there is a big opportunity there and I think there is opportunity in the rest of the world to continue to grow the business. In this case, we don\u2019t measure our success so much on shares we do in so many other categories, we measure our success on real growth because our share is high and I think that a very high share and given segment you can\u2019t often too comfortable and that drive the opportunity or the market growth. I don\u2019t think our people are comfortable, I think they all understand there's a much bigger opportunity there to drive growth in this business we certainly do like that. And so for me that's a real upside for us that's on our radar screen for a lot of investment attention and as you know we've recently invested in additional plant capacity not only in China and India, but also here in the U.S. in Ohio where we built a brand-new liquid plant that is specifically dedicated to this business. And we\u2019re already into phase 2 expansion there so we've got great expectations of the ability this business to drive growth in the future both here and in the areas overseas. David Roman : Okay and maybe lastly for you or Tom, even if you don't monetize the Mylan shares that you'll receive still be sitting on a pretty big chunk of cash fairly under the level of interest rate still level of potentially rising and any updates on how we should think about use of capital going into next year and how you might look to offset the Mylan dilution and any headwinds that might materialize from foreign exchange in 2015. Tom Freyman : Well, you got similar questions there, one is sort of capital allocation and the Mylan shares and then currency so let me just deal with the capital allocation first. I\u2019d say I'm probably not going to tell you right now what our intentions would be or what we\u2019ll do. I'd say your best proxy for that is just to simply to look at we've been good stewards and capital allocators in the past we always pay a healthy dividend, we always try to balance share repurchase, but at the end of the day we also have been investors in strategic growth opportunities and so forth and I think the best expectation is a mix of the above. We\u2019re not going to run the one side of the ship and tip. We\u2019re going to keep things relatively balanced. I think we\u2019ll be opportunistic about our Mylan holding. Obviously, we don't want to do anything to destabilize that holding or either company. And we think that's a pretty strong and valuable investment for us so we can afford to be I\u2019d say thoughtful about the disposition of those shares over time. Although it's not our intent to be long-term shareholders of Mylan I think that's been pretty clear. And you know I'm glad to have the capital and the challenge how to best allocated for our investors but I think, if we look at our track record historically we've been pretty good at balancing that for the range of investors we have those that rely on the income those that rely on a cash return those that rely on good strategic investments so forth so, without betraying any future direction here, and certainly time and opportunity can change here so you can expect more of the same from us and not something dramatically different in what you come to expect. With regard to currency, I note that a lot of companies that have reported in last couple of weeks a flag caution around currency around the world and you know rightly so. As you know our business is 70% international and in the continued operations now we\u2019ll be about 50% of emerging markets and some of those currencies have been disappointing or volatile if you\u2019re an American company and competing in dollars. And it remains a challenge for us so over the past few years we like other companies have taken quite a dent from currency and I\u2019d point out that over that time as you know the companies made tremendous strides in improving margins improving gross margins and distribution margins and unfortunately well fortunately and unfortunately we've done that because it\u2019s been able to absorb a lot of the currency hit and all pricing pressure that we've experienced around the world over the last couple of years and we still manage to improve margins, but or it would be eroding the bottom line that we\u2019re experiencing. So going forward I don't think any American company likes to have to keep dealing with that but for a period of time it appears to me we\u2019re going to be under some exchange pressure at companies around the world and expense in the market basket mix. Over the long term, our best hedge against currency fluctuations is to have our cost basis in the markets where we serve. And what I mean by that is our production, our plans, our products we've got a matchup some of our production in a proportion with profitability of markets and in fact that means producing end markets for the market and a lot of these large emerging markets and even the smaller ones that want foreign investments or want American brands or American companies or frankly European companies they also want you to invest there to build plants and employ people et cetera in their markets and over the long haul the best hedge against currency is to have your costs where your profits are and we happen to have profits in a lot of countries of the world and so we've got to ensure that we have also thought through, how to put some of our production capacity, R&D capacity, and so forth there we can\u2019t solely be exporters from the United States or concentrated places, capital all your cost in India, and exports it to the rest of the world. You've actually got to match it up where your profits are, invest in most countries and mitigate exchange. So I think over the next three years that's something that's going to get a lot of focus from us and other multinational that are 40%, 50%, 60% international companies and businesses. And you\u2019re going to see many of us working to balance that overtime because to the extent that the kind of currency we've experienced continues, and we expect it to continue in the 2015. I\u2019d say right now, you know, I'm not ready to even start hinting about the 2015. We always start the year targeting double digits. And we always do target double digits. We always set a high bar for ourselves even in small economy. But the hardest part of predicting this is the currencies. And then we still deliver on the top of that. So I think overtime, the only real way to mitigate currency is to do as I just described. You can head short-term, but that's it short-term, and for the long-term we\u2019ve got to deal with that. Because I think, if we want the growth from a participation of these markets then we've also got to shape our business to deal with the fluctuations of currencies because as you know our investors require us to get it right every quarter. Operator : Thank you, and our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley David Lewis : Miles I just want to come back to a strategic question here and you know and with nutrition back on track and the [receipting] in EPD you have two legs of the stool growing out in excess of the target rate you laid out for Abbott at the spin. Devices is the obvious departure which is more vascular and diabetes but one of your larger diversified peers is actually getting smaller in devices. And I guess the question is even though everyone's discussing large device consolidation, in light of the strength you have in the other two legs, and arguably better secular fundamentals in this business is why even bother getting much bigger in devices versus doing tuck in technologies for focusing on better execution? Miles White : Well, I\u2019d say two things. First of all, I\u2019ll correct you a little bit and say I got three major businesses that are doing really well. I think diagnostics is doing well too. And I think relative to the kind of opportunities diagnostics has and how it\u2019s been performing, it\u2019s been a really solid performer over the last few years and has a hell of the bank of systems and new products coming. So, I think your analysis and I'd say look - and by the way I haven't told nutrition are back on track, you just did. But I keep the fire to our feet here on this performance. But, okay, let\u2019s take you description and say, the established pharmaceutical business and nutrition are trending in the right direction in terms of growth, expansion and so forth. I think diagnostics is going to be a very solid performer at least devices. And I would take that in three pieces and say, you know the diabetes cure business actually I think is doing very well. I think they've stabilized the underlining business relative to the competitive bidding dynamics of the U.S. Every major competitor took their hit there. We just launched a unique, and I say spectacular products that in Europe at this point, that I think is going to drive a whole new generation of performance there that we\u2019re excited about. So I think in terms of things that we would do for our diabetes care business, we're pretty happy with how that's progressing at this point. In our medical optics business, it\u2019s best-performing division in the company right now, which is ironic because as you know for a couple of years after we acquired it, we kept reporting disappointing performance to you, and of course you all really challenge us on that. But that business is performing well, taking share in its business. It's had a great run here of new product delivery and continues to. So, I like what I see and medical devices out of those two businesses at this point, good innovation, good R&D productivity, good commercial execution, good expansion, good platform, I just can't say enough good about it. That leaves vascular and vascular has got challenges, which I already talked about. So, that\u2019s the one part of our release where you\u2019d say I am disappointed in the trajectory of disappointed in what I see in terms of performance. And we know that. I mean, nobody is going to be surprised to hear me say that over the phone. So, you can look at it any number of ways, you can say, well that's not very good any more. We\u2019ll just do something with that or shrink or just get rid of it or whatever. And I don't want to think that's necessary. I think right now our issue isn't - you can say the market is slower. All markets are slower. All markets are slower. There's no question about that. First issue here is our performance, our strategy, our execution, how we\u2019re doing our business in these markets. And relative to our competitors, I don't think you abandon commitment to our investments in the business because of your own execution I think you go picture execution. And in our case, that's what I'm going to focus on. Do I think there's still a lot of opportunity in medical devices? I do. I think there is opportunity there are some segments of medical devices that are attractive to us and some that are not. There's some that we would not choose to be in and having chosen to be in, and there are some that we would choose to be in. And I'd say that ebbs and flows, it's not clear given point in time, what\u2019s going to evolve, what\u2019s going to develop. I\u2019d say we all know that the easy part of it with a big tailwind of innovation funded by government reimbursements and so forth, that's not as easy anymore. Now you've really got to compete, and you've really got to be innovative, and you've really got to be better at it in your competition and you got to put a value proposition on the table with a product somebody wants and is willing to pay for it. So I think right now my focus on the device business is both fixing the base of that particular business as I described, and looking at where we would selectively choose to invest or expand I think one of the benefits of being large and diverse as we are is that we can afford to absorb occasional poor performance or economic downturn or whatever the case maybe and fix the business or improve its performance but we can afford to be patient about what new opportunities may come along and where we want to invest. There've been a number of transactions that we've done over time to build the company that have been from a timing standpoint opportunistic. We track those businesses and those segments for a long period of time and when an opportunity presented itself that fit and it was economically good for us and our investors then we pounced on it. And I think in this case some dimensions of the future of the device business require some patience here because the markets as you know aren't as favorable as they could be and it's not clear when that will change and it's not clear where the new opportunities in some of the areas of devices will be attractive. But I think for the long-term and especially in some out of the U.S. geographies and so forth there is still a lot of opportunities here so I\u2019m not ready to throw the challenge and miss it all. David Lewis : And Miles just to follow-up on something you mentioned on nutrition, U.S. adult very very strong, your pediatric maybe little less so. Is pediatric the business that you\u2019d like to see greater improvement and what steps need to be taken to do that? Miles White : I'm not sure I understood the question there. David Lewis : Just in terms of nutrition, we had all U.S. adult very strong and in pediatric maybe not as strong as we expected and given your comments on nutrition back on track but not quite where you wanted I wonder it\u2019s the area of improvement is that more in pediatric than this is in adult and what specifically has to happen in pediatric nutrition to improve that performance.? Miles White : Yes, okay. As you know, over the last 3-4 years there has been some largely there that impacted the pediatric nutrition business usually in China. And the recall that we had over a year ago clearly affected the business in China and several other countries. And when that happens to the pediatric business it typically takes a year or more to recover. And you might note that one of our competitors who was impacted more than we were by that particular recall has not recovered and we have. So, I think first thing I'd say is our team in China and Saudi Arabia and other places, Vietnam they\u2019ve done a wonderful job recovering not only share they had in the market but performance trajectory, brand confidence with the consumer et cetera and we\u2019re seeing that now. While we completely there we\u2019re close that cost a year\u2019s worth of growth and base and so forth to those countries. We're in a good trajectory in China a lot of new product launches are going on right now that are driving us I think very nicely, I'm not sure we\u2019re going to be satisfied and let ourselves to be satisfied in pediatric business in China until we've taken incremental share over and above where we were when the recall happened but we\u2019re on a good trajectory there and I think the team is doing well at that. We\u2019ve a launched a lot of new products around the world country by country over the last three years, our R&D productivity in the nutrition business has been exceptional, tops in the company and then put a lot of new products into the marketplace and it's our own commercial execution that needs to make those products successful in those markets. So I'd say, we're in so many countries that the opportunity from a pediatric standpoint is really strong, really good, and driven by good demographic circumstances in those countries and economic development circumstances. So I\u2019m pleased with all of that. As I turn to the U.S., the U.S. has always been Abbott competition there's no tailwind of growth for the pediatric business in the United States, this is hand-to-hand combat. That's primarily Mead Johnson. And they\u2019re to be respected for medical competitor and they make us better and hopefully we make them better I think they're a very strong competitor with both relatively equivalent share in the United States and we just slug it out every day and I think that puts a lot of pressure on both companies to be innovative, to perform well, to always be looking at new ways to reach the consumer. And the medical community and in our case I think we've done really well. I think that our share growth, our share gain in various segments of the business has been excellent and if you asked me if I'm satisfied I'm never satisfied. I always want us to do better than we've done and I think the attention that we give that business is warranted and we've got a lot of attention on that business. Because I think it can do even better than it has I think we've got really good management team there and I think the opportunity and the upside for us is good. It's not a market driven growth, it\u2019s a competition driven growth we have to compete. And I tell the people in the company that if you really want to see head-to-head competition and understand what competition looks like in a business whether the pediatric nutrition business because in every country of the world it is head-to-head with our competitors. And I think we've done really well there from share standpoint and gross standpoint to access that market so that gets a lot of attention and focus for us. It\u2019s a profitable business, it generates strong cash flow. I like everything about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning, thanks for taking the question, so just one multi-part question for me just starting with the Mylan deal. I think when you announced the deal you said it would be $0.22 diluted any update from the new terms? And how should we think about EPS growth off of the 2014 base with the Mylan dilution and the CFR accretion? And just lastly on the same theme, I think Miles in the past you said that you tried to make up any delusion from M&A. Is that still the case following the Mylan deal? Thank you. Miles White : Going down the list, no change at all in our -- Thomas Freyman : Just to be clear that\u2019s comps. Miles White : No change at all on our forecast of 2015 impact of the divestiture of the developed markets business for EPD to the Mylan. That stays at the $0.22. We estimated that in July. CFR, the way to think about that is we indicated that would add $0.07 to any baseline, you would develop in 2015. And the third question was, was what Larry? Larry Biegelsen : I think in the past you and Miles, I think it's Miles, I think I've heard say that you would try to make up any dilution from the M&A, is that still the case here? Thomas Freyman : I mean I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s quite the right way to phrase to I mean. We are very sensitive to dilution and I think if you go back and the many deals we\u2019ve done in the last several years, investors have not been impacted by dilution on any deal and so our efforts have always been that if there is some modest impact of the business that we find the way to manage through that without impacting investors. And I think that\u2019s the way to approach it and that\u2019s definitely in our history and I continue to be way we think about deals going forward. Miles White : You know, Larry, I would just add to it. There is $0.22 on this divestiture of this business and that\u2019s - its chunk of make up now obviously our EPS well figured in that, but that all chunk of makeup. CFR will offset fair amount of that. And then I would only point out that to the question earlier, we aren\u2019t constrained with capital in terms of opportunities. But we want to be opportunistic in terms of any opportunities that we had with the company, so I don\u2019t want to just rush out and you\u2019re not suggesting this I understand. But obviously deploy capital is simply replace EPS and in long-term I am always looking to build EPS and grow the Company. So we clearly with not only the continuing cash we earn and accumulate, but as the Mylan proceeds and so forth have tremendous flexibility for M&A and kind of without constraint. The only thing that constrains us is opportunities and fit of those opportunities and so on. So I think to the degree that they are investors who look at the net let\u2019s call it dilution from the sale of scaffold product business in the developed markets to Mylan, I would say be patient, you can\u2019t offset that or fix that in a few weeks, but longer term obviously our motive is to grow and improve the company. And I just can\u2019t predict the timing of that, but I can certainly figure all the possibility in the all deal is. Thomas Freyman : And Larry, I\u2019ll just add one more thing to what Miles said and the way I entered the question. Obviously, Miles just pointed in the near term we will have - we won\u2019t have the earning of that particular business, but as we talked about that in July and as you saw on this quarter and this first quarter reported continuing operation, you saw significantly enhanced top line growth rate, a better bottom line growth rate and that obviously investors like that message when we deliver in July and that\u2019s when we shouldn\u2019t lose as we move into 2015. Operator : Our final question today is from Rick Wise from Stifel Nicolaus. Rick Wise : Thanks. Morning Miles, hi Tom. Miles you've approach this in multiple ways but I'd sort of like to ask you more directly when I think about the last year or so you've done an amazing amount of operational and portfolio reshaping. I mean clearly it seems like vascular is something that you're going to be paying more attention to. But if you list the top three priorities for your attention here where are you focused and you know operationally and portfolio perspective now that you've addressed so many of the major challenges? Miles White : I am focused on vascular and I am focused on devices. I think, you think about where you spend your time it\u2019s not like you run the one thing and only spend your time there. I mean they all got a lot of time and attention from all of us, but we know very clearly where we\u2019re headed and what we want to execute. What we have to do in almost every business here where we don\u2019t seem to be executing or defining that future as well is clearly in the vascular business and I think it\u2019s not even devices it\u2019s the vascular business and we can think of the vascular business as vascular we can think of it more broadly as medical devices exclusive of optics and probably just care center for minute and I\u2019d say that particular leg has both fix it dimension to it and an expansion of future strategy dimension to it and its capital so that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to get a lot of attention from all of us and more or so I mean I would say we believe we have been paying sufficient attention to all the things necessary in that business but clearly it shows in the performance right now but that\u2019s not sufficient and we\u2019ve got to take through this a lot more thoroughly. And I think thinking from a standpoint of being more successful we just got to be a lot more successful not only in the current business but in the future. So, I guess if you said where is the majority of my worry time spent or my focus time or strategy time or whatever it\u2019s with my folks in the vascular business now. Rick Wise : Got you. And just to last operational questions. If you could talk a bit more about China are you back to normal in China? And do you think the new plant distribution from Tera, the new products had we think about growth and share there you know over the next year or two? It seems like there could be it could be quite extraordinary. And just last briefly remind us on the flash FreeStyle, how big the opportunity is, I know the market is huge, how big an opportunity how big a product could this be? And remind us about the US approval and launch times thanks so much? Miles White : Okay, with - China yes, I think we\u2019re back to where we were or we ahead of where were, we made up for the last year no but we\u2019re back to where we were in my view. And with regard to prospects in China going forward I\u2019d say the sort of the near term and the long term, the near term is often a bumpy ride in China and that can be because of local conditions, it can be economy, it can be the government, it can be the unexpected recall it can be anything, China is a bumpy ride and yes, it\u2019s a very attractive long term market so we made long term commitments and investments and have a long term strategy there including the ownership and development of our own dairies and own milk supply inside the country and I think that is unique among multinationals at this point. We\u2019ve ensured our own supply and our own access to ingredients at a very high quality level et cetera and I think for the long term that makes a big difference we\u2019re very very well positioned. So, I think the prospects in China are very good for the long term in spite of the fact that it\u2019s an occasionally bumpy ride okay and I think the underlying potential dynamics are all very strong and very good, it\u2019s a very competitive place, it\u2019s a different place to do business. But I can say that about any market around the world and I know people say it would they tend to lump emerging markets together like they\u2019re all the same, they\u2019re not the same and they\u2019re no two that\u2019s same and yes, they represent tremendous growth and I think China does in particular. Now in our case, I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty spread across a lot of foreign markets and emerging markets around the world because we don\u2019t want to be over dependent on just China, just India, just Russia, just Brazil et cetera. So as you know with our CFR transaction, CFR doesn\u2019t happen to be substantial in Brazil or Mexico or very large market it\u2019s in a log of next level markets medium size et cetera where there is tremendous opportunities. In our case we don\u2019t risk to over index necessarily just in China or India now when - market we want to be very successful in it so with the largest healthcare company, largest pharmaceutical company in India and I like that position but at the same time our share is at a point where there is still tremendous growth opportunity ahead of us we just don\u2019t want to be over dependent on any one market and while China is a tremendous growth opportunity so it\u2019s the rest of the world. With regard to Libre which is the flash glucose product just reference I don\u2019t know what I can tell you about the potential is to be honest I think we\u2019re going on at the beginning here with I think modest financial expectations but aggressive marketing intent, we\u2019re going at this a different way, I don\u2019t want to be overly reliance on reimbursement because I think this product has tremendous consumer or user appeal for the insulin dependent diabetic and I think the experience for that particular patient or user is so superior to what\u2019s available today or what they can do today that I think our challenge is to establish the value proposition and the product and it\u2019s benefits and it\u2019s use and it\u2019s experience to that patient group. And if we do that well then it won\u2019t as dependent on get keeping your hurdles of government reimbursement et cetera although it may be well enhanced by that at some point but we\u2019re trying to go about it more from a consumer approach perspective and go direct to the patient with this and to the extent that all regulatory circumstances allow. So, I think that\u2019s got great potential opportunity I don\u2019t know how to put a dollar value on that yet so I\u2019m reluctant to kind of Forecast one. Our team in diabetes care knows that almost any number they give me won\u2019t meet my expectations and I think that\u2019s kind of how we live it internally right now it\u2019s not clear that can completely project what the uptick will be or how fast but we\u2019re very pleased by initial reactions of consumers and professionals and physicians and so forth. And I think after we\u2019ve had some months of experience we\u2019ll be better able to put some numbers around what we expect here in terms of continuing trajectories, expansion share gain et cetera in the biggest user group there is which is insulin dependent diabetic and the frequent tester. So I think that\u2019s the best I can tell you about that at this point, right now we got an awful lot of expectation and hope and we\u2019re not overly focused on meeting particular numbers because right now the numbers are small of course because that\u2019s the initial launch phase but it\u2019s launched in 7 new countries and that\u2019s going to be pretty good test for us. Brian Yoor : Okay, thank you operator and thank you for all of your questions. And that concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 AM Central Time today on Abbott\u2019s Investor Relations Web site at www.abbottinvestor.com and after 11 :00 AM Central Time via telephone at 203-369-0489 pass code 2343.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations. Brian Yoor : Okay, good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2014. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1(a), Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments as except required by law. Note that financial results from the developed markets branded, generics, pharmaceuticals and animal health businesses are reported as discontinued operations due to the pending sale of these businesses. As a result, the line items of our consolidated statement of earnings are reported as continuing operations or excluding the results of these two businesses. To help facilitate year-over-year comparisons we filed an 8-K on Tuesday of this week that provides historical results from Abbott's continuing operations for the first three quarters of 2014. In addition, our 2015 guidance provided today for sales, P&L line items and earnings per share is for continuing operations only. In today's conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay, thanks Brian, good morning. Today I'll discuss our results for the fourth quarter of 2014, but in particular our outlook for 2015. We made good progress against our objectives last year and we see good positive underlying momentum in our businesses going into 2015. However, as you know, recent macroeconomic events have dominated the discussion on company outlooks for 2015 in particular the significant strengthening of the dollar against almost every currency during the fourth quarter of 2014 and in the 2015, as well as the impact of the draconian price of oil on the global economic outlook. These factors will affect the 2015 forecast for most multinational companies, including Abbott, but while many are focused on the negative aspects of these events, I'd note that they will impact countries and companies in different ways. Abbott will clearly face some headwinds, while emerging markets currencies have devalued, however underlying fundamental growth remained strong. In fact countries such as India and China where Abbott has a strong presence will benefit economically from the lower price of oil and while the weakening of the euro impacts our European based revenue the fluctuations of this particular currency will not impact our bottom line as a result of our European cost base and this should provide some durability to our result. So while I'll discuss currency in more detail when I review our 2015 outlook, the bulk of my remarks here will address what we control our commercial and operational execution, our new product introductions and our efforts to reduce costs and expand margins. So for the full year 2014 we delivered operational sales growth of 5.5% including acquisitions. Sales growth rates improved sequentially each quarter last year as we expected and sales in emerging markets increased nearly 13%. We expended both growth and operating margins and achieved adjusted earnings per share of $2.28 including results related to the established pharmaceutical developed markets business. This exceeded our guidance range and represents year-over-year adjusted EPS growth of more than 13%. During the year, we continued to build Abbott's investment identity as a durable and reliable growth company following a number of actions we took last year, were broader and deeper in emerging markets and were more consumer facing. In short, we are more present were the growth in healthcare is taking place now and will be over the long term. In established pharmaceuticals we further positioned a division for faster growth. We added CFR Pharmaceuticals which provides the scale manufacturing, R&D and product portfolio to establish Abbott as a top-10 pharma company in Latin America. We acquired Veropharm positioning Abbott as a top five branded generic company in Russia. Both CFR and Veropharm provide Abbott with in-country manufacturing to bring us closer to our customers as well as better match our cost with our sales and currency in those regions. And we're on track to close on the sale of the EPD developed markets business in the first quarter, our business that performed above expectations in 2014 and is well positioned to move forward with Mylan. Last year in our nutrition business we increased our local presence by investing in our global infrastructures. We opened three new manufacturing plants in China, India, and the U.S. and we partnered with world's largest dairy co-operative Fonterra to invest locally in China's milk supply. These investments are a reflection of the strong underlying demand for our high quality adult and pediatric products. In Medical Devices we positioned our portfolio for stronger growth over the long term. We entered a $3 billion fast growing electrophysiology market through the acquisition of Topera. In vascular we achieved improved reimbursement and coverage from MitraClip in the U.S. which should further expand adoption and we presented the first of multiple randomized clinical trials underway for ABSORB. In medical optics, we broke ground on a new facility in Malaysia to expand manufacturing capacity for our cataract lenses driven by strong global demand for cataract surgeries. And in diabetes care we established a new market with our Flash glucose monitoring device FreeStyle Libre launched directly to consumers in Europe last fall. It eliminates the need for routine fingersticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes. In diagnostics we delivered another year of mid-to-high single-digit growth well balanced across both the developed world and emerging markets. And in Europe we introduced our IRIDICA testing system what we believe will be a breakthrough in the infectious disease area. We're entering 2015 with good momentum. The fundamentals of our business are strong and the growing trends across our markets remain positive. The innovations we're launching are driving share gains and we're investing in our businesses to drive above market growth over the long term. We expect to step up in our 2015 sales growth rate the high single-digit operational growth, including acquisitions with emerging markets expected to contribute another year of double-digits performance. From a currency perspective we expect around 6% negative impact to sales from foreign exchange. This is roughly double the impact we had expected just three months ago and is in line with what a number of other companies and analysts have forecasted as part of their outlooks for 2015. Currency is a headwind that's impacting all multinationals and our assumption for this impact has been incorporated into our 2015 adjusted earnings-per-share guidance from continued operations of $2.10 to $2.20 a share reflecting top tier growth at the midpoint of the range. Strong business performance and growth in operating margin expansion have and will continue to help offset even these more pronounced currency impacts in 2015. At the same time, we need to continue to invest in our businesses to drive sustainable long-term growth. And in 2015 I'm optimistic about our prospects. In nutrition, our R&D organization has been the most productive it has ever been launching multiple products over the last several years. In 2014 in China this included two new infant formula products, Eleva and Similac QINTI in new market segments. We expect continued momentum in 2015 including our new Ensure product in China which is the first product introduced in the newly established Adult Nutrition category in this country. We're also building our brand in India. Local R&D manufacturing and supply chains are fully established. We recently rolled out our first line of simple products produced in our new state-of-the-art facility. Margin improvement remains a key priority for our nutrition business and we expanded its operating margin by several hundred basis points each of the last two years. Our original target was to reach 20% of sales by 2015 and we exceed that goal in 2014. Going forward we expect further margin expansion in this business. In Established Pharmaceuticals we're continuing to improve our commercial execution by strengthening our capabilities in key geographies and channel, expanding our product portfolios through innovation that's both fast and locally driven and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with consumers who are taking even greater role and making decisions about their healthcare. We're also strengthening our local scale and infrastructure through the integration of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm. Both of these acquisitions enhance our local market insights, knowhow and our commercial capabilities as well as help build out our portfolios in our core therapeutic areas. And finally as I mentioned, we anticipate closing on the sale of our developed markets business to Mylan in the first quarter. We will receive 110 million shares of Mylan stock which provides us with significant optionality given our strong balance sheet and ability to redeploy the net proceeds from the ultimate sale of Mylan shares. In medical devices, we're investing in a number of new products across diabetes care, vascular and medical optics. The medical optics and our cataract business a steady stream of new products over the last two years has resulted in several points of share gains. In 2015 we expect continued strong growth of our cataract business driven by more than 20 new product launches across multiple geographies as well as continued expansion of our laser cataract system CATALYS. In vascular, we're continuing to drive uptake of our new products, MitraClip, Supera and Absorb as well as our newest drug-eluting stent XIENCE Alpine launched in the U.S. and recently approved in Japan. In diabetes care we'll expand FreeStyle Libre into multiple new markets over time targeting more than $8 billion global blood glucose monitoring markets. Strong patient awareness has exceeded our initial expectations based on our direct-to-patient sales model. We are already executing on our capacity expansion and we're looking to secure broader reimbursement for Libre. And finally, diagnostics, which remains one of our most durable and reliable growth businesses, consistently delivering mid-to-high single-digit operational sales growth the past four years. We will continue to execute on our commercial strategy and core laboratory diagnostics in both developed and developing markets. We are also investing simultaneously in the development of next-generation system platforms in blood screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, molecular diagnostics and point-of-care. Margin improvement in diagnostics once again exceeded our expectations increasing nearly 100 basis points versus 2013. Our gross margin improvement initiatives are continuing to yield results and we expect continued steady margin expansion in this business. So to summarize, as we enter 2015 we expect a step up in full year 2015 operational sales growth into the high single-digit with double-digit growth in emerging markets and we expect continued growth in operating margin expansion as we execute on our division improvement programs and back office support initiatives. While we anticipate currency to be a more significant headwind this year, than in 2014, the long term fundamentals of our business are healthy and we remain committed to increasing returns to shareholders. In addition to our dividend and share repurchase activity our strong balance sheet and additional flexibility from the Mylan transaction provide us with a significant opportunity to invest in strategic growth opportunities to continue to shape Abbott for long term durable growth. I'll now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss 2014 results in more detail and our 2015 outlook. Tom? Tom Freyman : Thanks Miles. Before I review our financial performance and outlook I'd like to remind you that my remarks today regarding 2014 earnings per share will include the contributions from the developed markets, branded, generics business that we agreed to sell to Mylan and the animal health business that we've agreed to sell to Zoetis. Both of these transactions are expect to close in the first quarter of 2015. This basis of comparison is consistent with the adjusted EPS guidance we've provided in our folder. All of my comments for sales and other P&L line items this quarter and also our 2015 forecast will be for continuing operations only and that is excluding the businesses being sold. Today, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share excluding specified items of $0.71 above our previous guidance range due to the full year effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December including the R&D tax credit for 2014. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 29% in the fourth quarter. We saw strong operational sales growth and increasing sales momentum in the fourth quarter. Sales from continuing operations increased 10.2% on an operational basis in the quarter which include the impact on our recent CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm acquisitions. Operational sales excluding these acquisitions increased 6.5% in the quarter. The product sales increased 5.6% in the quarter including an impact of 4.6% from foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange on sales is almost twice as high as the estimates we provided in October reflecting strengthening in the U.S. dollar versus almost every currency during the quarter. Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in nutrition diagnostics and established pharmaceuticals. Own company sales in emerging markets increased strong double-digitss on an operational basis in the quarter. fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ration was 56.9% of sales ahead of our previous guidance reflecting underlying gross margin improvements across the businesses as well as the impact of the weaker euro on our manufacturing cost base. Adjusted SG&A expenses 29.5% of sales and adjusted R&D investment was 6.4% of sales. The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was below our previous forecast due entirely for the inclusion of the full year impact of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December as I mentioned earlier. Overall as we look at 2014 we delivered a strong EPS growth above our initial guidance range and up more than 13% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations grew 21%. We continue to make significant progress in our margin improvement initiatives spanning our full year adjusted operation margins in continuing operations by 200 basis points. And importantly we exited the year with strong underlying momentum as we head into 2015. As I turn to our outlook for 2015 I'd note that as detailed in our earnings release, in 2014 we achieved adjusted EPS from continuing operations $1.98. This was the new baseline against which we will be measuring EPS growth in 2015. As Miles indicated the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is negatively impacting our 2015 growth as it is from our multinational companies. Based on current exchange rates, the impact of foreign exchange on our sales will be even more pronounced in 2015 than it was last year with a negative impact on 2015 sales growth of around 6% compared to 2.5% for the full year 2014. Although the impact of currency will be significant in 2015, it is important to note that as I mentioned earlier we exited last year with strong underlying performance momentum. Our top line operational growth accelerated significantly in the second half of the year as expected and we continue to make substantial progress on our margin expansion initiatives. Importantly the underlying trends across the key geographies and healthcare segments in which we compete remain positive and attractive over the long term driven by improving access in healthcare and demographic trends that aligns our business. So despite recent currency dynamics we are well positioned to deliver strong EPS growth in 2015. So turning to the specifics of our outlook for the full year 2015 today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations of $2.10 to $2.20 which reflects the growth of around 8.5% over 2014. At current exchange rates currency would negatively impact 2015 EPS growth reflected in this guidance by around 10%. We forecast operational sales growth continuing operations in the high single-digit for the full year 2015. As noted, at current exchange rates we would expect negative impact of around 6% on our full year reported sales which will result in reported sales growth in the low single-digits for the full year 2015. Brian will provide more detail on the 2015 outlook by business in a few minutes. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57% of sales for the full year 2015 reflecting more than 150 basis points of expansion driven by gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. I'll note that at current exchange rates the impact of foreign exchange on our gross margin ratio is expected to be relatively neutral in 2015 as the impact of exchange on sales will be largely offset by the benefit we will realize from the weaker euro on our European based manufacturing costs. We forecast adjusted R&D investment as a percent of sales consistent with 2014 level at around 6.5% of sales. And we forecast adjusted SG&A expense around 31% of sales for the full year as we end up some of savings from our efficiency programs and new products across our businesses to drive top line growth. Overall we expect to expand our full year adjusted operating margin by over 100 basis points in 2015 reflecting another year of significant margin expansion. We forecast interest expense of around $150 million up over 2014 due to a planned refinancing of a portion of our short term debt and expectation of higher U.S. short term interest rates impacting short term debt in the second half of the year and somewhat lower interest income as a result of the funding 2014 acquisitions. We forecast adjusted tax rate of 19% for the full year 2015 which is in line with the normalized 2014 rate excluding the effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December. Our forecast does not assume reenactment of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2015. Finally I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter of 2015. For the first quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.41 to $0.43 which reflects growth of over 23% the midpoint of the range over adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2014 up $0.34. This strong growth even in the line of currency headwinds is driven by strong underlying performance as well as favorable year-over-year comparisons due to certain items of reduced sales and earnings in the first quarter of last year, including the carry over effects of the 2013 supplier recall nutrition, the planning of a plant swept out in EPD to expand capacity and reimbursement changes affecting our U.S. diabetes business. For the second, third and fourth quarters, while we forecast strong underlying adjusted EPS growth this performance will be partially offset by the significant impact of foreign exchange on EPS growth in each quarter of the year. This will result in adjusted EPS growth in the mid or mid upper single-digits depending on the quarter over the last three quarter in 2015 as we work through the exchange headwinds that began in late 2014. Returning to our first quarter forecast, we project operational sales growth in the high single-digit in the current exchange rates we would expect a negative impact in exchange approaching 7% resulting in reported sales growth in the low single-digits. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat about 57% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense somewhat about 34% of sales, consistent with a relatively higher ratio we typically experience in the first quarter and reflecting investments and growth initiatives. We forecast adjusted R&D investments of around 6.5% of sales, net interest expense of around $30 million and around $20 million of income in exchange gain of non-operating income line in the P&L. In summary, we delivered another year of strong adjusted EPS growth in 2014 exceeding our initial guidance range and exited the year with strong momentum including sequential improvements and operational sales growth each quarter of the year and significant operating margin expansion. This strong underlying performance and momentum positions us well to deliver durable growth in 2015 despite a challenging currency environment. Our 2015 outlook reflects top tier ongoing growth driven by high single-digit operational sales growth and continued operating margin expansion. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Brian Yoor : All right. Thank you Tom. This morning I will review our fourth quarter 2014 performance and 2015 sales outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I will start with our nutrition business where global sales increased 9% in the fourth quarter. in our international pediatric nutrition business sales increased 14%. We continue to capture market share with new infant formula products including Similac QINTI and Eleva and which we launched in China during 2014 to further enhance competitive position in our role of end market segments. International adult nutrition sales increased 13% in the quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in this business. As we continue to expand the adult nutrition category internationally. Earlier this month we launched our Ensure brand in China. Although we expect modest sales initially, the adult nutrition market in china represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for Abbott. The aging population is expected to growth to four times the size of the U.S. baby boomer population. In the United States pediatric nutrition sales were relatively flat in the quarter and in line with our expectations. As share gains in the non segment of the infant formula market will offset by lower sales in the weak segment. Adult nutrition sales in the U.S. were impacted by volume and rice dynamics in the institutional segment and by stockists in our pharmacy nutrition business. For the full year 2015 we will continue to focus on capturing market share with recently launched infant nutrition products and expanding the adult nutrition category internationally including developing a shape in the adult nutrition market in China. We are forecasting high single-digits growth on an operational basis in our global nutrition business with double-digits operational sales growth in international nutrition. For the first quarter we expect global nutrition business to deliver mid to high single-digit sales growth on an operational basis. In our diagnostics business sales increased 8.6% in the fourth quarter with sales in emerging markets growing double-digitss. Core laboratory diagnostic sales also increased 8.6%, with high single-digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally as we continue to build momentum with our commercial models. We are also expanding our testing menu in order to provide greater value to clinical laboratories and ultimately patients. In the first quarter, we received U.S. FDA clearance for the first fully automated Galectin-3 for use with our Architect platform. This test assist doctors in assessing the prognosis of people diagnosed with chronic heart failure. Additionally a study on our high sensitive troponin test previously launched on Architect generated new data that was recently published in the British Medical Journal. The study found that average test can precisely measure very low levels of troponin which may help doctors accurately diagnose twice as many heart attacks in women compared to standard troponin tests. In molecular diagnostics, sales increased 4.4% in the quarter. Our infectious disease business, which is our core focus and represents more than half of our molecular diagnostic sales, increased double-digitss in the quarter. This growth was partially offset by decline in the oncology and genetics businesses in the U.S. resulting from pricing and market channel dynamics. As Miles mentioned, in December we received European approval for IRIDICA infectious disease testing platform. IRIDICA is a first of its kind platform that more rapidly diagnosed serious infections, such as sepsis and pneumonia in clinically old patients and has the potential to lower associated healthcare costs by up to 30%. In point-of-care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 14% as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted developed and emerging markets. The point-of-care business had a considerably strong fourth quarter in the U.S. due in part to customers ordering Abbott's i-STAT analyzers as part of their ebola preparedness activities. In addition, a major hospital network in the U.S. standardized its point-of-care testing around Abbott's market leading i-STAT platform which also contributed to strong growth in the fourth quarter. We expect another year of durable performance in our diagnostics business in 2015. But we continue to execute on our commercial model and core laboratory diagnostics, drive uptake of our new IRIDICA infectious disease platform and molecular diagnostics in Europe and increase market penetration with our point-of-care platforms. At the same time, we continue development of our next generation platforms across all three businesses. These systems are being designed to positively impact patient care, improved service to customers, enhanced laboratory productivity and reduced costs. For the full year 2015 we expect our global diagnostics business to generate operational growth that is similar to our performance in 2014. For the first quarter global diagnostics we're forecasting low to mid single-digit operational sales growth. In medical devices, we completed the acquisition of Topera in the fourth quarter. Topera provides Abbott with a foundational entry in the $3 billion fast growing electrophysiology markets. Its breakthrough technology can transform how physicians treat people with complex heart rhythm disorders. Our vascular business increased 1.7% in the quarter representing a sequential improvement versus the third quarter of 2014 and somewhat above our previous guidance. In our structural heart business we continue to see strong double-digits sales growth of MitraClip, our breakthrough technology for the treatment of mitral regurgitation. Our endovascular business also generated double-digits growth in the quarter driven by our Supera peripheral stent for the superficial femoral artery or SFA. In November, we presented long term Supera data that demonstrate a very strong freedom from target lesion revascularization rate of 94% at three years. In the first quarter we launched our new drug-eluting stent system XIENCE Alpine, in the US. XIENCE Alpine is the only drug-eluting stent with an indication to treat chronic total occlusions. We've recently received XIENCE Alpine regulatory approval in Japan and expect to launch in the next few months following reimbursement approval. We are also making regulatory progress with our bioresorbable vascular scaffold ABSORB, which we expect to submit for approval in the U.S., China and Japan by the end of this year. These three geographies represent more than 50% of the world's coronary stent market. For the full year and first quarter 2015 we expect sales in our global vascular business to increase modestly on an operational basis. In diabetes care, global sales in the fourth quarter were down mid single-digits in line with our expectations as the rate of decline in the U.S. is moderate following the U.S. reimbursement changes that were enacted in the middle of 2013. Outside the United States, we launched our revolutionary new glucose testing technology, FreeStyle Libre, direct to consumers. With the launch of FreeStyle Libre, we expect our global diabetes business to return to low single-digit growth on an operational basis in 2015. For the first quarter we're also forecasting low single-digits operational sales growth in our diabetes care business. In medical optics sales increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter and 8.5% for the full year. Sales of our cataract products which represent approximately 70% of our medical optics business increased high single-digits globally in the quarter. This growth is partially offset by market declines in the refracted and corneal segments of the medical optics business. In 2015 we look forward to multiple new product launches across a number of key geographies as well as continued penetration of our CATALYS laser cataract system. The first of these new products, our TECNIS multifocal Low Add premium intraocular lens, which provides more range of vision options to patients and surgeons will soon launch in the U.S. For the full year 2015 we expect our global medical optics business to grow mid to high single-digits on an operational basis with more to mid single-digit growth in the first quarter. And lastly, our established pharmaceuticals business, or EPD, where sales from continuing operations excluding the developed market branded generics pharmaceuticals business, increased strong double-digitss in the quarter. As Miles mentioned, we completed the acquisitions of CFR and Veropharm last year, but at the same time generated strong underlying performance from our EPD emerging market business. Excluding the sales contributions from acquisitions, organic sales increased nearly 9.5% in the quarter. This performance was driven by double-digitss sales growth across several emerging geographies including India, Russia and China. For the full year 2015 we expect continued strong double-digit growth in EPD on an operational basis including the impact of acquisitions as this business continues to expand product portfolios in key therapeutic areas, implements new branding initiatives across the portfolio, and increases its focus on marketing to the pharmacy channels. Excluding the contributions from our acquisitions made in 2014 we expect high single-digit operational sales growth in EPD for the full year 2015. For the first quarter we're also forecasting strong double-digits growth in EPD on an operational basis including the impact of acquisitions. So in summary, we achieved our expectations in 2014. Sales growth improved sequentially every quarter this year. We exceeded our earnings per share expectations. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 200 basis points and we completed several actions to continue to position Abbott for durable growth. As we look ahead to 2015, we are well positioned to deliver sequential improvement in operational sales growth and another year of top gear earning per share growth. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Michael Weinstein : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions guys. Let me touch maybe on two topics. So the first and Tom could you talk a little bit more about FX, the impact on 2015 and how should we think about your ability to manage through additional dollar strengthening going forward? Tom Freyman : I pretty much covered that in my remarks. You know, we talked about 6% based on current rates on the top line and there's about 10% headwind on our earnings growth year-over-year. Historically as I have told you that follow us know within any one year we've done a pretty good job of managing through what I call normal fluctuations in currency and really it has not affected our performance against our expectations and going forward from this point, something in the major moves have happened. We would expect something similar in 2015. I think what everyone has seen in this season is that there are limits that there are major, major moves, but I'd say anything within the normal levels of fluctuations, we continue to do what we've done in the past. Miles White : Mike, I would add to that. We may have an unusual mix of currencies relative to what multinationals, for us for example, the euro is not an impact because we just happen to have enough cost, manufacturing, and other things in Europe that it pretty much self hedges. So, as we look forward at the year, we're not more uncertain currencies might be to euro that won't affect us. We're pretty protected on that. And a rather back handed I guess bit a good fortune I don\u2019t really accept the Rubel to impact us very much because it already did and it already impacted us pretty significantly in 2014. So when we look forward at the particular currencies that are most likely you know to be volatile or might have risk and I have no corner on crystal ball here to know what\u2019s going to happen certainly no one would have projected any of things that happened this last year. I think that we are likely or possibly going to see volatility in FX we are in a pretty good position. And so we don\u2019t anticipate it impacting us like a good thumb and we have already had the impact for PN and others and observe that and we are going to the year with a little bit of cushion and contingencies just in case. So I think we are probably in good places we have ever been in spite of how heavy headwind is of FX in general for all countries. Michael Weinstein : The strategic question you exit 2014 with the underlying businesses in really good shape obviously not all pieces are doing as well as you would like, but not aggregate and it looks very strong, obviously a lot stronger than it did 12, 18 months ago. So what are the strategic priorities and in particularly in the context of your balance sheet and what is your balance sheet could like so that you monetize your mile to take over the next several months? Miles White : Well I assume that course would come up at some point. My first priority is to get the deal closed and you may know that there are several concludes today, but we've had some really good news here in the last week in terms of your approval for the deal and so forth. So I expect to get that closed pretty quickly here. You know I don\u2019t want to forecast where or what we might be looking at our considering. I do want to add that to business. I do want to add to the company in places where we either want to expand our footprint or can certainly expand the strength of our footprint you know that telegraphing where that might be, I mean as you know I don\u2019t if telegraphs post things ahead a time and yet we have been pretty consistent at the kinds of things we are interested in. I think we got a lot of capacity and you know presuming that everything concludes properly here with our mile and transaction we have got a lot of flexibility and a lot of capacity and I think I want to make good strategic deals that are prudent. I think that a little more difficulty these days. It's not difficult to be prudent. It's difficult to find a lot of good opportunities and if it fit a lot of price tags up there have very ambitious expectation and I don\u2019t think it has rich robust and emanating environment as we see in other years. But having said that I would like to still see plenty of opportunities for us to expand and add to the business and just question of right timing, right receptivity on the other side, great values, and finance some overlap. The good news is I think you want to really add to a sound foundation. And you know, sometimes if you do MNA to patch you know something that\u2019s not working in the core of the company then they will always work that well and we have a lot of disintegration to get through here separating from ABT pretty much concluded get in close. We have got the same thing where we can work through on the EPD develop market business. You know your organization ready for the integration of whatever you have made do have a bigger or small it may be and I think we are in a good place were the underlying performance where all the businesses is really good. You are right there is places that I would rather see better commercial performance, but overall very stable and some organization have the other task and distractions pretty much concluded so we could not be more ready and position better with good strong balance sheet. Having said that I know it does not give you any sort of indication of where, what, and when etc, but we are obviously looking something. Michael Weinstein : And Mile a comment about targets ideally with the cash you are going to have outside the U.S. in the balance sheet as an ideal target would be outside the U.S. and other low shortage of target for you outside the US do you see opportunities there? Miles White : I see a lot of targets outside the US. A lot of them have a very high valuation and expectations that are you know I think a little unrealistic in some cases, but you know on the grand scheme of things that is just negotiation. I think there is a lot of I think the external next to the U.S. is in a fashion not quite target rich, but there is a lot of that can be done to expand our business and our presence in a number of key countries. I don\u2019t rule out the U.S. I think that there is still opportunity in U.S. it's just a lot more selective and obviously financially speaking it\u2019s a lot easier to build cash that\u2019s outside the U.S., where there is a going to be a lot of and that\u2019s a lot easier. You know under today\u2019s tax regimen so it's more -- probably a more attractive environment and a lot of our monitoring and you know hunting if you will is outside the U.S. The good news is we have been in these countries outside the U.S. a long time. And we know them reasonably well. You know a lot of cases the kinds of businesses that we are interested in outside the US or family owner or family sponsored a little different environment in the U.S. or European markets, but we are comfortable there. We are comfortable navigating there. We have had a fair amount of experience there and that is a plus, plus. I think during the last couple of years we have been accomplish some pretty unique and unusual acquisitions I think it was pretty unusual particularly given that we were well into it when the Ukraine issues happened and made it more difficult and I would say, I would path CFO for us to go and back here for having the presence of mind to do this deal in Rubles. So we were not exposed to exchange on that particular deal. I think it\u2019s a fabulous deal for us long term in Russia and that\u2019s an important market for us and we anticipated that we did not wish for and the evaluation of Rubles we were prepared for it. So I think there is a number of places where there is opportunities for outside the U.S., but there aren\u2019t necessarily that\u2019s is visible to U.S. investors or U.S. analysts I know you know that, but there is a lot out there that enhances what we are trying to do with the business and what we believe the growth opportunities are where we can leverage the already existing infrastructure we have. Michael Weinstein : Perfect. Thank you. Mile. I will let some others jump in. Operator : Thank you our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If we could just focus on the margins and the underlying performance, what stands out the most to me is just the guidance in terms of the EPS being up 8.5% at the midpoint despite a 10% FX head wind. Can you maybe just walk through the confidence in the underlying margin expansion, and then also just touch on the fourth-quarter gross margin because that came in much better than we were anticipating. Miles White : I\u2019ll make a couple of comments about it Kristen. I\u2019ll hand it over to Tom for little more color here. First of all I think we got, we had a head start here, because with the separation of FB as we have said in past calls we took a very comprehensive look at our G&A costs and our underlying costs in manufacturing and other things across the company and we have initiatives in all of our divisions pointed at that for some time and we have had some very good success with improvement of costs and improvement of expenses in the company in a variety of ways. And I highlighted nutrition and diagnostics as to that standout where we have tremendous improvement in underlying cost structure. The unfortunate thing is that given the exchange rates that multinational have experienced from on and so forth some of that has been chewed up or at least that improvement in our costs and expense structure has protected us from erosion from exchange and it continues to. Ideally we want to keep improving those costs overtime, which we believe we can, but the biggest costs we have had, has been exchanged and I don\u2019t think that you do see in the top line. The good news is in a lot of cases we have cost structure and our expense structure distributed among the countries where we have the high sales and profit and so it does offset to some degree the impact of exchange on the sales line. And what we will see is when it hurts the sales line it improves the gross margin. It is just offsetting so part of the improvement that you have seen in our gross margin is being in the right places when exchange so that we can mitigate the impact on our profits and we got a big head start on that two years ago when we splint. So we have been well prepared to sort of observe what's happening and it would have been our intent to have much higher earnings but in fact it has observed the impact and kept as a performance level that\u2019s really good, but we could have hoped for more had it not been for that. Tom do you want to give some more color on that. Tom Freyman : I\u2019ll just add a couple of things recall when we announced the ETD develop market transaction, we said that the underlying growth have rate of ABT was about 2% better on a continuing operations basis and once before so certainly that is giving a little more rooms to our growth than what you might have expected. I think the other thing and it\u2019s a really all about the manufacturing margin, there are gross margin that Miles alluded to. The last two years we have had relatively flat gross margin and what we have been saying is that has been in spite of the really strong costs improvement programs Miles talked about because the currency was hurting our gross margin, but that was because the year was strong and that was keeping our costs for that particular large manufacturing cost base up pretty high. But now the year was moving with the other currencies and the real benefit of the real actions in our manufacturing plants and our operations people are really starting to show through the gross margin now that the Euro is matching where the other currencies are going in direction line. So I think those are a couple of differences that really are the bases for our relatively stronger EPS growth rate in '15 than you might be seeing from other companies. Miles White : Make no mistake. If weren\u2019t all of us facing some of the currency headwinds earnings would be even stronger. Kristen Stewart : And I guess just in light of all the portfolio moves how do you look at longer-term growth? Do you feel very well positioned in the mid to high single digit and it certainly sounds like double-digit EPS growth forecast? Miles White : Well its always our intent to be in that range and do better and I feel pretty good about that, I say this would caution because I would not have predicted the things that happened in the latter half of the year in 2014 and I don\u2019t think there is many people that would have predicted what happened in 2014 toward the end of the year either in what happened with the price of oil, what happened with interest rates, what happened with exchange rates, etcetera. so that\u2019s it all things be equal. Tom Freyman : Yes I expect that we can maintain healthy high single digit sales growth rate and double digit bottom line growth rate that\u2019s our intense, that\u2019s are goal, we think that\u2019s kind of identity and expectations of a company and so every year at every LRP, every long range plan is sort of built around the expectation of maintenance of that and we have always got sort of long term view of where we believe those growth and share opportunities are. And I say so far so good I don\u2019t see any reason to accept less. Kristen Stewart : And just to clarify you said high single digit sales or mid to high. Miles White : Mid to high. To be clear. I am always pushing for more in reality today mid is pretty good and I can remember when mid was a disaster and today mid looks pretty good and I guess if the market, the world, all of us are doing well then everything looks good, but I think we target that range. If we steadily or in that mid to high range we are going to be targeting high. And if we are steadily in the high range we are going to be targeting double. It's going to be always wanting to do a little better than may be a lot better than what the market gives you. Kristen Stewart : Prefect. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. David Roman : Thank you. Good morning everybody. I wanted to start on the U.S. as obviously markets outside the United States were very strong for you in the quarter. But maybe you could just talk a little bit broadly about your U.S. franchises, particularly in the context of what looks to have been a better operating environment domestically, whether it's what we are seeing out of the hospitals or some of the other volume-related companies. How do you think about the evolution of your US franchise in 2015 and beyond? Miles White : I think the U.S. first of all very important market, it's such a big market. It's our largest market and three of our major business are large and important here. And one the established pharmaceutical business is not here at all in U.S. I would say it's interesting to me, most shareholders and analyst that I listen to today or hear from will tell me the US is better relative to what. I don\u2019t think that the health care environment or health care products companies in the U.S. are that much better to be honest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a robust market. I think it\u2019s a reaction to the kind of sudden volatility that lot of companies have experienced outside the U.S. and we tend to like predictability in this country and we tend to like our predictability in quarterly doses. But I look at the market for long term and I think what the U.S. is a health market, it\u2019s important for products, but I don\u2019t consider it in our businesses a particularly robust growth market and that means as we look at the U.S. our expectations to be in good single digit range and remain profitable and health here, but the real growth even this volatile market a worldwide is outside the U.S. For I think for health care products, for pharmaceuticals, for devices, for the products that were in I think the growth rates are much better outside the US, we just have to navigate the volatility of that means. And in that case there is probably 15 countries around the world may be 20 depending on what company you are that are important in varying degrees as growth opportunities market development opportunities etc and if those economies are developing or recovering as the case may be, I think the underlying fundamentals of growth of those market succeed the U.S. That doesn\u2019t mean the U.S. is best. I think the U.S. is better than it has been, but it has not been particularly good, so better is easy, it's a little hurdle and while we say the U.S. is more solid today, I think the U.S. today is in certainly a growth market it\u2019s just a lot more stable and predictable than a lot of markets around the world. Do you guys want to add to that? Tom Freyman : No I\u2019ll just say, even as we look at 2015, where in currency side again we are looking growth rates you know 2 to 3 4X what the US is and it underscores minus points that\u2019s where the growth is, but we do see improvements in some of our U.S. businesses in 2015. Diagnostics is continued to be a pretty good performance relative to the lower growth market and you ADC is now moving better into better territory and we do ask them to new product activity in vascular which can help you grow-up from slow growth market and things like MitraClip and Supera, and XIENCE Alpine are going to help us do a little better in that business in 2015. But the relative growth rate I just tackle with what Mile said there is no comparison and that\u2019s why we have pursued and invested more in these higher growth markets. Miles White : I\u2019ll say what is coming in the US and its frankly is a good for any company around the world in any country, but here in the U.S. you are not going to get a lot of tailwind growth. So you better be prepared to innovate and slug it up for share. And you got to look it at that way that you got win, you got to be the competitor, you cannot just take a tailwind. We got keep improving our products and got to keep putting up better products and gain our share that way. The thing I am heartened by is when I look across all of our business in the vision in their R&D pipeline and the products that are bringing whether are incremental innovation or may be substantial innovation like Libre in our diabetes care business they are really good products and they really will make a difference and they really will drive share gain and growth. That actually I look forward to as a real positive here for the next two to five years as we keep bringing out more and more new products. It keeps us and makes us more competitive in markets like the US. Frankly the reverse side of that is in markets where you got a tailwind of growth. You tend be a sharp in terms of competitiveness because you are getting that tailwind growth and it\u2019s actually a health for us to be both ways and we will get the benefit of our new products and new innovations in all markets. David Roman : Okay, that's a helpful perspective. Maybe just a follow-up on some of the questions around M&A and strategic vision here. I think the language that you have used in the past couple calls is looking at Reshape Abbott in 2014 was obviously a busy year in that regard. Can you maybe give us some more perspective on Reshape Abbott into what? What is the long-term vision here given all the moving parts? Are we looking at this as a four-legged stool for a sustainable period of time? Is the mix of business one that makes sense? Ultimately when you are done with that reshaping, what do you want Abbott to look like? Miles White : I want the foundation we have got. I like the four legged that we have that we want to describe on this four legs. We talked off and on from time to time about whether something is truly a fifth leg or whether a leg four current structure for example. A lot of people would not necessarily see the brand and generic pharmaceutical business than they are efficient business as related, but truthfully oversees they go through all the same channel, they go through the same wholesales, they go through the same retail outlet, they go through the same pharmaceutical or pharmacies and so forth. And so they are spreading they are very consumer facing in the markets and targets we focused on and so there is a lot of call it brand synergy and customer synergy and consumer synergy among them. So those are plusses for us. And we are not in - although than non nutrition business and in a way our brand of generic business we are not fully in the OTC business. But I will use it as a wide example, because, if someone brings me in a opportunity here that say, look, it\u2019s got this - by the way, it\u2019s got OTC, which is rejected with the OTC. Well you know I wouldn\u2019t in some countries. Does that mean I'm looking for that in order to try to compete with P&G in the U.S., no, I'm not, but if in a country like India, where the overlap of OTX, OTC branded generic Pharma and nutrition is such, that that was a extension opportunity, it would strategically fit really well with our infrastructure in India. So I would say kind of the pen, and I think we\u2019re much stronger when we can add to businesses we already know and already understand the operating models and know how we can leverage both the business, the brands infrastructure et cetera, much like we are -- we see it far in Latin America. I want to be cautious not to roll out opportunities that I think are long term expansions for us. I look at medical optics. When we made that acquisition number of years ago, well there was some criticism that -- gee, that's far afield for you. It isn\u2019t, it\u2019s not a nice strong growth drive for us what I would add to it, I would. If I see the right opportunities, and the right circumstances, so I think the related businesses here, they all have a couple of things in common. They are all in growing markets. They are all innovation driven. They are all durable. They are durable in terms of growth rates and I compare that to the funnel business that we used to be. Pharma it\u2019s a fabulous business. If you get all the way to the finish line and launch the product, and it\u2019s a risky business, it\u2019s a science so risky with pharmaceuticals. And so it\u2019s a different business model. Without the pharmaceutical business that particular pharmaceutical business which has been tremendously successful separate from Abbott, we are more of a durable growth company. A lot of people would interpret durable a number of different ways. I think at least mid to high single digit growth I think it\u2019s not particularly volatile in terms of patterns exploration and so forth although it might benefit from IPU like our wise business doing. But it\u2019s got a certain stability to it but also growth and innovation driven. And I think that the long term identity of Abbott has been to be growth, to be relatively reliable to be real growth and to return cash et cetera to shareholders as it grows. And that\u2019s been the identity of the company for a long time. I think the mix of countries and products that were in delivers that identity without a lot of harsh volatility. And I think an example would be the environment we\u2019re in right now. If we can weather 2014 and 2015 with what\u2019s happening in the world economies and in the world markets and so forth, and deliver the results we\u2019re delivering, I think we are absolutely living up to the identity of a very reliable durable profitable growth company. And that\u2019s what this mix of business is, a mix of geographies does. And I think it\u2019s a bit of unique that way. But I think that\u2019s the intent of what we are trying to do whether there is room for a fifth or sixth leg in there, I think it depends. And I think we take our opportunities as they come, we know what we\u2019re good at, we know what we\u2019re not good at or don\u2019t know about. If we\u2019re looking at some acquisition, or business to add to the company, my first question is, can we add to it? And so we do better because it\u2019s in our hand and I think that\u2019s a critical threshold for us to hold ourselves to as we invest shareholder money. David Roman : Thank you. I appreciate all the perspective and congrats on a good quarter and first start to 2015. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Good morning. I just want to come back to guidance for a quick second. I think the numbers were largely in line with many expectations. But the revenue outlook has been, I think, more bullish this morning. And I think the stock is reacting to that. Either for Miles or Tom or Brian, thinking about this year, if you can get acceleration, you have more difficult comps versus 2014 as the business improved in the back half of 2014. We talked a lot about emerging market currency but there may be emerging market weakness investors are concerned about. So, the first question is just what provides the confidence that you can get that incremental acceleration and be very confident in that revenue number? Is it products, is it specific segments? And where does that momentum reside that even in the face of EM and the face of strengthening comps you feel pretty confident that you can deliver this top-line number. And then I have a quick follow up. Miles Whit : Let me give a couple of comments and I'll hand it back to Brian and Tom to add. There is a number of moving parts here. The first thing that I would say is, we look at the underlying growth of the businesses, some of them are very strong, stronger than you might see, some countries have stabilized and turned more positive - India as an example when it has last year. So there is some underlying strengths here that comes from a variety of sources, number one. Number two, and there is still somewhat I like to see do better. Number two, there is the lapping of various events or uneven miss in the quarterly reporting. So for example, you recall last year in the first half of the year we were lapping a recall from the prior year which surpassed the first and second quarter of 2014, which enhances the comparison for 2015. So we\u2019ve got some of that up and down in here as well. We have the launch of some new products. We have two acquisitions in here that weren\u2019t there before that particularly effect the last half of the year CFR and Veropharm. There will be two subtractions from the company which will also effect that quarter-over-quarter comparison established from developed market business will be out of the mix. So when you change the mix of the pieces and the growth rates of the various pieces, when it all comes together, it actually looks like what we forecasted and makes sense. It\u2019s just there is a lot of moving parts and I think it probably is not that easy for investors to tease those apart, put them back together and so what it all will -- and I'm very confident in it. Brian Yoor : David, this is Brian. And I would say, just as like foreign exchange, I think what\u2019s going on in the companies, definitely in different ways. You take for example what\u2019s going in with respect to the price of oil. There were actually countries who benefit from this and you see that pass all the way down through their GDP and also way to the consumer. And as Miles talked about being a more consumer base company, clearly this has planned out very nicely in the countries for example of China and India who are net importers of oil, we are seeing very good performance by our nutrition business particularly with the launch of the products Similac QINTI that I referenced, as well as Eleva. Recall, we just turned on promotion there towards the end of 2014 and I would add that China as well, we\u2019ve not only recovered to baseline, we\u2019ve gone beyond share. So for all signs pointing positive there. Miles Whit : David let me add one more thing to it. Clearly under the circumstances in the last four weeks when so many companies have identified the currency risk that everybody is feeling and the currency hit that everybody feeling and the oil sand that many are feeling and the impact of that on tertiary markets and so forth. A lot of people are necessarily to report that\u2019s it going to impact their business. And with all that different business, in that environment I would have to say it\u2019s tempting to reset the bar lower. We look at that and said no, we are not going to reset our bar lower, it\u2019s not because it\u2019s hard for us to stretch to do it, if you want to be transparently reliable growth company as we are and we are already dealing with, always adjusting educating our investors about the variety of emerging markets when and so forth. I think it is important for us to be true of what we are going to do and this is what we think we\u2019re going to do. I mean there was a temptation that, buy a little conservatism here, and estimate lower and beat. We may bit anyway but I didn\u2019t want to take that opportunities to set lower so I'm confident in these numbers, I'm confident in the earnings projection, I think our mix is different than others, I think as I pointed out earlier, we are just not vulnerable to the euro and a lot of companies are. And based on the forecast there, I don\u2019t have the same issues. So our earnings turn out where they are. David Lewis : Okay. Just one quick question. I am loathe to ask another balance sheet M&A question but I am just going to ask it and hate myself the rest of the week. Miles, one of the hallmarks of how you approached M&A was to basically fix exposure. You have obviously had this nutritional asset, which is great exposure. You've increased your exposure to the part of the pharmaceutical business that you want and decreased your exposure to the part you didn't want. I wonder if you can talk about the consumer more broadly. Is getting access or getting exposure to the consumer, or steam, or something we could expect out of the company in coming quarters and years? Miles White : Yes, but for reasons different than just exposure to the consumer, I would say we've intentionally wanted to change the mix of the company to outsource sales and profit etcetera that wasn\u2019t necessarily as reliant on government reimbursement. We wanted a greater mix of patient pay or consumer pay and I would rather ride with the consumer markets than ride with the volatility of say Europe where it's heavily, heavily reimbursement driven and given the economic issues that most European countries in the EU faces, you are at the whim of the next stroke of the pen to cut prices. So wanted a different mix and we wanted a different geographic mix, we wanted a different balance in how much we're reliant on payers, how much we're reliant on government and how much we're reliant on the consumer or the patient themselves. So that drove some of the choice around geography and/or business areas that we believe make up a durable growth company. We also find that the predictable growth in profitability of countries that are -- or businesses that are more patient pay is frankly more reliable than those that at least for us are susceptible to reimbursement cuts etcetera. So it doesn\u2019t mean we don't want to in countries that are reimbursement driven, we do. It's a matter of balance. It's a matter of mix. It's a matter of timing have it but not too much. Brian Yoor : Okay. We'll have time for one more question operator please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Just a couple quick clarification questions for Tom, and then one product-related question from Miles. On EPS, I just wanted to confirm, the FX hit, the 10 percentage point hit. So, at the midpoint constant currency would be about 235, Tom? Tom Freyman : Yes 10% of our $0.20, so that's part right Larry. Larry Biegelsen : And then the contribution from acquisitions implied in the high single-digit constant currency growth for 2015, we have about 4%. Tom Freyman : Closer to 3.5% Larry. Larry Biegelsen : 3.5%. Okay. And that includes, that's net of divestitures, Tom? Larry Biegelsen : Divestitures are already out of the numbers because of our continuing operation. So that should be comparable between the years. Larry Biegelsen : Got it. Then just lastly for me, Miles, on Libre, if you could talk about your excitement for that product, how big you think it can be, and your long-term strategy in atrial fibrillation, a new market for you. I am sure people would be interested to hear your long-term strategy there. Thanks. Miles White : Okay. First of all on Libre, I am excited about the product. I think it's a great innovation a great product. I think we've had really good customer response and I guess our challenge right now is capacity expansion. And I would say that's the limiting factor for us quicker, faster, sooner than we expected and so the organizations kept the blow torch going to expand capacity because I think that product particularly as word of mouth spreads among patients is going to be very strong. I am frustrated with the pace of regulatory approval in the U.S., but nevertheless right now we know the capacity anyways. So it's open to a really good reception in Europe and I expect it's going to be a real positive product for us in that sector. On the electrophysiology front I don't want to create higher expectations there because everybody is going to tell me we're entering land of the giants and so forth. I think it's a great segment. I think there is a lot of opportunity for advancement of technology there to make a real and improved impact on the treatment of the patient. People see it as a $3 billion market today. I think it's going to be a bigger market a much bigger market over time and I think there is a lot of room for technology innovation there. We've invested in not only to play but a number of other companies from an equity standpoint to bring along and we have a long term view of how we want to play in that market which I don't want to detail here. But we're going to take a run at it and see what can be accomplished there. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Thank you, operator and thank you all for your questions and that concludes Abbott's conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 AM Central Time today on Abbott\u2019s Investor Relations website at www.abbottinvestor.com and after 11 :00 AM Central Time via telephone at 203-369-0489 pass code 5311.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations. Brian Yoor : Okay, good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today maybe forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2015. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1(a), Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that first quarter and guidance provided today on the call for sales, earnings per share and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. In today's conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay, thanks Brian, good morning everybody. I will be brief this morning and leave some time for questions. Our first-quarter performance exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines and we reported double-digit operational sales growth, exceeded both our gross and operating margin targets in the quarter, closed on the sale of our EPD developed markets business to Mylan and launched a number of new products across our portfolio. I will summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Tom and Brian for some further detail. Operational sales increased 10% in the quarter with particularly strong performance in our branded generics, international, nutrition and global diagnostics businesses as well as double-digit growth in emerging markets and that did include the additions of CFR and Veropharm. While currency was a factor, including a 7% negative impact on the top line, we continue to manage through its effect on the bottom line. Our first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.47 exceeds our previous guidance range and reflects growth of 38%, but again as I said that includes the addition of CFR and Veropharm in comparisons. Our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.10 to $2.20 remains unchanged and reflects double-digit underlying growth, excluding the impact of currency. So in the quarter starting with nutrition, sales increased more than 6% with continued double-digit growth outside of the United States. The new pediatric products that we have launched into China and other fast growing geographies are continuing to perform well. Products like Similac QINTI and Eleva, and we have got strong performance in the online segment. These new products drive share expansion and contribute to our growth in the market. The international adult nutrition business has consistently delivered high single digit to double-digit sales growth. Our adult nutritional Ensure is roughly a $2 billion brand globally today, and we launched it into the retail segment in China earlier this year. In March, we also opened a nutrition pilot plant in Singapore. This facility in addition to the others there allows us to customize more of our products to meet consumer preferences across Asia. In medical devices, diabetes care returned to growth this quarter as we expected. We have had a very positive early response to the launch of our new FreeStyle Libre device. As I mentioned last quarter we are already expanding capacity to meet this demand. Libre is a highly differentiated technology that helps people self-manage their diabetes without the need for routine fingersticks. We are also building a portfolio of products based on our sensor technology and FreeStyle Libre Pro is our first professional use device that was launched in India earlier this month. Our vascular business also performed in line with our expectations. Operational sales growth in the quarter was driven by high single digit performance of our endovascular products, as well as double-digit growth of our structural heart product, MitraClip. The market opportunity for mitral regurgitation is significant, but still in its early stages and MitraClip is the only product on the market to date that can treat this disease in a minimally invasive way. In medical optics, sales were impacted by market dynamics in our cataract and LASIK businesses. We recently launched two new cataract lenses and saw a pickup in our cataract lens growth as the quarter progressed. In diagnostics, we delivered 6% growth in the quarter. The continued success of our commercial strategies with core laboratory customers are driving share gains in the US and emerging markets. We continue to invest in the development of next-generation system platforms across all three of our diagnostics businesses. In point-of-care diagnostics, sales increased double digits. In the US we have had success with large healthcare networks, standardizing our point-of-care testing with our i-STAT system. Outside the US, our expansion efforts continue in both developed and emerging geographies. In established pharmaceuticals we\u2019re executing better commercially. That is something that I have given a fair amount of attention to on past calls with you. We are expanding our product portfolios in our therapeutic area of focus \u2013 areas of focus and driving more awareness of our Abbott brand with consumers, physicians and pharmacists. Excluding the benefit from our recent acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm, sales in our key emerging markets increased in low double-digit with above market growth in India, Brazil, China, Russia, and Colombia. With the sale of the developed markets business to Mylan completed in February, EPD is now focused solely on emerging markets. We received 110 million shares of Mylan stock for the developed markets business, and recently sold roughly a third of our position. The net proceeds from the sale of Mylan shares and our strong balance sheet provide us with additional flexibility to invest in strategic growth opportunities to continue to shape Abbott for long-term growth. So in summary we reported first-quarter results ahead of our expectations. We are building on the momentum we had exiting 2014, and we expect high single-digit full year operational sales growth and continued progress on margin expansion, and we are well on track to achieve our financial objectives in 2015. I will now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss our first quarter results in more detail. Tom? Tom Freyman : Thanks Miles. AsMiles indicated, today we reported first-quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.47, above our previous guidance range and reflecting growth of 38%. Sales for the quarter increased 10% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact of 7% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased to 3% in the quarter. Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in nutritional, diagnostics, and established pharmaceuticals, which included the impact of 2014 acquisitions. Sales in emerging markets increased strong double digits in the quarter. First-quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.1% of sales, somewhat above our forecast and up nearly 500 basis points over the first quarter of 2014. The year-over-year comparison was driven by gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses and in part the comparison relative to an unusually low ratio experienced in the first quarter 2014. In the quarter, adjusted R&D investments was around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expenses were around 34.5% of sales. The over delivery in the first quarter EPS compared to our guidance was in part the result of the dynamics of exchange on our results, including the timing effects of hedging activity on the exchange gain loss line of the P&L. We expect the first quarter favorability on this line of the P&L to partially reverse in the second quarter, with remaining net gains for the year to be offset on the operating income line of the P&L over the last three quarters. As we discussed last quarter, while the weaker euro impacts our top line, movements in the euro have a minimal impact on our bottom line due to our euro denominated cost base. Therefore the further weakening of the Euro that we saw in the first quarter of the year does not impact our 2015 EPS forecast. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2015, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 from continuing operations remains unchanged. Regarding our full year 2015 outlook for the P&L, we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the high single digits. Based on current exchange rates we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 7% on our full year reported sales, up over our previous projected in January of around 6%. This should result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2015. Brian will provide more details on the 2015 outlook by business in a few minutes. We now forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57.5% of sales for the full year driven by gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and now forecast an adjusted SG&A expense of around 31.5% of sales. Overall we continue to expect to expand our full year adjusted operating margin by over 100 basis points in 2015. We now forecast net interest expense of around $120 million, reflecting changes in the interest rate assumptions on both our debt and some of our investment. We forecast an exchange gain of approximately $35 million on the exchange gain loss line in the P&L for the full year, reflecting some reversal of the favorability we saw on this line in the first quarter as mentioned previously, and we forecast around $5 million of non-operating expense for the full year 2015. Turning to the outlook for the second quarter, we forecast ongoing EPS of $0.49 to $0.51, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, largely offset by the impact of segment foreign exchange headwind on operating results as discussed on the January call, as well as the partial reversal of favorability in the exchange gain loss line of the P&L from the first quarter as previously mentioned. We forecast operational sales growth in the low double digits in the second quarter. At current exchange rates, we would expect the negative impact from exchange of somewhat above 8%, resulting in reported sales in the low single digits. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales in the second quarter. We forecast net interest expense of around $35 million and approximately $15 million in expense on the exchange gain loss line of the P&L. Finally we project specified items of $0.23 in the second quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release. So in summary, our full year ongoing EPS guidance remains unchanged. As we start the year, we are well positioned to deliver another year of strong EPS growth in 2015 despite a challenging currency environment. And with that I will turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Brian? Brian Yoor : Thanks Tom. This morning I will review our first quarter 2015 performance and second-quarter sales outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I will start with our nutrition business, where global sales increased more than 6% in the first quarter. In our international pediatric nutrition business, sales increased to 11.7% driven by double-digit growth in China and Latin America. We continued to capture market share with new infant formula products we launched into the fast-growing market segments and geographies over the past year. This includes Similac QINTI and Eleva, which we launched into the premium infant formula market segment in China in 2014. International adult nutrition sales increased nearly 11% in the quarter driven by strong double-digit growth in Latin America. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in our international adult nutrition business. We continued to expand the adult nutrition category internationally, and recently launched our Ensure brand in China into the retail market segment, which represents a significant growth opportunity for Abbott. We also continued to expand our local presence in key markets. As Miles mentioned, in addition to the three manufacturing plants we opened last year in China, India and the US, we announced in March the opening of a new nutrition pilot plant in Singapore. The state of the art facility will serve as a second global R&D hub. In the US, pediatric nutrition sales were up 4.5% driven by market share gains in the non-WIC segment of the infant formula market, and double-digit Pedialyte growth as a result of the strong flu season. Adults nutrition sales in the US were impacted by competitive and market dynamics, including softness in the institutional segment. We expect a modest improvement in the US adult nutrition sales growth over the course of the year as we launch new products. For the second quarter we are forecasting mid to high single digit growth on an operational basis in our global nutritional business, driven by a continued double-digit operational sales growth in international nutrition. In our diagnostics business, sales increased 6% in the first quarter with double-digit sales growth in emerging markets. Core laboratory diagnostic sales increased 4.7% in the quarter. This above market growth was driven by strong growth in our core laboratory segment as this business continues to increase its win rate and gain share with its customer focused solutions. The US growth was impacted by a comparison to a strong first quarter of last year when sales increased double digits driven by higher blood screening sales. Last week we announced a partnership agreement with the number one coagulation company in Japan to provide coagulation testing solutions to core laboratories worldwide. This partnership broadens our diagnostics offering to meet our customers\u2019 needs and to deliver high quality results in an efficient workflow as part of Abbott\u2019s total solutions. Coagulation testing is approximately a $2 billion market segment of the in vitro diagnostics market that is growing in the mid-single digits. In molecular diagnostics, sales increased 7.4% in the quarter driven by growth of our core business segment, infectious disease testing. Growth was also favorably impacted this quarter by the timing of tenders in emerging markets. In Europe, we are early into the launch of our IRIDICA, infectious disease testing platform, which helps identify serious infections such as sepsis. For the second quarter we expect relatively flat growth in our molecular diagnostics business as we project growth of the infectious disease business to be offset by the declines in our non-core oncology and genetics businesses. In point of care diagnostics worldwide sales increased 15.5% with double-digit growth in both the US and internationally as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted developed and emerging markets. Strong growth in the quarter was driven by continued performance in the large hospital segment, as well as continued adoption in the physician office laboratory and ambulatory setting, where small portable solutions such as Abbott i-STAT help improve efficiencies. For the second quarter, we expect our global diagnostics business to generate mid-single digit operational sales growth. In medical devices, sales in our vascular business increased 2% in the quarter. Sales of our MitraClip product for the treatment of mitral regurgitation increased strong double digits in the quarter, both in the US and internationally. Last month we presented data that reinforces MitraClip\u2019s ability to reduce mitral regurgitation and improve a person\u2019s overall health and that supports further adoption of this device. Our endovascular business continues to have momentum with sales growing high single digits in the quarter driven by strong growth in our base business, including vessel closure, as well as our peripheral stent, Supera. And in our drug eluting portfolio in the US we have gained sequential market share following the XIENCE Alpine launch. XIENCE alpine is the only drug eluting stent with an indication to treat chronic total occlusions. We have also recently announced the launch of XIENCE Alpine in Japan. For the second quarter, we expect sales in our global vascular business to increase low single digits on an operational basis. In diabetes care, global sales in the first quarter increased nearly 3% as this business returned to growth after lapping the impact of US reimbursement changes. Outside of the US, strong consumer and physician adoption of our revolutionary new glucose sensing technology, FreeStyle Libre, has exceeded our initial expectations driven by a successful direct to consumer campaign. We continued to expand FreeStyle Libre to new geographies. Earlier this month, we announced the launch in India of FreeStyle Libre Pro for professional use. Libre Pro uses the same sensor based technology as our consumer focused FreeStyle Libre product and helps doctors obtain the comprehensive data they need to make treatment decisions. India is a logical target market for Libre Pro because there was a large diabetes population, but self monitoring of blood glucose is not a common practice. In the US we have and will continue to segment our products and our commercial strategies to drive profitable growth. And last week we announced the launch of FreeStyle Precision Neo, a new compact, easy to use, blood glucose meter that allows people with diabetes to easily access a well-known multinational brand in the over-the-counter market segment. For the second quarter, we are forecasting low to mid-single digit operational sales growth in our diabetes care business. In medical optics, sales were down 3.4% in the quarter. While this performance was below our expectations, we expect to improve sales growth in our medical optics business over the rest of the year as we launch new products. Earlier this year in the US we launched TECNIS Multifocal Low Add, which provides more range of vision options to patients and surgeons. And just last week-end at the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery Meeting we launched our TECNIS Preloaded in the US, which improves the ease of use for the cataract surgeon and enhances predictability of the procedure. For the second quarter, we expect our global medical optics business to grow mid single digits on an operational basis. And lastly, our established pharmaceuticals business or EPD, where sales increased strong double digits in the quarter, including the impact from recent acquisitions of CFR pharmaceuticals and Veropharm. In February, we completed the sale of our developed markets branded generics pharmaceutical business to Mylan. With this business now focused entirely on emerging markets we saw low double-digit underlying sales growth in our key emerging markets, which include India, Russia, China, Brazil and Colombia along with several additional markets. Performance across the Latin American region was strong during the quarter as we are starting to see the benefits of a more complete product portfolio and sales infrastructure due to the integration of CFR. Additionally Influvac sales were strong and benefited from the production capacity expansion we completed last year. For the second quarter, we expect similar strong double-digit growth in EPD on an operational basis, including the impact of the acquisitions I mentioned. In summary, our first-quarter earnings per share and operational sales growth exceeded expectations. We launched several new key products across our portfolio of businesses and our outlook for the year remains unchanged as we are well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth. We will now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Hi, congratulations on a good quarter and thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could just like comment from a big picture perspective, you have now really have done a great job of re-shifting the portfolio with disposition of the developed established pharmaceutical business and bringing in CFR and Veropharm, just how are you thinking about just kind of shaping Abbott going forward. It doesn\u2019t necessarily seem that you need to be in a rush to certainly deploy any of the cash, and you have plenty of flexibility, but just how are you thinking about just kind of more from big picture strategic perspective kind of what is next? Miles White : Thanks for the question Kristen. I would say we want to grow and we want to get bigger. And I think there is, obviously two dimensions there. One is organic and organic can be expansion of products or expansion of geography and then there is I think our footprint could benefit from being a lot bigger in a number of our businesses or even as a corporation in the diverse mix of businesses we have. So that would imply some M&A activity et cetera, and nobody would be surprised to hear that out of me, I don\u2019t think. So I think both dimensions are important to us and we are putting a fair amount of attention on both. The notion is I think we have got the right core. It is a very solid core of businesses that are performing well or they are in markets that we know will continue to be healthy and drive good growth and have great opportunity for us. I think we have got the core of the company well positioned today for the attractiveness of both product markets and geographic markets that we think there is a lot of opportunity for investors for. But beyond that I think we can do more and I think we can do a lot more and particularly if we\u2019re bigger in a number of these spaces. So my intention is to get bigger. I think strategically that is how I\u2019m thinking about it. And to your comments about resources and timing and so forth as I have said in the past they don\u2019t feel particularly capital constrained or resource constrained and yet I don\u2019t feel like they have to rush out urgently either. I think we can afford to be thoughtful and prudent but at the same time that doesn\u2019t mean sit on our hands. So I think the deal market or the M&A market out there \u2013 I would love to say we all go out there with a plan, we have the following priorities, we have the following targets et cetera. Those plans are always dead on arrival, the market tells you either who is willing to talk to you, who is willing to engage, what valuations maybe, what the circumstances in any given geography or industry may be, those things always tend to determine the timing of opportunity and I think what we have been good at is being ready even opportunity aligns, and when peoples\u2019 willingness to engage aligns and so forth. And I can\u2019t always predict the timing of that. But I can tell you if you are not ready when the things line up then you are not able to take advantage of it. So, we are obviously I think always tracking, always studying, and we have always got an idea of what our priorities would be. The market will tell us what order we get to address and to some degree, but you are right. We are sitting in a very, very good position I think right now in terms of our readiness, our ability to have resources et cetera, to invest, the condition of our underlying business. We have given a fair amount of attention to our cost structure, to our supply chain structure, to our back office structure, our G&A, all those sorts of things over the last couple of years really to ready ourselves for bigger business and greater expansion, particularly geographically, and I would say that has all fallen very nicely into place. You can see it in the results, you can see it in the gross margin, you can see it in the G&A line, you can see it in the efficiency of the business, you can see it in the growth rates of some of the businesses and so forth. I think I feel pretty good about the foundation and that is the kind of foundation you want to add to. You don\u2019t want to add to a weak one with a lot of problems or a lot of things you are trying to fix and you want to add to a strong one. So I think we are in a really good position right now. We feel good about it. Kristen Stewart : And you have been really reshaping Abbott to be more of a consumer focused business, is that how we should think about M&A priorities going forward in terms of things that could really leverage kind of the Abbott brand and stay within that structure? Miles White : Well, I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say to an extreme degree. I think, the word I have used a lot in the past is balance. I think historically, particularly in developed markets a lot of our businesses were reliant on government reimbursement or single payer systems and so forth, and we wanted a different balance of that, where there was consumer choice, consumer preference, consumer pay et cetera. The very nature of the mix of our business is now is much more like that, not just because of the businesses, but because of geographies and the structures in those markets. So I would say we have and, for example, in our pharmaceutical business, branded generic pharmaceutical business overseas, those are very much consumer pay markets. The economic structure of those markets is a little different. They are more attractive to us. We have targeted those countries with that structure in particular as opportunity. So I would say to the degree that opportunity exists for us, yeah, it is very attractive. But I would not rule out, Europe, the US or traditional markets as opportunities for us for some of our businesses. I just want a different or a more balanced structure, so we are not over-reliant on heavy concentration in given geographies where there is an awful lot of decision control at a central point. And then a lot of European countries are like that. It is one of the reasons Europe hasn\u2019t been as high a priority for us as emerging markets, but I wouldn\u2019t run all the way to one side of the boat either. Kristen Stewart : Perfect. And then just a quick follow up for Tom. Tom, would you be willing to provide just the organic growth in the quarter for Abbott overall and then just --? Tom Freyman : And the top line is the mid single digits adjusted for the acquisitions. Kristen Stewart : Perfect, okay, thank you. Tom Freyman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Michael Weinstein : Thanks. Just to clean that up to Tom. Anything more precise than mid-single digits on the organic growth? Tom Freyman : Right around 5 Mike. Michael Weinstein : And then the - it was a [bead] [ph] on the quarter but then not raising the EPS guidance is that just the timing of FX impacting the P&L over the course of the year? Tom Freyman : I\u2019d say a lit bit of it is that certainly in that exchange gain loss line I talked about that should be considered to be a little extra in this quarter offset by some negatives over the last three quarters in the currency area. I\u2019d say we\u2019re although - it was a really good high quality quarter when we look at how the business has progressed both on the top line and particularly in the gross margin area and we\u2019re just pleased with that progress at this early point of the year and I think it sets us up nicely to continue to build on that as we progress through 2015. Miles White : Mike, I would add to that the analysts and investors who cover us have all paid a lot more attention in last couple of years to currency than have had to in years past and probably because multinationals have expanded so much in a lot more countries; I mean we all used to be so euro focused and yen focused and lot of companies still are, but because so much of the growth for many of us is Asia, Latin America, other emerging markets we pay a lot more attention to a lot more currencies and I think that\u2019s made it harder to forecast and predict particularly the mix and the shifts and so forth although, when it all goes in one direction like it did the last couple of quarters that\u2019s pretty easy. But for us, at least in terms of the currency piece I think all of us were caught off guard somewhat by the magnitude of the currency shift in the fourth quarter of last year, although maybe we shouldn\u2019t have been, but we were. And in our case as I pointed out in the past we\u2019re less vulnerable to the euro, very much less vulnerable to the euro than a lot of companies might be just because of the mix of our business and where we produce and offset the exchange, but then that means we got a bigger basket of currencies to look at, look at those currencies and I say okay, well the ruble improved on us in the first quarter, thank God, and quite substantially while the Brazilian real did not and went the other way. China is very stable, India is pretty stable for us right now. So, the big currencies that you would normally think would affect us or could affect us and knock on wood and I look at, I think okay this should all be pretty stable for the year barring events I can\u2019t predict in the external world. With regard to guidance which you asked about and I\u2019m circling back to, I just think it\u2019s early in the year to do any change in the guidance, I\u2019m kind of a Murphy\u2019s Law believer that the minute we make any kind of confident move something is going to go wrong with currency or something, I don\u2019t know. I just think it\u2019s a little early in the first quarter; I\u2019ve to say to echo Tom, the underlying performance of the company is real good and to the extent that this momentum continues and there is no change to earnings assumption - or to currency assumptions and so forth, you\u2019re going to be pressuring us on this point again in the quarter here. And that\u2019s all good, but I think I just like to see more cards played before we move in that direction. I look back over our last 7 or 8 years to see how many times we had adjusted guidance in the first quarter and I think we just gave it to you a couple of months ago so to change it two months later does that make sense. I think when we change guidance a couple of times in the first quarter in the last 8 years and I\u2019m not even sure why I did it then, because I think in general I had to see half the year played before I\u2019ve got a good feel for how things are going to lay out because generally the second half of the year is different than the first half of the year for all of us and it\u2019s usually around the currency or some catastrophic event and world events and I would just like to see another quarter played and then if we\u2019re cranking along like we seem to be then you\u2019re going to be pressuring us and I\u2019m going to be nodding and say you told me so you were right. Michael Weinstein : Okay. So let me switch to strategy, so Miles depending on what plays out with Mylan I could see you guys in the year with maybe $12 billion and $13 billion of cash probably it\u2019s for nickel that would be outside of the U.S. you would have still call it $5 billion of net debt potentially net cash, -- made that point. Does the cash position and the fact that really all of it being outside of the U.S. is that really drive you to an acquisition of U.S. assets or U.S. domiciled assets and do you think you can put given the opportunities that you think you can put that cash in your balance sheet to work? Miles White : Let me go in reverse order, do I think I can put the cash in the balance sheet to work? Yes. The timing of when I can put at the work is kind of the question which I sort of addressed to Kristen a little bit ago. I can\u2019t predict timing very well Mike, I can predict in ten and my intent is that I\u2019ll put it at the work. I think we\u2019ve always found the good balance here, we are pretty stable, reliable, predictable in terms of dividend and payout and so forth and we have been pretty solid about balance of share buyback and capital deployment but we have also been pretty good about deploying the higher return investments and so forth and I think our deal records speak for itself. So, I would say yes, the intent there, the timing is little harder to predict but I\u2019m not [indiscernible]. Now having addressed that GMI, am I stuck with only opportunities overseas because of the structure of tax system in the world. No, I don\u2019t think so, I\u2019m not ruling out the U.S., I am not ruling on that at all and I think, let\u2019s just say we\u2019ve got great tax guides and great management of our cash flows and access to cash if we\u2019ve through and I think we\u2019ve got good borrowing capacity if we want to so forth. I think I\u2019ve got enough flexibility that I don't have to stay in an external world. I think there is a lot of reasons that overseas \u2013 say economically more attractive. We all know what those are, but I think those are all sort of financial packs cash related at the same time I think there is opportunities that are attractive to us strategically for our business that aren't overseas and I don't think I can rule those out. So I don't feel constrained to being overseas. I don't feel like our ability to finance what we may be interested in, its constrained that way so while I am always looking in other geographies of the world for opportunities to expand our footprint, I would tell you I have not failed to fish in my own dock here in the U.S. and look at opportunities in the U.S. Michael Weinstein : And Miles last question and I\u2019ll jump in, it\u2019s been relatively quiet over the last six months since the treasury action on U.S. corporate and voting to outside the U.S. is that something Abbott might still consider? Miles White : I am not looking at it. Let me put it that way. The \u2013 I may not evenly think that Washington will come to its senses eventually here and make adjustments to the tax code to mix U.S. based multinationals more competitive globally with all the companies that we compete with. I mean there is a lot of script written about this and my position on its been clear. This tax code disadvantage U.S. companies and put the sale sign on them for European and other companies to buy us and arbitrage tax rates and I strenuously object to the philosophy of the U.S. government on that line because I think in no way enhances job global creation or business creation or economic recovery in the United States when you advantage everybody else to buy our companies. So I hope at some point that both parties in Washington will address that and I think so. Again, one of the log, I think the minute we did something in around in version or otherwise that Congress surely would change the tax code and I wonder why bothered so I am not \u2013 and I am not even sure I am not tax technician to tell you whether there is a path to do that anymore. I think right now the way things have been structured in a way the treasury addressed it and affecting the trend for some companies looking in version I think it\u2019s clearly advantage that different M&A environment for non-U.S. companies for the U.S. companies I think that's absolutely clear and you would have to be blind not to see it. So I don't \u2013 it\u2019s not on my radar screen Mike. I am looking at things more strategically and more traditionally meaning I look at the strategic fits of the business or what we can do with it and what we can expand it and so forth and I look at whether those economics working, I am not trying to subsidize our M&A analysis with tax arbitrage. Now, I think lot of other companies [ex-U.S.] are definitely subsidizing their analysis with tax arbitrage because they can but we are not and that said I don't \u2013 I am not seeing the expectations of tax inversion premium in value. I think values are high. I kind of always think they are high. I think they are high around the world for a lot of reasons, a lot of deals are getting done at expensive prices and expensive multiples they are not because of inversion or tax they are just expensive and that's driven expectations in a lot of places up, but I always think it\u2019s expensive out there and my job is to make the best deal I can for the company, but it\u2019s pretty hard to get a real deal in some cases unless you have got a plan for what you are going to do with the business and how it\u2019s going to operate in your hand. So I guess to summarize all that there is \u2013 the short answer is I am not focused on inversion for the benefit of tax. Doing those things is temporarily pre-disruptive to a company and if there is a long term belief that you need to do that and some companies have done then it must fit them strategically. In our case I don't know that we need to do that and I would rather hope here that our government will fix the tax code in the next couple of years and if they do I think it\u2019s going to dramatically enhance the competitiveness of companies like us. It\u2019s commercial for me but that's kind of the deal. Michael Weinstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. David Roman : Thank you. Good morning Miles, Tom and Tim. I wanted to just start with the business actually and specifically around medical devices where actually, I think the overall growth rate of that business looks to be trending a little bit better than where it has. So, I was hoping if you could just go into little bit more depth on the turn in the vascular business and then also what gives you confidence specifically on the medical uptick side that will see a churn in that franchise through the balance of 2015? Miles White : Okay. Let me start with the vascular side. I think what we have seen occur here over the last few years in the core strength business in particular because everything kind of revolves around the strength business, is a certain amount of stability out in the marketplace, there is always price pressure. There still is. The major competitors in the market are pretty competitive and physicians that use our product they use all of us. And they kind of balance it. So I think what you have seen is the value of incremental innovation has diminished and the market has kind of stabilized, one might even suggest that\u2019s commoditizing to a degree but it\u2019s kind of stabilizing, so I would say there is kind of drum beat to price pressure as governments are payers or hospitals or whatever the case maybe are trying to manage their own budgets and in some ways I think it just forces [indiscernible] a lot more innovative about where our next frontiers are etcetera. And I think that in the medical device business there is a lot of opportunities for innovation and rather than look at much broader footprint of very matured products we are putting our focus on a lot of innovation at eventual levels and a smaller level where there is a lot of opportunities for growth expansion and continued improvement to health care. I am not prepared to talk a lot about that today, but I would tell you that's where I am headed with that to grow and expand that device business perhaps a little differently then what people might expect. But I like the core of what we have. I think we are going to have to manage it a little differently going forward but I think the expansion for a lot of other related areas is there. On medical optics it\u2019s kind of two stories here, am I pleased with our performance, sometimes. We had three or four very strong quarters in a row and then the business kind of hit a wall, there is several explanations for that part of its us, part of it is our own competitiveness or responsiveness, part of its one of our main competitors kind of waking up again and responding to the share that we had taken in the cataract business. I would sort of attribute that to just the ebb and flow of competition and which is good. There is also some structural things going on there in the optics business. We are seeing some customer consolidation in the Lasik market. We are seeing lower utilization in the Lasik market. We have been seeing that for a number of years now. Cataract business for me is strong. We have got a great drumbeat here of innovation coming steadily, our R&D groups have done a fabulous job I think over the last several years and they continue to just constant product innovation and launch. So, I think there are some tactical things we got to do a lot better. I like this business it\u2019s one I want to expand in if you got these you got to adjust internally it makes it little harder to expand, you like to add to a strong and well operating core. So, we know we\u2019ve got some improvement to do in our performance and I would say optics means on my radar screen is one to expand because there is lot of opportunity there. David Roman : Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe switching gears on the nutrition side, I think in your prepared remark you said that you had entered the Chinese market in adult nutrition with ensure in retail stores there, I know that\u2019s an opportunity that sort of in its infancy right now, but would you sort of agree with an assessment there overtime that Chinese adult opportunity can be low kind billion dollar -- $2 billion or $3 billion opportunity sort of using the Vietnam template as an example I\u2019m just looking at kind of a demographic opportunity in China and how long would it take you to realize something like that? Miles White : I\u2019m breathless to your expectations, look I would tell you I\u2019ve an ambition to put a big business. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll put it two or three in front of the billion here and I would like to get to few hundred million and kind of get some critical math and momentum. I do have an ambition for it to be a very substantial business, kind of along the line directionally headed. I\u2019m just cautious about getting ahead of myself here on that, I\u2019ve got a couple of businesses here at Abbott, but I\u2019ve had those same ambitions for 10 years and there is still around half a billion dollar. So, I don\u2019t want to perpetually be a visionary because it never comes true. I would like for it actually to happen and so in this case I would say, I believe that opportunity is there, I believe that potential is there. We got to establish the category, we got to establish the use, we got to establish the brand and I think what we\u2019ve seen in the past is that every country we\u2019ve done that in, it\u2019s been pretty substantial, we create the category, we\u2019re the category, we got to do that in China, there is an adult category in China. It\u2019s a little different than what ensure or does, but there has been some regulatory change there that\u2019s been favorable to us and log us to establish this category at a more rapid pace. And I think it\u2019s attractive and I think there is a big upside here. So, you and I would at least be conceptually online, I\u2019m just afraid to put that specificity around size because I don\u2019t know how long it might take. And you could be right and wherever we\u2019re when you\u2019re right, I want you send me a note to let me know you were right because I\u2019ll be very happy if we are. But, I think there is a lot of opportunity to get big like that. David Roman : Okay. I guess if you feel better we never put a timeline on it so I was more of a peak opportunity \u2013 Miles White : I think you\u2019re going to be right, as I said, we get to a few hundred millions first, we will start and have a temporary celebration and keep moving on, I mean, this is kind of like having a kid and literally and you want him to be a cheater. Let\u2019s just take one step at a time here. David Roman : I look forward to that celebration. And maybe just lastly on the P&L, looking at your kind of guidance for the year on operating margin, you\u2019ve obviously done a tremendous job of expanding profitability over the past of couple of years. But still as I kind of look at where your margins are versus your peers, it looks like there is still some room to go even after where you end up this year. Are we still sort of in a period where you think Abbott is under earning versus the peer group insurance segment with room to go on the profitability side? Miles White : I don\u2019t like that characterization so much, I mean, when I look at the study annual progress of really a complex multitude of initiatives nearly from top to bottom line across all these businesses, I think it\u2019s just exactly the way to go about it and \u2013 but, to answer your question directly I definitely see more margin expansion opportunity across a number of these businesses and that\u2019s part of our expectation as we move forward. And I think you\u2019re already seeing it in the first quarter here and we\u2019ve objectives in 2015 for that 100 basis points plus and there is no reason to stop there. I think each of these businesses in moving forward and it\u2019s a huge priority for the management team here as we look at the business. Tom Freyman : Let me add to that a couple of things that underlying one is, there is some cost side to get there \u2013 there is a lot of load hanging fruit early on that one can get okay that got that. There is other stuff it\u2019s structural whether its supply chain related or plant related where the plant is, cost to labor, cost to inputs, cost to commodities, distribution all those sorts of things, right. The structural ones take longer and if I look at the nutrition businesses as an example where we\u2019ve been added for four, five years, there wasn\u2019t study drumbeat every year, but what we\u2019re seeing the benefit of now is the bigger structural investments we had to make that took two or three years to realize even four years in some cases because of plant plan, occasion, supply chain etcetera. And we\u2019re now starting to see the benefits of that. So sometimes you got to actually change process system etcetera to get at it. Second piece of it that affects the margins is price and we\u2019re protecting price. This is a little bit two steps forward, one step back. Exchange keeps you racing some of the advantage of the top line and you see exchange advantages here on the bottom line to the extent that you can put pass in right places and that\u2019s true. But for the last few years we\u2019ve watched tremendous advantage gained in gross margin management, cost reduction, you raised by exchange and all multinationals are seeing that to some degree. So, we look at it and we say okay, we just got to have pretty aggressive targets here to improve these margins steadily. I got to treat exchange almost like a cost at this point each year or price reduction and so constantly we look at the balance of that exchange how we manage it and in effect treating it like an erosion of price because that contributes to margin so you have got multiple factors that work here and we have been very intentional about how we spread our business, spread our cost space, managed exchange, hedged exchange all of those sorts of things to protect that because honestly it hurts to gain it through cost and give it back through price erosion or exchange over year and we have affected mix the markets we choose, the products we choose and so forth, the mix and profitable segments versus some profitable segments, less profitable segments all that affects it. Some of it just takes time now to give you the bottom line answer to your question is there is still opportunity, yes there is. And it\u2019s not just little. We keep plugging it away at pretty big chunks of opportunity here. David Roman : Okay great. I appreciate all the detail. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley . David Lewis : Good morning. Miles just coming back to the Mylan stake here your treatment here this stake has been more patient than I think some expected which and so far is working out to your advantage. I wonder what your thoughts from here? Miles White : Just stumping. David Lewis : That's right. Patient is perfect but I wonder what your thoughts are here and how you are balancing sort of access to capital and the potential optionality of Mylan and there seems to be this view about west community that you are spending a lot of time thinking about this stake and what you do with it. How much time you\u2019re spending on it, is this sort of important to you and how you are balancing these different factors? Miles White : I just love the voracious and patience of the investment community. We didn't even finish this deal till February that was two months ago and I know you can say why you could have been thinking about it all ahead of time. Yes, I know but you know until it\u2019s done it\u2019s not done and now it\u2019s done, right. I would also say I don't feel constrained at all by the form of our capital whether it\u2019s in Mylan stock or cash or anything else. The fact is it has no bearing on what we can or can't do from a strategic standpoint because if for whatever reason our capital is tied up in Mylan I would just probably borrow to or unlock it. So I don't feel like I have got any constraint at all. And I am happy to have been patience. When this deal was done you\u2019ll recall the original value put on the sale of the EPD business was 5.3 billion and as I am watching the great theater out there that is surrounding Mylan and the team I\u2019ve respect for the value of our position has risen because investors have valued Mylan stock so you say that's lucky and I think good luck any day, but I am happy that we have been patience because it\u2019s clearly accruing value to us as an owner and investor of Mylan stock, I think [indiscernible] has got to an aggressive team there, he\u2019s got aggressive plans obviously other people have aggressive interest in them and all of that has been in our favorable interest financially and it\u2019s not inconsequential that was $5 billion value, $7 billion now and that's just more optionality for me and I am happy about that so I don't feel like I have to be in a real big hurry to do anything to resolve that stemming and one of the reasons that we only sold a third of the stock is because that's all we wanted to sell. We didn't want to sell any more than that nor would we have and I would like where our \u2013 where we are with it I think it\u2019s been prudent to hold it, its proven to be a great value gainer for us and it\u2019s not a constraint so there is no hurry on Mylan other than we don't intend to be long term holders but that doesn't need to be hurry if I put it into the cash I can tell you right now I can't earn this much on that because I am earning leaving it in Mylan, so until I need to sell it I think it\u2019s in the nice place. David Lewis : Okay, very clear at this whole -- doesn't work out I guess you can always be [indiscernible] so the other question I want to go in Tom is gross margins there has been lot of commentary on margins on the call here but specifically this is the strongest gross margin quarter I think we have seen since this has been actually going back before this spin, at least the four quarters before the spin so can you just specifically in this particular quarter any specific drivers of gross margin it does seem largely sustainable under the second quarter but what's really driving the strongest number we have seen in three years? Tom Freyman : It\u2019s just business mix continuing focus on cost reduction everyone focused on expanding and really it\u2019s across the board is in the businesses. There is a probably a slight amount of this benefit that's coming through there as well but it really is \u2013 really operating focused. David Lewis : Okay and Miles just one last quick question on and I will jump back in queue, there were two businesses you called out about a year ago as areas you are going to see more intensive management focus I think one was U.S. nutritionals and the other obviously was EPD. Between those two it does appear that there is more sustainable growth efforts sort of coming through a fruitful on the EPD side and the U.S. nutritional business but I wonder if you could update us in terms of that management intensive focus and where you see those two businesses today? Thank you. Miles White : Well, the EPD business has been pretty transparent to all of you to watch, what we done overtime I mean there was several things going on. One we came to conclusion that we wanted to focus on emerging market not develop markets and that part clearly with strategically better fit within Mylan in a much larger business focused in those developed markets and so we did that. Now you will note we also acquired wonderful company CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America which gave us a very strong position in Latin America and enhance the one we already had and we made a fairly significant move in Russia that got done during the core of the whole Ukraine issue which was a different hit, again [Murphy\u2019s] laws if you believe it can go along -- everything kind of aligned badly and we still got that deal done unfortunately we did it Ruble so it didn't hurt us when the Ruble collapse. So that was really good strategically and I think that what we have got now in our EPD business which was done fairly transactionally as a complete redirection of that business refocus, re-emphasis where I think the biggest opportunities from our standpoint are for what we are focused on and interested in and so that's been good. That repositioning has been good. It\u2019s been very intentional. It took us about 18 months to get it done frankly I think that was faster than we might have expected, the things aligned very well for us. And so, I look at the underlying growth rates of the countries that we are focused in EPD. They are strong. I look at our own performance, its improving, could it be better, sure it could. But right now it\u2019s double-digit and above its market rates in its countries and I think that's all good. So I like the positioning of that and that's the core that I can add to. On the nutrition side, we have gone through quite a bit of change too. There has been some management change in the businesses. I like the management team. We have in place right now a lot in terms of its capabilities, it\u2019s just getting its feet under it most of our leaders there have been in place for better part of six to nine months if there has been a change that's good. Some of that's organic some of it\u2019s from outside. We have made some changes in how we are investing in the business and frankly how we are marketing all of that has been a strong improvement. I think the pediatric business is well positioned. We will see a fair amount of improvements in our marketing coming forward here, new product launches and other things that I am pretty excited about but I think will be good for that business. So, I have actually got a pretty strong comfortable feeling about the U.S. I think our adult nutrition business is weak or weak relative to what I would expect of it. It\u2019s a strong business we are large in the category as you know and I think there is some things that we are working through there. We have got a good team there and it takes a while to see the results of the changes in marketing that we put in place and the changes in products and etcetera. so I think we just got to be I hate to say the word for you guys a little patient to wait for the results to show, but the actions that we have taken which were pretty deliberate are in place. I can remember years ago in Chicago did once that folks are saying all the pieces are in place we are going to super bowl on that and I don\u2019t think we were in 500 that year I think the pieces are in place. The right management in place and I am pretty pleased with where we are with that business. You don't see it as much from your perspective because it wasn't so transactional like divesting or acquiring from the company\u2019s word in EPD, but I think, I need the nutrition business is now well positioned. When I look at the international part of it, we withered a number of events whether its recalls or other things in that business and call out one example I would say the team in China has done a wonderful job regaining loss market, loss share loss position from that recall couple of years ago that business is going well. The pediatric business I am speaking of now and the share somewhere between 8.5% - 9% whatever the way we measure it and trending well, those rates are trending well are positioned in a number of other companies in other countries are improving well. So I like the underlying fundamentals of what I am seeing out of our nutrition business and I would like to say a couple of quarters of evidence of good momentum here and I think you will see it. David Lewis : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Tom Freyman : Okay we will take one last question from the queue please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question for today is from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Bob Hopkins : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just two quick strategy questions, one on devices and one on EPD. First Miles it sounds like from your comments that the strategy in traditional devices is going to be a little more focused on smaller innovation based deals and I was wondering is that the right way to look at it because I assume your comments in line to be a lot bigger don't really apply to traditional non-consumer facing MedTech? Miles White : Let me clarify it. I wouldn't say exclusively and so I wouldn't want you to think you are only going to see little out of me because that's probably not accurate but I think that you can't just assemble large and mature either. You got to have a foundation and a presence and a core but the future of any core or foundational business in devices almost always depends on innovation replacement cannibalizing yourself with future innovation etcetera. So there is got to be a balance there. And I think we are at a point where we got this very strong core but probably not enough of the innovation that comes from the smaller kinds of companies etcetera and you can\u2019t do everything in our own R&D in that particular business. You can't diagnostic you can't in devices so I would say you might see both. You might see that I can tell you intentionally you are going to see we are going to be investing in smaller opportunities that could get a lot bigger because we want to build the breadth of that business but you are right. We may well have to pay attention to the foundational base as well. So we wouldn\u2019t rule that out, but I don't want to give you the impression that I am just looking at couple of big add-ons or something there because I am not. Does that make sense? Bob Hopkins : It does. It does yes and will follow up a little bit more offline because I wanted to ask one other one just about EPD because you have done a couple of deals lately I am just curious are there others out there in EPD from an M&A perspective or is this an area where you have kind of found what's available acquired them I am just curious how hard it is to find assets in EPDs since it looks like that's an attractive business long term? Miles White : It is not hard at all to find asset. That part is easy and it\u2019s not hard to find really good assets. That part is easy and it\u2019s not hard to find assets with good management, good fit, good products, good geographic location. That part actually easy and I think our people and our team and some of our contacts and stuff, I think we\u2019ve a unique advantage there geographically and internationally on that particular dimension, I can think of one or other companies that historically I\u2019ve thought. We\u2019re thinking about it the same way because we keep bumping into them everywhere we go when we\u2019re out hunting, fishing whatever you want to call at looking opportunities, we keep burning into the same one or two companies out there doing the same thing so I know that they think a little bit like we do. But I would tell you that part is easy, well hard part is getting beyond the recognition of it and getting to something where either somebody is interested in a transaction or it\u2019s the value that doesn\u2019t make [indiscernible] and that\u2019s sometimes a challenge. A lot of the things that we would be interested in and some of the international markets are family sponsored, family owned or privately owned etcetera and sometimes it\u2019s just more it\u2019s just more complicated. It\u2019s not easily transacted, it takes well what I call lot of relational time getting to know each other and getting to become familiar and comfortable to get somewhere with the deal. I would say that CFR transaction this is the fabulous company. It was a family company even though it was public. It had a 90 year history. It was emotional thing for them to sell the company and the company is super high quality, the management is high quality. I couldn't be more pleased and it\u2019s a great home if you are habit for it. It\u2019s a great performer that deal took a while to develop comfort and relations and so forth and that's how a lot of them are that's how lot of them are, [Indiscernible] was the same way and I think it just takes time so if you ask me do I think there is opportunities out there, there is a lot of opportunities but they\u2019re not fast. Bob Hopkins : Terrific I appreciate the comments, thanks so much. Brian Yoor : Okay, thank you operator and thank you everyone for all your questions. That concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call.

With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration; and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Brian, and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2015. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1a, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly, any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that the second quarter financial results and guidance provided today on the call for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles D. White: Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.52, above our guidance range and reflecting another quarter of double-digit underlying growth. Sales increased double digits operationally for the second consecutive quarter. Excluding the impact of the 2014 acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales increased 6.5%, which, as expected, reflects an acceleration of our performance from the first quarter. We also exceeded both our gross and operating margin targets in the quarter. As you know, macroeconomic events continue to be a major theme in 2015. Looking back to the beginning of the year, most companies, including Abbott, were dealing with the challenge of setting 2015 guidance in the context of the strengthening U.S. dollar against almost every currency that occurred late in 2014. We set our growth target high with a forecast for double-digit EPS growth, excluding exchange, and 9% absolute growth. Halfway through the year, foreign exchange is impacting results for Abbott at a somewhat higher level than we projected in January. At the same time, the fundamentals of the end markets in which we compete remain strong, and we've remained disciplined in managing our business in this environment. Strong performance has and will continue to help offset currency headwinds as we're well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for the year. With that context in mind, our full-year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.10 to $2.20 remains unchanged, which again reflects double-digit underlying growth. I'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning the call over to Brian and Scott. And let me start with Diagnostics, where we achieved very strong sales growth of 9% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Lab and Point of Care Diagnostics. We continue to capture share and win new Core Laboratory accounts with our customer-focused solutions, including the immunoassay business of the two largest commercial labs in China during the first half of the year. In Point of Care Diagnostics, we achieved another quarter of double-digit sales growth. We continue to enhance our product offering and expand our presence in targeted international geographies, including Europe, where we recently launched our wireless i-STAT handheld device; and in the Middle East, Japan and Latin America, where we achieved double-digit sales growth in the quarter. In the U.S., sales performance was driven by continued adoption of our i-STAT system in large hospitals and remote care settings. In Nutrition, sales increased 4%, slightly below our expectations. In China, we achieved double-digit growth and share expansion with the new Pediatric products we launched last year. At the same time, recent market softness in Hong Kong and Vietnam impacted our overall international Pediatric growth rate in the quarter. The international Adult Nutrition business delivered another quarter of strong sales growth, including double-digit growth in Latin America, as we continue to build and shape the Adult Nutrition category globally. In Medical Devices, our Diabetes Care business delivered 5% growth in the quarter, somewhat ahead of expectations, including international growth of 10%. Consumer response to our new FreeStyle Libre device continues to be very positive in Europe, and we're expanding capacity to meet this demand. We also made progress during the quarter to bring the Libre sensor-based technology to the U.S. with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro, our professional use device. Our Vascular business performed in line with expectations. Operational sales growth in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth of our structural heart therapy, MitraClip, the first and only device available for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. In Medical Optics, sales were impacted by market dynamics in our cataract and LASIK businesses. We expect improved sales growth over the remainder of the year, driven by market uptake of several recent product launches that enhance our portfolio. And in Established Pharmaceuticals, sales increased double digits, excluding the impact from recent acquisitions and foreign exchange. Improved operational execution and portfolio expansion are driving above-market sales growth in several geographies, including India, China and Colombia. We're seeing the benefit from the integration of CFR Pharmaceuticals with a broader product portfolio in key therapeutic areas and expanded sales force driving double-digit underlying sales growth in Latin America. So in summary, we achieved another quarter of double-digit sales growth, including a sequential improvement in our organic growth rate, as expected. We're particularly pleased with our performance in the branded generics business and another quarter of above-market growth in Diagnostics. We continue to make progress on margin expansion and reported second quarter earnings per share results ahead of our expectations. And despite a challenging currency environment, which you'll hear a lot of, I'm sure, during earnings season, we're well on track to achieve our financial objectives in 2015, reflecting the strong outlook we forecasted for EPS growth at the beginning of the year. So I'll now turn the call over to Brian and Scott to discuss our second quarter results in more detail, and then be back for questions. Brian? Brian B. Yoor: Thank you, Miles. As Miles indicated, today, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.52, above our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 10.8% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of around 8.5% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than previous expectations due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the latter part of the quarter. Reported sales increased somewhat above 2% in the quarter. Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in our Diagnostics and branded generics businesses. Sales in emerging markets increased 21% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of 2014 acquisitions and foreign exchange, total company sales in the emerging markets increased 11%. Given recent investor interest in the Chinese economic situation, I'd note that our sales in China, which represents around 8% of our overall sales, increased strong double-digits in the quarter. The second quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.8% of sales, slightly ahead of our previous guidance due to continued underlying improvements in Diagnostics and Nutrition, and up 250 basis points over 2014. In the quarter, adjusted R&D investment was around 6.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was around 32% of sales. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2015. As Miles indicated, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 from continuing operations remains unchanged and continues to reflect strong double-digit underlying growth. Regarding our full-year 2015 outlook for the P&L, we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the high single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 7.5% on our full-year reported sales, more than our original full-year projection in January of around 6%. As previously indicated, the increase reflects strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus several currencies late in second quarter. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2015. Scott will provide more detail on the 2015 outlook by businesses in a few minutes. We now forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 58% for the full year, reflecting gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales, and now forecast adjusted SG&A expense approaching 32% of sales. We forecast net interest expense of around $80 million, reflecting changes in interest rate assumptions on both our borrowing rates for debt and the income we earn on some of our investments. Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2015, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.52 to $0.54, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange headwinds on operating results. We forecast operational sales growth in the low double digits in the third quarter. At current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange somewhat above 9% in the quarter, third quarter, resulting in reported sales growth in the low single digits. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 57% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense approximately 31% of sales in the third quarter. Finally, we project specified items of $0.21 in the third quarter, reflecting the same items, as we identified for the full year in our earnings release, with the exception of the gain on the sale of a portion of our Mylan shares, which occurred in the second quarter. In summary, we achieved another quarter of strong performance and are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for the year despite a challenging currency environment. With that, I will turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Scott? Scott Leinenweber : Thanks, Brian. Today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter sales performance and outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales increased 8.7% in the quarter, including above market growth in both developed and emerging markets. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, both U.S. and international sales increased 8.5%, including another quarter of double-digit growth in emerging markets, led by strong performance in China and Russia. In Molecular Diagnostics, sales also increased 8.5%, driven by double-digit growth in our Core Business segment of infectious disease testing. Growth this quarter was somewhat above our expectations, primarily due to slower than planned scale down of our genetics business and timing of tender orders in emerging markets. In Point of Care Diagnostics, sales increased 11.5% driven by continued adoption of our market-leading i-STAT platform. During the quarter, we continued to enhance our product offering, including the U.S. FDA approval of our Total \u03b2-hCG test, which detects pregnancy in early stages during critical emergency situations. For the third quarter, we expect global diagnostic sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis. In Nutrition, worldwide sales increased 4% for both pediatric and adult nutrition. In Pediatric Nutrition, we continued to expand our product portfolio with the recent launch of the first certified organic infant formula offered by a large multinational company in China. In the U.S., we launched Similac Advance non-GMO, the first and only non-GMO labeled formula from a leading infant formula manufacturer. In Adult Nutrition, sales growth was led by international performance. As expected, U.S. Adult Nutrition sales were impacted by competitive and market dynamics, primarily in the Institutional segment. We now expect global Nutrition sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis for the third quarter and full-year 2015. In Medical Devices, sales in our Vascular business increased 3%, led by strong double-digit growth in MitraClip, our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation. During the quarter, we completed regulatory submissions for approval of Absorb in both the U.S. and Japan, and expect to submit in China in the coming months. Collectively, these markets represent more than 50% of the world's coronary stent market. We also enhanced our Absorb product offering in Europe with the approval of Absorb GT1, a new advancement of the Absorb stent system that improves ease of use. For the third quarter, we expect global Vascular sales to increase low single digits on an operational basis. In Diabetes Care, sales increased 5%, somewhat ahead of expectations, led by strong international performance. In the U.S., we launched FreeStyle Precision Neo during the second quarter. This easy-to-use meter provides consumers with an affordable, well-known brand in the over-the-counter segment of the market. For the third quarter, we forecast low single-digit operational sales growth in our global Diabetes Care business. In Medical Optics, sales were up 1%, somewhat below our expectations due to market dynamics in our cataract and LASIK businesses. Earlier this week, we announced U.S. FDA approval and launch of our iDesign System, which creates a 3-D map of the eye that is 25 times more precise than traditional systems, and offers the potential for more people to qualify for our LASIK procedure. We now expect global Medical Optics business to grow low single digits for both the third quarter and full year 2015. And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased double digits in quarter with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. EPD continues to make meaningful progress in becoming a more consumer-facing business with an increased focus on branding initiatives, marketing to the pharmacy channel and building the Abbott brand in key countries. For the third quarter, we expect similar double-digit growth in EPD. In summary, we achieved another quarter of strong growth, achieved several new product launches across our businesses, and are well-positioned to deliver high single digit operational sales growth for the full-year 2015. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Michael J. Weinstein: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Actually, I have a bunch of questions, I'll try and be brief, though. So, Miles... Miles D. White: Let's do it as one great big run-on question, Mike. Michael J. Weinstein: Yeah. That's usually the way it works. Miles, I think everybody would love to hear your thoughts on China. Obviously, there was some concern about how your China performance would look coming into the quarter, given Mead Johnson's report, comments from other multinationals about China overall, so we'd love to get your comments there. And then maybe a second item, you guys disclosed that you'd filed Absorb in the U.S., the initial PMA. Can you disclose at this point whether ABSORB III hit its primary endpoint, and anything else you can share on it? Thanks. Miles D. White: Okay. Well, let me comment on China first. A lot of times, you don't know how you're really doing until you see reports of your own competitors to give you context about what others are experiencing in a market. I'd say, overall, we're pretty pleased with China. We're gaining share. The launch of our new products is moving us along quite nicely. I think several of us have experienced this cross-border issue in Hong Kong, some more than others apparently, and that certainly impacted us a little bit as well, but we feel pretty good about China. I mean, it's only about 10% of our total Nutrition sales and about 8% of the total company. So if there's a hiccup in China, it doesn't tend to have a big impact on Abbott as a whole. That said, it's an important market. This is an important business there for us. I'd say the fundamentals of our business in China are great. We're growing double digit, a strong double digit, I should say. And new product launches, going fine. We're gaining share. I'm probably less pleased with the development pace of the adult business in China, which is a new category, but I'm usually dissatisfied with pace no matter what it is. So I'd say we feel pretty good about China. I was surprised at the pre-announcement that we saw from one of our competitors, but actually gave me a little better feel that the issues cross-border from Hong Kong to Mainland China were impacting others as well, so we weren't the only people seeing some of that impact. So I guess that context helped. On Absorb, I really don't have much to report. We have a series of improvements or incremental changes to our product over time here. This is one of the first. So beyond that, I don't think I can comment on your question. Maybe Brian or somebody else can but... Brian B. Yoor: At this point, we don't have any further information to report on the details of the trial, Mike. We file and then ultimately, timing will dictate whether this goes to Japan or not ultimately as we move through 2016. Miles D. White: I would tell you, Mike, as long as you asked about Absorb, I was pleased to see that the Vascular business sequentially here, while it's not booming double digits, is still improving quarter-to-quarter. And even though these are low single digit numbers for Vascular, that's an improvement over what we've seen, say, the last year and a half, 18 months or whatever. So I'm pretty happy about that. I like the direction we're headed here and frankly, I like the direction we're headed with the breadth of the business, the next-generation products in the business across the board, and not just in the stent business, but other aspects of the whole Vascular franchise. Michael J. Weinstein: Miles, just one follow-up. Can you just share with us your updated thoughts on M&A and use of your balance sheet? Any changes since our call a month ago? Miles D. White: Well, you know, I tried to be studiously evasive then and I probably will try to be that now. So in some respects, no change other than increasingly, as time is passing here, our focus is sharpening on where our interests lie. And I'm pretty pleased with, well, the portfolio of opportunity. But as I explained before, it depends on alignment with other companies and so forth and their interests. So I think that while I've said in the past, sometimes there's not much out there that one can justify from a valuation standpoint or a fit, I'd have to say today, while valuations are high, I think there's a fairly robust set of opportunities that fit several of our businesses quite nicely and our strategies and intentions quite nicely. So I'm not sitting here on a pile of cash thinking there's nothing out there of interests that fits us. Quite the contrary. I think there's quite a lot out there that fits us well. So I don't really want to directionally comment more than that, because I generally don't like to telegraph where our interests lie for obvious reasons. But I'd say I like what I see, I particularly \u2013 I have to say, you're probably dying to ask me this as a follow-on as well \u2013 I really like that Mylan investment right now as a place to park our cash while we're looking at the opportunities we're interested in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank Kristen M. Stewart: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess with respect to that Mylan investment right now, since you talked about it, I guess what are the terms that you have to vote along with management or abstain from the vote just in terms of monetizing that and maximizing the value? You said that was more of a short-term investment, that you didn't have intentions on being a long-term owner in Mylan. So I guess how should we think about the still being a holder in Mylan stock or someone else's stock? Miles D. White: Well, I'd say that nothing's changed. I mean we don't have an intention long term of being shareholders in Mylan. On the other hand, I suppose you could say, well, what's long term? And until we actually have to monetize that investment, I'd put it this way. Cash on most people's balance sheets today earns pretty close to zero. And that said, I think this is a pretty good place to have our cash parked, because I think that Mylan, as a company, is pursuing a strategy that I would endorse. I have a little bit of insight, given our continued dealings with our partners at Mylan. And I like the strategy that Mylan's pursuing and I support it and endorse it as a shareholder. So from that perspective, I think that this is right now, as long as we are a shareholder, we're going to vote in our interest and Mylan's interest, because as shareholders, it certainly directly impacts Abbott. And I think what they're pursuing with their Perrigo acquisition is something we clearly endorse. We've said so. We have the right to vote our shares on that particular issue as we like. And that's an independent decision by us. It's not one that the Mylan board or management controls. That's our decision. And we made that clear several weeks ago that we support what they're doing there. Obviously, Teva has other desires for Mylan, but my own assessment of that is a shareholder of Mylan is that's not likely to happen. And I think as Mylan's shareholders or Teva's or others' review in more detail the Mylan situation in the Netherlands in particular, and the rules around foreign acquisitions, whether in the Netherlands or in Ireland or other places, I think that their investors are gradually figuring out what the degrees of freedom are that anybody particularly has. And in our case, we know that pretty well as the largest shareholder of Mylan, we know it pretty well. So I'd say, we put our interest where our best interests lie and that's to support Mylan's current strategy and current pursuit of Perrigo. And we get to vote that ourselves, so \u2013 independently, and I think it's important for, not only our shareholders, but the other Mylan shareholders to know that since we're the largest one, and we get to make that decision. With regard to certain votes, Mylan would control the vote if they were pursued. So if a company like Teva pursues Mylan, Mylan controls the vote of those shares as long we have more than 5% of Mylan. But frankly, we're pretty aligned on that. I mean we haven't disagreed with Mylan on this at all at any point in time. So I think we're not just a passive ride-along here. There's our interests here, there's Mylan's interests here and we're voting our interests and our own shareholders' interest, and I think it's a good place for the proceeds from that transaction to be for now. And as I said, we don't intend to be long term, but in the interim here, while we don't need access to those resources, we certainly want those resources invested the best possible way for us and our investors. And I like what I see there and I endorse what they're doing. Kristen M. Stewart: Okay. And then just on the strength of the results that we've seen for the first half, I guess why not tighten the range, from a guidance perspective, for the second half of the year? For the full year? Miles D. White: You know, we could have. I suppose we could have tightened the range. The \u2013 I think there's enough volatility in the currency markets that I'd say, it would \u2013 my concern was, it would imply a degree of forecast-ability and precision that I'm not sure anybody really has. And there's a pretty strong possibility that we will beat this original guidance. But I'm a superstitious guy and I think the minute we try to be more precise than where we already are, Murphy is going to reach up and strike us. And I think that there's always some unpredictable event that happens. I can't predict what those events are. We're having another strong year in spite of a very strong headwind of exchange. I think the impact on us from currency this quarter is probably as great as anything I've seen. It's everything that everybody wrung their hands about back in December and January, as companies struggled to give guidance, and we wrung our hands too. But the fact is we set a double digit target every year and a real double digit target, and we did again this year. And so we set a high bar at the beginning of the year and we're exceeding that high bar thus far. But I have to say that given the volatility of certain geographies of the world and/or currencies, I thought I'd just go one more quarter. And by the time we actually change this guidance, you're going to say, we told you so, and you'll already know that we're likely to exceed for the year. I probably could have tweaked the lower end, which would have said, gee, I'm confident. You know I am confident. I wouldn't forecast to you anything that I know of today as a downside to this business, other than what we all see as ongoing currency translation. You watch CNBC or other things and people say, do you only invest in American stocks and don't invest in companies overseas? All you got to do is look at our underlying growth rates and you can see that investing where we are, in emerging markets and other places, is paying off. And it's very strong growth for us. It's very profitable growth for us. And I've said before, if you want to be where the growth is, you got to be able to navigate the volatility, and that's what we're doing. We're navigating the volatility. We're delivering steady, reliable, double digit earnings, net of exchange, in spite of how strong the exchange is. And I think that's what we're supposed to do. And I have to say, wouldn't have expected it to be tested quite so severely by this kind of currency challenge, but we're meeting and beating that. And given that we set a high bar early, I guess my judgment was I'm not ready to move that exchange yet or the guidance yet because I think it is pretty unusual that the currency is as volatile as it is. So that's one great way of wringing my hands in front of you and saying, you're probably right, but you get to be right at the end of the third quarter. Kristen M. Stewart: No problem. Thanks. Good quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. David H. Roman: Thank you and good morning, everybody. I wanted just to follow up on the capital deployment side and ask one financial question. Miles, maybe you could just talk a little bit about your use of cash strategy more broadly. I mean, if I look over the past, call it, four quarters to eight quarters, you've had a big increase in the dividend that occurred in late 2013. You've been buying back stock fairly consistently and you've now announced some M&A, but nothing significant. Can you maybe just sort of help us understand your broader capital allocation strategy and how we should think about the mix of use of cash? Miles D. White: Well, yeah, and I think it's been pretty clear. I mean, it's a great problem to have. Gee, we have a lot of cash and a lot of cash flow and I think (31:49) the businesses are strong and they generate great cash flow. We're able to fund our plant and equipment needs. We've built a number of plants around the world in the last couple of years. We're expanding capacity. We're doing all the things you'd do to support the ongoing growth of the business from an internal standpoint and yet, we generate a lot of cash. And in some regards, you'd say there's a lot of different things you could do with that cash. We know that part of the identity of the company is a dividend, and so we are attentive to an appropriate dividend payout in a range of a percentage of EPS somewhere between 40% or 45% of EPS. And we tend to maintain that steady range because there's a lot of investors out there who rely on us for steady passive income that way in their portfolio. So that's one use of cash and frankly, we don't have any difficulty funding that. So I think that's an important aspect of the identity that's Abbott. M&A activity is opportunistic to a degree, as you know, and it can be funded by your cash flow or it can be funded by debt as well. We watch our debt ratio carefully. We watch our debt rating. We watch all those things. But I have a say, right now, while we've got what I think is a fairly attractive menu of opportunities for us from an M&A standpoint, you just haven't seen us act on it. Now, I would also tell you, over the last 10 years, you've seen us act on a lot of things, and we don't tend to forecast it until it's already happened. And so I'd say you probably should not assume that we're just sitting on our hands accumulating. I think investors expect us to deploy cash, and we do, and we will. I mean, that's one of the things \u2013 I'd have to say, leaving our cash in Mylan right now is good place for it to be if we haven't got something else to do with it. I'm not a big fan of borrowing to buy back shares. I think that's artificial and short term. Although I know there are many activists who might advocate such, I think we can deploy our capital to earn a healthy return, but it doesn't mean you can do it on a rolling quarterly basis. It depends on when the M&A activity is available or when the opportunity arises. So we're all about building and growing the company, and investing the capital in things that earn at an attractive rate for our investors. And if we have capital beyond that, which we always seem to do, we do buy back shares. I think we should \u2013 we do have a philosophy of returning cash to our investors at least at some level to keep our stock and share count from being diluted, et cetera. I chuckle a little bit because some investors or analysts out there condemn the practice of buying back shares, while other investors want you to return cash to them or capital to them as part of the return, and it's interesting to listen to these two diametrically opposed points of view. It's almost like everybody wants to be chronically unhappy. I think it's a great problem to have great cash flow and a lot of cash. We can fund the dividend. We can fund the share buyback. The question is how big in any given point in time. And frankly, we're able to fund a fair amount of M&A. And M&A that is strategically a good fit with the company and a good return above and beyond certainly what we can earn with cash, but what we can earn in a lot of things. So we tend to look at it in all those ways. Right now, I'd say it's in our interest to obviously support our dividend, maintain a certain level of share buyback, which we do each year on a steady basis and husband our resources for what we believe are some great opportunities in M&A. We try to keep that balance in the right balance. We do pay attention to the returns we're earning for our shareholders. And frankly, we track what our shareholders think about that capital deployment or redeployment so that frankly, we're reflecting what they're looking for as an investment. So I don't know if that specifically answered your question, but I'd say right now, the level of share buyback that we've typically done is not threatened in any way. I would not go out and do some big leveraged share buyback. Frankly, if I was going to go seek leverage, it would be to acquire additions to the company, which I think would make a lot of sense. David H. Roman: Okay. Yes. That is very helpful, actually. And then on the financial side, if I look at your guidance for the full year, it looks like your targeting about a 19.5% operating margin. But as I kind of look at the comp set of the individual businesses in which you compete, that would suggest that there are several hundred basis points still of margin expansion left in the business. I guess, A, would you agree with that assessment? And, B, if so, is there a reasonable case to be made for consistent, call it, 100 basis points or so a year of operating margin expansion? Miles D. White: Yeah, I think in the foreseeable future, I'd say that's the case. It's an interesting thing, we've done very well in the margin expansion, particularly in Nutrition and Diagnostics. And in fact, in Diagnostics I think there's more opportunity. But I wouldn't drop all of it through to the bottom line. I'd like to be investing even more in R&D and Diagnostics and some in SG&A. I think all of our businesses would take more sales and marketing investments in a heartbeat. Every business always thinks it's tight and it always thinks it has more things to spend money on. But the reason they call it discretionary spending is because it's discretionary. And I think to the extent that we keep improving the margins, part of that is good for the shareholder and part of it is good for discretionary spending, depending on the worth of the investment, whether it's R&D or sales and marketing expansion. So I agree with you. I think there's more opportunity. I think the Nutrition business has shown a tremendous capabilities to improve its gross margins. Now to be fair, we've had the benefit of low commodity prices, and at some point, that's going to end, and we'll see it change. But we have the benefit of low commodity prices. That's clearly reflected in our margins in the Nutrition business. I think the Diagnostics business has just made great strides in what it's done from a gross margin standpoint. There are days when I look at the margins in these business and say but for exchange, or but for price pressure in given markets, there's not a lot of robust price upside out there in a lot of these businesses, and yet, even in the face of exchange and/or pricing, depending on where you are in the world, the margins keep improving, which I think is a great credit to the management team in these businesses. So long way around, I agree with you. I think there's still consistent opportunity to keep improving margins. And like every other CEO of a multinational, I'm waiting for the day that the U.S. dollar weakens. David H. Roman: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David R. Lewis: Good morning. Miles, just one question, one quick follow-up on some prior questions. Just coming back to China, you have less exposure to many of the factors that your competitor obviously described for their China weakness, and you're actually seeing strength in China. But Nutritional growth did come down modestly for the remainder of the year. So where specifically is that pressure coming from if it's not a lot of China? Miles D. White: Well, we've got some challenges in Vietnam and some other places as well. The market in Vietnam has slowed, I'd say, kind of suddenly and a lot. And I don't think we're losing any share in Vietnam, but we've certainly seen it slow. And from time to time, we see the impact of government price pressures and so forth. But do I expect that to be a sustained situation in Vietnam? No, I don't. I can't always explain why any given market will suddenly take a breather, but they seem to. And in this particular case, Vietnam and Hong Kong both are impacting these numbers to a degree. Last year, Saudi Arabia impacted our numbers to a degree. And in a lot of cases, I think we get so used to watching China that we discount the impact that other countries may have on our performance. And the truth is we're pretty large in Vietnam. We're the biggest nutrition company in Vietnam by far, it's a big market for us. Same with Saudi Arabia. There are some of these markets that, because China gets so much attention, we tend to think are rounding error and they're not rounding error, they're important. And they're big markets for us. So when we see some impact in the marketplaces in some of these other countries, it does affect the collective numbers overall. Because as I mentioned earlier, China's only about 8% of the whole company, and that's all businesses, including Pharma and Devices, Diagnostics, et cetera. Our second biggest business in China is Diagnostics. And so China's important to the company across the board, but it's only 8% of all our sales and in the Nutrition business, it's only 10%. Our competitors sometimes are much more highly indexed in China relative to other countries. And I say that and the Danones, and the Meads and the Nestl\u00e9s, they're in all the same countries we are, but the degree to which they are dependent on China versus other countries varies. And in our case, while China's a very big business in Nutrition relative to the total of all the business in Nutrition and in Abbott, it's not as big. So some of these \u2013 the long story short, some of these lesser, smaller markets or countries also impact the look of sales. So what you're seeing here I think is more Vietnam and Hong Kong than fundamental Mainland China. David R. Lewis: Okay. Very helpful. And then, Miles, you talked to extensively today about (41:48) the Mylan-Perrigo situation. Just a small nuance, was there a benefit to Abbott shareholders in expressing earlier support for Mylan-Perrigo than perhaps you needed to or are people just making too much at that particular point? Miles D. White: Well, I think a lot of people are making a little too much of it. But I think that first of all, the rules in the Netherlands are a lot more complex than what a lot of investors understood, and certainly, about Mylan's domicile there. And therefore, what \u2013 there's been a fair amount of press more lately around the so-called structure of ownership in the Netherlands, the Stichting, and all these other things. And I think if one assesses the clear path to completion of Mylan's interest in Perrigo versus Teva's interest in Mylan, there's a pretty clear difference. And I don't think investors completely appreciate that because I don't think they know the underlying hurdles or rules, et cetera. And so I think that, I think, a lot of investors could have misunderstood or misperceived a choice that doesn't actually exist, my view, one investor. And so I wanted to make it clear where the largest investor in Mylan stood because I think that will influence other investors to take a closer look at the facts of what is the clear path to completion here in terms of the \u2013 what are thought to be alternatives that I don't think are. And to the extent that, that influence other investors to take a closer look, I think that's in Abbott's best interest as Mylan's largest shareholder rather than continuing to debate back-and-forth, an alternative that I don't think truly is. End of comment. David R. Lewis: Thanks. Very clear, very important commentary. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Glenn J. Novarro: Hi. Good morning, guys. Miles, I'm a little surprised just here, in the middle of the year, we haven't seen a lot \u2013 or any M&A from you. And I'm not sure if you're paying attention to Congress, but there's a chance that attached to the highway bill, there may be a tax holiday toward the backend of this year. So given the fact that a lot of your cash sits outside the United States, I'm just wondering, is that what's holding back any M&A? Are you potentially waiting for this potential tax holiday? And if there is one, would that accelerate the pace of M&A? Thank you. Miles D. White: No. Yeah. The image that comes to mind is Charlie Brown holding a football for Lucy. Do I think Congress is actually going to do anything with tax policy before the end of the year? I give you a resounding no. So I would tell you, not for one minute would I hold back our M&A interest based on thinking that Congress is actually going to do something in some comprehensive and constructive fashion here about tax policy in the United States. I hate to be that definitive about it. You can probably tell what I think, but no, I \u2013 that has no impact whatsoever. And I'd say the things that have impacted us here up to now has mostly been us completing all the things that we needed to complete, which we've done. We think we're in good shape on all our transitional things. And it's more just our own pursuits and decision-making that is driving our M&A portfolio. I mean, we've got a lot of opportunities, I think, to support our branded generic pharma business, and we've got a lot of opportunities in the device space. And that's where a lot of our interest is right now. We'll make a lot of progress there. It will become more apparent by the end of the third quarter, I feel confident. Apparent doesn't mean there's some great blockbuster coming here. Those things tend to take time, and I don't know that I can predict time right now. But I'd say, look, we're \u2013 I already said \u2013 normally, I've been on this call and said there's not that much out there. Frankly, there's a lot. And \u2013 but it's all very highly valued and nothing's easy in the deal world, and I think you know that, even though there's a lot of activity these days, in fact, a lot more activity than we've seen in a long time over the last 18 months. So I'm not sitting here holding back for anything. I think we're moving along as best we can. I think the one thing that holds anybody back is the fear of overpaying or paying too much, and \u2013 or making a poor deal. And I think we've always tried to be disciplined about our deals. I always find that we're criticized for paying too much until a couple of years later, when everybody says, hey, great buy. We try to make intelligent deals. I don't think you can ever expect not to pay full value for something, but we're always careful about what we think we can do with a given business and whether we can add value to it and so forth. And trying to find that sweet spot where everybody's happy is sometimes a little slower than we might like. Glenn J. Novarro: Okay. And just one quick follow-up. I'm not going to ask you about your view on the med tech tax. So I'll just ask quickly, in the past, you've said that the fact that your cash sits outside the U.S., or most of it's outside the U.S., it would not hold you back from doing M&A in the United States. Does that still hold true? Miles D. White: That still holds true. Glenn J. Novarro: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Jayson T. Bedford: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first is there's certainly been a lot of conversation of you getting bigger, and I understand that, but are you also contemplating further pruning of the business, meaning product lines that may not fit as well, or visibility and the returns may not be there? Is that part of the strategy going forward? Miles D. White: It is not. Jayson T. Bedford: Okay. And then just a specific question, and following up on an earlier one on the Nutrition softness outside of China, I think you mentioned price in Vietnam, and I'm guessing Hong Kong as well. Is this is a dynamic that you'll be facing for the next three quarters until it laps? Or are there other factors there that would allow you to turn this geography around a little earlier? Miles D. White: No. I don't actually expect a long, sustained downturn we've got to lap here, et cetera. Brian is dying to say something. Let me let him comment. Brian B. Yoor: No, I just wanted to add... Miles D. White: Brian was just there, by the way. So he really wants to tell you about it. Brian B. Yoor: Yeah. So in Vietnam, we are gaining share. Remember, we are recovering. So all things are pointing the right way there. This is truly a market issue. So I think this is within our destiny to control. The good news, too, I think with Nutrition is when you look even beyond that area, we're growing double digits in key Latin American markets as well. So a little bit different dynamics and circumstances than maybe what we heard from others last week. So I feel good about where we're at. Miles D. White: Yeah. It's hard to generalize because it \u2013 and we just had my staff meeting earlier this week, and we look at every geography. We look at our share position. We look at our competitors. And I have to tell you, every one of these countries has got a different mix of competitors. And different companies are strong in different countries. So it's hard to just generalize with one brush across them all. Vietnam, as I said before, it's been an important market for us. It is an important market for us, it will be. I don't anticipate some long-term difficulty here. But it clearly impacted this quarter. Jayson T. Bedford: Fair enough. Thank you. Scott Leinenweber : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay? Miles D. White: Yes. Larry Biegelsen : Great. Hey, let me start, one product; question one, strategic question. So international diabetes growth accelerated nicely this quarter, I think you had 10% operational growth outside the U.S. Libre, the feedback is all, frankly, phenomenal that we've heard, but you're capacity constrained, I believe? So \u2013 and you filed Libre Pro in the U.S. So, Miles, can you just kind of give us an update on Libre? How big do you think that product can be for you in 2015, 2016? When do you think you'll be \u2013 won't be supply constrained? And when are we going to see the key European and U.S. studies that you have ongoing? And I have one follow-up after that. Thanks. Miles D. White: I'll tell you, we think we've got a real winner of a product here, but we are capacity constrained, and that's our own problem. We obviously didn't build enough capacity for what we anticipated. We expect that to start easing in the mid to late fall. We'll have considerably more capacity online at that point, and we continue to invest in capacity because I \u2013 we believe in the impact of this product and the response from diabetics and consumers is, frankly, terrific. We intentionally slowed down our marketing because there's no point in creating greater difficulty in terms of demand for a while until we can fix that capacity issue, and we're getting close to that point now where we can go back to a more aggressive marketing of the product. But in the meantime, we're just waiting for that capacity to come online. Brian, did you catch the rest of those questions? Brian B. Yoor: Yeah, it was with respect to Libre Pro, with respect to the launch that we had in the U.S. \u2013 or pending launch after the (51:52) approval, submission. Miles D. White: The submission, yeah. Brian B. Yoor: So yeah, Larry, recall, we just got this approved in India. I mean, this is a great opportunity for us to go after the doctors and the patients in a different way. We did file and submit in the U.S., and typical timeline I'd say here is approximately a year. But again, this is probably a modest segment, but it's still an important one for the professional segment that we're targeting. But I'd say, overall, between this strategy, as well as what we have internationally with Libre, and even our approach to the market here in the U.S. with some of our offerings, is really balanced and really helping us, as you see here, return to growth for the Diabetes Care business. I mean, to be performing in the mid-single digits is where we expected to be, and so I think everything's on track. Miles D. White: I don't think I could forecast for you how big it's going to be. I don't know. I just don't know. What I do know is anything I'd tell you would be wrong. So I think it'll be a significant product. I think after, say, 6 months to 12 months of unfettered availability, we'll know pretty well, but I'd like to hit that capacity or the capacity release point where we've got plenty of manufacturing capacity and we're unconstrained, and then we'll get a better sense of that. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks. And then on a strategic note, when one looks at the \u2013 at Abbott's Vascular business, it doesn't have the breadth right now as its two main competitors. And cardiovascular device is one of the therapeutic areas where we have seen contracting across product categories, so what are the strategic implications of those factors for Abbott's Vascular business? At some point, does that business, Miles, need more breadth within the cardiovascular device space? Thanks for taking the questions. Miles D. White: Yeah, and I think, I \u2013 yeah, I do think it needs more breadth, but I also think it needs pretty solid performance in the pieces it has. I think we can do better on the stent front than we're doing, and I think we can do better in the endovascular space than we're doing. Structural heart, for us, really, right now, is a product, but we think there's a lot more breadth there that we should be participating in. And then I think beyond that in the device space, whether it's Vascular or not, there's a lot more breadth. We created a different structure in our organization where we'll incubate ventures. Ventures can take on a lot of different sizes, and there's a lot of activity there right now. We have a clear focus on expanding and broadening the whole device business. It's actually going really well. We're just not in a position to tell you much about it yet, and it ranges from equity investments to outright ownership or assembly of businesses there. And we announced early in this quarter, the second quarter, that we were making a change there to not just be a venture funder, but actually builder of business. And it's surprising to me how much opportunity kind of exploded in that space for us. So yeah, we're going to broaden it, well underway, a lot of opportunities, agree with your point, and we're on it. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions, and that concludes Abbott's conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at www.abbottinvestor.com and after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time via telephone at 203-369-2013, pass code 4277. The audio replay will be available until 4 :00 p.m. Central Time on Wednesday, August 5. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

All participations will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration, and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom, Brian, and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including the expected financial results for 2015. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual reports on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that the third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. With that I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles D. White: Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, at the high end of our previous guidance range. We also narrowed our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $2.14 to $2.16. The midpoint of our guidance range remains unchanged and continues to reflect double digit underlying growth. Sales in the quarter increased double digits operationally for the fourth consecutive quarter. And before I summarize our results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss two topics that have dominated the headlines of late, growth in emerging markets and the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Healthcare growth and demand remains strong despite challenges facing emerging economies. In the third quarter, Abbott again achieved double digit organic growth in emerging markets, led by Nutrition, branded generics and Diagnostics. While clearly there has been some softening in emerging markets, growth in these economies continues to outpace growth in the developed world, and healthcare is growing even faster than overall economic growth in these markets. National policies focused on expanding access to care and favorable trends, including increasing birth rates, aging populations and adoption of Western standards and technologies are all driving growth. Abbott remains uniquely positioned with our diverse set of healthcare businesses to capitalize on these trends, from birth to older adults and from diagnosis to treatment, in pharmaceuticals and innovative medical devices. At the same time, the strengthening U.S. dollar continues to be a challenge for Abbott and other multinational companies. We're thoughtful about how we manage our business and exchange in this environment, and we remain focused on achieving the right balance of returns to shareholders and investing in the business to drive long-term growth. I'll now summarize our third quarter results before turning the call over to Brian and Scott, and then we'll be back for questions. I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 8% in the quarter, driven by continued above market performance in core laboratory and Point of Care diagnostics. We continued to capture share and win new core laboratory accounts with our customer focused solutions. In Point of Care diagnostics, we achieved another quarter of double-digit sales growth. We continued to expand our presence in key developed and emerging markets and capture share in the U.S. through adoption of our market-leading i-STAT System in large hospitals, physician office labs and remote care settings. In Nutrition, sales increased 6.5% led by growth in our international pediatric business. In China we again achieved double digit growth driven by continued market uptake of our Eleva infant formula and online offerings in the premium segment. The international adult nutrition business continues to achieve strong performance, including double digit growth in Latin America as we continue to build and shape the adult nutrition category globally. In Medical Devices, as expected, our vision care business saw a sequential improvement in growth led by strong performance in our cataract business. The underlying fundamentals of the cataract market remain attractive, and continued market uptake of several recently launched products is driving above market growth. In vascular, sales growth was led by double digit growth of MitraClip, the market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. And in diabetes care, sales growth was led by international performance. We continue to receive positive response to FreeStyle Libre, our new sensing technology that helps people self manage their diabetes without the need for routine finger sticks. Our capacity expansion remains on track to meet the growing demand for the differentiated product. In Established Pharmaceuticals, sales again increased double digits, excluding the impact from recent acquisitions and foreign exchange. Growth continues to be driven by India, Russia, China and several countries throughout Latin America. This business continues to deliver above market growth through improved commercial execution, expansion of product portfolios in our therapeutic areas of focus, and driving more awareness of our Abbott brand with consumers, physicians and pharmacists. So in summary, we achieved another quarter of double digit operational sales growth. We continue to see strong underlying growth broadly across emerging markets and all of our businesses. And despite a challenging currency environment, we remain on track to achieve our financial objectives in 2015, reflecting the strong outlook we forecasted for EPS growth at the beginning of the year. I'll now turn the call over to Brian and Scott to discuss our third quarter results in more detail. Brian? Brian B. Yoor: Thanks, Miles. As Miles previously stated, today we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.54, at the upper end of our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 10.9% on an operational basis. That is excluding an unfavorable impact of 9.5% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than previous expectations due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter. Reported sales increased 1.4% in the quarter. Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in our Diagnostics and branded generics businesses. As Miles mentioned, Abbott sales growth in emerging markets remains strong, increasing double digits on an organic basis in the quarter. Given continued investor interest in the Chinese economy, I'd note that our sales in China, which represents about 8% of our overall sales, increased double digits overall and across each of our reportable business segments. The third quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.5% of sales, up 200 basis points over 2014 and slightly ahead of our forecast, driven by continued margin expansion in Diagnostics and Nutrition. In the quarter, adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 31.4% of sales. Turning to our full-year 2015 outlook, today we narrowed our adjusted EPS guidance to $2.14 to $2.16. The midpoint of our guidance range remains unchanged and excluding the impact from foreign exchange, reflects strong double digit underlying growth over 2014. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the high single digits for the full year 2015. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 8% on our full-year reported sales, somewhat higher than our prior expectations and reflecting the move that we've seen against the U.S. dollar since July of various currencies. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2015. Scott will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes. For the full year, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 58% of sales, reflecting gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense approaching 32% of sales. Overall, we expect to expand our full-year adjusted operating margin by more than 100 basis points in 2015. We now forecast a gain of around $50 million on the exchange gain loss line of the P&L for the full year which is offset by exchange impacts on the operating lines of P&L over the course of the year. Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2015, we forecast operational sales growth in the mid single digits. At current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange of around 6.5% of sales, resulting in a low single digit decline in reported sales. The sales impact from exchange in the fourth quarter is expected to be less negative than the third quarter as we will be lapping the currency effects that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. We forecast a fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59% of sales. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales, which reflects the planned timing of development programs, including investment in several next generation diagnostics platforms. And we forecast adjusted SG&A expense of around 30% of sales in the fourth quarter. Finally, we project specified items of $0.28 in the fourth quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release, with the exception of the gain on the sale of a portion of our Mylan shares which occurred in the second quarter. In summary, we achieved another strong quarter and a strong underlying performance and are on track to achieve our financial objectives for the year. With that, I will turn the call over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and our outlook. Scott? Scott Leinenweber : Thanks, Brian. Today I will provide an overview of our third quarter sales performance and outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales increased 8% in the quarter. In core laboratory diagnostics, both U.S. and international sales increased 8%. Double digit growth in emerging markets and share gains globally continued to drive above market performance in this business. In molecular diagnostics, sales were led by 10% international growth, as well as double digit growth in our infectious disease testing segment. As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the continued slowdown of our genetics business as we scale down this business. And lastly, Point of Care diagnostics, where sales increased 12% in the quarter. U.S. and international growth were driven by continued market adoption of i-STAT, our hand-held device which provides critical information that helps clinicians make quick and informed decisions. For the fourth quarter, we expect global diagnostic sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis. In Nutrition, global sales increased 6.5%, reflecting a sequential improvement in growth over the prior quarter. Pediatric nutrition sales increased approximately 10% and were led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac Advance non-GMO in the U.S. During the quarter, we continued to expand our non-GMO product portfolio in the U.S. with new launches in the tolerance and up-age categories. In adult nutrition, sales were led by 8% international growth, including double digit growth in Latin America. As expected, U.S. adult nutrition sales were impacted by competitive and market dynamics. For the fourth quarter, we expect global Nutrition sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis. In Medical Devices, modest sales growth in our vascular business was led by 5% growth in endovascular sales and double digit growth in MitraClip. During the quarter, we further solidified our leadership position in the transcatheter mithral valve device market with the acquisition of Tendyne and an option agreement to acquire Cephea Valve Technologies. Along with MitraClip, these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our leadership position in this market. For the fourth quarter, we expect global vascular sales growth to be relatively flat on an operational basis. In diabetes care, sales growth was led by international performance, including strong growth of FreeStyle Libre in Europe. For the fourth quarter, we forecast low single-digit operational sales growth in our global diabetes care business. In medical optics, as expected, sales increased sequentially over the prior quarter. Growth was led by strong performance in our cataract business, which represents around 70% of our medical optics sales. Continued market adoption of our premium intraocular lens products, including lenses that provide patients with more range of vision options, are driving high single digit growth in our cataract business. For the fourth quarter, we forecast mid single digit operational sales growth in our global medical optics business. And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales again increased double digits with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. Sales growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in several markets, including Latin America, where a broader product portfolio and expanded sales force from the integration of CFR Pharmaceuticals are driving double digit underlying sales growth. For the fourth quarter, we expect low double digit operating sales growth in EPD. So in summary, we achieved another quarter of strong underlying sales growth and are well positioned to deliver our financial targets for the full year 2015. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Michael J. Weinstein: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Miles, I think people probably first want to hear your thoughts on capital allocation. On the last call, I think people came away from and expecting that Abbott might be more active over the course of the quarter. Obviously, we saw 10.9%, but I think people's expectations were a little bit higher. So can you just give us your current thoughts on business development activity and how you're thinking about the balance sheet? Thanks. Miles D. White: Yeah thanks, Mike. I'd say basically no change from last quarter. I'd describe a little bit of macro environment. I'd call it exuberance of activity in this space, meaning healthcare in particular, pharmaceuticals, et cetera. It clearly came to a halt, I'd say, mid-summer. And it doesn't reflect that there aren't the same opportunities or the opportunities that we've been interested in, but activity slowed. I'd say we didn't miss anything. We're still absolutely as active as we wanted to be. I might like to have gotten more done too, but I think sometimes these things take time. And we haven't missed an opportunity. There's one opportunity that went by where I'd say the valuation was such that it obviously was a lot more valuable to somebody else than it would have been to us, and I don't regret missing it. But in general, I think there's been a slowing, but not so much a change in valuation expectations in some of the businesses out there. We're still every bit as active and interested. So on the M&A front, I'd say that remains a very high priority. It's hard to say something gets done within a few months, but I'd say we're all going have to just be patient here while it sorts out. And rest assured, we have not backed off one iota. In terms of capital allocation in general, I like our position. We've got capacity. We've maintained a strong dividend. We'll continue to do so. We think we've got the right balance here in terms of share buyback, investment in the business, et cetera. So I think in general, all those different constituencies who value some portion of our capital allocation will continue to be satisfied or pleased with what we're doing. Michael J. Weinstein: Okay. And the emerging market performance is obviously encouraging. People were clearly concerned during the quarter about the potential slowdown in China, as well as other markets. Anything in the quarter that you viewed as one-time, whether it be tenders or something that might've benefited the Nutritionals business? Was that a pretty clean picture of your emerging market performance, particularly in Nutritionals? Miles D. White: Well first, let me say, I think the emerging market performance was a lot stronger than people expected. I think there's been a lot of concern about the slowing of various emerging markets, in particular China. And while the overall economies in some of these markets have slowed, it hasn't been the same in healthcare, and it hasn't been the same in the businesses we're in. Those have not slowed in the same way. And so our performance in the emerging markets remains strong in spite of what we might see in construction industries or other consumer areas, or I can pick a whole lot of different areas that clearly have slowed or investment has slowed in emerging markets, but it's not been so in healthcare. That has remained pretty strong, and I think above expectations, and we're gratified by that. We're glad that's the case. The single biggest thing, Mike, as you know, that's affected all of us in emerging markets is exchange and across the board. I mean last quarter was among the toughest I've seen from an exchange standpoint and you say to yourself, we got to go where the growth is and the growth is clearly attractive in emerging markets. It's double digits. It's healthy, strong double digits on the top line, and we'd all give anything for strong double digits on the top line, and that's there. But again, it's mitigated by pretty strong currency headwind and while none of us are great prognosticators of when that may ease, when it does, I think that the strength and robustness of emerging markets will really, really show. But in the meantime, I'm glad to have the growth of the emerging economies as we do and we continue to be very enthusiastic about them. That said, we have to navigate exchange. To this point, to your specific question about whether or not there's any one-timers here, not that I see or I can think of off hand. I mean everybody around the table here is shaking their heads and nope. So yeah, you're right, it's a clean picture and we're pleased with how that picture is developing and there's no oddities in here or whatever. I'd like to put a one-timer in there of an acquisition here and there and as you know, from the first part of your question, and we'll see. Michael J. Weinstein: Okay, great. Congratulations. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Kristen M. Stewart: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to just focus on the diagnostics business because that has continued to actually perform quite well and just the sustainability of that. You also commented in the release that you continue to see operating margin expansion there. Can you maybe just flesh that out a little bit more? Miles D. White: Well actually, we've been very pleased with the steady growth of that business. It's been a very strong grower for us, frankly across the board. It's done very well in both developed and emerging markets, and I think it's done that with great commercial execution. It's probably the strongest commercial organization in our company, and they've done a great job in terms of their enterprise selling model and improvement of service and so forth, and they've got a very healthy and broad pipeline of new systems coming. I'd say the breadth and magnitude of new products in development has probably never been bigger or better in diagnostics, so the coming three to five years here, at least as far out as I can see, and because I don't know that any of us can forecast more than a year ahead at this rate. But in any case, what they've got coming in terms of new products is going to drive a lot of growth and share gains. So we're looking forward to the eventual launch of all the different systems and products in development to sustain that growth and we've put that in the hands of a really great commercial team and service team and I think this is highly sustainable. It tends to fluctuate between 6% and 8% top line growth, kind of goes up and down a little bit in cycles. But in any case, anywhere in there is pretty healthy growth in this business, particularly in the core laboratory business. We've seen pretty good improvement in the point of care business, particularly as we expand internationally, and that's been good. We've had some ups and downs in the molecular business, but I think we've stabilized our plans there and looking forward to how that will go forward. So I would just say in general it's been a real bright spot for us and a steady one. On a margin improvement basis, they have done a really great job, as has our Nutrition business, at gross margin improvement. And while it may sound odd, at some point you say, gee, I think we might be overdoing it here. Let's invest more and more and more, and we're sustaining investments even with this margin, which is very healthy, we're sustaining investment in a lot of R&D programs and -- that are expensive. The R&D in this business when you're doing major system development and assay development is expensive and we've got an unprecedented portfolio of things in development and that remains a high priority for our internal investment. I'd say they are one of the most efficient commercial organizations I've seen. There's not a lot of waste here and they spend very efficiently, they're very effective. They get great bang for the buck and consequently, the margin in this business is just exceptional. So I'd say they've done a great job, and at this point, we think there's still room to improve gross margin, and so we continue to. Don't know what else to say about it, except it's just very gratifying to see how well they're doing. Kristen M. Stewart: And then I know you had mentioned, touched a little bit on the Nutritional margins. You'd think, I mean this year it's been pretty impressive to see if you look, excluding currency, just on the overall leverage that you've seen through the business into the bottom line. Do you think that that level, maybe not this level in 2015 is sustainable, but do you still see the opportunities for leverage going forward? Miles D. White: Yeah, I see some opportunities. It's been a focus there now for four or five years, and we've seen steady incremental improvement. Of course early on, there's low hanging fruit that you pick, and then other things take some investment and some shift in your manufacturing and other things. And I think that we have begun to see the benefits of a lot of the things that took longer to get at. So I do, I think there's more, I do. Do I think there's another 500 basis points or something? Geez, I wouldn't forecast that even if I thought so. So I think there's still room for steady improvement there. We have not been dependent on price to get it. In fact, we've been very careful not to rely on that. I think when you rely on price, you don't get at the underlying fundamentals of how you operate your business. At some point, I think we're going to feel the pressure of commodity prices. We've been fortunate in the last couple of years that we've gotten some great benefit from lower cost, lower priced commodities. At some point that will turn, and we've tried to put plans in place to be able to mitigate that when the time comes, so I think that will be some pressure on us sometime in the future and we should probably anticipate that at some point. So we keep our focus on continuing to manage cost, input costs, et cetera, because I think that will be coming someday and we should expect that. Kristen M. Stewart: Okay; great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. David Harrison Roman : Thank you, and good morning, everybody. I wanted to just start with the total top line picture, and by just by our own math, it looks like the organic growth rate, I guess excluding acquisitions, accelerated once again to north of 7% this quarter, representing the fastest level of growth I think you've had since the spin. So maybe, Miles, a) is that correct? And b) maybe you could sort of talk about some of the factors that have come together over the past couple quarters to give you that level of growth and your view on the sustainability thereof. Miles D. White: You're spot on. The overall organic growth rate, if you exclude exchange impact and acquisitions, is about 7.5%. The factors that have driven it, a lot of the things that we put in place in our pharmaceutical business, our generic pharma business, have come together. We're seeing much better commercial execution. We're seeing expansion of our product lines in our key therapeutic areas. You've seen the focus of the business in a number of areas of the world where the growth is clearly helping to sustain the business. So I'd say if nothing else changed, which is not likely, but if nothing else changed, I think the growth rates we see as an underlying organic growth rate in pharma are sustainable for some time, I'd say at least in the mid to high single digits organically, and frankly we have ambition to enhance that, so we'll see. They've done a nice job, as our other businesses we've discussed also, of managing margin and margins. So I'd say, look, there's always surprises and there's always something happening somewhere in the world, whether it's an access issue or a licensure issue or a pricing issue. Whatever it is, there's a lot of things that will affect this business, because if you have the mix of countries that we do business in, there's always something volatile happening. But overall, it's been a fairly steady story for us. You may recall several years ago, it was not such a great story, and we put some emphasis on all the factors I just mentioned -- commercial execution, the breadth of our product lines, our relationships with distributors, our brand -- all those things to improve that business, and actually that's worked, and so that's done well. In Nutrition, it's a couple of different stories. In some places, we're doing well and we're satisfied with our performance, and in other places we're not satisfied with our performance. So I'd say while we can say today we're pleased with the solid performance of this business, the truth is we're not, and we think we can do better. So I'd say that's a plus to looking forward, we believe we could do better there. Diagnostics, I already mentioned. So I think the probably the one area that I continue to put a lot of thought and effort and focus on our segments of our medical device business. It's been solid, but it's some segments of it are not the robust growth areas that they once were, and they're not likely to be. They are likely to be solid core businesses. But our issue will be continued incremental improvements in products and then additions to the product lines and spaces around that core. And that's been getting a lot of emphasis. So while we're paying attention to the core, we also paying attention to how we can enhance and add to it, because I think it will be a fairly durable business over the long term. It's a of course highly profitable business even in the pressures of a different market. And I think it's a good strong core franchise that we can add to and build on. So overall, I think we'll see the underlying growth that I referenced earlier much more clearly second half of next year because if exchange were not to change \u2013 and that's a big if \u2013 if it were not to change, you'd really see the underlying growth rates of these businesses in the second half of next year, although you can see it now if you just do the math. And I think you'd see that there's some pretty solid good franchises out here because we positioned ourselves in the markets and market segments where the growth is. And part of that's emerging markets, and part of it's particular business segments where there's clear growth. I think we're going to see some of our businesses like diabetes care surprise people with some growth. I've got great expectations for FreeStyle Libre. And as I mentioned, our capacity expansion there is well along. And it won't be long before we'll be able to release more sales of that product, which has been hampered by our capacity to produce. So I think there's a number of things that will sustain growth for us, so and I'm pleased with that. It's the things we can't control, like currencies and so forth, that are of greater concern. But we all have that problem and we're all facing it the same way. David Harrison Roman : And then maybe more specifically on medical devices. If I look at that business, it's still the one that remains a drag on growth despite the overall uptick in performance. Can you get that back to a mid single digit growth business organically? Or is that the area that requires the most focus from an external investment standpoint? Miles D. White: Well, I think from my standpoint, it requires a fair amount of focus. If I went back a couple of years ago, we were having this kind of a conversation about the generic pharma business. And there were not a lot of people giving us much prospect of doing better with that business. And I'd say, okay, look where it is now. So I'd say, look, it's clearly got a lot of our attention. And I can't forecast for you. I don't think I should forecast for you what the growth rates are likely to be or what they will be or what it's going to look like when. But I will say this, we are in no way accepting its current standing or status. It's a strong, good business with best in class products in the market. The market's clearly changed some. I'm speaking primarily on vascular here because the optics business, it's doing well. I think it's getting our attention. When we put a lot of focus on something, we've generally fixed it and redirected its strategy. So I'd say we are in that process right now, and it's premature to forecast timing or outcome. David Harrison Roman : Okay. And then maybe lastly on the M&A side, understandably you're not going to give us too much visibility into what you're thinking. But conceptually, as we kind of evaluate the types of deals you might be looking at, could you just sort of talk about how you think about the financial engineering cash EPS accretion that's seemed to be quite popular, call it six to 12 months ago versus top line growth and ROIC from your vantage point? Miles D. White: Well I'd say I start with the strategic fit with the business. We're looking at growth opportunities, and growth comes in a lot of different ways. If you just start with emerging markets, if you put your company in growth markets and you put it in the current of the stream or the flow of business, you should be able to do as well as the growth in the marketplace. So obviously we look for growth segments, whether it be geographic or business segments. And we're in those now. So I'd say we are looking to add to or expand our footprint in places where we have that kind of growth. And then you want to be among the leaders in those markets because your ability to drive share gain is greater, and so we're targeting areas where there is clearly growth, and that means it needs to strategically fit with the businesses we're in. Now that said, there's a lot of ways that fit is accomplished. If you were to look at the pharma segment, there gets to be a blurring sometimes between OTC, OTX and Rx, and depending on the nature of a given geography or market or distribution channels in that market, there's opportunity for expansion there for us. So I look at strategic fit first. We're not financial engineering our growth. We're not looking to be a rollup that's got to go find a few more opportunities every year to overcome last year. We're looking for fundamentals that drive growth and expansion in markets and there's a lot of healthcare expansion around the world that fits us beautifully and a lot of opportunity for us access. So our primary focus is on businesses that relate to what we're already in or doing. Does that mean we would not look at businesses that we're not in, no it doesn't mean that. We'd look at businesses we're not in if they fundamentally have the characteristics that we as a diverse healthcare products company have or look for. We know what we can leverage. We know what we can do. We know what doesn't make sense in our mix. But we are generally very interested in things that strategically fit what we're trying to do as a company and we're not particularly interested in those that are, as you characterized it, financial engineering for short term accretion. I think we're always mindful of accretion. We're clearly very sensitive about dilution, as our investors are. It's one reflection of price. It's one reflection of value. It depends on how long something will take to pay off. And I think we've been pretty disciplined dealmakers, hence probably one of the reasons that we haven't seen as much activity out of us as we wanted to. You can make a lot of deals out there if you have no limit on what you want to pay. And I think in this environment, you got to put the right value on businesses and that means that your forecast about what a business is going to do in the near to long term really matters, and there's a lot of ways to do deal models to convince yourself that what you're doing is a fundamentally good return. But let's face it, at the end of the day, we're investing our shareholders' money for growth and for long term sustainability and that's what we're focused on. David Harrison Roman : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate all the perspective. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Matt C. Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one I guess related to exchange. It's sort of a two parter, but the question is really on number one, can you just walk us through your hedging program? Remind us how your hedges were set this year and how further drops in exchange could impact the middle of the income statement and the bottom line. And then as related to that, I was just curious how you think about exchange in terms of being opportunistic with M&A. You've structured some prior deals where you've done deals in local currency, and that's actually benefited you when exchange has dropped. So just curious if that's something that's on your mind or is more of a minor theme. Miles D. White: Okay. I'm going to phone a friend here for a little help on some of the exchange explanation, but let me generally answer in the following way. Depending on how you hedge, if you hedge your currencies at all, it's good for one year. It's not necessarily so great the following year as your hedges expire and so on. So you can be opportunistic, but at the end of the day, we're not currency traders and we're not trying to make money necessarily on currency. That's not our business. What we are trying to do is mitigate and smooth the impact of the currency on us so that the changes or swings or fluctuations in currency aren't shocks to the expectations we set for investors or how we budget or plan for our investments in our businesses or the long term continuity of our support of our businesses. So we look to smooth that impact, and to that end, we do hedge. We're thoughtful about our hedging. We stratify our currencies into three categories, those that are inexpensive and easy to hedge and so forth and they tend to be key obvious currencies in markets that you would expect. There's a middle category where it's more opportunistic in terms of our view of the trade-off of the cost of hedging those currencies and the ability to do, and the impact and the volatility and all those things, and that's a judgment assessment by our treasury (40:29) group and CFO. And then there's those that are just frankly either not hedgeable or they're impractical to hedge. And so we look at that tiering and determine where it is beneficial in our view to try to manage the impact of the currency, and then we do it in a rolling laddered fashion. You can think of them like rolling laddered bonds are laddered bonds or something. But we do it in a rolling laddered fashion on a continuous basis that is not opportunistic; it's in fact strategic and ongoing. And we do that to minimize the overall shock to the system of the ongoing effect of currency. We experience the same exchange markets that everyone else does. We experience the same fluctuations that everyone else does. Our longer term strategies affect where we put our plants, where we put our R&D, where we put our costs, where we earn our profits. Because our best natural hedge to exchange is having our costs in the same places where we earn our profits. And so we try to take advantage of as much natural, I guess, hedging as we can by where we invest for plant capacity and so forth and -- but that takes time. That takes time, and so I'd tell you, you'd find that the euro doesn't impact us as much as other currencies because we've got considerable investment in Europe that offsets the impacts of exchange. We're obviously invested in India, Russia, China, Latin America. We've got a number of capacity investments in all those places that will of course adjust with time. But that's how we look at it. I think that the impact of negative exchange on us as a dollar denominated company over the last four or five years, like any multinational in the U.S., has been pretty clear. It's been a real headwind. But the growth is in emerging markets. The growth in those markets around the world is far greater than in developed markets, and you got to go where the growth is. So if you're going to go where the growth is, you're going to have to make the management of exchange impact part of your strategy, and we have. Tom, anything you would add to that? Thomas C. Freyman: No, I think you captured it pretty well, Miles. I mean obviously the hedging helps, it smooths, but it doesn't eliminate currency. If you look at our EPS forecast for the year this year, it's very strong, upper single digits, and our underlying growth is much stronger than that. So we did experience some currency this year despite some pretty timely hedging. It'll help going forward, but every year you are still going to have some challenges from the currencies, because that's where our businesses are. Miles D. White: And I think there was a second part to question I've already forgotten. Could you repeat it? Matt C. Taylor: Sure. Yeah, no, that's a great first part answer. The second one was just as currencies shift, if there were bigger drops in currency, does that change how you think about valuations given those particular countries where then you might have an advantage if you structured it (43:42) Miles D. White: Well, I recall you asked if we have a philosophy on how we do any M&A in those countries. Look, I think I'd always want to do it in local currencies if possible. It's not always possible. So I think there's always an assessment of, if you're engaged in any kind of M&A activity in some of these countries with volatile currencies, can you do it in local currency or not, and it not, there is a risk assessment there of how you manage that. If it doesn't go your way, I can tell you there's a few circumstances where I've backed off from opportunities because they were going to have to be done in dollars, and I didn't view the risk on the currency as worth taking. And fortunately it turned out to be right and I was glad I didn't. But you can't always forecast or predict that, and so I think there is an assessment of the value of an investment you make for the long term to add to the company versus what your view may be the currency environment short term. But generally speaking, I'd prefer to do it in local currencies, but you're not always able to do that. Matt C. Taylor: Great. Thanks a lot for the answers. Miles D. White: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and maybe one on gross margins here. Really strong incrementals, right, and despite the FX headwinds that you guys are seeing, looks like the increments are really strong. Points out some structural changes in the business, right. So I'm just thinking sort of what innings are we in on the gross margin side? Miles D. White: Well, there's two parts to that. We've obviously improved our gross margins with a lot of internal activity in terms of costs and cost management, expense management, et cetera, and some of that has been in investments in our own production and efficiencies and so forth. The gross margin has also been impacted interestingly enough by negative exchange. I mean, because it's a mitigating factor when our costs are in local currencies, we, as we just explained, have a bit of a self hedge there, and that too contributes to the gross margins. So you have to break it down into two pieces, that which is sort of organic to us and that which is driven in this case by negative exchange, and I'm going to guesstimate that's about a 50/50 proposition right now. I'm looking around the table here for opinion on that, but... Brian B. Yoor: Yeah, there's not much impact from exchange this year on our gross margins. You're seeing the true underlying performance here, in what you see in the year-to-date results and what we're projecting for the full year. Miles D. White: Okay. I stand corrected. Vijay Kumar : Great. And then maybe one follow-up on, again I think one of the questions I'm getting from investors here is, look, I mean 3Q was fantastic, but as we look at sort of the near term, how do we put in context? You have certain elements of your business which are more consumer like versus parts of your business which are much more resilient to cycles out there. (46:35) So could you sort of compare and contrast how those two pieces play out? Thank you. Brian B. Yoor: Vijay, this is Brian. So I would say looking forward, I'd say all of our businesses look healthy going forward, and I don't really necessarily separate it in terms of consumer versus I'll say the non-consumer, I mean because we're participating in markets where growth in healthcare has high demand. If you go back to my comments for example, all of our major segments, not just Nutrition, grew double digits in China. So we're seeing a lot of resilience I would say on the upstream, be that in our diagnostics, be in our vascular, and our other medical devices, in addition to the consumer side. So you're right, the consumer side tends to get a lot of attention, and the consumer has been quite resilient around the world. And you see that reflected in the demand for our Nutrition business as well as our Established Pharma businesses. But at the same time, there's a lot of investment going on in these countries because healthcare is part of their five-year plans, or part of their priorities to where they're also making investments in for example private hospitals. And that's playing very well into the underlying demand that's occurring across our other businesses, not just the consumer, but across the whole spectrum of health that we're trying to cover here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from - Scott Leinenweber : Operator, we'll take one more. Operator : Our final question today is from Rick Wise from Stifel. Rick Wise : Good morning, and thanks for the question. Miles, a couple of things. First on the EPD front, you did CFR in May of 2014. Just maybe help us understand, is it fully integrated now? Are you fully cross-registered with the products, with all the parts of your global business? I'm just trying to gauge where are you in that process. Clearly, you're seeing excellent growth. And have you achieved all the sales and cost synergies you hoped to? Is there more to come? Just where are you in that whole process? Miles D. White: Well, I think generally, Rick, we are pretty fully integrated. There wasn't a lot of integrating to do, to be honest. The management that was running CFR is still in place. It's excellent management. We've had a fair amount of sharing across the board between the regulatory and R&D teams of CFR and the other parts of our business around the world. We tend to run them in fully integrated fashion in the various geographies of the world, rather than functionally from the top. So CFR has remained fully functionally integrated, which is a good thing. Now we did back integrate our Mexican and Brazilian operations into CFR. Or actually, make that our Latin American organization. CFR became the core of our Latin American organization, and we back integrated Abbott into it. We did that in every country, but in particular Mexico and Brazil, because CFR didn't have a lot of business in Brazil or Mexico, so we have fully integrated and combined all of that. I think that's largely done. I think there's always opportunities for further improvement. I can't comment on some of the back office stuff because I don't know, but generally we tend to integrate our IT and finance systems and so forth over time, and my guess is that's probably pretty close to complete, but it may not be. But in general, commercially it's fully integrated. Management's fully integrated. Abbott, we're very happy with the management team. It's an excellent management team, and I'd say it's clearly contributing to our growth, and the more we can expand in Latin America, the better. We picked up some other assets in other countries, non-Latin American, with CFR. Actually very happy to have those assets too and looking for ways to expand and grow those in those given countries. So yeah, I think that's actually been a real positive. It was everything we thought it would be, and we've been very pleased with it. Rick Wise : Yeah, and just a second question on China. Clearly you've answered some of the concerns, 8% of sales, up double digits in each segment. Maybe a couple questions there. Is this, whatever the specifics were of the double digits, I don't know if it was low or high teens or whatever, how sustainable is it? And what's next in China? You've opened up the sales and distribution centers. You've launched new products in new categories. How do we think about growth? And if you want to extend it more broadly in emerging markets, but China specifically, how sustainable? What's next? Thanks so much, Miles. Miles D. White: Okay. Well, I'd say a couple things. I think the growth opportunity in China remains as attractive as ever. China reaches up and surprises everybody once in a while in a lot of businesses. And we've had some experience that way ourselves. I think there's still a lot of opportunity for us to grow there in the pediatric business. I think there's opportunity in the adult business. We have not been pleased with our progress in that business. And obviously, that gets a fair amount of attention. But I think there's an awful lot of opportunity in China. I think as a very, very large market, and because it's China, there's always a certain amount of caution about how far one can go with growth in China and so forth. I think for us, there's a lot of opportunity. Our share position, or frankly the size of market in some of these businesses is such we think there's a lot of opportunity. So for the foreseeable future, barring any sudden changes or changes in policy or whatever the case may be, I think China is a pretty attractive opportunity for us, and it remains so. Rick Wise : Thank you so much. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator. And thank you for all of your questions. And that concludes Abbott's conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at www.abbottinvestor.com, and after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time via telephone at 402-220-9782, passcode 1784.

All participations will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration, and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom, Brian, and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual reports on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that fourth quarter financial results and guidance provided on today's call for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today I\u2019ll discuss our results for 2015, as well as our outlook for 2016. For 2015 we achieved our financial objectives for the year reflecting strong double digit EPS growth when excluding the impact foreign exchange and almost 9% growth on an absolute basis, excluding the same sales grew over 9% including strong double digit growth in emerging markets and we continued to expand our growth and operating margins. Overall, we made good progress against our strategic objectives. I would like to highlight few two key achievements from the past year. In established pharmaceuticals, we completed the sale of our developed markets business and successfully integrated CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. The integration of CFR provides the scale, manufacturing and portfolio of breadth to establish Abbott as a top 10 branded generics company in Latin America and actually number one in many of the markets in Latin America. And Veropharm had a similar impact in Russia positioning Abbott among the top branded generics companies in this key market. We also made significant progress improving our commercial execution, expanding our local product portfolios and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with patients, physicians and pharmacies. In Nutrition, we achieved double digit growth and share expansion in China with the portfolio of Pediatric Nutrition products that are customized to meet local preferences. In the U.S. we expanded our product offering in the tolerance and up-age categories with the portfolio of non-GMO products providing parents with additional formula choices. Our international adult nutrition business achieved another year of strong growth as we continue to bold and shape this category globally. And we achieved another year of significant margin expansion. In Medical Devices, MitraClip achieved sales of more than $250 million and we further solidified our leadership position in the transcatheter mithral valve repair market with the acquisitions of Tendyne and an option agreement to acquire Cephea Valve Technologies. Along with MitraClip, these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our leadership position in this attractive segment of the market. In medical optics, we continue to launch a number of innovative products that are driving growth and share expansion most notably in the premium len segment. And in diabetes care, we introduced our revolutionary flash glucose monitor FreeStyle Libre in several countries throughout Europe. Consumer response for this product continues to be very positive and we recently expanded capacity to meet the growing demand. We also made the progress during the year to bring the Libre technology to the U.S. with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro, our professional use device in June of last year. And finally in diagnostics, the combination of commercial execution, high quality platforms and customer focus solutions resulted in another year of above market growth across those developed and emerging markets. This business also achieved another year of margin expansion, while simultaneously investing in the development of next generation system platforms across all three of its segments including the Core Lab, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics. So we\u2019re entering 2016 with good underlying momentum. Our businesses have well aligned with favorable long term trends including the continued expansion of healthcare and emerging economy. While there has been some softening in this economies on a macro basis, national policies focused on expending access to care and feasible demographic trends, or driving growth in healthcare which is outpacing overall economic growth in these markets. The fundamentals in the market and geographies where we compete remains strong, and we expect to deliver another year of strong double digit underlying earnings growth in 2016. However, a couple of items are impacting our growth outlook on an absolute basis and you\u2019ve heard this all weak, most notably foreign exchange. The rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several emerging market currencies beginning in the third quarter of last year means that foreign exchange will again be a growth headwind in 2016. We're now entering the fifth year of this dollar bull cycle, while we actively worked to mitigate the impact of currency on our results, the impact of exchange on our bottom line would be more pronounced in 2016 due to the mix of currency movements and certain timing effects. In comparing our 2016 forecast, we were mindful of finding right balance between managing through these transitory currency dynamics in the near term while concurrently making the right choices in appropriate investments to drive sustainable long term growth. The other notable impact to our 2016 outlook relates to Venezuela, which has been a good market for us for many years. As many of you know, market conditions in Venezuela have become more challenging including high inflation, increasing price and margin controls, regulations on import, and slowing demand. As a result, our forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuela operation in 2016. Brian will provide more specific details on the impacts of currency in Venezuela in a few minutes. So for 2016, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 reflects another year of strong double digit underlying earnings growth offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and a lower contribution from Venezuela that I just mentioned. In this environment, we remain focused on what we control. Our commercial and operational execution, our innovations and our efforts to expand margins. In nutrition, our R&D organization continues to be highly productive and is now developing new products closer to our customers than ever before. We will be opening up several new R&D centers in Asia over the last several years. We expect continued growth and share expansion in China, Latin America, and other priority markets including another year of strong international adult nutrition growth. And while we've made great progress expanding margins in this business, margin improvement remains a key priority and we continue to see opportunities for steady expansion going forward. In established pharmaceuticals, our execution has improved significantly and we\u2019re focused on strengthening our capabilities in key channels and geographies, and building a well-recognized added brand with consumers take a permanent role in making decisions about their healthcare. Internal development programs and local product acquisition are driving a steady cadence of new products in our established pharma business to strengthen local portfolios. In 2015, our productivity of new product launches increased versus the previous year and we expect another strong year at new product launch productivity in 2016. In medical devices, we expect continued growth and share expansion in our cataract business driven by the ongoing launch and market uptick of our premium intraocular lens product across multiple geographies. In diabetes care, we recently expanded capacities as I mentioned, to meet the strong demand for FreeStyle Libre in Europe. And we expect to bring this technology into a number of new markets in 2016 targeting in the multibillion dollar global blood glucose monitoring market. And in vascular, we continued to drive uptick of MitraClip and expect to bring it Absorb to new markets through the year. Finally in diagnostics which remains one of our most consistent growth businesses. We will continue to execute our commercial strategy to drive above market growth at both developed and emerging markets. And as we progress through the year, we look forward to providing more specifics regarding our next generation diagnostic systems platforms as we get closer to launch. Before turning it over to Brian, I\u2019d like to comment briefly on capital allocations. You always ask me about that and you know that we take a very balanced approach here which rest includes increasing our dividend, share repurchases, and M&A activity. Last month, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend marking the 44th consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our dividend. That is only one of only a handful of companies to deliver with such consistency. Share repurchases have and will continue to be part of our capital allocation mix. And lastly, while 2015 was relatively quiet for us on the M&A front, adding to our business with good M&A remains a key priority. We see plenty of opportunities and we will continue to remain active on this front. As always, we remain disciplined and focused on finding the right balance of strategic fit and measures of return that will benefit for long term shareholder. I'm sure you\u2019re going to have a question for me later on that topic. But overall you can see, cash flows remain strong, margins remain strong, the underlying growth of our businesses remain strong. In summary, the fundamentals of the market and geographies in which we compete, all remain strong. And we continue to focus on what we can control. For 2016, the impact of foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics I mentioned earlier are offsetting double digit underlying earnings growth. These impacts while significant are transitory in nature and therefore we remain focused on making the right decisions, drive long term growth for our shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss 2015 results and 2016 outlook in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Okay, thanks Miles. Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operation of $0.62 in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by strong performances in our branded generics, diagnostics and adult nutrition businesses. Reported sales declined 3.1% in the quarter including an unfavorable impact of 8% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was approximately 1.5 percentage points higher than previous expectations due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter. The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.2% of sales, up 130 basis points over 2014, driven by continued margin expansion in diagnostics and nutrition. In the quarter, adjusted SG&A was 29.6% of sales and adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales, reflecting investments in development programs across the businesses including several next generation diagnostic system platforms. The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was somewhat lower to previous forecast due to inclusion of the impact of U.S. tax legislation inactive in December. Overall, as we look at 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year despite difficult environment. And we delivered strong underlying growth, while continue to make significant progress on our margin initiatives. Turning to our 2016 outlook, today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.20. While this forecast reflects another year strong double-digit underlying earnings growth, foreign exchange in the Venezuela dynamics that Miles discussed are impacting our 2016 absolute growth outlook. Let me take a moment to provide more detail on each of these items. As you know in the third quarter of 2015, several emerging market currencies weakened rapidly relative to the U.S. dollar and have continued to steadily weaken since that time. Based on the geographic mix with currencies that weakened and the rapid pace at which these currency decline, foreign exchange will be a greater offset to our underlying earnings growth in 2016 versus 2015. Additionally in 2015, our hedging programs served to mitigate some of the underlying foreign exchange exposure and volatility. While our program remains in place for 2016 and it anticipate to deliver some offsetting impact to our exposure. The benefit of our hedges have naturally lessened over time. So the follow through from translational foreign exchange combined with these hedging dynamics, negatively impact EPS growth in our guidance by little more than 10% for the full year of 2016. Lastly, as Miles mentioned, due to challenging market conditions in Venezuela, our 2016 forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations. This impact lowers our 2016 sales growth rate by almost 2%. And excluding this impact, the midpoint of our 2016 guidance range would reflect adjusted earnings per share growth in the mid single digits even with the more pronounced foreign exchange impact I discussed earlier. As the year progresses, we will provide any relevant updates on our business in Venezuela. I'll now provide more specifics for our 2016 outlook. For the full year 2016, we forecast operational sales growth in the mid single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we'll expect a negative impact at around 4% on our full year reported sales, which would result in reported sales growth in the low single-digits for the full year 2016. Scott will provide more detail on 2016 outlook wide business in a few minutes. The forecast in adjusted gross margin ratio around 57% of sales, reflecting the negative impact from exchange was partially offset by underlying gross margin initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment are somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. We forecast net interest expense of around $125 million, up over 2015 primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates and lower forecasted interest income in certain countries. We forecast a loss of approximately $25 million on the exchange gain-loss line of P&L for the full year. And we forecast around $10 million of non-operating expense for the full year of 2016. We forecast adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% for the full year of 2016, similar to 2015 and reflect in the effect of the U.S. tax legislation inactive in December. Before I review our first quarter outlet outlook, I'd like to provide some context for our forecasted pattern of quarterly earnings growth in 2016. We forecast underlying adjusted EPS growth in double digits for each quarter of 2016. However, in absolute terms for foreign exchange in the Venezuela dynamics, we'll will have a more pronounced impacts on our results in the first half of the year. We expect the pace of both sales and the adjusted EPS growth to progressively accelerate throughout the year. So for the first quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share $0.38 to $0.40 cents reflecting double-digit underlying growth, which is more than the offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution to the Venezuela operations. We forecast operation sales growth in the low single digits. And our current exchange rates, we expect a negative impact of exchange around 6% resulting in a reported sales decline in a low single digit. The Venezuela dynamics that I discussed lowered our first quarter operations sales growth forecast by around 3 percentage points. The forecast in adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 57% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 34% of sales in the first quarter. And we forecast net interest expense of around $25million in the first quarter. In summary, we achieved strong growth in 2015 despite a challenging environment. Our business at end of 2016 with good underlying momentum and we continue to execute well on our margin expansion initiatives. Our underlying earnings growth forecast is to remain strong in 2016, very similar to the underlying earnings growth we saw in 2015. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights now. Scott? Scott Leinenweber : Thanks, Brian. Today, I'll provide an overview of the fourth quarter sales performance in 2016 outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I'll start with diagnostics where sales increased 7% in the quarter. In core laboratory diagnostics, international sales increase nearly 8% driven by double digit growth in emerging market. And in the U.S., we continue to achieve above market performance with growth of more than 6%. The molecular diagnostic sales grew 3%, led by strong growth in our core focus area of infectious disease testing. As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the planned scale down of our genetic business. And lastly, point of care diagnostics where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter. U.S. and international growth were driven by continued market adoption of i-STAT, our hand-held device which provides critical information at the patient's side helping healthcare providers choose the best treatments in a variety of care setting when minutes matter the most. In 2016, we'll continue to leverage our best-in-class model and provide customers with a full offering of solutions to help them most efficiently operate their businesses while improving care. We expect global diagnostics sales to increase mid single-digits on an operational basis with both the full year and the first quarter of 2016. In Nutrition, global sales increased 5.5% sales in the quarter. Pediatric nutrition sales increased approximately 4% and were led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac Advance non-GMO in the U.S. As expected, international pediatric nutrition were all impacted by a difficult comparisons versus the prior year when sales increased more than 25% driven by market uptake of product launches in China and South East Asia. In adult nutrition, sales were led by 10% international growth, including double digits operational growth in several Latin American countries. U.S. performance was led by growth of venture in the retail and institutional segments of the market. In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on capturing share with locally relevant pediatric nutrition products and growing and shaping the adult nutrition category globally. For the full year 2016, we expect global nutrition sales to increase mid single digit on an operational basis. It's important to note that the Venezuela dynamics that Miles and Brian reviewed most significantly impact our forecast for nutrition and established pharmaceuticals. Excluding this impact, we forecast operational sales growth for our global nutrition business would be mid-to-high single digits for the full year 2016. For the first quarter, we are forecasting global nutrition sales to increase low to mid single digits on an operational basis. In medical devices, as expected vascular sales was relatively flat for the quarter. MitraClip, our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation once again grew strong double digits. And Cephea, our innovative endovascular stent continued to perform well. This growth is mitigated by market dynamics and the coronary stent market. In 2016, we'll continue to drive market uptake in MitraClip and Cephea and expect to bring Absorb, our fully dissolving stent to the U.S. market. For the full year and first quarter of 2016, we expect global vascular sales to decline whole single digits on an operational basis. In diabetes care, sales growth was again driven by strong international sales of FreeStyle Libre in Europe. In 2016, with the recently completed capacity expansion, we look forward to bringing this breakthrough technology to more consumers around the world. For the full year 2016, we expect global diabetes sales to increase double digits on an operational basis. For the first quarter, we\u2019re forecasting global diabetes sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis. In medical optics, global sales increased 2% has strong performance in the cataract business, notably in the premium lens segment was partially offset by dynamics in refractive markets. In 2016, we'll continue to drive updates of our innovative premium intraocular lenses and we expect global medical optic sales to increase low to mid single digits on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016. And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales again increased double digits. Sales growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in several markets, including Russia, India and China. For the full year 2015, EPD sales grew double digits operationally with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. In 2016, we'll continue to broaden our portfolio with globally relevant in products, remain focus on successfully building our presence and scale in key countries are focus. For the full year 2016, we expect EPD sales to increase mid-to-high single digit on an operational basis. As I mentioned earlier, Venezuela has a significant impact in our forecasted EPD growth rate. Excluding this impact, we would forecast operational sales growth for EPD in the low double digits for the full year 2016. For the first quarter, we're forecasting EPD sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis reflecting double digit operational growth excluding the impact of Venezuela. In summary, we achieved another year of strong underlying sales and margin growth, and are well positioned to maintain that type of momentum for the full year 2016. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open. Mike Weinstein : Let's start with Venezuela and maybe you could just give us a bit more in terms of what you're doing, one, with your operations there; and two, the change you're assuming it sounds like you're marking to market the business basically at different exchange rates. So can you just walk through financially what you're doing? And again, why that's blowing the business as much as it is in 2016? Tom Freyman : Hi, Mike. This is Tom. I don't \u2013 I\u2019ll talk about what's going on for us in the country, but I want to make it very clear that we're not changing our exchange rate assumptions for the country. This is really about what's happening to the market through economic activity of those markets, and really demand and ability to pay for products. The oil price was high at the beginning of the year, it declined throughout the year and the top markets became more challenging and we would talk as Scott talked about and Brian talked about significantly lower volume as we exited 2015. And as Miles indicated in his remarks with price controls, very high inflation. And when we look at the remainder of 2016 going forward, we see very challenging conditions and much lower volumes in the country. So we're focused on supplying the market, more focused on medically critical products. Our products are important to the market, but just the profitability of what we would expect for the year from that activity is a very low contribution compared to what we experienced largely in the first half of 2015. So that is a situation and I think it will basically take some volatility out of our forecast, but reflects the reality of the market we're dealing in. Mike Weinstein : So two more fundamental follow-up. So one, the Pediatric Nutritional business had a tougher comp in the fourth quarter internationally on optimum product launches and particularly in China. Can you just separate out for us the tough comp versus the underlying growth and degree to what you think you're seeing maybe slowdown in any of your markets? Brian Yoor : Sure Mike. I would say in international, as particularly and the slow down we\u2019re seeing on the surface, nothing has changed about our underlying momentum here. If you go back to fourth quarter of 2014, that was the period where we were launching our innovations particularly, Eleva and QINTI into the market. And as you know, Eleva has had great success in the portion of the market that it's playing in. So there is a little bit of a tougher comparison, fourth quarter '15 over '14. If you blend it out in China there on the average, Nutrition business grew over the mid teens for the full year. And so that's more reflective of the performance for this business for a year and it's still ongoing. We still have the momentum there. We still have plans for further opportunities of how we compete and how we've been priced to the various channels. So nothing has changed about the momentum and it continues in the 2016. Mike Weinstein : So Miles bringing you in here. So all this discussion, the underlying business if we can pull out Venezuela and we can pull out may be one or two other smaller items. The underlying business hasn't changed, but the environment has changed in some places and the price update for prices for assets has changed. Have your priorities on the capital allocation and the M&A question, have your priorities changed at all in the last six months? Miles White : No. Let me go back, Michael and paraphrase that for you. The frustrating thing and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are U.S. based is the underlying market dynamics remain strong in a lot of places. Every morning we get up, we see CNBC. Everybody brings their hands about China, but whether China is 7% growth or 6% growth, 6% is way bigger than the rest of the world. It's a fundamentally strong market for us as our practically all of these emerging markets. Now, the oil-based economy, the ones we were extremely dependent on oil, take Venezuela \u2013 okay, there are different stories. And the volatility, unreliability and sustainable market there is different than just about anywhere in the world. So okay, there was an outlier. And every year there is going to be some outliers somewhere. And I think if you're in a broad mix of currencies and a broad mix of countries and geographies as a multinational, somewhere something is not going to be great. But the fundamentals of the markets particularly for us in healthcare are good. And yes, translating that back during this period it's unusual, it's frustrating. I mean none of this have seen this kind of oil price in couple of decades, none of us have seen this kind of currency pile on in a long time. So okay, that said, we all know that every multinational CEO has said in the last two weeks in his earnings calls and we all see it, we all experience it. Now, going back to your next question, has my expectation of our underlying momentum changed? No. Has my priority changed in terms of M&A activity? I'll tell you one thing about it that's changed a little bit. We've been looking at properties largely internationally. And I'd say, I'm probably balanced in that a little bit back in other way. I don't think in the past it was pretty hard in a lot of expansion opportunities in branded generic pharmaceuticals. And I think there are opportunities there. But I think as you and others, we've watched those valuations over the last year when deal heat turned and I can tell you that there was still one particular one that we were involved in an auction for and the valuation that that property went for, we did not win it. But the valuation that property went for was non economic. I mean just plain non economic. I would challenge the buyer to explain where the economic return was in that particular deal. They obviously have their reasons and they obviously saw something rest of us didn\u2019t appreciate. I\u2019d say is an understatement but the evaluation are at a level in some cases that you have to question prudence. And I think at the end of the day while we got strategic reasons we want to expand our footprint in different places. Those valuations when we redeploy the capital on behalf of our shareholders have to make some sense. And I don\u2019t think that we are anymore, and I think we are prudent, I think we\u2019re disciplined, I think we\u2019ve made good deals in the past. I've gone through so much of this where I've heard we paid too much, we didn\u2019t pay enough, we got a good deal et cetera. But I think some of things I saw last year said but I don't think I mind of losing that one. I don\u2019t think I've minded not participating that one. So I think right now, first of all I don\u2019t see a lot that people are offering up for sale in effect and you know the old maxim; everything is for sale at some price. Well the price of some of these things would be for sale at isn\u2019t prudent, it just isn\u2019t prudent. So I think you have to step back and say we\u2019re not in that zone. We\u2019re not going to be that irrational in some cases and that\u2019s me, I mean I hate that I\u2019m going to see some of this in print later but I think that. So, you look at some of the currencies and some of the weakening of the currencies, we would do a lot of those deals in local currency, in fact almost all of them in local currency and I\u2019d say based on where those currency rates are today you could say it\u2019s time, this is the time because there is not as much currency rift in a purchase in that particular market et cetera. But I think if I would think about mix of geographies and the mix of currencies and so forth that we currently have, I'm not sure investors would applaud further wading toward it just now. I think there is a prime issue here. I\u2019d tell you, having said that if there was a right opportunity and the right place and I believe that we are strategically very important to us or real opportunity for investors and you know the balance of what we first saw in both of that market in the position, currency and so forth. They are all lined up and the valuation looked good, I\u2019d probably do that deal but that was a step up of a lot of ifs right now. So you\u2019d say what's changed? I\u2019d say where I\u2019m looking and what I\u2019m considering it hasn\u2019t changed, it\u2019s just shifted in some of its balance. I think, I\u2019ve got all the same sort of pharmaceutical opportunities on my radar screen but I\u2019m prioritizing some others now that are maybe more important I think in this market, this environment in terms of strengthening our businesses. Now I\u2019ve heard other CEOs say the same thing, I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say actually, I\u2019ve mostly heard bankers say that it\u2019s a very robust, everybody is out there trying to buy stuff market. I\u2019ve heard it more from bankers than from other companies reporting. I don\u2019t think there is that many things out there for people to consider in our spaces. I don\u2019t think there is that many properties, I don\u2019t think there is that many assets, I don\u2019t think there that much to consolidate. So I think it\u2019s fairly predictable particularly for an analyst in this space as you are to predict the kind of things that people are going to be looking at there is not a lot out there to consider. So I think for us we know what our strategic priorities are. We know what can help our business. We know where there's real plusses and opportunities and the question is whether or not the other parties whoever they maybe see the same sort of opportunity and we can come together on an overlap of valuation and make something happen. I know that sounds like textbook platitude but that\u2019s really what it is. There is a lot of people at the dance looking at each other and trying to decide whether they want to dance but I don\u2019t think there is that many opportunities to be made and everybody is in the same environment where they think their own evaluations are low and they are looking at evaluations from last year that will turn a high and I think you\u2019re in a zone where people are adjusting to what's my value. And so having said all that, am I any less focused on it? No, I\u2019m probably more focused on it if anything. But I\u2019d say we\u2019re also pretty analytical about what we can do with the businesses and what's the right valuation and what's the right timing and so forth because you know we don\u2019t get swept up in deal heat. We\u2019re fairly strategic about it and I know that a lot of people think that a lot happened last year and we should have been in the midst of it but I didn\u2019t see anything go by that I felt particularly bad about not being in the mix of it. I mentioned there was one particular one we were in the hunt on and the evaluation at the end was so high, I don\u2019t mind missing it at all. So I realize that\u2019s a long ramble for you Mike but that probably gives you a fair degree of insight into how I\u2019m thinking about it. We\u2019re definitely not inactive that\u2019s for sure. Mike Weinstein : Listen, I have follow-ups, but I'm going to let some others jump in. Thanks, Miles. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Kristen Stewart : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to kind of follow up, I guess, along Mike's line of thinking, I know you talked a lot about more from a geographic point of view. I was just wondering if you could talk more about the balance of Abbott from more of a business mix point of view. Has the way that you've looked at the mix of Abbott from that perspective changed over the last kind of year or so, really since the spin of AbbVie? And if I look at the growth rates for this year, medical devices, the growth operationally was 1.5. If that division were to be separated out, I just look at Abbott as - it would be even stronger as a company and how do you think about that franchise and strengthening it, or just kind of the composition of Abbott today and the future. Miles White : Well I think I\u2019d start with that would be all about strengthening rather than separating out, but we're committed to all four major segments that we have in the company. One of the important things about those segments is they are in relative balance in terms of size, sales, profitability et cetera. They have all got you now somewhat different dynamics and they have also got a lot in common, because the EPD and nutrition globally, they share a lot of channel dynamics and so forth devices, diagnostics, I mean there is a lot of different things going on with these businesses. But I\u2019d say first is balance matters in the mix with the investment identity of the company for a investor because we want to be reliable performer steadily over time. And as you know our proprietary pharma business avaricely grew to a terrific size and based on one product in particular. And so we were out of balance as a company and so we split into two companies. But we got balance in these businesses. That said, you know I\u2019d say from an M&A perspective and the places where we are looking to be perfectly fair, we are not looking to do anything with regard to M&A in our nutrition business today. I mean if something came along opportunistically we would look at everything but the fact is that business is - that\u2019s an organic business for us and all of our performance objectives and things we want to do in the nutrition business globally are organically driven and we think we\u2019re in a good position for all of that. So the kind of investments that we make in those businesses and we\u2019re a capital plant et cetera in the right market for the world and managing supply chains and so forth. The other three businesses are each a different tale, you know diagnostics I\u2019d say we got a very strong business here. It\u2019s actually a diverse business. It\u2019s wanted in a segment of diagnostics and if we opportunistically could add to it we would. Obviously all the criteria you look at have to make sense but that\u2019s a business where we don\u2019t really have to but if we had opportunities we will. EPD similar, you know we\u2019ve got a gem of a business there and having done a lot of things to shape that business in the last several years, we are in the right growth markets, we\u2019re in high growth markets, we\u2019re in markets where the profitability and the market development, the retail facing, all the structural and channel dynamics for a brand of generics are good. We\u2019ve identified like let\u2019s say in priority 15 countries in particular that meet our criteria and we\u2019ve got strong positions and most of those particularly important ones and we\u2019re always looking to enhance our footprint in those markets if we can and expand our brands in those markets. Latin America was a great example of that and so there is still many geographic opportunities to do so, but I always make the distinction to investors and others that it\u2019s really where we can distinctively differentiate branded generic pharmaceuticals which means retail and channel and so forth right till the end, other Latin American countries and so forth. And so when we have those opportunities it\u2019s great to add on but what we\u2019ve got is core business now, a very strong branded generic international largely focused on emerging market business where there is tremendous tailwind of market growth. So that\u2019s one that\u2019s opportunistic. And then devices, I\u2019d say it\u2019s some of both. We look at that, we\u2019d always want to strengthen that business, we do wish to strengthen that business, there are a number of ways for doing that and obviously there is organic in-house and then there is our venture organization where we're building a number of small companies who are investing in other early stage companies and so forth and building our pipelines for the future. And then finally, opportunistically, there are available opportunities where it fits our market segments and so forth, and then there is always M&A. So we are always mindful of those opportunities. It gives you a sense of how we think about each of those segments. Would you think about something completely unrelated difference? Probably not. There are too many opportunities to build or strengthen the ones we have, and their needs from a strengthening standpoint vary. Some have more need to have more breadth of product than others and some are purely opportunistic. Kristen Stewart : Okay. And then just thinking about -- I know one of the areas that you've highlighted earlier was building out the capacity for FreeStyle Libre. What about the U.S. timing for that and is that going to be a consumer product, or is that just going to be more of the physician product? Scott Leinenweber : Well, I think it depends on what timeframe you're asking. And it's going to be both, eventually. I mean, right now, I want the fastest regulatory path possible. This product has been exceptionally well received in Europe. Spectacularly well received I should say. Consumers and users and diabetics and so forth have just given us an over whelming positive response. So that's good and we're just in the process now to releasing all the new capacity we invested in, in the last year. And we got the next way to capacity expansion underway. So it's kind of one of those great challenges where I want to play from my own perspective. The diabetic community in United States wants this product. And it's a regulatory pacing issue here. It wasn't so in Europe. And I would say no more about that, but I'm in a hurry because we know the value of the product. We know the reception of the product. We know what the physician community reception of the product is. We know all of that and the value proposition of this product on top of the medical proposition is just fabulous. I have great expectations for it. I'm excited about it. And there is sort of two dimensions to that. One is enough capacity, which for a while we'll have and then we'll have another tranche coming on. And the regulatory process for how fast we can go. Kristen Stewart : Any sense on when the first product could hit market in the U.S.? Scott Leinenweber : I'm one of those superstitious people that no matter what I tell, I'm going to be wrong. And so I don't want to jinx anything. So I'll say, I would optimistically hope towards this year, but I don't know. Kristen Stewart : Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much for question. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Glenn Novarro : Hi, good morning, guys. Miles, first question is on the Mylan stake. I'm wondering if you'll give us an update on this stake. What you're thinking is -- in the past you've said you're not going to be a long-term holder. Are you any closer to selling that stake? And will the sale be associated with some M&A? Thanks. Miles White : Well, good news. You're right. We're not going to be a long term shareholder of Mylan. But the good news is, we don't have to sell it right away. We have the freedom to sell it. We just don't have an immediate reason to have to. So I'd say we can leave it in Mylan shares or we can leave it in cash, either way. And you ask if it had something to do with M&A. Well, obviously that might trigger it. I think it depends on what the price of Mylan is in the market and the manner in which we might market our shares and so forth. There is a couple of dynamics there, but I would confirm. No. We don't intend to be long-term Mylan holders. And well, we don't think holding this back is probably trigger of M&A activity. Maybe a little evaluation, but we're not particularly hung up on value right now. We did watch the entire Perrigo process and hoped for a path and we though until that stabilize and was finished, there was no point in being in the way of that. So that happened, that stabilized, that's finished. There is a stable market now for Mylan shares. And we'll just wait and see what triggers it. But we otherwise have no reason to move one way or other until there is some trigger like M&A, I would guess. Glenn Novarro : Okay. Let me just follow up -- Miles White : If the price were to rocket north, we'd probably view that as a trigger too, to be obvious. Glenn Novarro : Let me ask a specific question on your vascular business because, if you strip out currency, I think over the last 12 months, even going forward, most of the businesses are on track, at least performing in line with our expectations. But the vascular business continues to come -- at least relative to our expectations, continues to come in below. And I know you highlighted Absorb, but a lot of our channel checks are not very positive on Absorb. So I guess my question is what's the commitment to this vascular business? Is this a business that you need to build up through M&A and the reason why we haven't seen a lot of M&A, is it because the targets have still unrealistic valuations? Thanks. Miles White : Well, I'll say couple of things. First of all, we're committed to the business. And I think these are the bigger market conditions here. If you look at the markets around the world, not just the U.S. but literally every major country in the world, the markets have stabilized among competitors. Share doesn't move a lot. It does moves a little. The provisions in these spaces -- they take a new product and they experiment with it a little bit and that's about it. The innovation here is at a point where I'd say, the incremental value recognized by the healthcare system is limited. If you think about what drug code it stands for and so forth have done in the vascular space, it's been a tremendous boon in the treatment of patients. But I think now what we see is this market is far more driven by cost and prices in either countries or hospital groups and others, trying to manage the overall cost of healthcare. So I think all of us see the same dynamics where we're increasingly challenged on more value proposition than just innovation. And I think increasingly the payer, whether it's government or purchasing people or insurer, whatever it is are increasingly more influential here than preference of physicians. You say, well, those aren't very good dynamics. Well, they are not bad dynamics either. We have to compete in this business just like we compete in a lot of other businesses. And I think we and our competitors in this business are all broadening our product lines or innovating in other surrounding spaces and broadening those offerings in the space. And there is still a lot of room to innovation, but it may not be specifically just on the stents. So that - what behooves us is to expand our business and to some degree, or to a large degree, that is M&A. And in our case it's been a lot of small-ball M&A and look to expand around those businesses might require to Absorb those kind of things or incremental. Well, MitraClip is very significant that way. We look at expanding into structural heart or heart failure or other categories, and we're trying to build our breadth in those other -- let's say, surrounding spaces that way. I don't think that's very different for any of the companies in this business, worldwide. I think it's been difficult for any market that have been kind of a robust-innovation driven growth that this one did back in early 2000s. It's a different market today. It's a different market everywhere, today. So is it a slower growth market? Yes. Is it still a very attractive market? Yes. It's still a very profitable market for all participants. And it's why it gets a lot of pressure from a cost standpoint from payers, etcetera. I don't think that's a secret to anybody. So while other make it a --performance of the business and say, gee, it's a little lower expectations. I'm beginning to think its just robust adjusting our expectations to sort of a reality of the value propositions in the market today. And so I think it's a very strong business, it's a very healthy one in recent that respect. We still invest quite substantially in R&D and innovations there, and clinical trials and so forth. We get innovations that are in R&D and in the clinical space and a lot of investments around it. So would it benefit from a much broader footprint? Well, it probably would. The question is how to get to that broader footprint. And I think the current medical device space broadly defined today, there is either a bunch of big companies or bunch of little companies. There is not much in the middle. And the couple of things in the middle are extremely highly valued relative to their current performance. And I think there is a lot of speculation or question about whether or not that kind of value will play out. So it will just evolve in little time. We've made a lot of investments in a smaller companies or segments, as you know, whether Tendyne or Cephea or others to expand our footprint here. So I think -- I believe in medical device space right now and long term, but I don't think it will be the same kind of space it was10, 15 years ago. Glenn Novarro : You had mentioned priorities. Is vascular higher up on your priority list now? Miles White : Well, that implies it wasn't before. I would say the device space has always been high on my priority list. And whether its -- the vascular space or the optic space or whatever, this has been high on priority list for a while. Glenn Novarro : Okay. Great. Thank you, Miles. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It's just a one clarification question and then two real questions. On the emerging market growth in Q4, can you give us the trend of the organic constant currency growth for this quarter, please? Brian Yoor : Yes. Larry, if you look at the quarter and you take out the impact of what we talked about a little bit slow in Venezuela throughout the year, we are in the double-digit range for emerging markets across Abbott's businesses. The emerging market momentum -- Larry Biegelsen : Sorry, Brian, that was for Q4 2015? Brian Yoor : Q4 2015. And for the four years as well, double-digit growth to the underlying momentum continues in the '16 as well. Larry Biegelsen : Okay. Thanks for that. And then so for my two real questions, one is on deal size. Miles, you've talked about in the past a sweet spot of $5 billion to $7 billion. That's one thing you haven't touched upon this morning. Any color on that? Is that still the case? And then I had one follow-up. Thanks. Brian Yoor : In reality, we've got a lot of capacity and it just depends. We've obviously done a lot of small things and small can be measured in a lot of ways. I can remember when I thought a $1 billion dollars was huge. Now people seem to think of that as dinky. We've done a lot of things smaller than that and also mid size -- I don't feel constrained at $7 billion. I don't feel constrained at $8 billion or $10 billion. I don't feel constrained. So I'd say look if the opportunity is right, the strategic fit is right and the valuation is right, I don't feel constrained by size right now. Larry Biegelsen : That's very helpful. And then I hope you understand the spirit of this question, because it's kind of a question that we'll probably get today. But I was struck by your comment earlier, Miles, when you said every year there is some outlier somewhere when you were talking about Venezuela. And I think, in the past, Abbott would absorb those outliers. So I guess why not now and what can you do to kind of mitigate that in the future? Thanks. Miles White : Well, I think that's a good question. And I'd say what we always do everything we can to mitigate. Here is what's different this time. Last year exchange was a strong headwind for any U.S.-based multinational across the board. And I recall at this very time last year from December to now, you'll recall both oil and exchange kind of hit, kind of sudden hit accepted the oil price drop at that point was a very high level -- much higher level than where we are today. But there was this sudden hit in sort of late fourth quarter '14 and then in early '15, and everybody scrambled to readjust their ETF guidance for the year to try to deal with what they saw coming as currency and was already happening. And a lot of companies dialed back to single digit or whatever and laid it on exchange and so forth, which was valid. In our case, we said -- we think we can navigate through it and we did. And we had extremely strong underlying growth in our market as we still do. And it wasn't just double digits. It's been healthy double digits all year long. And so in our case, we were able to mitigate and off of lot of that exchange all year long and still deliver what was frankly very differentiated higher growth than many, many of our peers, even multinational peers not in healthcare. And what we got now is another year on top of that, okay, same sort of thing. And if you look at the exchange rate graphs, who would have thought these exchange rate could in a lot of cases, be even bigger. Even bigger exchange rates -- how we want to translate it to have stronger philosophy on the other side. And then on top of that, nobody predicted $25 to $30 oil. Now, that's a curve ball for the whole world. As so when you throw that curve ball in there, it dramatically unbalances the mix of their currencies because of the oil-based economies where lower oil prices really affect the underlying performance of the country. So you take a country like Russia or Venezuela or Saudi Arabia. Now these are countries, they are all strong countries for us. And to different degrees they\u2019ve been impacted by their own oil revenues and therefore their own ability to pay for products. Now, having said that, is Russia still a strong market for us? It is. Do we have the same kind of difficulties in Russia that we have in Venezuela? We don't. It is a fundamentally good market, strong underlying market et cetera. The only thing it\u2019s not strong is the Ruble which is dramatically weaker versus the Dollar than even a year ago. And so there is this disproportionate imbalance in the pressures in the currency basket if you will from a little handful of countries where they already had currency translation, challenges just like the rest of the world. Except that they have oil dependence on top of it which amplifies it even more. And when you start to stack up all of those things, you\u2019ll say, okay, could we navigate through this? And the answer is, we could. I can cut a lot of expenses, I can delay a lot of investments. There is a lot of things that frankly, I have the discretion to do. We, as a company have the discretion to do. And I could then say to you, we\u2019ll either have 5% earnings growth or high single digit earnings growth, but in our judgment, this year is so unusual this way with the ongoing depth of currency walls and the unusual circumstance of oil prices and its impact on its economies, that I would look out and say, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent to compromise our ability to the laughter all this underlying growth for one year. In suspect it\u2019s more prudent to take out Venezuela out of the assumptions. It\u2019s more prudent to take that one out and keep right ongoing, and I think if you believe in the underlying strength of economies around the world, the ones that are delivering growth, and if you believe in the underlying growth of healthcare and those economies, and you believe in the underlying growth of all our products, if you believe in Abbott\u2019s ability to continue to access all that growth, then my judgment was okay, I\u2019m going to roll out of the pocket here, take Venezuela out of the assumption. If I hadn\u2019t taken Venezuela out of the assumptions, I'd be telling you right now that you are going to have mid-single digit growth on the top and bottom line. And you know something you think that was terrific in this environment. And if you compare this to all the other multination in our phase or, frankly, other multinational species, they\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s right now with everybody else. So in this case we said, if don\u2019t want to artificially compromise our investments in a lot of these businesses, whether it\u2019s an SG&A investment or R&D or whatever, because of Venezuela. So I think I\u2019m going to take that one out and keep right ongoing because I believe in the longer term growth prospects of these economies in these businesses, and I\u2019m not going to compromise that for couple of quarters in Venezuela, so at the end of day, could we manage through it? Yes. And you know this. If you look back at even 10 years of track record of Abbott, it\u2019s absolutely been reliable at double digit bottom line and high single-digit topline unlike almost any other large, diverse multinational out there. We\u2019ve been a very reliable performer that way in a very diverse world. So I don\u2019t say all that defensively, even though it might sound like it. I look at the world and say man, this is like a total different circumstance that anyone of us have ever seen. And that\u2019s going to make a judgment of how far do I go to push off what we ought to be doing to sort of wait out this oddball storm we\u2019re in. And I think there\u2019s a lot of people who project oil prices are going to stay down for a long time. And yet everyone says, yes, but what is down. And At what point do these oil driven economies start performing better, 60 bucks, 70 bucks, 50 bucks? There is different thresholds where the performance of economy change dramatically through a lot of different businesses in the world, not just us. In our case, healthcare is pretty good, no matter what the oil price is. The dynamics of Venezuela are unique. They are unique. And even the Saudis. Do they still spend on healthcare? Yes, they do. It\u2019s still a very strong important market for us and so is Russia and so on. So I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a long round of a way of saying, we made a deliberate decision. It was discretionary. Could I have made the decision to say, I\u2019m going to deliver high single-digit earnings no matter what? Yes probably, but I\u2019d have had to compromise the underlying momentum and whereas I didn\u2019t think it was prudent. For exchange, yes we can manage exchange. Venezuela, I think it\u2019s more prudent to just take Venezuela out of the mix in terms of what our expectations are and that\u2019s an unusual anomaly. I challenge back to 2015, we lived through exchange, can we live through exchange again? Yes we can. And the single biggest in difference in our guidance for this year is actually Venezuela. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question but that was my judgment you know it\u2019s not an inability, it\u2019s more of a decision. If you look at our spending rates and stuff in our go forward guidance our spending rates are healthy. Larry Biegelsen : Very helpful, thanks Miles. Operator : The next question comes from Mr. Rick Wise of Stifel Nicolaus. Sir your line is open. Rick Wise : Thanks for the question. Miles, hard to resist just asking one more question on Venezuela, and I totally understand the point you were making there. But you sort of said in your last comment that maybe a quarter or two of headwind. Wouldn't it be more prudent to think this might be a couple of year issue and might be structural? And then just as part of that, maybe for Brian, is the simple monkey math on this - you're really growing mid-teens, some of that 15%. If Venezuela is a 5% hit to EPS growth and FX is 10%, that's what you're really growing on a sustained basis. Miles White : Yes let me deal with your Venezuela question first and then I'll let Brian wrap up with, close on what he just said about our growth rate. You know you could be dead right about Venezuela, I don\u2019t know but here is the difference for us. We\u2019re healthcare company and among our businesses there are products that are medically necessary and we have to pay attention to medically necessary. We don\u2019t have to lose money all the time, we don\u2019t have to be irrational, for whatever reason but we\u2019re mindful that we\u2019re a healthcare company. We\u2019re mindful that we have medically necessary products. We\u2019re mindful that we\u2019ve been in Latin America and in Venezuela for decades and a lot of times in the past in decades, foreign companies have exited those countries immediately when the economics turned sour. And the long term commitment to that continent, the governments of those countries and the healthcare systems of those countries, they know that and they recognize that. Abbott has never done that in 90 years in Latin America and we are a fundamentally large healthcare provider in Latin America. So our judgment was to make these decisions one step at a time as we see how circumstances develop. It\u2019s a pretty big decision that we\u2019ve taken just to say we\u2019re going to take the sales and profit expectations out of our expectations for the year so that our investors, frankly you\u2019re getting news today that we\u2019re taking it out of our expectations right, and yet all I\u2019m trying to do here is de-risk your expectations, de-risk your riding the roller coaster volatility here with that particular country, because that one\u2019s unique. And so we just chose to take it out of the estimates because we know we\u2019re going to continue to have medically necessary products there but that\u2019s going to be in our view at a much lower promotional level even in the past. So for right now I think that\u2019s the right prudent place to be for that change I suppose anything to change. I hope the change is more favorably frankly but I\u2019m not listening through the graveyard, I just know that they are in a very tough circumstance as a country and they are volatile, they are unpredictable and it\u2019s not a very reliable market as markets go. So I think this is the right step, you could say we shouldn\u2019t just go a lot further and I\u2019d say you know you could say that if you were just in some common industrial consumer or whatever good but I don\u2019t think as an healthcare company you can quite do the same things. So, I think we have to be a little prudent here about the medically necessary part, that\u2019s why we\u2019re where we are. And Brain you can address Rick\u2019s final comment about underlying growth rate. Brian Yoor : Sure. Rick, when you think about Venezuela and a decision to derisk this and just assume for a second if that\u2019s your reality, your growth rate it doesn\u2019t change. Your growth rate will actually become better as you move through time, so nothing\u2019s changed about Abbott\u2019s growth perspective, they may even become better. When you think about what I\u2019ve said and what you\u2019ve modeled in '15, you know that we had mid-teens underlying growth not for the impact of foreign exchange and we take these things that we talked about into account be about the de-risking of Venezuela on what it means to our earnings, as well as the FX, you are going to get right back to the mid teens. Miles White : Rick, I think you did a better job summarizing than Brian did Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. And that concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor website at abbottinvestor.com, and after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time via telephone at 203-369-3630, passcode 6422. The audio replay will be available until 4 :00 p.m. Central Time on Thursday, February 11. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Abbott's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session. The entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President-Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration; and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks; and Brian will discuss performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Tom, Brian and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that first quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS, and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles D. White: Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.41, exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales increased 5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals. As you know, we've been taking important strategic steps to expand our footprint in the world's fastest-growing geographies and have been investing in R&D that has resulted in numerous new product launches across our businesses. These actions and investments are driving our strong first quarter performance, which I'll briefly review by business. I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 7% in the quarter driven by continued above market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. We continue to capture share and win new accounts with our customer-focused solutions, which we further enhance with an unprecedented series of new instrument launches over the next few years. We continue to make great progress on the next-generation diagnostics systems and point-of-care, immunoassay testing, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening. These new systems are being designed with the customer in mind, incorporating the features that are deemed most important, including increased automation, higher throughput and enhanced user interface. We'll provide more details on our launch plans of these systems in the coming quarters. In Nutrition, both pediatric and adult nutrition grew roughly 4.5% in the quarter, above market performance; and U.S. pediatric nutrition was led by strong performance of recently launched non-GMO products for infants and toddlers. Internationally, pediatric nutrition growth was led by continued share expansion of Eleva in the premium segment of the Chinese market, as well as continued strong growth in Russia and across several countries in Latin America. In adult nutrition, where Abbott is the global leader, sales growth was led by Ensure in the retail and institutional segments of the U.S. market, as well as double-digit growth in several Latin American countries as we continued to expand the adult nutrition category globally. In Medical Devices, sales growth was led by 5.5% growth in Medical Optics, where we continue to capture share and drive growth in our portfolio of recently launched premium cataract lens products. Earlier this month, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia that is capable of producing over 4 million lenses a year to meet the growing demand for our products. In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of 11% was driven by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre in Europe. During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre received European approval for use in children and teens who can now manage their diabetes without the need for routine finger sticks. We expect growth in our diabetes business to accelerate in the coming quarters as we meet increasing demand for Libre from consumers and healthcare professionals; and we also look forward to bringing Libre to new markets, including the U.S. In Vascular, modest growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation and strong performance in our Endovascular business, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the superficial femoral artery. And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales growth of 11% was led by continued double-digit growth in India, which comprises more than 20% of EPD sales, including strong growth in the therapeutic areas of women's health, gastroenterology and cardio-metabolics. We also achieved above market growth in China and several countries in Latin America as we continue to expand our presence and portfolios in these geographies. Finally, given our performance in the first quarter, coupled with an improving exchange outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.14 to $2.24. So in summary, we're off to a good start this year with each of our four businesses having met or exceeded growth expectations for the quarter and with good progress on our new product initiatives. So I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Brian B. Yoor: Okay. Thanks, Miles. First, I'll provide further details on the first quarter results. Sales for the quarter increased 5.1% on an operational basis. Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 5.3% on sales resulting in relatively flat reported sales in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.8% of sales; adjusted R&D investment was nearly 7% of sales; and adjusted SG&A expense was nearly 34% of sales. Turning to the details of our full year 2016 outlook. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2% on our full year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low-single digits for the full year 2016. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across the business. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. This would result in full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations. For the second quarter, today, we are issuing ongoing earnings per share guidance of $0.52 to $0.54, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the second quarter. At current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange of around 3%, resulting in reported sales in the low-single digits. I'll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter operational sales growth outlook by business. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast sales to increase mid to high-single digits. In Vascular, we forecast relatively flat sales growth. In Diabetes Care, we forecast mid-single digit sales growth. In Medical Optics, we forecast mid-single digit sales growth. And lastly, in Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single digit sales growth in the second quarter. Turning back to the other aspects of the P&L, for the second quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 57%; adjusted R&D investment somewhat above 6.5% of sales; and adjusted SG&A expense of around 31.5% of sales. And finally, for the second quarter, we project specified items of $0.14. And now with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question or comment is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brittany Henderson : Hi, everybody. It's Brittany Henderson in for Kristen Stewart. I just wanted to kind of start on a high-level basis. The Medical Devices business kind of continues to be somewhat of a drag on the overall business. So we just wanted to kind of get your thoughts on just the outlook for Abbott Pharmaceuticals with Medical Devices and how that kind of fits along with the other segments of the business? How it fits in with Nutrition and Diagnostics in the Established Pharma business? Brian B. Yoor: Yeah, this is Brian. I'll start off and open up to Miles. I think you've got to look within Medical Devices, and there are a lot of bright spots here in terms of what's growing. If you look at MitraClip, we had 40% growth in the quarter; and that's a space we're early to and it could be a large market here. If you look at our Supera product \u2013 again a newly added product in the not too distant past \u2013 it's grown double-digits for the quarter. And coupled with that, our vessel closure business has also led to real strong growth in the Endovascular. Clearly, as you see, on the stent side, it is a flattish market. But even then, we're excited about our portfolio we have. It provides a great contribution to our business. And if you look at where we're at now, we've stabilized our share of where we're at and we're excited about bringing Absorb into the portfolio ultimately and to further compete in this aspect of the business. Miles, I don't know if you'd add anything to that? Miles D. White: The only thing I'd add to that is we got Absorb coming in the U.S. and Europe. We got a number of things happening here from a new product standpoint and expansion of the business that I think are all good for the business going forward here. So I think it's all good. Okay? Brittany Henderson : Okay. Thank you for taking the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David R. Lewis: Good morning. Miles, I wanted to start off with Alere and just sort of reflecting on investor commentary here in the first quarter. I think we talk to investors. I think they understand the ability to take out margins with Alere potentially. And given the success of the Diagnostics management team in Abbott, they seem to have a high degree of confidence in your ability to do that. Where they seem to be getting hung up is this, the growth opportunity for Alere, right? They see Abbott as large-cap growth company and they're buying a business that has below Abbott growth rates. How would you comment on sort of how you see Alere from a top line growth perspective over time both market and the particular company? Miles D. White: I look more at the Diagnostics business broadly in all phases, all segments, and I look at it globally and I look at it by testing categories, not just point of care, or core lab, or blood screening, or molecular testing and so forth. And I think our Diagnostics business has shown that there is good growth to be had and good growth if you're innovative and your systems and your products are responsive to customer needs. I think all the segments of Diagnostics provide a growth opportunity. And I think that our own business in particular has shown that not only is there growth opportunity everywhere it competes, but it can manage margin, it can manage cost, it can manage product innovation; it can do all that. So I would comment on the overall Diagnostics growth opportunity as demonstrated by Abbott's Diagnostics business and not specific to any one company. David R. Lewis: Okay. And then, Brian, just a clarification. I'm trying to kind of reconcile organic growth in the quarter. So we're basically taking a 5% operational plus like two points of Venezuela and getting something around 7%. Is that kind of in the ballpark? Brian B. Yoor: That's in the ballpark. You're right there. Miles D. White: Yeah. You may have noted that a lot of these businesses globally in different geographic segments were growing 10%, 11% on the top line in the quarter. So it was a pretty strong quarter across the board there, David. David R. Lewis: Yeah, agreed. Thanks so much for the clarification. Miles D. White: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein : Thanks. Miles, just to clarify, on Alere, are you reaffirming your commitment to the transaction? Miles D. White: I am going to be careful how I answer any questions about Alere, Mike, because as you know they've had delays filing their 10-K. We don't know when they'll file their proxy. We don't know when they're going to have a shareholder vote. So right now I'd say it's not appropriate for me to comment on Alere. Michael Weinstein : Okay. And let me ask \u2013 I've got a bunch of questions already this morning just on the guidance raise relative to the FX delta from the 4Q call to today, depending on peoples math, anybody who has gotten anywhere from $0.06 to $0.12 of basically earnings delta from the impact of FX from when currency was on the fourth quarter call to where it is today. But you only raised guidance by $0.04 including the beat today. So could you just walk through your math, Brian, on FX and the headwind for 2016 today versus what it was three months ago? Miles D. White: Before I turn that over to Brian, Mike, let me tell you a couple of things as background. First of all, you know that the exchange impact for us lags on the bottom line relative to the top line because it's got to pass through inventory, et cetera. So we do have that lag. And that's always a little difficult for us to precisely call. And we get very close, but it's always a little difficult to precisely call depending on the currency of the world and depending on inventories and so forth, and sales, and sales mix in that given geography. And as you know, because we've got such a broad market basket of currencies, that's a little more difficult to call precisely; and it does lag, as you've already acknowledged. So while I'd say, look, I like what I'm starting to see is the easing in exchange. But given the last few years, I'm a superstitious person and I think the minute I think this is starting to go well, for some reason we're going to get smacked down with some change in the market. For the last two years in the third quarter and fourth quarter we've seen some events, some economic events of some kind alter the world's view of economies and then a change in exchange. And more recently, last fall, it was $30 oil. So if there's some caution in the raise and I'd say if things don't \u2013 if we get no curve balls, you're probably right. Call it the curve ball discount there, I'm just waiting to see another quarter. And right now, I'd say all indicators are looking favorable for improvement as the year goes on. I actually want to see some of that improvement sustained; meaning, economic conditions and exchange. And, plus I'm mindful of the fact that we made adjustments to our estimates here in the fourth quarter call three months ago that clearly some of that has changed with exchange, but it can change in as little as a quarter. So with the current circumstances of the world and what everybody is talking about in terms of real negative interest rates and so forth, that actually favors weakness to the dollar for us right now. And I hope that continues for some time here, but I just want to see some of it before I go further. Michael Weinstein : Brian, did you want to add to that? Miles D. White: Brian, do you want to play in on that? Brian B. Yoor: No. I think you perfectly articulated it. Q1 and Q2, as we talked before, Mike, is largely locked due to the dynamics Miles discussed on the timing of flow through. So really this is a second half phenomena. Miles D. White: I mean, Mike, if you look at it this way, the sales strength on the top line is frankly my leading indicator here of we're above all of your estimates. Frankly, we're above our own and \u2013 for the first quarter. That's a good thing going into the year and it's across all businesses and most geographies. So that to me is a pretty strong indicator. And if exchange does improve arithmetically, as you described, of course that only gets better too. So whether we forecast it now or actually experience it later, we'll see. Michael Weinstein : Okay. One follow-up, Miles, and I'll jump. Can you talk about pricing across your Nutritionals business? I'm asking because in the 10-K, annually you guys disclose the contribution from price to each of your different businesses. And in Nutritionals, if we went back a couple of years, price was a pretty significant contributor. And I think back in 2012 it was a 4.5% contributor to the top line growth of the business; 2013 was 3.2%; and 2014 it was basically 1%; and last year it was zero. So the contribution from price has obviously eroded over time. And we hear in the Mead Johnson calls, we hear of the Danone calls talking about pricing pressure in China and other markets. So can you just talk about that business and that end market? And obviously we're talking about a bunch of different end markets, but can you talk about those end markets and what's happening with the price and your view on them? Miles D. White: Yeah. I think it's different by geography. First of all, I think all your facts and all the stuff you just quoted, absolutely right. And actually there's a couple things there. One, you know that in the last, call it, two years, certain countries, China, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, have taken unilateral government actions to pound down price of the multinationals in particular in those countries in reaction to price increases taken by multinational competitors in those countries over the prior few years. And our ability to be commercially successful around the world depends on healthy happy markets and happy governments in some cases. So I'd say to the extent that that influences the degree to which companies are able to take price, I think that has some influence. I also think that there's the overall balance of consumer demand, consumer absorption, et cetera. And what I've been pushing with our team is let's compete on product and volume and share gain. The prices in the market, for now, they're healthy. And to be truly competitively healthy I think we have to be able to win share, win the shelf space, win the consumer, win the physician, win the recommendation, et cetera; and that's where we put a lot of our emphasis. So to the extent that we have not put further emphasis on price in the last couple of years, it's primarily to sharpen our own competitiveness and compete, I'd say, at a pretty effective level on all other dimensions. I think from a business fundamentals standpoint that's important. I want real growth, not just masked growth because we took price. But I think at the same time the opportunity for us here is pretty good. I mean these are healthy products. This is a robust segment of business. In all these countries profit is not challenged. And I think we're just drawing, call it, a little different balance in terms of how we want to be competitive versus relying on price alone or too significantly in the mix. So I'd say have the dynamics intimidated price? I'd say dynamics have pushed price to a more appropriately balanced level. And in our case I want the emphasis on real share gain, and product growth, and market segment growth. And to the extent that at some point there is opportunity for price, we certainly know that. But I think price is easy, and sometimes too easy. Michael Weinstein : Thank you, Miles. I appreciate it. Miles D. White: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Robert Adam Hopkins : Hi. Thanks, and good morning. Thanks for taking the call. Two questions. First one, I wanted to ask on just capital allocation. Miles, is M&A still a top priority for you from a capital allocation perspective? And then within the different divisions, is it safe to say that Vascular remains a very high priority given the growth rate relative to your other divisions? Miles D. White: Yes to both. No change. Same top priority; same focus. The only thing I'm cautious about, Bob, that I'd say is different, while I think there are opportunities, as I've said before, in the pharmaceutical arena \u2013 and remember we're only in the branded generic pharmaceutical business in emerging markets, we're not in the U.S. or Europe in pharmaceuticals \u2013 but in those markets, I have noted from time to time a lot of opportunities to add to our platform. We have, in that business, really strong positions in the markets we focused on and great depth and breadth. And I think we've chosen our countries well. I think we've chosen our breadth and depth well. So we've got an EPD that now, post-shaping of the Europe business and so forth, is a pretty good gem. And there are other properties out there that would expand that footprint and add to it. However, in the last couple of years in particular currency or exchange in those markets has been a pretty heavy headwind. And the expectations of value by potential properties or assets in those markets has been 25 times to 30 times EBITDA which, to be honest, is way out there according to any kind of historic norm. So if you have to go pay that kind of a multiple and then translate back to dollars with a strong currency headwind, you really can't earn the return for your shareholders against that headwind that you need to if you're going to pay that kind of a multiple. So we have sidelined that to a degree. I think we can be selective about given markets. But we've sidelined that while we put our emphasis and focus on other areas of Abbott's business in terms of what we're looking at or what we're interested in. It doesn't mean that we don't think there's wonderful properties in the pharma business, but we're much more selective about geography, what we think we can see as currency headwind, growth of market, et cetera, going forward here because I think we want to be prudent that we earn the return. To a high degree, we're always talking about the underlying growth of the business. Investors got to be able to spin (25:55) the underlying growth; and we got to be able to bring that underlying growth to the real bottom line. So while we do navigate a market basket of currencies in a volatile world economically and we're diverse across all countries and we're in emerging markets for their growth, I think we have to be prudent about when we invest and how we invest in those markets, so that we can bring back the return that it cost us to invest in those markets. So we've kind of put that one, I'd say, partly on the back burner, but it depends on the country. And then, as you say, yeah, it's a high priority for us and we continue to look at opportunities in devices and in diagnostics; and those remain of interest to us. But I know it's a long-winded answer, but that's really how we're thinking about it. Robert Adam Hopkins : No, it's helpful. And then the second thing I wanted to ask you, Miles, is that can you give us a sense of what emerging market revenue growth was in the quarter? And then more importantly, can you just comment broadly on what you're seeing in terms of emerging market economies and the health of the consumer in emerging market relative to what you saw exiting 2015? I mean are things improving, stable? How would you characterize it? Miles D. White: I'd characterize it, first of all, as high-single digit overall, which I think is good. I think it kind of depends. The world wrings its hands about slowing growth rates in China; and China was 6.5%. And I think if any other country of the world was growing 6.5%, we'd all be doing cartwheels and investing heavily. We wring our hands when a country as large as China slows to 6.5%. Even if China were at 5%, I'd think it was pretty attractive. So I'd say I think the growth rates, relatively speaking, are strong. I think you have to take into account here that, historically, if one area of the world was struggling, other areas of the world were pretty strong. It's actually not the case right now. Everything has slowed some, and for all the reasons we know. I think there's a lot of uncertainties around the world right now and I could run through them, but we'd just be in a bad mood afterwards. And I think everybody's kind of waiting to see how some things turn out; and whether exchange stays on a certain track, whether some countries kind of recover, I think people are waiting to see what happens with oil and they're going to wait a while to see that. They're going to wait to see what happens with the interest rates. There's a lot of hand wringing, as I said, over negative interest rates. So there's going to be a lot of things that kind of hang on the world and you say, well, how does that directly affect your business. Well, in healthcare, a lot of healthcare is funded by governments and they are the insurer of their population and so forth and the health of their economies. And as you know, almost half our business is consumer direct in a fashion or consumer pay. So the health of those economies matters. I still believe and continue to believe China, India, Russia, these are all strong markets, notwithstanding the currency speed bumps that we've had here in the last couple of years, but these are strong markets. I think there's solid growth there. Countries like Venezuela, Brazil and some others are obviously of great concern for their own economic circumstances and volatility. I think Venezuela, as we've talked about plenty here, has been a real outlier that way. But I think the emerging markets represent real strong growth. I don't see that slowing. I think the kind of growth rate we see there drives pretty healthy expansion in investment by companies like us; and Europeans and others as well. I mean I think all those markets represent terrific growth, better than developed markets. But I also think if you're innovative and you have new products and you have products that bring value to the healthcare system, I think the U.S. and Europe are also worthy markets for us and remain a focus. These are some of our most important markets. So because we're geographically diverse and we are a multinational, I think they're all pretty healthy. And I think that's reflected right now in our top line, which is pretty strong relative to all the concerns that get expressed about the world's economies and economic growth. I mean one of the best things about healthcare is even in poor economic times, people need healthcare at one level or another. So I'm pretty bullish about the opportunities for us. I think we've all adjusted, industry-wide or even investor-wide, to lower growth rates. And today we talk about 5% like it's a pretty high growth rate; and I have to say it feels pretty good. And 11% feels really good on the top line, and those kinds of things. And I can remember when that didn't feel so good, because we're used to much higher growth rates. But, frankly, in this global economy right now those are pretty healthy returns; and we're conscious of the returns. So I'm still pretty positive about all this. Robert Adam Hopkins : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. David Harrison Roman : Thank you, and good morning everybody. I wanted to start on the operating margins side of the business. And this goes back a little bit to the disclosures that you provided in the 10-K and also some of the longer term margin targets you've put out by segment. If I look at where you're sitting right now in your Nutrition and Diagnostics businesses, both of those look to be pretty close to best-in-class margin. So can you maybe talk about the areas for operating margin improvement? How much of that on a go-forward basis comes from the individual segments versus how much would come from the G&A side or sort of internal restructuring efforts? Brian B. Yoor: Yeah, David. This is Brian. So as you know, we've been going 100 operating basis points, 200 operating basis points per year on an underlying basis; and we continue to see that performance in 2016. Clearly, as you said, we've made great progress in Nutrition as well as Diagnostics as where they stand today, but that's not to say that there isn't additional opportunity. It may not come through at the same pace that you're accustomed to seeing it, but there still is, we believe, remaining opportunity in these businesses to continuously improve our margins. Over the longer term, we have some businesses like Established Pharma. Clearly, there's opportunity there in the coming years. So we see that that could be a driver as part of our contribution. And don't forget, too, we are still working through the phases of what we're doing from a G&A, taking out the unproductive spend around the world when it comes to how we operate and support our businesses, and what's the right shape and what's the right size. So I think taking all these things into consideration, David, we're still targeting around the same range that you've been seeing on an underlying basis. Now FX, as you know, is muting that this year, but the underlying's still there. David Harrison Roman : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe back on the earnings guidance increase, understandably you might not want to get ahead of yourself with respect to currency at this point, but could you maybe just talk about the charge related to Venezuela? It looks like you're taking up the GAAP adjustments from $0.55 to $0.78 this quarter. How much of that is Venezuela? How much of that is cash? And are you moving anything from ongoing to one-time? Brian B. Yoor: No, David, this is just the adjustment we're making in Venezuela, similar you've seen in other countries to take the net monetary write-down at the end of the quarter; and it's somewhere north of $0.30 and we're done. Ongoing earnings, no impact. We'll do business forward at the rate of the new floating rate, which is around 260 (33:29), but any activity that's minimal really won't surface at those rates. David Harrison Roman : Okay. And then just lastly on the top line, you are talking about mid-single digit organic growth over the entire year, but I do think you started at a higher rate than where you had initially contemplated. So given things like FreeStyle Libre and the new platform launches in Diagnostics, is there the potential to see an acceleration from the 5% that you generated this quarter and what you're sort of guiding to in Q2? Miles D. White: Well, the question is how much of that have we already got baked into our estimates for the year and how much of it will exceed that. And let's put it this way. The fact that we're above all of your estimates in the quarter and all businesses performed at or better than expected, I think that's a good sign. I'm just going to wait to see a little more sign. David Harrison Roman : Okay. Understood. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Lawrence Biegelsen : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just one question on EPD and one question on capital allocation and M&A. First, the last couple of quarters for EPD have been quite strong, about 11% constant currency growth, but you're guiding to mid-single digit growth for EPD in Q2, if I heard correctly. So just any color on why that business would slow down? And as I said, I have one follow-up. Brian B. Yoor: I think keep in mind, we talked about this earlier, what our growth would be but for; and this business has the one country we don't talk about. But if you look at India, it's growing double-digits, Larry. So it's doing well. Latin America and CFR, the performance is going well. The integration has gone extremely well. And I will say Russia. As Miles mentioned, that as a strong country. We're doing very well in our performance here in Established Pharma and are achieving what we expect from the Veropharm acquisition that was made. But EPD is not a straight line, Larry, as you know. There's a lot of markets. And so, from time to time there can be simply just some timing of tender. So there may be a little timing. I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves here. Miles D. White: I think that's the best answer, because we have comparisons in quarter to quarter that depend on what happened last year and what country, and the countries don't tend to be the same. And because of the diversity of countries and currencies in this business, it doesn't tend to be that nice reliable ruler business where you can lay a ruler down on the line of growth. It's just bumpy. Now, overall, it's all up and it's all good. We like that. But any given quarter, can have a curve ball in it or a comparison to last year. So I'd say the underlying fundamentals are all strong here. And we're going to have to lap Venezuela, because that was a pretty significant piece for EPD, given CFR there and so forth. And I'm trying to think where else. I mean currency I guess is an issue in a number of countries, particularly Russia. And I'm just cycling through all the ups and downs. There are quarter-to-quarter variances depending on gee, the tender didn't happen in March, it happened in April, that kind of thing. So I think underlying this is pretty solid strong growth. Lawrence Biegelsen : Fair enough. And then, Miles, you've said in the past that you're not constrained on doing more deals even after the Alere acquisition. So how should we think about Abbott's ability to do another medium size transaction while the Alere deal is pending and there's some uncertainty? And second, is the sweet spot for Abbott still that $5 billion to $7 billion range that you've talked about in the past? Thanks for taking the questions. Miles D. White: Yeah. I'd tell you, again, I don't feel unreasonably constrained at all. I think that we're always conscious of capital allocation; we're always conscious of return; we're always conscious of where our debt is and what our debt rating is and so forth. We want to be all in the right balance here. But for the things that I think would be on my radar screen, I think we're in good shape here. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions. Brian B. Yoor: Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. And our final question or comment comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is open. Jayson T. Bedford: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to follow up on the EPD, the 11% growth certainly exceeded our number and your expectation I think going into the quarter. What was different from your thoughts heading into the quarter? Was it a function of tenders? And then secondly, there were some headlines earlier in the quarter or I guess in February, around increased regulation of combo drugs in India and I'm just wondering does that have any impact on your business? Miles D. White: Well, in the last part, it hasn't yet, but it could; and we're prepared for that if it does. So that remains. It's still working its way through the Indian courts, but maybe Scott's got more detail on that right now than I do, but it hasn't yet. Brian B. Yoor: Yeah. And I would also add just on the quarter, there is some timing, to Miles' point. There is always some tender timing in various countries. If you take the first quarter and the second quarter, you're looking at a first half of the year that'll be a high-single digit operational growth for EPD; and that's strong growth. Jayson T. Bedford: Okay. If I could just add a second one in there, just on Nutrition. Certainly the U.S. Nutrition business has seen some pretty good signs of momentum here, both in adult and pediatric. I realize you're anniversarying some tougher comps, but are you seeing some real momentum or at least some sustainable share gains here? Miles D. White: It's kind of too early to tell. I think we kind of hope so, but to call it sustainable I'd like to see some more data and I'd like to see a little more time because generally speaking in the Nutrition business in United States, share might blip up and down a little bit, but over time remains relatively static. It's pretty difficult to move share sustainably and meaningfully over time in the U.S. And your ability to grow the adult nutrition business is to grow the market, for the most part; and as you know, we are the leader in that market. And pediatric, share may move a couple of points here and there, but it always seems to snap back to wherever its median point was. So we're always pushing on share gain. And about the time you think you've gotten somewhere with it, something happens, competitive response or whatever, moves back the other way. So I think to call current momentum sustainable, I think I'd say let me see another quarter. Jayson T. Bedford: All right. Thank you. Miles D. White: Okay. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all your questions. And that concludes Abbott's conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at www.abbottinvestor.com; and after 11 a.m. Central time via telephone at 402-220-5335, pass code 1726. The audio replay will be available until 4 p.m. Central time on Wednesday, May 4. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. You may disconnect your line at this time.",

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration; and Brian Yoor Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss the performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Tom, Brian and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS, and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filing from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. As you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016 announcing the transaction with St. Jude Medical. Please refer to that release for additional important information about Abbott, St. Jude and related matters. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles D. White: Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 above our guidance range. Sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Diagnostics. As you know, earlier in the quarter, we took an important strategic step with our announcement to acquire St. Jude Medical. Abbott and St. Jude combined will have a highly competitive medical device portfolio, including an industry-leading new product pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and vision care. This strategic action builds upon the steps we've taken to achieve critical mass and leadership positions across each of our four businesses. In Diagnostics and Nutrition, where we hold market-leading positions today, we've been investing in R&D and infrastructure in high-growth geographies that have strengthened our global scale and competitiveness. And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, we've taken a number of strategic steps over the last couple of years to position our business for long-term growth. EPD now operates entirely in emerging geographies and holds leading positions in many of the largest and fastest-growing pharmaceutical markets for branded generics in the world, including India, Russia and Latin America. All four of our businesses will now hold leading positions in large and growing markets that are aligned with healthcare and demographic trends, providing a strong foundation to deliver top-tier growth over the long-term. I'll now briefly review our second quarter results, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 6% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. Our Diagnostics business has been a solid and continuous outperformer in the company and in its industry over the past several years. There is an opportunity here to further maintain if not improve upon this growth trajectory, as we prepare to bring multiple next-generation systems to market across every area of diagnostics where we participate. We'll provide more details on these systems and our launch plans during the second half of the year. In Nutrition, sales grew around 4.5% in the quarter or more than 6% excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth in the quarter was led by U.S. pediatric and international adult nutrition. In the U.S., above-market performance in Pediatric Nutrition was driven by continued growth of recently launched products including non-GMO products for infants and toddlers. In Adult Nutrition, double-digit international growth was led by Ensure and continued expansion of the adult nutrition market, where Abbott is the global leader. In Medical Devices, sales growth in our Vascular business was led by share gains in our core stent business and double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally-invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. Our Endovascular business also contributed another quarter of strong growth, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg. And earlier this month, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent. This first of its kind product is an important addition to our market-leading drug-eluting stent portfolio in the U.S. In Medical Optics, sales growth of 5.5% was led by double-digit growth in our cataract products business where we continue to capture share and drive growth with our portfolio of premium cataract lens products. Last week, we further strengthened our portfolio in the U.S. with the FDA approval for our TECNIS Symfony lenses; the first and only lenses that provide a full range of continuous high-quality vision following cataract surgery. In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of more than 15% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our new and innovative FreeStyle Libre device in Europe. We continue to see strong demand as consumers and healthcare professionals become increasingly aware of the many benefits of this innovative device. There are now more than 125,000 patients utilizing FreeStyle Libre in Europe and we're working to bring this novel technology to new markets, including the United States. And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, our strategy of targeting key geographies with a broad portfolio across select therapeutic areas continues to deliver strong results. Sales growth of 9.5% or 14% excluding the impact of Venezuela, was led by balanced growth across several markets including India, China and several countries in Latin America. The acquisitions and subsequent integrations of both CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm have exceeded our expectations and are contributing to strong growth overall. So in summary, it was a good quarter and we're particularly pleased with the steady cadence of new product approvals and recent launches that are contributing to growth including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip, Absorb and Symfony. And we took another important step to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth potential with our announced acquisition of St. Jude Medical. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Brian B. Yoor: Okay. Thank you, Miles. Sales for the quarter increased 6.4% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of 3.2% in foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than previous expectations due to modest strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the quarter. Reported sales increased 3.2% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.6% of sales, somewhat above our previous guidance. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 31.6% of sales, each in line with previously-issued guidance. Turning to our outlook for the full-year 2016. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations remains unchanged and reflects double-digit underlying growth offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full-year reported sales, somewhat higher than previous expectations of negative 2%. This would result in reported sales growth in the low-single digits for the full-year 2016. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year. We now forecast net interest expense of around $100 million, reflecting changes in interest rate assumptions on both, our borrowing rates for debt and the income we earn on some of our investments, and around $35 million of non-operating expense. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 to $0.59, again reflecting double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the third quarter and at current exchange rates, we'd expect the negative impact from exchange of around 1.5%. Turning to other aspects of the P&L. For the third quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investment around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30% of sales. Finally, we project specified items of $0.19 in the third quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter and full-year operational sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high-single digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. And lastly, in our Medical Devices business, for Vascular we now forecast low-single digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Diabetes, we forecast high-single digit growth for the third quarter and mid-single digit sales growth for the full year. And in Medical Optics, we forecast low to mid-single digit for the third quarter and mid-single digit sales growth for the full year. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Weinstein : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Miles, let's start with a couple of items, if we could. I'm sure everyone would love to get an update on the two transactions in both St. Jude and Alere. So in particular on Alere, I think people would love to hear your comments. And then second, fundamentally, it was a good quarter. I think the mix of growth was a little bit different than what we saw at the last couple of quarters. If there is one business that probably is worth spending a few more minutes on is the international pediatric nutritionals business. We've seen a couple of the local companies announce weaker results. Your quarter this quarter wasn't as good as some of your recent quarters, so maybe you can talk about what's going on in some of those markets obviously and particular at China. Thanks. Miles D. White: As usual, Mike, you are spot on. I feel like you must've been in the room or something here. Let me deal with the transactions first, and I'll go right to the one that you targeted, Alere. From our perspective, there has been no change. They still haven't filed a 10-K. Our access to the information has been limited. And they did put out a press release with an update that I think was at least from my perspective over-enthusiastically embraced from one of their analysts. But to that extent, the update they put out basically provided no particular new information and was a requirement they had with their bondholders for the extensions they got on the requirements in their agreements. And, the information they put out was characterized as preliminary unaudited summary only, et cetera. So I think from our perspective, no change other than the passage of time. And that's about all I can say about it at this point. So I'm not an odds predictor here so I have no particular predictions to make other than the information that's here and there is no more really to say about it since the last time you asked me the question. So moving to St. Jude, I'd say everything is tracking well. We've got a second request from the FTC which we'll certainly respond to. I'd say there is not much in the way of surprises there. All of our planning going forward is going according to plan. There is no surprises, no negatives. Their performance appears to be tracking according to our forecasts, our expectations and for their forecasts. In fact, I'd say their report this morning looks to me like their best quarter in about the last six quarters anyway. And they're trending in the right directions as we predicted and forecasted and saw in our due diligence. So I'd say with regard to St. Jude, everything is tracking well. We still hope to close that by before year-end. I think that will be close call just as we work our way through the administrivia of the FTC's request and so forth and whatever we may have to do there. But I'd say there is no big surprises at all. We're just going to try and complete the work that we've already indicated and everything there is tracking according to plan. With regard to the mix of business, I'd say you can see in our numbers, it's a strong quarter across the board, across the world in all of our businesses but one. And the Nutrition business is weaker and the weakness is primarily focused on China, Pediatric. Really nowhere else. And what's been not only forecasted by some of our global competitors but also our own experience has been a slowing of growth in the China pediatric market. Last year at this time I think that market was probably 13%, 14% growth estimated and this year it's probably just under half that, would be our estimate, and I think that's probably consistent with what some of our competitors have seen or expressed as well. Well, we're seeing half the growth rate as a market rate that we've seen in the past and that's clearly softening the sales growth rate and we've seen that and we are seeing that. We have not yet seen in any data that there is any share change that's impacting us but our growth rate is clearly slower. So I'm a little cautious on the second half. I don't expect that to change on this particular business. I don't expect that growth rate or that, let's just call it softness. It's not softness in terms of decline, it's slower growth. It's still a pretty healthy growth rate compared to anywhere else in the world and it's a good growth rate. It's just not the double-digit growth rate it was last year or the year before and, as you know, that market has been a pretty high grower from a growth rate standpoint for quite some time. So that's an adjustment for all of us to adjust to. I don't know whether that's a long-term change in the market. I know that there is an increasing breastfeeding rate in China. But in terms of other fundamentals, we see channel shifts and so forth, but channel shifts shouldn't impact the overall market over time here. So other than the dynamics of just lower growth or slowing demand, I'd say that's about the best way I can characterize it. As I said, the market growth at 6% is still a healthy rate; it's just not the one that we've been used to and enjoyed for the past several years. Michael Weinstein : Maybe I could just get in two quick follow-ups. So one on the Alere question. Can you just talk about some of the items that you're still waiting on beyond just the filing of the 10-K? And then second, Brian, you raise your estimated FX impact on the top-line for the company. I assume there is an incremental FX headwind on the bottom-line, and that's in part why you're not raising 2016 guidance. But if you could shed any light on that, that'd be great. Miles D. White: With regard to I guess Alere, some information has been provided to us. We've made a number of requests regarding books and records and things that we want to audit and have access to. Some of that has been provided to us and a fair amount of it has not and continues not to be. So there is really nothing more I can say at this point, Mike, unfortunately. The announcement that they put out was not that forthcoming, and I certainly wouldn't share the optimism that one of their analysts expressed about their announcement. But I think we're just in a waiting situation here. With regard to guidance, I mean, I'll just pre-empt Brian a little bit here. You recall, we did raise guidance after the first quarter. And I think \u2013 I want to be careful how I state this, because all of our businesses are running really strong here, but I'm a little cautious on the second half. Part of it's FX but part of it is just watching underlying market growth, I'm particularly keeping an eye on China. I didn't mean I'm negative on China at all \u2013 I'm not. But I think it's premature to forecast or forecast for raising guidance on the second half of the year, so I think we'll just keep our powder dry there. Brian B. Yoor: Mike, around $0.01 to $0.02 on the back half. Michael Weinstein : Perfect. Understood. Brian B. Yoor: (20:53). Michael Weinstein : Thank you, guys. I appreciate you taking the questions. Miles D. White: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is now open. Matthew Taylor : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to start with Medical Devices. Your results there even excluding the royalty were better than recent trends, and you called out some new products. I was wondering if you could give us some more details on the contributions of those and what you expect out of Absorb or any other meaningful products going forward. Miles D. White: Yeah, I'll give you a little bit of overview, and then I'll ask Brian for a little help on some of the details here. But the Vascular business is doing better and a couple of things there. MitraClip is certainly a contributor to that and so also is the Endovascular business. On the core stent business, and there is still pricing pressure there, because it's an intensely competitive market among three of us but, at the same time, we're gaining share. And I think that business, if I would characterize it, is doing better and stronger than it has been in the last, I'll call it, year-and-a-half. So I'm pretty pleased with the progress there and the performance of the team. The royalty situation itself, there is a catch-up in there, which inflates the number, the growth number for this quarter, because it was catch-up of the past. But it's also \u2013 that we're going to have that royalty going forward here, so that'll be something we will clearly have in the future which has not been there for the past few quarters. So that's a plus. But if you take out the impact of that catch-up in the royalty, the growth in the Vascular business in the quarter is better than we've seen in quite some time. Brian, do you want to add any detail to that? Brian B. Yoor: Yeah, Matt, we're growing to mid-single digits even tough for the royalty here. MitraClip had a really strong quarter. We're seeing great adoption uptake and utilization in the centers we're in there. And our Endovascular business continues to perform well. It's growing double digits. It's a combination of both Supera for the SFA, as you know, as well as our vessel closure business. And as far as the other side of like Medical Optics, I mean, you continue to see us grow, outpacing the market in cataracts, particularly with our premium lenses. And just excited about the cadence of the portfolio that's coming here, particularly with Symfony, to continue to build upon that. And then of course you know the story on FreeStyle Libre. Miles D. White: The optics market, particularly in the U.S., as you know, has experienced a fair amount of price decline in the LASIK business. And setting that aside, the performance in the cataract and the intraocular lens business has just been stellar, and we're really pleased with that. And pleased with our R&D group for the products that they've put out, pleased with the reception by customers and to be growing in healthy double digits in that segment is, well, it's great fun. All of these businesses have had their times when they've been down or waiting for new products, but these businesses are all doing really well. Matthew Taylor : Great. And maybe just one follow-up on Diagnostics. You've talked for a while about the potential for a refresh of the Core Lab and Molecular systems. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit more thoughts on timing, the feature upgrades and what really matters there, and how that can contribute to growth for Dx? Miles D. White: Yeah, we've got a number of new systems coming here, all of which have been under development for a few years in our Diagnostics business, and we're starting to see those roll out now and we will see over the next, let's say, two years, three years. First of all, we just launched AlinIQ, which is an informatics program that is designed to help labs with productivity and their own cost management and so forth, which we think is going to be exceptionally well received. That's launched. Following that, we've got five systems coming. There is a next-generation system in our Point of Care business that will begin to launch in Europe in the second half of this year; probably in the fourth quarter, then in the U.S. in 2017. Then the Core Lab systems to both immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing will begin to roll out as well. We expect European launch before the end of the year and in the U.S. in 2018, early in 2018. Blood screening, same thing. Late in the year in Europe, late this year in Europe. A brand new system. Beyond that, hematology in the following year of 2017, early 2017 in Europe, and then all of these early on in 2018 in the U.S. And then finally in our Molecular business in the second half of 2017, we begin to roll out a new system in Europe. So that's a lot, and that's unprecedented. No company in our business has ever put that many new systems out. They're not just refreshments; they're not just software updates or upgrades or incremental improvements on existing systems, they are all complete new refreshed systems or redone and with some new advantages and so forth. So we're pretty excited about the entire product line. Diagnostics has been doing really well with the mature products in its line, and when you think about the complete line of new products coming over the next couple of years to that business, I think that's just really a great shot in the arm there for a business that's been outperforming as it is anyway. Customers will start to see those systems at the AACC Conference in Philadelphia in later this month. At a number of the industry trade shows in the U.S. and Europe we'll clearly be introducing those systems to customers so they get a preview in advance. So I think the future for Diagnostics looks pretty good. Matthew Taylor : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is now open. Rick Wise : Good morning, Miles. Good morning, everybody. Miles, just to start with sort of a bigger picture question, a lot of the pushback that I get in talking about the acquisitions, that St. Jude, Alere, it seems to revolve around a few points that both are challenged, even troubled assets, that you're taking on too much integration challenge at once, the uncertainty around an equity raise, the lack of certainty around how Abbott will add value improve or better run particularly St. Jude, and maybe a little lack of clarity about the Abbott senior management team, how that's going to change, who is going to lead the effort, again, particularly on the device side. While I personally don't agree with these thoughts, I'd be curious just looking at the big picture here, again, given your long track record of successful opportunistic M&A, how is St. Jude, Alere, set up better or worse than some of the past challenges you faced? Why are these the right deal after another few months of thinking about it? What needs to be done to ensure that these are the right moves today for Abbott shareholders? Miles D. White: Well, I'd say a couple of things, and I understand the sentiments of investors in general. I mean I think that first of all I'd say, it's not a skeptical or cautious attitude on the part of investors, with just about everything, not particular to Abbott or specific to Abbott, but I think there is just a lot of caution out there. All that frothy, robust enthusiasm of a year and a half ago is definitely not there now. And yet the market is at a near high, but in our businesses that enthusiasm, or at least that attitude, doesn't seem to be that lit up. So we put this in the context of all of that. I think what I find in the feedback from investors is they just want a lot more clarity and a lot more visibility so that they can forecast or model or know where all this is going to go, because I can lean on historical track record and say, hey, look, AMO wasn't a great performing business when we bought it, but right now it is doing exceptionally well. The assets we assembled there is EPD. We're not at the time great asset \u2013 let's say (29:41) CFR was a pretty great asset, but a lot of the assets that we put together weren't necessarily super-performing assets. And right now, I'd say we've got one of the gems in the branded generic business globally because of the markets and the things we're in. And I think the track record of how we integrate or how we manage our businesses is proven. We're not intimidated at all by the integration. Frankly, that part, I think, we've shown we're really good at. We've got an experienced team in place. I'm not worried about that at all. And frankly, in the case of St. Jude, the organizations are so well aligned, I think that one will go extremely well and extremely smoothly. I don't consider St. Jude to be a particularly challenged organization. I think that they've got a great pipeline of products. I think they've got a lot of good products. They went through a fairly significant organizational structural change over the last two years that, I think, proved to be somewhat disruptive to the operation of the organization. We're well aware of that. We're well aware of what it meant, how it works, et cetera. But understanding that, I think we've got a pretty good idea of how to integrate St. Jude and run it going forward. With regard to the management team, the management team that will be running our device businesses will be a mix, probably a fairly balanced mix of Abbott and St. Jude people. Where we believe that there is a clear benefit to Abbott management, talent, et cetera, or experience that we can bring to the party, we certainly intend to do so. And we pretty well wind out what we think that is and we will also have the benefit of some of the most experienced and best managers and so forth at St. Jude. I think St. Jude has been, probably, more maligned in the last year than it has deserved because they missed earnings in the third and fourth quarter and they've had some delays in product approvals. But to be honest, if they had an MRI compatible CRM product, I don't think we'd be hearing nearly as much criticism of St. Jude. And it's amazing how one thing, or maybe if they were achieving the reimbursement of CardioMEMS faster, that's about it. Beyond that, their businesses are booming. All their other businesses are doing super well and they've already shown that they can recover share, when they get a CRM approval, by their performance in Japan. So I think it's been overblown, Rick, and I understand the investors are disappointed. It takes them a while to recover from them that and then they're skeptical. And they may look at Abbott and say, why do you think you can do it better? And my answer to that is, I think we can do it better and I think St. Jude can do it better and so does St. Jude. And I think that the two of us together, both believe that, first of all, they resolve their MRI compatibility issue and continue to run the business well, which they are, this business is going to do not only how analysts expect and we expect, which is growth of 4.5%, 5% or more, but frankly, maybe even better than that. As I've indicated on other calls, St. Jude's own estimates of how they're going to do are even higher than that. Our deal was done based on estimating, frankly, same kind of growth rates analysts estimate, which quote them at call it 4.5% to 5% going forward. And right now, they're tracking towards that with their performance in all their businesses. We're just waiting for an approval of an MRI compatible CRM and I think this changes. When I look forward, I think the breadth of the business and the combination with Abbott and the improved performance in our own Vascular business is nothing but up. And well, right now, you've got this period where there is uncertainty, uncertainty about when will it close and you haven't forecasted what it will do and so forth. I think it's \u2013 I think a lot of our investors are just more cautious. But I look at it and look down the road at our own projections in what we believe we're going to do and I think, okay, the stock is whatever it is today, $42 or whatever. I don't think investors are ever going to see another point to buy in at this level. That's what I think. I actually believe that. And I think our track record, which is proven, we know how to integrate it, we know how to manage it, we know how to do well with it, we know how to add value to it, we know what the breadth of offering is, we know the quality of their pipeline and the quality of their people. You don't just buy it, put it in the portfolio and leave it alone. You buy it and you put the best management you can in place and you run it the best you can. We've got really excellent managements in our Medical Device business and I think they've got excellent people too. So in spite of the fact that they've disappointed investors, I think the investors got to get over last year and look forward here, because I don't think we bought some challenged property here. Alere, yeah, it has challenges, they acknowledge they have challenges too. And frankly, they've had challenges for a number of years and the management team that's there right now, has been there just a little more than two years, they have dealt well with a lot of the challenges Alere has. Now, they clearly have more, right? And to be honest, no matter what kind of teeth grinding and gnashing we go through with them here or they are going through, et cetera, one thing I'm certain of is that they are trying to do everything they can their way to address the challenges in the company. I don't think otherwise. So whether it all works out the way it originally planned or not, I don't know. We can't predict. As I've said many times, we like the products, and to us it's an opportunistic opportunity to expand our Diagnostics business. Our Diagnostics business is one of the most consistent top-performing businesses in our country and in its industry and they've proven they know how to manage costs, they know how to manage product, they know how to manage the commercial operations, they know how to grow, they know how to compete. This business is one of our best most reliable businesses in the company and to expand that footprint with more products is just an opportunistic plus. If for some reason it didn't work out, we still have one of our top-performing companies in the industry but if we can add to it, well then even better. So I think to address further investors, having two deals in the hopper at the same time is a lot of moving parts for investors. It leaves some things uncertain. It leaves the issue, as you said, the equity issuance uncertain. Obviously, for some reason both of these didn't happen, there wouldn't be a need or a desire to do that because we're trying to balance our overall debt and equity balance sheet. So we'll see. We just don't know at this point and I think there is other ways that we can consider addressing that issue around the equity, since I've had the feedback from investors that they are concerned. At least they don't like it because it's dilutive. And I'm aware of that. But I don't think we're anywhere close to where we have to make a decision on the equity issuance. At this point we're planning for it, but we're only going to do it if it's in our interest to do it to balance our balance sheet. So full transparency. We're planning to do it but there is other ways that may well be addressed and we're nowhere close to a resolution to that. I think that the uncertainty of that for investors just has them cautious, concerns and so on, and I think what I tell most people is, look, by January, this is all going to be pretty clear. And it's going to be resolved one way or another and we'll know whether we're going to do something like that or not. I think the same thing is true, that we get asked a lot about the Mylan shares and what are we going to do and are they going to play a role? And the answer is to be determined, unclear, you know. If \u2013 right now my sense is if I don't have to sell those shares I'm not going to. So I think that there's enough moving parts. So I actually like the moving parts even though investors want real clarity I don't want to make any of these decisions until I actually have to, and there is probably a number of months that are going to go by before we have to. And it's unfortunate it leaves a little bit of uncertainty not only for Abbott shareholders but for Mylan's too to some degree. But if we don't have a need to sell those shares, I don't intend to. So at least not anytime soon, let me put it that way. So I think those are all the moving parts, and I think there is some frustration out there, I think people want to buy the stock, I think they want to be in the stock, I think they want the ride that we think we have ahead of us here for the coming years. They just don't know whether there is going to be some surprise they can't anticipate. And right now, I think all the possible outcomes are pretty evident, and I don't see anything that's going to take us backwards, but I certainly see a lot of things that are going to take us forward. And I'm pretty optimistic about it. I just think that we and investors have to ride through about, call it, six months of less certainty on some of the choices here, until it starts to resolve. And that's not going to be next month, it's going to be a while. Rick Wise : Yeah, that's great perspective. One tiny quick follow-up. Obviously FreeStyle Libre is often running in Europe. You said you're working to bring it to the U.S. What's needed to make that happen? What kind of timing should we expect for FreeStyle Libre in the U.S? Thanks so much. Miles D. White: Yeah, there is \u2013 gosh, I'm not sure how specific to be about that. We're going to submit, as soon as possible, and I would estimate it is approved in the U.S., is my estimate and my guesstimate in the first quarter. That's what I would guess. And there's two stages to this. There's a Libre Pro and then a Libre consumer. So I think that our ambition would be to get this approved probably within the next six months to eight months, something like that. But we'll see. There is a number of steps that are going to happen here in the interim. In the meanwhile, I think it's doing exceptionally well on its rollout in Europe, we've had a really good reception from the states and countries with regard to reimbursement which I think is unusual. This has been \u2013 thus far, Libre's success has been driven by consumer pay, and direct consumer pay. And we are achieving our goals of getting key countries and key prices to agree to reimburse the product which should frankly make a big difference in the performance in the market, and it's already trending north at a pretty good clip. So I'm pretty enthusiastic about Libre and, of course, when you've got a product that's as good as that is and trending like it is, you're in a big hurry to get it approved in the U.S. yesterday. So that's where we are. Brian, do you want to add anything to that, or Scott? Brian B. Yoor: No. I think that's perfectly characterized. Thanks. Rick Wise : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Navarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Glenn John Novarro : Hi. Good morning, guys. My first question relates to St. Jude. They did report this morning, and I thought what was very important is the fact that all their new products and timelines were reaffirmed this morning, which really sets St. Jude up to rebound and have a strong 2017. And Miles, you mentioned St. Jude's internal forecast, we've read it in the proxy, 10% revenue growth for the next five years, which is well above what the Street is modeling. And I'm curious... Miles D. White: Well, that's above what I modeled. Glenn John Novarro : Okay. And it's above what I modeled. What is in that forecast that gets them to that 10%? And I guess another way to say is what are the upside surprises that could exist within the St. Jude outlook portfolio over the next five years? If you can maybe call some out to us. And then, putting the two companies together, there could be sales dis-synergies. I think you're hoping for sales synergies. How soon do you think you can achieve those sales synergies? Thank you. Miles D. White: Okay. A couple of things. First, before I phone a friend next to me here for some of the details underlying specific products, I would tell you that \u2013 first of all, if you've got a robust portfolio of new products coming, that's always a good thing, and we're naturally always optimistic about the uptick of products, the penetration of products, the introduction of products and so forth. And it's always a constant balance of being sufficiently enthusiastic and pushing your organization hard enough on how you want to take those products to market. And then there is always the speed bumps; something slows you down somewhere, whether it's reimbursement or the timing of an approval or whatever. And in all my years in the industry, I have never seen, on a particularly consistent basis, any company including my own deliver its new products on-time, on-plan, on-schedule without some kind of delay. Even with Libre, our ambitions were \u2013 in terms of our own internal goals, we're probably a couple of months behind where we wanted to be \u2013 months, okay, couple months. And yet, we have pretty stiff goal in our own minds about what we're trying to do here. And if you look at the product, it's screaming north at a rocket-like pace, which is a good thing. And all it takes is some minister somewhere to slow down his decision a few weeks and you're off by a couple of weeks. So when I look forward at St. Jude and I look at the 10%, is it potentially possible? Yeah, it's potentially possible, but it's a lot of green lights. It's a lot of green lights without many speed bumps. And the reality of life is, is there is a lot of speed bumps. So I would've judged it back a little bit in terms of just caution. I think they're aspirational about the pace at which those new products come. I don't think there's any disagreement on our part with them about how good the products are, how well received they'll be or what competitive response will be and so forth. I also think they're going to benefit from some great market growth rate behind a lot of these products. They don't have to go tear it away from somebody else in competition, hand-to-hand combat. The CRM business is hand-to-hand combat, but a lot of the other businesses here are frankly just plain innovative, new and relying on growth and training physicians and usage and so forth. So I think that while they would \u2013 their estimates really were sort of in that 9% and up range. I think we're just being naturally cautious of the unknown, that the (45:18) unknown. And I think analysts are, too. When we looked across a consensus of analysts for St. Jude, the consensus was around 4.5% to 5% growth going forward here for the next five years. And what's ironic about that is I've spoken to a lot of these analysts because we know them covering us as well. And they'll say, yeah, I know that's what my model says but I'm just not sure they're really going to do that. And that's because their growth rate was more flat over the last five years. But the growth rate was flat over the last five years because they didn't have some of these products or a Thoratec or some of the other businesses they've got now. And right now, they've got a heck of a lot more in the pipeline and a heck of a lot more that they've added to the company since, say, three, four years ago. So I don't think the last five years' growth rates are relevant as a comparison. I think what they've got and what they've done is. And I think right now, the growth rate is only suppressed because they've got difficulty with not having an MRI-compatible claim on their CRM/CRT products. And you take that away and this business is already at analysts' projections and analysts' projections have been more robust than the past history. So I think St. Jude is one of those stories where once you disappoint some investors a couple of quarters, the investor doesn't believe the projection of the future as much as he believes the rearview mirror. So I think they've got to put the points on the board and earn back a little credibility that what they've projected is actually going to happen. And I think the sentiment will change on St. Jude. I'm not investing in sentiment; I'm investing in real products and real company and real business. And I think that what they're tracking at right now is giving the evidence that what they've projected is valid. These businesses, if you look at all the segments of businesses, they're really doing great. The one soft spot in the company is CRM and they do have to get better reimbursement status for CardioMEMS. Okay. That's two things and they're all over that, and we're comfortable with how they're all over that. And the rest of the company is doing gangbusters. So I think they just got to show the evidence here over time. Rick, I've already forgotten the second half of your question. Glenn John Novarro : Well, it's Glenn. Not Rick. Miles D. White: Sorry. Glenn John Novarro : And second \u2013 it's all right, Miles \u2013 and it's sales synergies. So there's the potential for dis-synergies, but as I look at this deal both companies are very compatible. And so there conceivably should be sales synergies. So maybe comment on, is that \u2013 how soon that can happen? Miles D. White: Yeah, yeah, Glenn. May I call you Bob? Glenn John Novarro : Yeah, sure. Miles D. White: I apologize. It was such a windy answer, I lost track. In any case, I think the synergies are going to be easy to get. I think the commercial synergies, and first of all it depends on the integration of your sales forces, the integration of your sales management structures, your commercial management structures. I think it depends on how we construct our integration our \u2013 well, there's integration and cooperation across boundaries with the multiple businesses. That will and how customers embrace that particularly in the U.S. will determine how rapidly that goes. Now, having said that, the companies have had some experience that way for some time already because we've had a joint marketing agreement with St. Jude for a number of years between our stent business and their CRM business, so we're already well familiar with each other. Of course, the dynamics change when you're part of the same company and that's a positive. It gets better. So I think that the nature of the kind of commercial synergy we would look for in the broader portfolio of products that we offer, how we approach our accounts, how we can service our accounts, et cetera, I'd say that planning is well underway if not starting to be in practice in a number of cases. And in between Mike Rousseau, the CEO of St. Jude; and Robert Ford, our EVP, and that organization or these two organizations I think the two of them and their people have planned and cooperated exceptionally well going forward here so I think we hit the ground running as if the two companies had been together for a long time. I don't really foresee a lot of hiccups or bumps here. Glenn John Novarro : All right. And since you called me by the wrong name, Miles, can I squeeze in one more question? Miles D. White: Sure. Glenn John Novarro : Okay. The Mylan stake, when you do sell the Mylan stake, the cash that you realize, will that be considered OUS trapped cash and if so, how do you handle the tax liability if you bring it back indeed to pay for Alere or St. Jude. I remember a few years ago when Tom was CFO, you brought back cash and the liability was called out as a one-timer. Is that something that you would consider doing? Thanks. Miles D. White: No. I don't anticipate that. Glenn John Novarro : Okay. But the cash would be considered international cash? Is that correct if you do sell the stake? Scott Leinenweber : Glenn, I would assume we can navigate this without the tax correction. I think we've shown a propensity across the corporations through our buybacks and other means to access our cash in an efficient way. And I think you can assume the same about this if, to Miles' point, if we're in a situation where we sell the stock. Glenn John Novarro : Okay. Thank you. Miles D. White: Yeah, I don't think we're going to have that hiccup. Scott Leinenweber : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Larry Biegelsen : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just, Miles, on Libre, a clarification question. First quarter 2017 is that the professional version or the consumer version? As far as I know you haven't disclosed yet when you're filing the consumer version in the U.S. And second under the Dexcom panel tomorrow, what do you think the implications are for Libre? And I did have a follow-up. Thanks. Scott Leinenweber : Hey, Larry. This is Scott. I'll touch base on the professional version very quickly. As you know, we filed for that device in the middle of last year. We're working with the FDA on that and that is the approval we would expect in the next six to nine months on that particular point. Obviously, as it relates to, as you know, the Dexcom panel tomorrow, I mean we're really excited about the U.S. market. We think there is lots of opportunity there. We think Libre is a unique technology. It's a discussion we'll be watching closely to see how the FDA is thinking about these novel technologies and how to apply them for diabetic patients' needs in today's market. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks, Scott. And then lastly, we saw J&J adopt ASU 2016-09 yesterday and had some implications for their tax rate. What are the implications for you guys and when do you plan to adopt it? Thanks for taking the questions. Scott Leinenweber : Yeah. So we don't need to adopt till 2017, Larry, and we're still assessing what that means in terms of our ongoing earnings on a year-to-year basis because there are some moving parts there. We're still assessing it. We won't adopt until we have to. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks a lot, guys. Scott Leinenweber : Sure. Miles D. White: Okay. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. That concludes Abbott's conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 AM Central Time on Abbott's Investor Relations website at www.abbottinvestor.com. And after 11 :00 AM Central Time via telephone at 404-537-3406; pass code 38160622. The audio replay will be available until 4 :00 PM Central Time on Wednesday, August 3.

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration; and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Tom, Brian and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS, and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. As you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016 announcing the transaction with St. Jude Medical and a related press release on October 18, 2016. Please refer to those releases for additional important information about Abbott, St. Jude, and related matters. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 at the high end of our guidance range. We also raised the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.19 to $2.21, exceeding the initial guidance we set at the beginning of the year. Sales increased 4% in the quarter or more than 5.5%, excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth was led by strong performance in established pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We achieved our expectations overall and our pipeline continued to deliver a steady cadence of new product approvals and launches that are contributing to growth. At the same time, we continued to actively and strategically shape our portfolio. In September, we took the next logical step in shaping our medical device business with the announcement that we will sell our medical optics business to J&J. This action is in line with our strategic decision to sharpen our focus on building leadership in cardiovascular devices. I will now briefly review our third quarter results. And I will start with diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in core laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics. In August, at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry Conference, we unveiled our next-generation suite of instruments called Alinity. The Alinity suite includes new instruments for every segment of the diagnostics market in which we compete. Over the next few months, we will launch new systems for point of care, immunoassay testing, clinical chemistry, and blood screening in Europe. Over time, we will introduce additional systems and launch the full Alinity suite into additional geographies providing a highly differentiated platform for sustainable, long-term growth. In nutrition, sales declined 1% in the quarter, below our expectations due to soft performance in China pediatric nutrition. As you may recall, I expressed caution on the near term Outlook in China in our last earnings call. Over the last few months, market conditions have remained challenging there, including rapid channel shifts and new safety regulations that are driving an oversupply of product in the market and aggressive levels of discounting. Although conditions are expected to remain challenging in the near-term, the long-term fundamentals of the market remain attractive. We have right portfolio of products for the various channels and the best-in-class global supply network. We have also continued to focus on strengthening our competitiveness in order to deliver growth over the long term. Outside of China, we continued to perform well in Southeast Asia and Latin America and again achieved above market growth in U.S. pediatric nutrition. In medical devices, sales growth in our vascular business was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation and high single-digit growth in endovascular products, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent and an important addition to our drug-eluting stent portfolio. In diabetes care, international sales growth of more than 20% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our revolutionary FreeStyle Libre system in Europe. In September, we received FDA approval for our FreeStyle Libre Pro system in the United States. Libre Pro will help healthcare professionals make better, customized treatment decisions for their patients and at a significantly lower cost than other professional continuous glucose monitoring systems. We also submitted the consumer version of the FreeStyle Libre system for FDA review during the quarter. This system is designed to eliminate the need for routine fingersticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes. And in established pharmaceuticals or EPD, sales grew 9% in the quarter. Double-digit growth in key emerging markets was led by strong growth in India, China, and Latin America. EPD continues to execute at a very high level and remains well aligned with the fundamentals driving long-term growth in emerging markets, a rising middle-class, improving access to healthcare, and consumers that are seeking and willing to pay for high-quality brands. So in summary, we achieved our financial expectations for the quarter and our diverse business model continues to deliver reliable growth. We continued to advance our leadership and competitive position through several new product approvals and launches across our businesses, and we continued to take strategic steps to shape our portfolio building leadership positions for long-term growth. I will now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Okay. Thank you, Miles. Sales for the quarter increased 4% on an operational basis. That is excluding an unfavorable impact of 1.1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased 2.9% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.7% of sales, in line with our prior guidance. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2016. We narrowed our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.19 to $2.21. The midpoint of our guidance range reflects double-digit underlying growth offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year 2016. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact somewhat above 2% on our full-year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low-single digits for the full year 2016. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We also continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SGA expense approaching 31% of sales for the full year. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.66, again reflecting double-digit underlying growth. We forecast operational sales growth of mid single-digits in the fourth quarter. We have now annualized the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar that began late in the second quarter of last year and at current exchange rates, we expect a favorable impact to sales from exchange of somewhat more than 50 basis points in the fourth quarter. Turning to other aspects of the P&L for the fourth quarter. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investments somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 28% of sales. And finally, we project specified items of $0.25 in the fourth quarter. Before we open the call for questions, I will now provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter operational sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth. In nutrition, we forecast sales growth similar to the third quarter. In diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. And lastly, in our medical devices business, for vascular, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In diabetes care, we forecast double-digit sales growth. And in medical optics, we forecast low to mid single-digit sales growth. With that, we will now open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mike Weinstein : Good morning guys and thanks for taking the questions. Let me start with nutritionals, Miles. That's now your challenged businesses, so to speak. Could you just spend a few more minutes on China, what you see playing out in that market and how much of what's playing out today is transient versus a longer-term, more structural change? Miles White : I will try to. I would say the market in China has been in a bit of a transition for a number of months, it would appear, maybe even a little more , and it depends on who you are and what channels you are in, and so forth, depending how it affects you. We expected this year to see 7% to 8% growth in China, slightly above the GDP growth, et cetera, and what we are seeing now is flat-to-low single digits and I think some of our competitors have reported the same, so we\u2019ve gotten some triangulation on just underlying market growth rate, but beyond that a number of dynamics are at work there. There's some pretty rapid channel shift from traditional channels, like modern trade to various e-commerce channels and so forth. And I don't think that's surprised anybody in terms of just overall trends. But the speed and magnitude of it, I think, has hit China differently than what you would see in the U.S. or other countries. And so that's been a pretty big chunk. In the process of that, what's happened is, some inventories have piled up in, let's say, traditional channels while the market's needs have been satisfied by e-commerce channels. And so the market has got to burn through that, I guess, to some degree. So we have seen growth slow. And in our case, there's been a loss of about 0.5 share point, we estimate. We are also seeing a fair amount of market and competitor reaction to the anticipated new food safety laws, which will become effective in a little over a year, in January of 2018. Those new laws will limit the number of brands per manufacturing plant for a competitor, et cetera. All products have to be re-registered and so on, and the government has got a number of goals for that. But I think what's at work here is, we are seeing a lot of competitors oversupply this market. And under those scenarios, you see a lot of discounting. So we are seeing that. We are seeing the discounting. We are seeing the channel shift. We are seeing slower growth there. I do think it's transitional. I do think it's transient, but I don't think it's going to be a quick adjustment. I am cautious for 2017 because I think that it's a little hard to predict the reaction of the many competitors and many brands in the market to these new food safety laws. So I think what we are seeing here could be with us for a while, but I think the long-term attractiveness of the market is definitely there because there aren't fewer moms, there aren't fewer babies, et cetera. But we are in kind of an odd transition period that I don't think was anticipated by the government's intent with its new food safety laws or frankly even the channel shift. So I know that's kind of a long-winded answer, but there's a lot of things kind of stacked up here happening at the same time. We have watched the results of some of our competitors and see that it's hit all of us, but all of us kind of differently depending on what channels we might be more prominent in. And taking that apart and trying to understand all the dynamics there, I would say, has been a key focus over the last couple of quarters here, and I think we have got a pretty good handle on what's happening, but I think it's going to be this way for several quarters. Mike Weinstein : Understood. I am going to just ask a question about 2017. And Miles, I know you are not going to give 2017 guidance, but I just want to think about the framework for it. When we had the call to announce the St. Jude acquisition, and then on the call that you and I had back in June, you talked about the goal of the company historically of delivering double-digit underlying EPS growth. Let's just say that's 10% and that the goal for 2017 would be to try and deliver that. Then on top of it, you get the accretion from the transactions. Obviously, we don't know yet what's going to happen with Alere, but looks like St. Jude is on track to close. If we think about the base business piece of that, given that nutritionals is obviously looking weaker than it was six months ago, the device business was looking better, so there's some pluses and minuses, is the underlying business on track to deliver 10% next year? And is the right way to think about 2017, the underlying 10% plus the accretion? Or should we back off of the underlying expectations? Thanks. Miles White : Well, I would say, first of all, you are right. It's too early to be giving 2017 guidance or even be able to be precise about it. But I would say, look, the underlying growth does continue to be strong in our businesses. Fortunately, we are very diverse, many companies, many businesses, many products, many geographies, and we are not that over-indexed in China in any particular case. So I can't say that I think the China pediatric business is going to be great growth next year but I don't think it's going to impact in a fashion the overall strength of the growth of the company globally. So I would tell you that I see the underlying growth continuing to be strong. Clearly, that will have some impact on us. But at this point, I think we are seeing great growth in our pharmaceutical business. We are in the midst of preparing to launch a number of new systems in diagnostics. FreeStyle Libre, I would say, is going gangbusters in Europe and we are looking forward to having that in the U.S. shortly. There's a lot of new product launch and approval happening. So there's a lot of drivers of growth here and frankly, I think there's a lot of growth to be seen in St. Jude as well. So I remain kind of in the same position. I know we have got a slower situation in China. But I don't see us as so over-indexed in China that that is somehow going to knock us back in a way that I can forecast for you right now that this is going to have a huge impact on the company next year. I mean, frankly, it was going to have a huge impact in a fashion, you would have seen it this quarter and we did. I mean, we have seen it in our China numbers but look at how the company performed. We exceeded our expectations yet again and owing to the strength and the diversity of the company and the strength in pharmaceuticals, the strength in medical devices. I can remember a couple of years ago, we were talking about medical devices as the weakness, not so much of the strength. So I would say the good news is we have got a lot of parts of the business that are performing well, if not better, in the midst of new product cycles and launches. And frankly, the other parts of nutrition are doing reasonably well. If you look at the U.S., which I think everybody has become accustomed to sort of ignoring in the numbers, the U.S. is having a better year than planned, better year than in a long time and it's better than solid. So there's a lot of thing happening that offset China, to some degree. So I would caution this way. I would say, look, we always start the year looking for double-digit earnings growth and yes, we will have the addition of St. Jude on top of that and as you said, Alere remains to be seen. But in any case, I am not in a position yet where I can say, No, I have got different expectations for 2017. I actually think the underlying growth continues to be strong and everything tracking according to expectations on strategic moves otherwise. Mike Weinstein : Perfect. I will let some others jump in. Thank you, Miles. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Glenn Novarro : Thanks. Good morning guys. Miles, two questions on St. Jude. The deals are on track to close by the end of this year. But in the third quarter, you had a cybersecurity report issued. You had St. Jude issue an advisory regarding battery depletion of some of its older ICDs. So I know you have been in contact with St. Jude, but maybe talk about what gives you the confidence that these issues will not impact St. Jude's business post the deal close? And then I had a follow-up. Miles White : Well, what I would tell you so far is I think St. Jude has handled all this pretty well, pretty thoroughly and not only in terms of they are taking it seriously their own investigations, the third-party consultants and investigators that they have worked with and employed. I have to say, they definitely put patient safety and patient credibility and physician credibility and the product performance and so forth first and that's right. And I think that they have done all the right things. They have been in great communication with us. And based on everything that we know, I don't see this impacting the close of the deal or the business long term. I have seen a lot of speculation in the press. And every time there's a product issue or a hiccup or whatever it may be, everybody wants to run to the headlines and speculate about the deal. I would say based on everything I see, the deal is going to close. And determined by the timing of regulatory approvals, it's probably going to close by year-end. And I haven't seen anything to date that would suggest otherwise. Regarding the performance of the company after that, I would say honestly, what I am most anxious for is for their MRI-compatible claim to be approved by the FDA in the U.S. And frankly, if you look at the rest of their businesses, they are all growing at a pretty healthy rate and particularly overseas. And I think their success overseas has demonstrated that when we do get their MRI-compatible claim in the U.S., that their recovery of share, recovery of growth rate, et cetera, there should be pretty strong. So I haven't changed my expectations about the performance of St. Jude going forward. And I could probably someday give you my opinion about the current circumstances with the cybersecurity claims and so forth, but I will keep my thoughts to myself right now and we will wait until the deal is closed. Glenn Novarro : Okay. And just a quick follow-up. St. Jude is going to be accretive to 2017. But your accretion calculations, did it contemplate the divestitures that you just announced to Terumo? Thanks. Miles White : Yes. In a fashion, Glenn, it has. Glenn Novarro : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. MattTaylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus a little bit on the core business. We already talked about nutrition. But maybe you could just discuss some updated thoughts on how you are seeing the diagnostics business that Abbott could perform over the next few periods of the Alinity launch and how things are going in medical devices and some specifics on Absorb and MitraClip and other moving parts there. Miles White : Okay. It's kind of a big question. Well, let me start with diagnostics. I think the diagnostics business has been one of the consistent, reliable star performers of the company. It's been good mid to higher single-digit performing overall. I mean, it does have a fair number of moving parts. The core laboratory business, that just performed exceptionally well, continues to. I think, the point of care business has. We are going through the exit of an agreement in our molecular business that we will lap in a number of months. But in any case, I think all of those businesses are performing commercially well. What I am more impressed with, with this team than anything, is that over the last four to five years, they have had an unprecedented number of systems, new diagnostic systems in development in R&D that are all beginning to launch now. And I don't think ever in the history of this industry or this business has any company attempted to develop and launch multiple new systems simultaneously across every category of its business. And our diagnostics business is, both in immunoassay, in clinical chemistry, in hematology, in blood screening, in point of care and then to be followed in molecular diagnostics. And that's an unprecedented pipeline move. We will see that roll out over years now. They are beginning of the launch in Europe. We have gotten approvals to go. So we are in an unprecedented launch phase that I think sustains the growth of the diagnostics business across the board for years to come. And no other competitor is in a position to say that. And I think that the value proposition, the performance proposition, the economic proposition of those systems was well thought out, well designed. They where unveiled and shown at the recent AACC meeting in United States to great reception. So I have nothing but high and positive expectations. Now having said that, customers will slowly, they tend to be long-term contractors. They tend to be five, seven, sometimes 10 years in contracts and in tenders and so forth. So I don't expect it to be a vertical line in terms of sales. But I think, if you think about the gradual rolling of a customer base and taking of share as tenders come due and so forth, I do expect that our diagnostics business has a long, positive trajectory ahead of it and no one else does. So I am pretty excited about that. I think they are in a uniquely strong position as we look forward and we are all pretty happy about that. It's a challenge to launch that many systems. But we are reviewing them all closely, looking at them all closely and while you all have the natural hiccups at the end of a project that you do to cost you week here and a week there, weaken the grand schemes of things as much. So I am pretty pleased with how that's going. With regard to medical devices, also pleased. And again I can start at the top. And let me mention, in medical optics, where I think the cadence of new products and the performance of our R&D team has been exceptional and particularly, even recently with the launch of the Symfony Intraocular Lenses. And while we have made a deal to sell that business to J&J, we sell it in great shape with great products, great technology. They are gaining share in the cataract and intraocular lens business. I am really pleased with what the team has been able to do there and I think that the business will be in a strategically great home at J&J. We think we got fair value for the business and we are working on the integration trends transition of that to J&J. But I think they have been innovative. They have had a great cadence of new product development over time. I realized that that's mostly to the benefit now of J&J shareholders. But the point is across our businesses, we are seeing productivity out of our R&D and new product development like we have never seen before. If I move to diabetes care, our FreeStyle Libre launch in Europe has gone well. We have over 200,000 patients now. That's a lot. And that's a really good success rate so far. We had very ambitious plans for this product. And to be honest, we are behind our plans by a month or two, but it's a fairly vertical ramp. It's a pretty high ramp. And that ramp is occurring at the trajectory we projected, but about a month or two behind what we projected and it will probably stay that way. So we are going to have a terrific performance, as you can already see in the numbers for this year and even that was behind what we had hoped. But it's not because it's not on that trajectory, it just started slower than we had planned but now it's pretty on track and we are anxious to launch the consumer version in the United States and enjoy the same sort of success here. And I think it owes to the capability of the product, the unique medical proposition of the product and frankly, the economic proposition of the product. A lot of payors and a lot of government that pay today, don't bring any new technology, bring me something more cost-effective that impacts my ability to spread my budget further and treat patients better. Well, Libre has got that in the equation in a big way. So we are looking forward to the launch of that. Our medical device business will certainly be enhanced by the addition of St. Jude. But at the same time, I think there's a lot of good things happening in our vascular business, MitraClip is going well, Supera is going well. We continue to do well in our stent business in what is otherwise not a growth business. We still remain the world leader in that category. And Absorb has been licensed and launched in the United States. So I think across in the board in diagnostics and devices, without exception, even including AMO, all these businesses have shown in the last few years real progress, tangible progress in R&D, in innovation, in developments, in meeting our timelines in a disciplined fashion, bringing new products to market and we are seeing all that roll out now and over the next couple of years. And frankly, think it will be sustained after that. Now having said that, I expect the same out of our St. Jude piece and I think there's nothing but good there. So we are pretty bullish about it. Matt Taylor : Okay. Thanks for all the thoughts. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open. Rick Wise : Hi. Good morning, Miles. Miles, maybe the first question, just on Alere. Obviously, there's been a lot of public noise, if you will, a lot of headlines, a lot of discussion, but I think when people ask me about it, they just want to be reassured that the long-term post-merger opportunity that you saw initially is still there. I mean, is that the way? Do you still see it as basically impact in the plug-and-play for the portfolio? Abbott diagnostics portfolio still make sense? Where are you today on Alere? Miles White : Well, I am going to be very limited in the comments that I am willing to make about Alere, but some of that's easy to answer. So first of all, yes, there's been a lot of noise and it's come from a lot of places, not us. And it isn't prudent for us to respond to noise. I think the questions you asked are the right questions. Is the strategic fit there? Yes, it is. We like the products. We like the businesses. We have said that and I continue to say that. Is the long-term post-merger opportunity and fit there? Yes, it is and I have never wavered on that. And I believe that right now even in this minute, right. So none of that has changed for me or for us. I believe I just told you how great I think our diagnostics business is doing. Do I think that the Alere businesses are a good fit to expand that footprint and especially our point of care business? I do. Yes. I have had no change in my view strategically that way at all. Rick Wise : Okay. So turning to a different topic. Back to China briefly in nutritionals, a couple of parts to the question. Am I right in thinking that China pediatric is 3% or less of sales? Does it get worse in 2017 from here? Or are you where you are and yes, it will take a year or so to work through? And maybe two last aspects of the question. knowing you and the way your hands on approach to management, maybe are there things that you can do to maybe mitigate some of the near-term challenges? And maybe last related to all this, is the long-term outlook and how confident are you that the excellent performance in Latin America and Southeast Asia is a sustainable offset in these next few quarters as we sort of get ready for 2018 in China? Thanks Miles. Miles White : Are we talking just nutrition there, Rick? Rick Wise : Yes. Thank you. Miles White : Yes. Okay. There's a lot there. Yes. China, I think, is about 3% of overall sales. Now that said, yes, it's a small part of the company as a whole. Nevertheless, it's an important business. It's a big business. It's a business we pay a lot of attention to. Frankly, China is an important country for us for a lot of our businesses. But it is true that in the grand scheme of Abbott, as China pediatric goes, the company isn't necessarily going to be driven by just that. So we think all of our businesses, particularly large ones and that's a large one, are important, but the diversity of the company and the size of the company, obviously, absorb shock when it happens in other parts of the company. So to your question about, are we hands on mitigating and dealing with what we think we can do with the challenges? Yes, we are. The EVP of that business is spending a lot of time in China. We have made some management and leadership changes in China in a proactive way to enhance our management, our experience, our knowledge, our skill, et cetera there. I think hope always springs eternal when you make changes in your leadership team, et cetera. But it's getting a lot of focused attention by the senior leadership team on down and in the right ways. The CFO, the Controller, everybody who's got any kind of way to have a stake in this has weighed in. We do, as a team, look at our spending allocations, our capital allocations, how we are spending, where we are spending, where the bang for the buck is, et cetera. So I think we have looked at just about everything we can, not only to specifically focus on improving the situation and the performance in China, but also how to mitigate it if it doesn't improve enough or fast enough. And so yes, it's getting a fair amount of attention that way across the company. With regard to Latin America and South East Asia, I am pleased with the progress in both places, pleased with the performance of the business, frankly pleased with the performance of the business in Europe and other places too. But I am going to be careful not to project what I think can happen in any given country because the year always starts with a certain set of expectations and then has some surprise you didn't anticipate, which is one of the reasons I always tout the diverse model because somewhere something is going to go awry or different from your expectations and no matter how tightly you manage everything. In our case, I am pleased with our management teams in the various geographies you mentioned. I think they are all doing well. We have got a lot of talent in the organization. We have made some changes where we needed to. In this particular case, our challenge in China wasn't talent based as much as market driven and a lot of dynamics that change rapidly there that we had to react to and deal with. So I think there are a number of other countries picking up slack here. U.S, surprisingly is one of them in the nutrition business. I think you can see that in the numbers in the earnings report. Vietnam, doing well, strong for us. A lot of other smaller countries doing well. Vietnam, as you know, is a big business for us in the nutrition business and we have got a terrific manager there and have had for a long time and that's doing well. So there are some places that are picking up some of the slack there. Frankly, so are other business of Abbott, like the pharmaceutical business and so forth having a great year in China and other countries and good, sustained, high-growth performance. So again, yes, it's proactive. We are mitigating. It's why we are not giving any guidance or anything at this point. As I answered Mike Weinstein earlier, the underlying fundamentals of the overall growth rates in our markets are good, but one place that sticks out right now as a challenge is the pediatric business in China, which is about 3% of the company sales. Rick Wise : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Larry Biegelsen : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just two for me. First, Miles, I know it's a sensitive subject but on Alere the other question we get is, now that Alere has fulfilled its reporting requirements and the business trends have been decent, what else does Abbott want to see before closing the deal? And along those lines, if you don't complete Alere, how should we think about the dilution from the AMO divestiture and offsetting that in 2017? I did have one follow-up. Thanks. Miles White : Well, first of all, Alere is not a sensitive subject and at this point, I am just not going to make a lot of comments about it. I would say we are pursuing all the necessary regulatory approvals for the deal and at this point, that is the path. That is the things that have to happen between now and whether a deal finishes here is regulatory approval. So all necessary approvals are being pursued. We are doing everything we are supposed to do on the contract. And beyond that, I am not going to forecast it or try to. But that's it. I can't say a lot more about Alere or express opinions or whatever. I think I have said about what I can say to Rick Wise's question and to yours. And other than that, we will work through the regulatory approvals and see what happen. With regard to AMO, we have said that the perceived dilution of that business will be offset in some fashion. So you don't need to adjust your model, et cetera. I have seen that's the basis of the question because net of all considerations here in the mix of our financing of these deals, there's enough moving parts that we won't need to absorb dilution there. Larry Biegelsen : That's very helpful. And then you talked about focusing on cardiovascular devices earlier and your diabetes business is doing well, seems to have a bright future with Libre. I guess my question is, is diabetes still strategic for Abbott now that the focus is more at cardiovascular devices? Thanks for taking the question. Miles White : Yes. Diabetes is definitely strategic for Abbott. There have been a number of occasions over the past, I think, five years when I have had inbound phone calls of people interested in acquiring the diabetes care business and we absolutely said no because we had a program here that started with Navigator years ago that became Libre that fundamentally changes diabetic monitoring, glucose monitoring, et cetera, that we believe is game changing, market changing, health care changing, et cetera. And we believe that the notion and the opportunity was such that we just plain had a different game plan than everybody else and that it was worth us making that core and pursuing it and we have. And we are seeing the benefit of that now with the rollout of Libre in Europe and soon a rollout in United States. And there's a lot of opportunity for Libre beyond that depending on how we develop it and how we take it. So it is strategically core to us. If you think that's kind of on my radar screen for some strategic move, take it off your screen. That is core to Abbott, will remain core to Abbott and the opportunity there, we think, is nothing but great looking forward. Larry Biegelsen : Very clear. Thanks for taking the questions. Scott Leinenweber : Operator, we will take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Jayson Bedford : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to actually follow up on the diabetes. Clearly, it was a standout in the quarter. The noticeable step-up from trend and the guidance implies a follow-through in the fourth quarter. You have unique offering with Libre. Is double-digit growth how you expect this franchise to play out over the next couple of years? Miles White : Well, you have got two franchises going here. You have got the old established legacy franchise of blood glucose monitoring and then you have got what we call flash glucose monitoring or Libre. And that older blood glucose monitoring market is clearly under both volume and price pressure and Libre is growing rapidly in Europe and we expect to grow rapidly in the United States. So at some point, we would hope that Libre would grow so significantly that it would overtake the other. So I don't expect, obviously, that kind of growth out of the base. But I think we are going to keep experiencing pretty heavy double-digit growth out of Libre for the foreseeable future. So yes, I think it drives a lot of growth. But where it crosses in the overall business is somehow double-digit. I am not sure I can project. Jayson Bedford : Okay. That's fair. And then just second question on gross margin. It's down year-over-year. My understanding is that FX is weighed on this metric. Is there a point where we anniversary the FX headwinds and are able to see some gross margin expansion in the base business, meaning, excluding St. Jude and Alere? Miles White : Well, I would say it's interesting. We have put a fair amount of focus on gross margin, more than four or five years ago in a couple of our businesses and you can see that. You can see it in the performance. You can see it in the bottom line of those businesses. You can see it in the bottom line of the company. You can see it in those margins of the company. So we expanded those efforts across the company in a number of places. And I think what we have obviously learned from that is there's always opportunity to improve your business model, improve your cost structure, improve your gross margin, et cetera and it hasn't been done with price. It's been done with the fundamental inputs in cost and the way we do business, the way we manufacture, the way we do a lot of things. So I think there's always opportunity and we approach the business and the businesses every year with that in mind. And it's fortunate that we have because we have had some great success there in a couple of businesses particularly, which has offset the effects of exchange over the last, say three, four years which, as you know, has been pretty heavy. And without that, the company would have obviously been at a lot more profit growth pressure. So for us, it's become a routine. We look for more gross margin improvement opportunity every year. And if I look across the businesses, there are still many opportunities for us as we benchmark competitors or other models, the business models we see out there to improve the cost structure of our business in ways that are meaningful for the corporation. Included in that is even the cost of new things launching. The cost of our new diagnostic analyzers will be a tremendous improvement over the cost of our current diagnostic analyzers. And one of the ways you can affect gross margin over the long term is design it in your products and we are. So I think there's a lot of initiatives internally at the company and across businesses now that make this part of routine daily life to keep improving gross margin. I can't forecast to you right know how that will impact us. But I think in a world where you denominated in dollars and every year exchange tries to erode some of your top and bottom line, it becomes a routine part of your business to always be looking at ways to improve your margin and we do and we are and we are having a fair amount of success with that. Jayson Bedford : I appreciate the color. Thank you. Miles White : Okay. Thank you.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. During the question and answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the star, one key on your touchtone phone. Should you become disconnected throughout this conference call, please redial the number provided to you and reference the Abbott earnings call. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question and answer session, the entire call, including the question and answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1(a), Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, as well as in St. Jude Medical\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 and St. Jude Medical\u2019s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that fourth quarter financial results and guidance provided on today\u2019s call for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay, thanks Scott, and good morning. Today I\u2019ll discuss our 2016 results, as well as our outlook for 2017. For the full year 2016, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.20, representing double-digit underlying growth. Continued strong performance across many of our businesses and operating margin expansion enabled us to deliver adjusted earnings per share at the upper end of the initial guidance range we set forth at the beginning of last year. Importantly, 2016 was a year of significant shaping for Abbott. We\u2019ve lined our businesses with long-term growth trends, and it\u2019s been our intention to build leadership positions in all areas of healthcare where we compete. This past year, we took multiple strategic steps to ensure we\u2019re in the right businesses that provide the best opportunities for our future. I\u2019ll start with the pending sale of our medical optics business, or AMO. We entered the vision care business several years ago with the intent that AMO would be a foundational cornerstone for us to build upon. Under Abbott, this business performed well, gaining share and improving operating profitability; however, as we looked over the long term, we didn\u2019t see sufficient opportunities for us to build AMO into a more broad-based leader in vision care. Strategically, the decision was made to strengthen our medical device business in a market that offered the greatest long-term growth and leadership potential, and that market is cardiovascular care, one of the largest and most important areas of healthcare. The recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical creates the kind of market-leading position we seek in all of our businesses. This includes strong positions in nearly every area of the $30 billion cardiovascular device market, including coronary stents, cardiac rhythm management, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. Importantly, Abbott now has one of the strongest product pipelines in the industry. The combined best-in-class portfolio has the depth, breadth and innovation to help patients restore their health and deliver greater value to customers and payors. So we enter 2017 as a stronger company. The fundamentals of the markets where we compete remain strong, and we have good momentum across our businesses. We\u2019re also entering a period where innovation and new product launches will fortify our leadership positions. I\u2019ll touch on some examples and important new products during my commentary on each of our businesses in a moment. As we announced this morning, we expect to deliver strong financial performance in 2017. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.40 to $2.50 reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint. I\u2019ll now provide a brief overview of our 2016 results and 2017 outlook for each business. I\u2019ll start with nutrition, where Abbott is the global leader in the adult market and maintains leadership positions in the pediatric market across several geographies, including the number one position in the United States. As expected, fourth quarter sales growth was affected by challenging market conditions in China, including new food safety regulations that are set to go into effect in January 2018 and a consequent oversupply of product in the market. Although we expect market conditions will remain challenging in 2017, the longer term fundamentals of the Chinese infant formula market remain attractive. With localized R&D in China and a world-class global supply chain, we\u2019re well equipped to navigate this highly dynamic market with a competitive portfolio of products that are aligned with evolving customer needs and purchasing channels. In the U.S., we continue to outperform the pediatric nutrition market driven by several recently launched new products, and we continue to drive strong growth in both pediatric and adult nutrition in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Turning to established pharmaceuticals, or EPD, which achieved double-digit operational sales growth for both the fourth quarter and full year 2016, EPD has grown into the business that we envisioned when we created and further shaped it through a series of strategic actions, including the sale of our developed markets business and the acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. With leading market positions in several geographies, including India, Russia and Latin America, EPD is well positioned for sustained above-market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world. In 2017, we\u2019ll continue to execute our unique operating model which focuses on portfolio selling in core therapeutic areas where we have well recognized, highly trusted brands. This portfolio approach creates unique channel opportunities in differentiated relationships with physicians, retailers and pharmacies that are looking to offer a complete line of solutions to treat prominent local health conditions. We continuously refresh and enhance our localized product offerings through internal development, cross-registration of brands across geographies, as well as local and regional acquisitions and in-licensing. In 2017, we\u2019ll further strengthen our development capabilities with an expanded EPD innovation center in India. In addition to developing new drug formulations, dosing and other differentiated offerings, the center will act as a hub, shipping products to over 30 countries that will further develop differentiated products to suit local needs. In diagnostics, we achieved another year of above-market sales growth in 2016, and importantly we initiated the global launch of Alinity, an integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. The Alinity solutions represent a major leap forward over competitive systems in terms of automation, throughput, space efficiency, and ease of use, which will help our customers address issues they face every day, including higher testing volumes, constrained staffing and space, and complex disparate processes and instruments. In the fourth quarter of last year, we obtained CE Mark for our point-of-care, immunoassay, clinical chemistry, and blood screening systems, and have initiated the launch of these four systems in Europe. Over the next couple of years, we\u2019ll launch the full Alinity suite across Europe and into additional geographies, including the U.S. in the 2018 time frame. This unprecedented level of innovation is an extremely ambitious undertaking and one that will strengthen our competitive position tremendously for years to come. Lastly, I\u2019ll cover our medical devices business. As I mentioned earlier, 2016 was truly a transformational year for this business. The acquisition of St. Jude represents a major strategic move that establishes Abbott with a premier medical device business comprised of cardiovascular, neuromodulation, and diabetes care. These represent some of the largest and fastest growing areas of healthcare, and we now hold leading positions in each area. In 2017, our focus will be on integrating the businesses, achieving the projected synergies and financial targets and successfully delivering on new product launches. Our integration approach will bring forward the best of both companies with a focus on creating a best-in-class cross-functional organization. In terms of synergies, we anticipate annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million by 2020, including revenue expansion opportunities as well as operational and SG&A efficiencies. We\u2019ve modeled the progression of these synergies as fairly linear over the next four years. Lastly, 2017 will be an important year for innovation across our medical device business. In our diabetes care business, growth is being driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative sensor-based glucose monitoring system that eliminates routine finger sticks. This system offers convenience, ease of use, and affordability, and is a truly differentiated solution for the large and growing diabetic population. In 2017, we\u2019ll continue to focus on driving uptake in Europe where we now have over 250,000 users. We received U.S. approval for the professional use version of Libre in the third quarter of 2016 and we look forward to bringing the consumer version of Libre to the U.S. market in the second half of this year. Other areas where the combined Abbott and St. Jude business will drive rapid growth and important new product innovations include mitral valve disease, where Abbott is the global leader in minimally invasive repair with MitraClip, and has multiple ongoing development programs in the area of mitral valve replacement. The combination with St. Jude strengthens our R&D expertise in this area and broadens our commercial presence. Atrial fibrillation, where Abbott is now the number two player in this fast growth market with a broad portfolio of products, including the recently launched EnSite Precision Mapping System. Heart failure, where Abbott is now the clear global leader in assist devices and is developing other important heart failure products with great potential to improve outcomes and reduce cost, and neuromodulation, a fast-growing device market that addresses pain and movement disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. The addition of St. Jude adds multiple recently launched products that will drive continued strong growth in this business. So in summary, we delivered on our projections in 2016 and expect double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2017. Our portfolio is aligned with favorable demographic trends that are driving growth in healthcare. Through a series of organic and inorganic strategic actions, we\u2019ve built leading positions across all of our businesses, and our broad-based innovation pipeline has never been stronger than it is today. With these growth drivers intact, Abbott is well positioned to deliver significant growth in 2017 and the years beyond. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2016 results and 2017 outlook in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Okay, thanks Miles. Today we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.65, in line with our previous expectations. Sales for the quarter increased 3.8% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact of 1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased 2.8% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 28.3% of sales, all in line with previous guidance. Overall as we look back at 2016, we achieved our financial objectives for the year, including mid-single digit operational sales growth and margin improvement to once again deliver double-digit underlying adjusted earnings growth. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2017, today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.40 to $2.50, which reflects double-digit underlying growth of Abbott\u2019s base business, accretion from the acquisition of St. Jude of $0.21, the pending sale of our medical optics business which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, and the expected unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on our operating results based on current exchange rates. In terms of our 2017 sales forecast, please note that all references to sales growth unless otherwise noted are on a comparable basis which adjusts the 2016 basis of comparison to include St. Jude\u2019s 2016 results adjusted for the recent sale of its vascular closure business, and excludes sales of our medical optics business. On this basis, our 2016 sales baseline would be $25.4 billion, and we forecast comparable operational sales growth in the mid single digits for the full year 2017. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year comparable reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 60% of sales for the full year, which reflects the profitability mix of Abbott and St. Jude as well as underlying gross margin improvement across our integrated business. We forecast adjusted R&D investment for the combined businesses of somewhat above 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales, which includes expense synergies associated with the addition of St. Jude. We forecast net interest expense of around $700 million. The increase over 2016 reflects debt-related interest expense associated with the St. Jude transaction, partially offset by deployment of proceeds from the sale of St. Jude\u2019s vascular closure business and the pending sale of our medical optics business. We forecast a loss of approximately $15 million on the exchange gain/loss line of the P&L for the full year 2017, and we forecast around $45 million of non-operating expense. Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 16.5% for the full year 2017. The 2017 adjusted tax rate is lower than our historical adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% which reflects the tax deductibility of the higher interest expense that I discussed earlier. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2017, we forecast an adjusted earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.44. As you would expect, synergies associated with the St. Jude acquisition are expected to ramp as we progress through the year. We forecast comparable operational sales growth in the low single digits and at current exchange rates we\u2019d expect a negative impact from exchange of around 1.5%, resulting in low single digit comparable reported sales growth for the first quarter 2017. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 8% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 33% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $210 million in the first quarter. Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our full year and first quarter operational sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single digit operational sales growth for the full year 2017 with balanced above-market growth across our key emerging markets, and we forecast low to mid-single digit growth for the first quarter. In nutrition, we forecast operational sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the full year 2017, and relatively flat sales growth for the first quarter with expected sequential improvement in growth rates as we progress through the year. In diagnostics, we forecast operational sales growth above mid-single digits for the full year 2017 driven by continued above-market performance in the U.S. and international markets, and we forecast low to mid-single growth for the first quarter. In diabetes care, we forecast double-digit operational sales growth for both the full year and first quarter, driven by continued strong market uptake of FreeStyle Libre. Lastly, Abbot\u2019s legacy vascular business and St. Jude have been combined into our cardiovascular and neuromodulation business. Yesterday, we issued an 8-K that provides comparable quarterly unaudited sales for the first nine months of 2016 which assumes that St. Jude was part of Abbott in 2016. This morning, we provided an additional 8-K to update the comparable quarterly unaudited sales to include the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, we forecast comparable operational sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for this business and we forecast comparable operational sales growth in the low single digits for the first quarter. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Mike Weinstein : Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Miles White : Yes. Mike Weinstein : Okay, perfect. Good morning, Miles. A couple things I wanted to touch on first. So one, can you talk about the St. Jude performance in the fourth quarter? The St. Jude CRM sales ended up coming in below, it looks like, the street\u2019s expectations, and the guidance for the first quarter seems to suggest that that business is still struggling from the recalls they had in the third quarter. So if you could touch on the St. Jude performance and then the outlook there. Then second, the overall business, the expectation I think that Brian laid out was that the business would grow operationally low single digits in the first quarter, but then get to mid-single digits for the year. So if you could just walk us through that, that\u2019d be great. Thanks. Miles White : Okay, first comment on St. Jude fourth quarter, CRM I think has continued to struggle. I mean, we can see that in the sales and the share and so forth. I expect that to be rectified imminently here, shortly. The good news is we\u2019ve seen in other markets around the world when they\u2019ve gotten their MRI claim, they have recovered and restored whatever position they have lost. That\u2019s obviously been an overhang for them for this last year and the fourth quarter was no exception. So the good news is we expect that very shortly, but your observation about it was correct. I\u2019ll turn to Brian here for a little bit of underlying detail on your second question. Brian Yoor : Sure, Mike. A step-up in sales throughout the year is simply what Miles message is - the stabilization of the CRM that we just talked about on the MRI claim, but also the opportunity to penetrate the accounts that we have with the combined businesses together is another contributor as we go to the market with a much broader presence of products as we call on the various accounts. Also, you\u2019ll note that they had some nice approvals that we talked about with EnSite Precision, a key driver of growth in atrial fibrillation which has been growing in the double digits. We expect a lot of continued strong growth here, and there\u2019s also a couple key catalysts here that we\u2019re expecting as we move through the year, one being Confirm, which is in the heart failure space with atrial fibrillation - we expect that to be a unique contributor for the patients who have atrial fibrillation, and then also the continued contribution of neuromodulation. They recently had the Verse [ph] technology, which has had a lot of success and we expect that to continue, and then that for deep brain stimulation as well. Finally, there\u2019s one more catalyst, and that\u2019s HeartMate 3. It\u2019s been doing really well in Europe. They\u2019re the leader there. We do expect an approval of HeartMate 3 in the U.S. as we move through 2017, and that would be a contributor on the back half. Mike Weinstein : Okay, and then just quickly on your bridge, if you would Brian, the assumed impact from both FX and from the AMO divestiture for 2017? Brian Yoor : Yes, the assumed--again, on a comparable reported sales basis, which Scott--and we filed an 8-K this morning, it\u2019s 2.5% of sales on a comparable basis, and then the AMO business will likely have sales in the first quarter of no more than a couple hundred million dollars. But as you recall, the full year was about $1.2 billion. Mike Weinstein : Sorry, I meant EPS. Brian Yoor : Oh, on the earnings per share? De minimis, Michael, on AMO. It typically is not a big earner in the first quarter just based on the pattern of spending; and again, if there is a little de minimis contribution, that also plays into the moving parts of where we\u2019re offsetting the dilution that we\u2019re seeing from the vascular closure divestiture. Mike Weinstein : I\u2019m sorry, Brian, I was talking about the full year bridge for 2017, so the FX headwind I think in our modeling, we were at about $0.08 for FX for the full year. Is that close-- Brian Yoor : You\u2019re in the range. You might be a little bit north of that, Mike. We are probably closer to a dime. Mike Weinstein : Okay, and the AMO divestiture, is that still about $0.11? Brian Yoor : You\u2019re right, Mike, and remember this offset to--the AMO divestiture is $0.11, but we\u2019re deploying proceeds, so the net is $0.07. That is a complete wash with otherwise what we had a long time ago with our general purpose financing, which was also negative $0.07. Mike Weinstein : Understood, thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to explore, I guess, some of the trends in nutrition, because you talked about improvement throughout the year as well there, too. So obviously we know about some of the challenges that you had in China last quarter, and you had some puts and takes in the results this quarter. Can you walk us through your assumptions for how China fares for the early part of the year until you lap your comps, and then what else is driving that improvement in nutrition? Scott Leinenweber : Hi Matt, this is Scott. I\u2019ll touch on it very quickly. As you know, market conditions continued to remain relatively challenging in China for all competitors. It is a market dynamic. We do expect as we go through the year, our performance in that business to improve. Certainly as we start to lap through some of the impacts that we started to feel in the third and fourth quarter here of 2016, you\u2019ll see some natural improvement but we also expect our business to improve as well. If you go outside of China, though, really there\u2019s been nice performance in Latin American and in Southeast Asia. We continue to perform very well in the U.S. on the pediatric side of the business, and then obviously as you know, optically our results have looked a bit suppressed because of our scale-down in Venezuela, so our results and our performance in 2016 actually are a little bit higher than the print would indicate there as well. So we have a number of initiatives in place in China. We\u2019re well prepared and understand the situation on the ground, and we\u2019ll work our way through it at the beginning of this year and we expect our growth rates there to improve throughout the year. Matt Taylor : Great, then just one follow-up on that earlier CRM question. Just because MRI is such a big deal, can you talk about why you have confidence that, I guess, the pacemaker approval could be imminent, and can you give us any update on the timeline for your high power expectation for the timing of that approval in the U.S.? Scott Leinenweber : Yes, so I\u2019ll touch base on the high power piece initially. So our updates on that are it will be later in the year. We\u2019re looking at about the fourth quarter there for both of those high power devices. The pacemaker piece, we think is a little bit more imminent. We\u2019ve had ongoing discussions with the FDA on that front and we feel like that one is right around the corner and should start to contribute here fairly early in the year, but the other two will be second half of \u201917 items. Matt Taylor : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open. Rick Wise : Good morning everybody. Hello Miles. It\u2019s hard to resist asking you a bigger picture question. Obviously we\u2019re witnessing what could be dramatic political policy changes in Washington. [Indiscernible] it seems like a lot could have potentially positive impacts on Abbott, but there\u2019s some worrisome things as well - hospital capital spending uncertainty post-ACA changes, trade agreements--especially with some of the trade agreement changes. It\u2019s hard, again, to resist asking you, how are you thinking about some of these issues? Are you concerned that this is all going to be a net plus or a negative? How are you adapting, et cetera, especially given your significant OUS exposure? Miles White : You know, it\u2019s hard to speculate. I\u2019d say in general I\u2019m optimistic, and I\u2019d say for a number of reasons. Some of the things that have been talked about won\u2019t necessarily directly affect us. They may affect a number of multinationals. Obviously our new administration is pro-business, but there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in that, as you know. The things I look for that might affect us, I think early on, I think we\u2019re all waiting to see if there\u2019s a tax reform package that would allow us the ability to access overseas cash and repatriate cash, et cetera. I think that would make a big difference for a lot of multinationals. I don\u2019t really expect to see any changes in the Affordable Care Act directly affect us as much as I think they\u2019ll affect other segments of the healthcare industry or business, and I think a lot of the effort will be pointed at other segments more than the spaces we\u2019re in. At least as far as that is impacted, we\u2019re primarily a diagnostic device company in the United States, so I think that to some degree, some of that impact could be favorable for us. The other things that I watch going forward is policies that affect strong dollar-weak dollar - you know, strength of currencies and so on, because we\u2019re so geographically diverse internationally. I mean, I think one of the benefits - it\u2019s not the primary benefit - but one of the benefits of the St. Jude acquisition is it does spread and balance us into developed market currencies a little more than we have been, and in general I\u2019d like to see stability in the currency markets for us relative to the dollar, which has been a headwind for us for at least four years now. I think that will affect all multinationals. So you know, while there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around the various things that this administration appears to be making priorities out of, I\u2019d say that there are relatively few that would impact us early on, and I think the impact is likely to be favorable, that being primarily tax and/or cash access. Rick Wise : Turning to a cash flow question, maybe Brian, you\u2019d want to talk about the cash flow outlook post-the St. Jude deal, and maybe any stepped up initiatives to focus even more on even better cash generation potential and help us think what that might mean for debt pay down over the next couple of years and your targets there. Miles White : Brian is point at me to take that question, Rick. You know, there is a stepped up emphasis on cash flow, definitely, and I\u2019d say we\u2019ve always been a pretty strong cash flow generator. We balance our use of cash, as you know, among internal capex, dividend, share repurchase, M&A activity, and so forth. Obviously for the next little while, we\u2019re not going to be putting a lot of emphasis into M&A. We\u2019re going to hold back on magnitude of share repurchase, et cetera. We\u2019re maintaining our dividend, growing it a bit, and a lot of emphasis will be put on, I\u2019d say, rapid pay down or reduction of debt. I think that\u2019s kind of a prudent place to be for the nearest term, so we\u2019re being very, very prudent about cash use, cash flow, et cetera internally. I think we can do that for a while here and put ourselves back in a range where I think a conservative financial company like us would be, and get back to kind of the normal balance. You know, we\u2019ve slowed the growth of the dividend. Will we restore that? We will, but we want to get to some targets, some leverage targets first, and we want to get there rapidly. So you know, not only in terms of our internal investments and so forth that we\u2019ve across the board got a very emphasis on freeing and generating cash, and I\u2019d say generally when we\u2019ve had even a little bit of emphasis on that in the past, we\u2019ve done very well, so that definitely is getting a lot of attention right now. Rick Wise : Just one last quick one from me on Libre. Libre is off to a clearly brilliant start in Europe, and you\u2019ve said, I think, second half \u201917 filing in the U.S. How do we think about growth from here and what kind of label you\u2019re hoping for to drive U.S. adoption of the technology? Thanks. Miles White : Well, it\u2019s already filed, but it\u2019s--you know, I have to say, to be honest, the FDA has shifted sand on us a couple times here, so consequently we\u2019re seeking both claims, replacement claim and adjunctive claim. We\u2019re going parallel path on this, and I think that the performance of the product thus far ex-U.S., Europe and other countries, has been frankly excellent and does have replacement claim and so forth. I think the potential for the U.S. is extraordinary, and I think not only is the product itself an extraordinary product, but I think its value proposition is unparalleled. So--and I think the reason we\u2019ve been able to get reimbursement in Europe and drive uptake as much as we have owes to the fact that governments there recognize the value proposition in the product as not only impact for patients but impact on the cost to the healthcare system. So I\u2019d say at this point, I clearly can\u2019t predict what the FDA\u2019s timelines and so forth are going to be here, but we\u2019re upbeat about the potential for it. Rick Wise : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Glenn Novarro : Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on the MRI ICD. Last year, St. Jude was telling the street approval, I think somewhere around the second quarter of 2017. You\u2019re now saying kind of fourth quarter of 2017. Can you talk to us about what\u2019s creating this delay, what\u2019s the hold-up at the FDA? Miles White : You know, I think you\u2019re referencing--I think you\u2019re confusing two different products possibly here, which is high voltage versus low voltage. In effect, we\u2019re telling you now we expect the low voltage, which is the primary bulk of use, imminently here, which you could read first quarter, not second quarter, and high voltage later in the year. Two different areas. Scott Leinenweber : Yes, I\u2019d just add to that as well. Obviously we\u2019ve been working with them on the low voltage piece. There\u2019s a bit of a gating factor and [indiscernible] generally run in parallel as well, so those discussions overlap and the process overlaps for a period as well, so there\u2019s some sequencing to that. I will say on all of these timing items that I gave [indiscernible], all of those were contemplated along those lines in our deal model, so there\u2019s nothing different in our deal model relative to those timelines. Glenn Novarro : Okay, all right. I guess for some reason, I thought they were assuming a 4Q16 pacemaker MRI safe approval, and a 2Q17 MRI safe ICE approval. But let me just ask you one other question. The cash proceeds that you\u2019re getting from selling the medical optics business to J&J and the cash proceeds that you\u2019ve received from the asset sales to Terumo, have you applied that to your 2017 guide; in other words, are the cash proceeds being used to pay down debt or are we waiting to get more clarity on Alere? Thanks. Miles White : No, we\u2019re not waiting for more clarity. We\u2019ve pretty much applied it to our entire borrowing scheme, et cetera. No surprise, we\u2019ve been able--you know, as we went into this, we had planned for many different paths and outcomes, so it\u2019s contemplated in our financing. Glenn Novarro : Okay, great. Thanks for the clarity, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Larry Biegelsen : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First on EPB and diagnostics, the Q4 guidance was a little softer than the full year 2017 guidance. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that and what drives the acceleration? And just second for me, Brian, can you talk a little bit about the margin profile of the company beyond 2017? The guidance you gave for this year implied, if my math is right, about a 22% operating margin and a better gross margin than we expected. Just a little color on how to think about the margins going forward, thanks. Brian Yoor : Sure. Larry, I assume when you\u2019re talking about established pharma, you\u2019re referring to the Q1 guidance, and it is a little bit low. In 2016 it was the last, and it was just the timing of when these shipments are received of some essential medicines into Venezuela, so that\u2019s just causing the last of our quarters of comps here. They\u2019ll step up right to the growth rates we\u2019ve been accustomed to seeing for several quarters now, which has been high single, even double digits based on the strength of this business. That\u2019s with respect to EPB. With respect to the margin and how to think about it, there definitely is the impact of bringing in St. Jude into the mix, and that provides some natural accretion there. You\u2019re probably in a very tight range there with what you referenced in terms of a profile of 22%. I think of the expansion over \u201916 being roughly half mix, but also synergies. Keep in mind we\u2019re going to improve the profiles that historically St. Jude have had, and those will ramp significantly in Q2 and even further from there as we move through the year. Then finally, gross margin, as you know, and operating margin has always been a focus for us, and if you want to deliver double-digit underlying base earnings growth, you\u2019re going to be naturally in that 70 to 80 BPs of range based on mid-single digit top line growth. Larry Biegelsen : Brian, thanks for that. On the diagnostic business, I didn\u2019t hear you comment as to why--I mean, if I heard the guidance correctly, you expect low to mid-single digits in Q1, but greater than mid-single digits for the full year. If you could just comment on that, that\u2019d be great, and that\u2019s it for me. Thanks guys. Scott Leinenweber : Yes Larry, what we anticipate in diagnostics, which as Miles mentioned in his prepared remarks had some really strong growth, in particular as we hit the second half to the year and Alinity really starts to gain some traction and we gain access to some contracts on that front, so there\u2019s some natural strength there in the back half of the year. In the first half of the year, the first quarter what you\u2019re seeing, to Brian\u2019s point on EPD, there was a smidgen of Venezuela in the first quarter of 2016 in diagnostics, and you\u2019re also seeing some of that last scale-down within our genetics business which is well known and as expected in our molecular diagnostics business as well. So it\u2019s more of a comparable item there. The underlying strength of that business is strong, and it will actually pick up steam as we head out through the year. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Kristen Stewart : Hi, just a modeling question then a big picture question. For the interest expense line item, I think you\u2019re modeling about $700 million for the full year. That does include, I think, some of the debt that was taken out for Alere. What are you assuming with that for the balance of the year in terms of redeployment? Is that assuming going down to pay down debt or share repurchase, or how should we just think about that to the extent Alere does come or doesn\u2019t come in, in terms of accretion? Brian Yoor : Yes Kristen, the way to think about the build of the 700 is we took out $15 million of debt for the St. Jude transaction, and I think that was somewhere around 3.75%. Keep in mind, too, we\u2019re also assuming some debt from St. Jude as well - that was a contributor to the addition of debt, and we just had our ongoing normal debt that had interest on it for Abbott. When you add all those things up, and then to Miles\u2019 point say that we said we\u2019ve contemplated the deployment of proceeds from the divestitures that we earlier talked about, that\u2019s how you net out to the 700. Kristen Stewart : Okay, great, and then I guess big picture for Miles, you\u2019d mentioned obviously earlier in your remarks, this is a significant year of shaping for Abbott. Certainly I think we can all agree to that - it\u2019s been several years of shaping. As you look over the next three to five years, how do you just think about Abbott overall? Is it likely that we\u2019ll see another kind of reshaping of the mix, any thoughts on further divestitures of the businesses or potential, I guess, break-ups? I know you\u2019re obviously putting a lot in in 2017 here, but I guess how do you just think about the evolving healthcare environment and kind of macro environment now, relative to the mix of your businesses? Thanks. Miles White : Well, I\u2019ll put this in a little bit of context. When we spun off AbbVie, which has now been four years ago, there was a lot of, call it post-separation, call it clean up to do. We had to take the attendant overhead in the company down, finish the back office separations and so forth with AbbVie, and as you know, we did want to reshape some of our portfolio. We sold the developed market generic drug business to Mylan and we acquired CFR and Veropharm, so we made a number of moves that we think positioned the EPB business very strongly. We had great organic internal investment in diagnostics and strong business that really wouldn\u2019t benefit from a lot of M&A in nutrition, and the weaker part of the company that got attention from analysts, investors and others that we believe needed strengthening as a fourth leg of the company was medical devices. With the St. Jude acquisition, we think we\u2019ve pretty directly addressed that, and having placed our investment on the cardiovascular health segment, which we believe is pretty important, we determined we didn\u2019t have the same opportunity in medical optics to build and add on and grow onto that, like in this case J&J would, so we divested that. Now at this point, having made all those significant changes, we look at the company and say, we\u2019ve got four very strong sectors that are very well positioned in their respective product markets and their respective geographic markets. Our challenge, or at least opportunity now looking forward for the next few years is integrate St. Jude and, frankly, focus on the organic pipelines of new products coming, and execute so that we can see the growth benefit of the strength of these four segments around the world, so in their various segments want to see the growth out of ADD for all these new systems, we want to see the growth out of St. Jude in our vascular business for their new products. Obviously the same with EPB, which has got a very good sustained growth track, and same with our nutrition business. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re going to be focused pretty operationally here for the next several years. That\u2019s our intent. I think when you go through a phase where you\u2019ve made a number of transactions, people get very transaction focused, and we\u2019re still an operating company. That\u2019s what we intend to be here, is an operating company, and operate them very well and grow the targets that we\u2019ve grown. We\u2019ve always had double-digit earnings targets and we\u2019ve positioned ourselves in growth markets, both product and geographically for the purpose of sustaining that identity for investors to be double-digit earnings growers and so forth. With the new product pipelines and the strategic positioning of the company, I think we\u2019re extremely well positioned to deliver on that, so that\u2019s going to be our focus for the next few years. Kristen Stewart : Okay, and you\u2019ve certainly made a lot of individual purchases in the stock, so clearly I guess that expresses your view on what the future holds. Miles White : I\u2019d say it very much expresses my view on what the future holds. You know, you always hear these comments about alignment with your shareholders. I am a shareholder, and I believe that the stock represents excellent value, and that\u2019s why I bought the shares. Kristen Stewart : Perfect, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Bob Hopkins : Hi, thanks very much for taking the questions. Can you hear me okay? Miles White : Yes. Bob Hopkins : Great, good morning. So first question is, I just wanted to make sure I understand the fourth quarter growth rates in a little bit more detail. Would you be willing to give us the--you know, what was the core legacy Abbott growth rate this quarter ex-Venezuela? I know it was 3.8% organically, but how much did Venezuela detract from that? Brian Yoor : Yes, our core growth rate excluding Venezuela would have been around 5%. Bob Hopkins : Okay, so--and most of that drag goes away in Q1? Brian Yoor : Well as we discussed earlier, we\u2019ll have bits and pieces in EPB mainly, but then we\u2019re through it. Bob Hopkins : Okay, and then two other quick things. I was wondering if you could give us for the fourth quarter, what was the legacy growth rate of St. Jude\u2019s revenue base, kind of ex-divestitures. I was just curious what a clean revenue growth rate was for St. Jude in the fourth quarter. Brian Yoor : Yes, so a clean growth rate, it was in the low single digits, on the upper end of that around 2.5% or so. You know, we expect obviously as we go through the year with some of the launches, with the approvals on the MRI side, with EnSite Precision and some of these other innovations that are coming, as well as with some of the modest revenue synergies that we have baked in initially, that will ramp over time, that the St. Jude combined business with ours should accelerate growth here in 2017 over \u201916. Bob Hopkins : And then just lastly, really quickly on 2017, two quick things. One, the EPS guidance for the first half was a little bit below where the street was. Can you help us understand the cadence of the earnings power over the course of the year, like maybe what percentage of their earnings is in the back half, just given that Q1 number was a little bit below what we were thinking? And then also, I was just wondering if you could give us your view on Abbott\u2019s opinion of the outlook for the growth rate of the ICD market as we look forward into 2017, given that that\u2019s been obviously challenged of late. Thank you. Brian Yoor : Let me take the first one here, Bob. I think it\u2019s safe to assume that you\u2019re going to have greater than 50% on the back half of the year, and also contemplated in that is the benefit of this financing also that we talked about. The combination of that, the deployment of our proceeds to generate benefit and synergies ramp is just going to naturally put you into a stronger second half versus the first half. The other thing in the first quarter I\u2019d just note is that when you think about the FX impact, it has a modestly heavier impact on Q1 relative to the other quarters, so we feel comfortable with this ramp, we know the pieces are in place, some of them are just simply comps. Bob Hopkins : And then on ICDs? Brian Yoor : Yes, we expect that market to be relatively flat as an overall market, which would be a little bit of price down offset by some modest volume. Bob Hopkins : Thanks very much for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Lewis : Good morning. Maybe two quick ones for Brian and then one strategic question for Miles. Brian, I have two questions. It\u2019s been a long time since we got the first synergy number - almost a year. Any greater clarity, kind of post-close of St. Jude, how you\u2019re thinking about that synergy number, either the mix of revenue or cost synergies, the absolute size of that number, and the cadence over the next couple years? Brian Yoor : Yes David, nothing really. We said it was going to be linear, fairly linear. We talked about the mix being heavier on the SG&A side initially and then the revenues ramping over time. I\u2019d say the difference about us versus just putting a revenue--or excuse me, a fully synergy number out there is we go out and identify these relatively fast as part of our normal acquisition due diligence, so those are well in place, they\u2019re in plans to be executed. We hope to do a little better maybe in the first year than what we said in linear, but we\u2019ll see how that plays out over the year. David Lewis : Okay, and I know you and Miles both stressed free cash flow earlier on in the call. Is there any kind of target, either in \u201917 or \u201918, as a percent of net income we should be thinking about in terms of free cash? That\u2019s a question for Brian. And then Miles, I just think given what happened earlier this week, it\u2019s pretty interesting - the two best consumer-oriented device companies were probably yourselves and J&J, and they\u2019re buying one of your consumer-based franchises but they announced they want to get out of their other consumer-facing diabetes franchise. Can you just talk about how you see the diabetes franchise going forward and why you think that\u2019s the right consumer franchise for Abbott to stay in, versus ophthalmology where you made a different decision? So those two, and I\u2019ll jump back in queue. Thank you. Miles White : Yes, I would say we\u2019re in kind of a unique position relative to a lot of the traditional competitors in this space in diabetic glucose monitoring. In the past, the four major competitors there, and there\u2019s always--there\u2019s a lot of other smaller ones, it\u2019s been a finger prick and a little chip business, and we have a unique position here with Libre that is a completely different product that eliminates the need for that finger stick and gives a continuous glucose read that\u2019s, frankly, impactful for the patient, both Type 2 and Type 1 in a very different way. I think that puts us in a unique position to see a transformation of that market and to benefit from it, if not lead it. Others don\u2019t have that, and I think that the competition in what I\u2019ll call the traditional part of the market and the commodity nature of it, the economics of it have clearly changed negatively in the past couple of years. Ironically, J&J kind of led that, and in our case we\u2019ve got a different position with Libre that I think gives us a unique platform to benefit as one of the disruptors. Going forward, I believe that platform has possible utility for us in other testing segments, so in our case we see a growing business that as we replace the traditional finger stick business, not only ours but others, I think there\u2019s an opportunity there that\u2019s a real growth opportunity and a very valuable one. David Lewis : Okay, and Brian, just on free cash? Is there a decent percentage to think about, maybe this year or next year as a percent of net income that the free cash generation can be? Brian Yoor : Yes David, let me provide some context too. I think you saw our cash flow from 2015. I think with all the things that Miles mentioned [indiscernible], you should expect to see a little bit of a step-up when you get to the K in \u201916, showing the step function of the efforts we\u2019re making here on free cash. You know, it\u2019s tough to completely model out what the ongoing sustainable, I\u2019ll say, free cash flow conversion is to net income in the early years with an integration, but if you look at St. Jude, they are a very powerful cash earner. We\u2019re excited about bringing that into the portfolio. If you take away the one-time things that are transitory, David, that go with an integration, be that expense or capital that bears fruit long-term, we\u2019ll probably be in that competitive range that you see others, probably somewhere in that 70% to 80% range. That\u2019s probably what we\u2019d target. David Lewis : Great, thank you so much. Scott Leinenweber : Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS. Your line is open. Matt Miksic : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. So just one follow-up here. I know there\u2019s been a number of questions on MRI and St. Jude, but maybe just a couple of clarifications, if I could. We hear some different expectations in the field around these low power pacer leads, and if you could just clarify whether this is a new lead system you\u2019re waiting on, which was our original understanding, or whether we should expect the pending approvals to relate to labeling on existing leads? It\u2019s a nuance that obviously could make a difference as we think about the ramp. And I have one follow-up. Miles White : Okay. Yes, our initial expectation will be a new lead, and I think that\u2019s a strong position for us, we like that. But we are also seeking approval on the existing lead so that we can provide that as well for existing patients, but I think going forward we like the notion of new lead and so we expect the initial approval here to be that. Matt Miksic : Great, and then the follow-up, Miles or Scott, if I could, on EPB. One of the things that we get often, questions we get often is just around the sustainability of this growth that you\u2019ve seen - impressive sort of high single, low double digit. It\u2019d be helpful if you could shed some light on maybe what we can--the drivers of that business, how we can think about sustainability, what potential future growth drivers could be to carry this into \u201918 or beyond would be very helpful. Scott Leinenweber : Yes Matt, this is Scott. You know, that business has been delivering at a high level here fairly consistently for years, quite frankly, since it\u2019s been reshaped. You know, the demographics in these markets are aligned with growth for the long term. The model that we operate, quite frankly, is quite unique. There\u2019s not another multinational company or a local company, quite frankly, that operates the model that we operate with the variety of shareholders, including the trade channel, which is a very powerful channel for us. So given the demographics and the model we operate and the strong brands that we have, we see this growth rate as highly sustainable over the long term. Matt Miksic : And that\u2019s through sort of--is it portfolio expansion of that product? Is it also geographic expansion on that sort of core model that you\u2019re describing? Miles White : You\u2019ve got several drivers of growth, Matt. It\u2019s first of all the call it growth or emergence of a middle class in a lot of emerging markets. Remember, this business is 100% focused in what characterize as emerging markets, and the middle class income growth and the growth of their healthcare systems alone is a major underlying growth driver. Most of these markets are not reimbursement-driven, they\u2019re consumer driven and have a model that is both a combination of call it medically driven through the physician or consumer driven through the patient and the pharmacist. So all the drivers of that growth and the distribution structure and so forth say this has got strong underlying growth. I\u2019d say it\u2019s target rich for geographic expansion in addition, and beyond that portfolio expansion, so a lot of our organic effort internally is driven toward expansion of key therapeutic areas, expansion of product, formulation innovation on product, and distribution management. In a lot of these countries where we are the leader, we\u2019re a leader with not that big a share, so you get all the benefits of being the leader on the shelf, the leader in distribution, the leader in breadth, et cetera, with a lot of potential expansion and share gain as well. So all of the various factors that would drive growth are pretty favorable in these geographies and product areas that we\u2019ve targeted. Matt Miksic : That\u2019s great, thank you. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, Operator, and thank you for all of your questions. That concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call.

It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian, and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1(a), Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that first quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjust the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange, as well as current and historical results for Abbott\u2019s Medical Optics business and St. Jude\u2019s vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude\u2019s historic sales related to administrative fees paid to group purchasing organizations in order to conform with Abbott\u2019s presentation. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay, thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.48 exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales increased 3% in the quarter, which is at the upper-end of our expectations. Our full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 remains unchanged and reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint. As you know, we completed several important strategic steps during the quarter to shape our company for sustainable long-term growth, including the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which establishes Abbott as a leader in the medical device arena. The combination with St. Jude positions Abbott with one of the strongest new product pipelines in the industry, including several recently launched products that are setting new treatment standards and contributing growth today. The combined portfolio has the depth, breadth and innovation to help patients restore their health and deliver greater value to customers and payors. In terms of the integration of St. Jude into Abbott, the team has made tremendous progress over the first few months of the year when we\u2019re on track to meet our objectives. The newly formed leadership team reflects a blend of Abbott and St. Jude leaders, and importantly, the team has remained focused on achieving its new product milestones, synergy targets, and financial objectives for the year. Additionally, last week, Abbott and Alere announced that the companies have agreed to amend the existing terms of our agreement to acquire Alere. Point-of-care testing remains an attractive growth segment within the in vitro diagnostics market and the acquisition of Alere will significantly expand our diagnostics presence and leadership in that space. I\u2019ll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Brian, and I\u2019ll start with diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of nearly 5% in the quarter in line with expectations. Growth in the quarter was led by continued above market performance in core laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics. During the quarter, we initiated the launch of our new Alinity systems in Europe with the ongoing roll out of four new instruments in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening and point-of-care. Later this year, we plan to launch two additional Alinity instruments in Europe in the areas of hematology and molecular diagnostics, which will be followed by the initial roll out of the Alinity suite of instruments in the U.S. during 2018. In nutrition, sales declined 1% in the quarter. As expected, challenging market conditions in China impacted the results of our international pediatric business. As we previously discussed, we expect these market challenges to persist throughout the year that continue to hold a favorable outlook on the Chinese and infant formula market on a longer-term basis. With the pending new regulations in China, we remain confident that our supply chain and product portfolio is well-positioned to meet evolving customer preferences and purchasing channels. In the U.S., we continue to achieve above market performance in pediatric nutrition with a portfolio of innovative product offerings for infants and toddlers and in adult nutrition where Abbott is the global leader, high single-digit international growth in the quarter was led by continued expansion of Abbott\u2019s market-leading brand Ensure across many international markets. In Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, sales growth of roughly 6% was led by double-digit growth in key emerging markets including above market growth in Latin America, China and several markets in Southeast Asia. Our continued focus on enhancing local capabilities and expanding our product portfolio within core therapeutic areas targeted specifically to address local market needs continues to strengthen Abbott\u2019s unique position in these markets. And in Medical Devices, which comprises our new cardiovascular and neuromodulation business, along with our diabetes care business, sales grew 4.5% in the quarter. Sales growth in cardiovascular and neuromodulation was led by double-digit growth in electrophysiology, structural heart and neuromodulation. In electrophysiology, we initiated the U.S. launch of our Ensite Precision cardiac mapping system, which provides physicians with improved automation and three-dimensional images to better treat irregular heartbeats. Growth in structural heart was led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the repair of mitral regurgitation. And in neuromodulation, growth was led by recently launched products including Burst for the treatment of chronic pain and deep brain stimulation for the treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. During the first part of the year, we also achieved several important new product milestones across the business including U.S. FDA approval for MRI compatible pacemaker, European launch of our Confirm Implantable Cardiac Monitor and submission of our MRI compatible ICD device for FDA review. In diabetes care, international sales growth of 29% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative sensor-based glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks. Now available in more than 30 countries outside the U.S., we continue to see strong demand as consumers, healthcare professionals and payors recognize the cost, comfort and convenience advantages Libre offers. So in summary, our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the year. The integration of St. Jude is going well and we\u2019re on track to achieve our projected synergy targets. And as we continue to execute on our key business priorities, we expect to deliver on our double-digit ongoing EPS growth target for the full year. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and our outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Okay, thanks Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on a comparable basis which is consistent with the guidance we provided back in January. Turning to our results, sales for the first quarter increased 3.2% on an operational basis. Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 0.6% on sales, resulting in reported sales growth of 2.6% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 8% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.5% of sales. The over delivery in the first quarter EPS compared to our guidance is primarily due to timing of spending and certain non-operating items. I\u2019d note that while exchange rates eased somewhat since our call in January, a follow-through impact on our first quarter results is fairly modest, taking into account our hedging program and the lag time that it takes for rate changes to work through our product costs. Before I review our financial outlook, I\u2019d note that our sales and adjusted EPS forecast do not include any contribution associated with the Alere acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2017 subject to certain closing conditions. We will provide an update regarding the expected financial impact of this transaction at a later date. So, turning to our outlook for the full year 2017, we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits and based on the current exchange rates, exchange would have a negative impact of around 1% on our full year reported sales. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 60% of sales for the full-year, which reflects the profitability mix of Abbott and St. Jude, as well as underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat about 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales, which includes expense synergies associated with the addition of St. Jude. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2017, we forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.59 to $0.61. We forecast operational sales growth in the low to mid-single digits and at current rates expect exchange would have a negative impact of around 1.5%. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 60% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 30.5% of sales. Finally, we project specified items of $0.55 in the second quarter, primarily reflecting intangible amortization and expenses associated with acquisitions. Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter comparable operational sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth. In nutrition, we now forecast low single-digit sales growth for both the second quarter and the full-year. In diagnostics, we forecast sales to increase mid-single digits. Turning to medical devices. In diabetes care, we forecast double-digit sales growth. And lastly, in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation business, we forecast relatively flat comparable sales growth in the second quarter, which includes a difficult comparison versus last year when sales were favorably impacted by the resolution of a third-party royalty agreement in our vascular business. Excluding this third-party royalty comparison, underlying sales growth in the second quarter would be low single digits. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mike Weinstein : Good morning, everybody. And Miles, I was hoping I could start with Alere. You didn\u2019t update on the potential financial impact of Alere. But I was hoping that you could talk about your view of the math on the company\u2019s earnings power today versus the time that you announced the transaction and how we should think about that assuming that we go forward to a deal closing here? Miles White : Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m prepared today to give you a lot of detail on that Mike. But I can say this, look, the company had some challenges, we all know that, and it\u2019s a bit of a fixer upper and we know that. I\u2019d say, we\u2019re pleased to have the resolution of this matter behind us. We want to go forward and close this deal. We want to close it in the next few months. It\u2019s going to be a little unpredictable, because they\u2019ve still got to file their 10-K and they need that in order to do a proxy statement to do a shareholder vote and so forth. So there\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s some steps to get through here before we can close. And we\u2019ve got to finish the divestiture of a couple of businesses that will have to divest because of the regulatory approvals and anti-trust approvals. And I know what I would say is, we\u2019re committed all of us to get all of that done in the next coming months here. So I\u2019m looking to close this hopefully, and I\u2019m \u2013 this is just a guesstimate by end of summer, allowing for enough time for, what Alere has got to do with the shareholders and so forth. But I\u2019d say, look, if it remains on strategy, we really like the space. We like this point-of-care space. We like the expansion to our diagnostics business. We like the businesses. We will divest a couple of pieces. When we first announced the signing of the deal, that wasn\u2019t clear and wasn\u2019t known. So and they had issues with a couple of pieces of businesses as we know. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that the same sales will be there. Obviously, the businesses that have had problems will either be gone or smaller. And the ones we divest won\u2019t be in the portfolio. So the amount of sales and profits that we add to our models will change. As far as earnings power and all that sort of stuff, I\u2019m just not prepared to give at this point. I\u2019d tell you that I think that the resolution of the matter between us is fair and it\u2019s behind us and we move forward. And beyond that, I think we\u2019re going to have to wait till, first of all, we\u2019re in possession of the company and obviously, it\u2019s going to take us a bit to get our hands around that. So I\u2019d say, we\u2019re not going to really be in a good position to give a lot of detail guidance until minimum fourth quarter and probably normal guidance time. And I know, you\u2019re going to all of our analysts and investors are going to want guidance before that at some level. And I think we\u2019ll be able to give it at some level within ranges. But I can\u2019t do much detail today. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Let me switch to St. Jude and that\u2019s what the question people have is relative to the Sylmar warning letter. So can you give your thoughts on how that warning letter impacts the business? Any guess at this point on how long you think it will take to resolve? And I assume that that means that the MRI compatible ICD approval timelines to push out. So given that, are you able to stabilize the business while you\u2019re waiting for the warning letter to lift and for those devices to get approved? Miles White : Well, I want to be careful not to make assumptions about things that the FDA gets to decide. I would say this. First, the warning letter clearly a disappointment, but not unanticipated. We\u2019ve been aware of the circumstances here for sometime and we\u2019ve been working with our St. Jude colleagues for sometime even before close on GMP matters at the site. So, we\u2019ve got a pretty good head start here on the issues and a fair amount of dialogue with the FDA about the issues. So having said that and being clearly disappointed in the outcome, I\u2019d say, the impact will depend a lot on our response, how thorough, how effective that response is. And I can tell you, we\u2019ve got an excellent team of people on that. We\u2019ve basically taken everybody that is exp0ert in the field in our company and then we have a lot of very good people in the area focused on and working on not only Sylmar, but we\u2019re doing a full valuation across all the sites and make sure that we understand everything here in detail. We\u2019ve got a very strong track record ourselves in GMP performance, et cetera, the FDA is aware of that. So I\u2019d say, the effectiveness of our response, the thoroughness and so forth will determine a lot of this. Now, in the mean time, how fast they will resolve? Can\u2019t really predict, but I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve got a pretty, pretty good sized head start on this. It\u2019s not like we received a letter and said, go. We\u2019ve had a pretty good visibility to all the issues and matters at the site starting last year. And so, I think we\u2019re well along here. And with regard to the timing of approvals and all the new products that we have under review with the FDA remain under review. We know that they\u2019re continuing to review those submissions. So that\u2019s a good thing. And so I don\u2019t think we can draw any conclusions from that that are negative or positive. I think that it\u2019s going to depend on the quality of our response here, and I\u2019m very, very confident in our team. So, at this point, I\u2019m not going to change our launch dates, our assumptions on approval dates and so forth, because I don\u2019t see a reason to do that yet, or a direction to do it in. And so I think right now, I\u2019m just going to leave it where it is. And we know that there\u2019s some uncertainty around that. We know that this will depend on our actions at the site and we\u2019ll see how that progresses and then I\u2019ll have a stronger position or point of view about that probably later this year. But right now, we\u2019re focused on what needs to be done in terms of corrective actions and improvements at our site, and that\u2019s where the focus ought to be. And then was \u2013 is that makes clear progress and shows clear effectiveness and all, I think it\u2019ll be time to try to figure out what impact is going to have on launch dates of new products. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Let me ask one last question, if I can, Miles. The discussion on the street right now really, I would put it in two buckets on. It\u2019s a question of okay, what is ultimately Abbott\u2019s earnings power post this deployment of capital in the acquisition of St. Jude and ultimately Alere here? And what does that look like? And okay, what is the ease for the company? And then the second discussion is really what I was hoping to have you comment on which is, okay, well, what do we pay for Abbott going forward? And the discussion essentially ends up centering around this question of well, is Abbott\u2019s mix of assets today post the acquisition of St. Jude and Alere and the change in the outlook for the Nutritions business as good as it was two to three years ago, and effectively what should we be paying for Abbott today? Can you give us just your own thoughts on that in terms of the overall quality of the portfolio today versus two to three years ago? Miles White : I think the quality of the portfolio today is clearly strong and improving better. I think that\u2019s an easy one, geez, did you tee that up on purpose? You know if I look back two to three years ago at \u2013 I\u2019ll just run through the portfolio. I love the nutrition business, yes, it has its ups and downs occasionally, but it is a strong solid grower, driven today obviously by emerging markets in a lot of cases, but it\u2019s been a great profit and cash flow generator, solid business et cetera, challenges occasionally in China notwithstanding. The pharma business, our branded generic business, I think is in a much stronger position than it was several years ago. We\u2019re focused on the markets where high double-digit growth exists, we\u2019re seeing it. We are seeing the execution of that strategy being, I\u2019d say, beautifully executed by our team. The only headwind we\u2019ve seen in that is exchange and you know when I can control exchange and predict it for you, you know we\u2019ll do even better. But I think the EPD business has been a true gem among branded generic pharma companies and it\u2019s proving it with its growth rates and its performance. You know we just keep expanding the product lines and expanding our footprint in countries and we keep growing at strong singe or low double-digits there, I\u2019d have nothing, but good things to say about that business. Diagnostics is in the process of launching the biggest range of new systems and new products that\u2019s ever been done in the entire space in history. I used to run the R&D in that business years ago and I know the challenges and the complexity of developing big mainframe systems for diagnostic laboratories and this team has just launched four of them into the market at the same time. These are new systems with full menus, and you know it will be a rolling rollout, but I think when you look at two more systems coming, six systems across the board, a complete redo of the entire product line, I think the strength of that to drive the growth of our diagnostics business, gosh, for the next decade is unprecedented, absolutely unprecedented. And designed not only for their size, their efficiency, their cost, I think there is nothing, but good there and nobody has done that, so I\u2019m extremely enthusiastic about that. And then Mike, you yourself have challenged us on the breadth of our medical device business for a number of years and I think that the addition of St. Jude here is powerful. I mean, arguably, we\u2019ve got the best stent in the world and it\u2019s challenging for everybody in this space to incrementally improve on the efficacy and quality of stents today. We have a lead position in the stent business and now we\u2019ve broadened that across six other major cardiovascular categories. And I look back at the last few years in the medical optics business, which you know frankly I think J&J has acquired at a particularly opportune time, because it\u2019s taking share in the intraocular lens space at a pretty nice clip, but they\u2019ve got leading technology and that business had its own struggles when we first acquired it. So, you know if I look at Alere and St. Jude or even parts of Abbott that need you know improvements or whatever, I think we\u2019ve got a very strong track record of improving performance in businesses that needs some improvements. And I look at KMO, I\u2019m \u2013 we\u2019re very proud of how AMO has performed over these last six years. And I think that was proven in the sale and value and so forth that J&J saw in it and I think they\u2019re very happy to have that business, we\u2019re very proud of it and we wish it well, because we\u2019re pretty happy with how low it did. So I look back three, four years and I think we\u2019re much stronger today and have a much more robust and strong portfolio across the board. You can say, well, now aren\u2019t there challenges to fixing the business? I think any large company with diverse set of businesses is always going to have some defects. We\u2019re always going to have something that\u2019s not up to our standards or that we want to improve on and then there\u2019s always going to be currency or something going on somewhere in the world. If you are in a 130 countries, there\u2019s always going to be somewhere and something. So, I look at it and I think, yeah, I\u2019m very pleased with how we\u2019ve done and I think that for the growth prospects going forward are stronger than they\u2019ve ever been. And to be honest, we start every year with a target of double-digit earnings growth. I mean, I \u2013 there have been, gosh, in the last 10 or 11 years, maybe two years that we\u2019re high single-digit, but otherwise we target double-digit earnings every year almost without exception and that\u2019s unusual in our space, and I think you know that. So at some point, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re the same company, but with a much better portfolio. And we live to the investment identity that we\u2019ve been and creative and that\u2019s our intent, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve made the moves we did with both St. Jude and Alere. And even though that we\u2019ve got to put sometime and investment into these businesses to help achieve the growth aspirations we have. We just look at the strength of the portfolios across the Board. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had rich new product portfolios coming like we see across these businesses today. So thanks for the question, that was kind of an easy one. Mike Weinstein : Thanks, Miles. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. Matthew Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. A couple of areas of the portfolio I wanted to ask about. The first was on diabetes, you had a really strong quarter. We actually saw some acceleration in that business outside the U.S. And I was hoping you could make some comments on, I guess, A, how FreeStyle Libre is doing? And what your expectations are for that in the U.S. you could give us an update there? Miles White : Yes, no problem. Look, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re pretty excited about FreeStyle Libre. It\u2019s doing very well, doing really well across Europe. As I mentioned, I think in my opening remarks, we\u2019re in about 30 countries now. The expansion within those countries is going well. I think we\u2019re at about 300,000 patients. I mean, you can compare that to a like competitor, and I think that stacks up really favorably. We\u2019re getting reimbursement across European countries, that\u2019s unprecedented. And even within Germany and other countries, the reimbursement is expanding, that\u2019s helping. In some cases, where it\u2019s patient pay, we\u2019re still growing very well, patients accepting it. So we\u2019ve got both great patient acceptance, great value proposition. And then as we said payors, governments, sick funds and so forth are all giving a lot of support to the product because of the not only what it does, but the value proposition represents relative to what patients can do today. And it makes a heck of the difference in the care and treatment of diabetic patients and their care for themselves. So, I think, we\u2019re pretty excited about this product and the pace at which it\u2019s growing and expanding nothing, but good. As far as the U.S. goes, still working with the FDA to get approval in the U.S. and submitted, waiting, excited anticipating, in patient. Matthew Taylor : Okay, great. Well, and then just on the St. Jude side of things, so there\u2019s a few areas that we\u2019re pretty strong. But you continue to have some negative growth in Rhythm Management and heart failure. I guess, my question is, can you stabilize that business before you get ICD approval? And what are the things that would help that? Maybe you could comment on the pacemaker launch and how that\u2019s going? Miles White : Well, pacemaker launch is going fine. We\u2019ve got about 75% of our accounts are contracted about 25% to go. And because it\u2019s a new product, new leads, there\u2019s a little bit training and re-contracting involved, because it\u2019s not the same old product. So, yes, I\u2019d say that roll out is going well. It\u2019s interesting you always wanted to be instantaneous and it takes a little time to roll it in. So I actually expect to see improving sequential quarters in terms of its growth, or decline. We\u2019re comparing to last year when it lost some share, while it waited for approval. So I expect to see that improve steadily through the year, obviously, it will be helped when a high voltage is approved. But, as I said earlier, I can\u2019t make predictions about that right now. We\u2019re hopeful that we will be able to resolve matters sufficiently, or show enough progress with the FDA that we can stay on track with that. But I can\u2019t predict that just yet, but I think that will make a difference as well. But I\u2019d say everything is going very well with low voltage. Matthew Taylor : Okay, great. And one last follow-up. I just wanted to clarify on the Alere timeline as a few steps here. Do you think that it\u2019s going to basically take kind of through the summer, what\u2019s the soonest ticket close and kind of what are the key uncertainties in that timeline around FTC? Miles White : Well, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to speak for Alere, because that\u2019s \u2013 right now they and their auditors working on their 10-K and so forth. I can tell you they\u2019re just as anxious to get finished as we are. So that aside, I think we just arbitrarily sort of say end of 3Q, or third quarter, but it\u2019s kind of an arbitrary date, you know do I think it\u2019ll take longer than that? No. And I would tell you that both companies will get there as soon as they can. You know we got a couple of pacing items, I mean obviously we got our divestitures to finish up, but they will not \u2013 I don\u2019t think be the long pole in the tent here, I think it\u2019ll be the shareholder vote, but I don\u2019t know that. I just think that we both got actions to finish up here in parallel and you know we\u2019re going to act as I think we practically can. Matthew Taylor : Okay. Alright, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel Nicolaus, your line is open. Rick Wise : Good morning, Miles. Miles White : Good morning. Rick Wise : Let me start with China, in China nutritionals, no surprise you know the issues you called out. Maybe help us \u2013 you know maybe talk us through some of the steps you are taking now to set the stage for a better 2018? How confident are you that 2018 will be better? Obviously you are going to have some easy comps, you know whether it\u2019s product or management or other initiatives, help us sort of frame the outlook as we look ahead there? Miles White : Yes, I\u2019m thinking how to characterize that because we\u2019re talking about one of the most dynamic markets of any market I\u2019ve ever seen in the world. Would you have new management? I like the management a lot, very impressed with the experience, the background, the understanding of the markets, the actions taken et cetera. I\u2019m pleased with the actions that we\u2019ve identified. We\u2019re not completely in control of what happens in China as you might guess, so you know we know that there\u2019s a lot of inventory in that market. We know there\u2019s a lot of channel shift happening in that market that takes time to play through. We believe we\u2019ve refocused on the appropriate channels, the digital channel in particular has exploded and sucked a lot of the activity and energy out of traditional modern trade channels and so forth and that\u2019s been a pretty big shift to us, because we have historically been heavy modern trade, but we have reacted to that, I think, now well. I wish we had been quicker, but we weren\u2019t, so I think that the team there is making all the right adjustments in terms of where we promote, how we promote, where we ship, how we ship, product benefits and value propositions. I mean literally across the board I think our nutrition business has put a lot of attention on adjusting to what is frankly a fascinatingly dynamic changing market. We still like the long-term prospects of China. We look at the growth rates and so forth and there is not any big underlying detriments to how strong that market has been, it\u2019s been \u2013 you know a lot more the reaction of competitors and all of us to pending regulation changes and what the government will allow in terms of number of SKUs competitors in the market and so forth, we\u2019re actually in a very strong position for that given the number of different plans we have, different products and so forth. But we\u2019re focused on only a few, very strong products and we\u2019re focused on the \u2013 let\u2019s say the differentiation that moms in China wants in their products. Some of them want European products, some of them want New Zealand products, some of them want American products, some of them want local product and we actually have that and all of that. So, I think it\u2019s an adjustment to a lot of channel, a lot of digital and a lot of product, and then on top of that a lot of government regulation and so in this particular case, there are so many competitors in China, a lot of them have pushed a lot of inventory into that market in anticipation of a lot of that and we have to see that play through. So, it\u2019s made this year hard to predict. You know we think we\u2019re in a good position thus far, I mean I hate to be superstitious, I\u2019ll knock on wood and say, right now China has not been a surprise or an issue for 2017, but I felt that way last year at about this time too. So, you know I want to see a lot more this year play out before I can predict how the year is going to finish or even how 2018 will be, but I think we feel pretty good about China for the long-term, but as the government transitions through these new regulations, I think that\u2019s going to be a little bumpy and it has been, otherwise I like the management team and the actions we\u2019re taking right now and that\u2019s about all I can tell you. Rick Wise : Okay. Turning to guidance, you obviously beat the first quarter, chose not to raise it full year, I think you talked about the timing of spending and some other issues. And when we look at the second quarter, you sort of basically framed current consensus, as I understand it, with your EPS guidance anyway. Help us understand a little more behind your thinking, is it simply caution as you look at the many moving pieces in terms of the outlook for the full-year and for second quarter, specifically, can you perhaps walk us through the bridge from first quarter to second quarter, $0.48 to $0.60 the puts and takes that that get us up to that kind of ramp in the second quarter? Miles White : Well, I may have to phone a friend for that last part. But let me address the first part. You\u2019ll recall, well, first of all, we set our targets for the year that healthy double digits. Now, we\u2019ve got St. Jude in the mix there, so there\u2019s extra healthy double digits. But even on top of just last year on a comparable basis, there\u2019s a double-digit earnings growth target here, which again, I would point out is not typical across our peer group, or competitors, et cetera, or even the companies that our investors compare us to many of which are not healthcare. And so we start the year with healthy double-digit target and guidance. And then the gating of that guidance over the quarters, as you may recall in the first quarter, that the issue was jeez, it looks back-end loaded. And our fourth quarter is always strong and our first quarter is always the low quarter of the year. And so you look at that and you say, okay, the investor tends to think that last quarter, gosh, it looks like such a big hill. So, we have a strong first quarter that tends to be the case. We tend to have lower guidance then and we tend to beat it each year, tend to be \u2013 tends to be a pattern. And then there\u2019s, I look at each year a little superstitiously. I guess, if you\u2019ve been around long enough, you get to see this. But every year exchange or something happens later in the year, where there\u2019s a change. There\u2019s a political change, there\u2019s an exchange, just a matter of some kind or whatever. So I\u2019m reluctant to adjust guidance in the first quarter for almost anything, and because I\u2019d like to see the year play out a little more first, because I don\u2019t like the whip around shareholders, particularly when we\u2019re all already, looking at a double-digit growth target, which is annual for us. And so I look at it and say, okay, we\u2019re off to a nice strong start. We have had a bit of favorable exchange. We do know there\u2019s some timing in there, and there\u2019s also some strength in there. And I\u2019d like to see that strength sustained and I\u2019d like to see the exchange sustain. I\u2019d like to see more than three months play out here. So in the meantime, my view would be, let\u2019s take some of the gaining off the back part of the year, or let\u2019s regain this a little bit more gently, call it, a little smoother, and let\u2019s wait to see another card played in the second quarter. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent at this early point in the year to make adjustments to earnings that are already double-digit targets until we see more cards played. I mean, that\u2019s that\u2019s basically my thought process right now. Rick Wise : Yes. Miles White : I mean, we can second-guess me all you want, but that\u2019s how I thought about it. Scott, do you want to, or Brian, Brian is going to help me with your second question on the quarter. Brian Yoor : Yes, the question gone up from Q1 to Q2 and then we talked a little bit about this on our first call. I mean, as Miles talked about China, while we anticipate pressures to be there through the year, we\u2019re expecting some relief as we move through the year, not a lot. But obviously, that comp becomes a little bit easier for us as we move through the year. That\u2019s one area of nutrition. One area, Rick, and we talked about this. We expected a lower branded generics sales in Q1 and that \u2013 some of that was around the anticipation around what they were going through a process known as demonetization. Established Pharma and also it was our last quarter of sales of Venezuela. It just so happened and we talked a little bit about that too. This is our last quarter. Established Pharma would have grown a 11% to 12% this quarter had we adjusted for that comparable on Venezuela. So we expect that to flow through in Q2. You also saw in diagnostics, whereas diagnostics came in the full range. They\u2019d be closer to 6.5% much for Venezuela. So we anticipate all these moves when we projected our Q2 earnings. And also I\u2019d note too, we expected a very modest contribution from St. Jude in Q1. You have the dilution from the shares, but it takes time to ramp the synergies. And so we move into Q2, you\u2019re going to start to see those synergies ramp in St. Jude as we move through the year, and that\u2019s really the bridge to take you from what you saw the $0.48 to $0.60. Rick Wise : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Glenn Novarro : Hey, good morning, guys. Miles White : Good morning. Glenn Novarro : I wonder if you can provide a little bit more detail on your CRM performance in the quarter. U.S. was down 18%. Can you break it down between Pacing and ICDs? I would imagine pacing did better, given that you have the MRIC for approval. And it seems like from the numbers, ICDs came in worse. So a little bit more clarity on CRM performance in the first quarter. Thanks. Scott Leinenweber : Sure, this is Scott. As Miles mentioned, we did make some progress there in the U.S. on the CRM side during the first quarter. We\u2019re off to a good start with the pacer, particularly as we exited the quarter and started to add more and more contracts, and we think we\u2019ll wrap up that process here in the second quarter and do better with the pacer throughout the year. So the pacer sales were down in the mid-single digits and then the remainder would have been obviously the performance of the defibrillation business. We did make some progress there as well. With respect to filing, we filed the ICD in March, and we expect to file the CRTD here in the second quarter. So we\u2019ve made progress in terms of approval milestones on that front as well. Glenn Novarro : Okay. And then I guess from Miles commentary, you\u2019re assuming pacers throughout the year get stronger, as it fully gets launched, as doctors get trained. So this is a business that will go from down 5 to flat to up throughout the year, is that a fair assumption? And I guess we should assume ICDs continue in this downward trend until MRIC gets approved, is that fair? Scott Leinenweber : Yes, I think you\u2019ve got it there. Definitely pacers will improve throughout the year. Glenn Novarro : Okay. Thank you. And then one quick follow-up for Miles on China. We talked about the challenges in 2017. Once we get through the regulations, as you go into 2018 and beyond, what\u2019s the new norm in terms of market growth for China? When Abbott and AbbVie split up. Miles, you talked about China being a double-digit growth market. So what\u2019s the new norm in 2018 and beyond for growth in China in nutritional? Thanks. Miles White : This is just a stab in the dark. But I would tell you, I\u2019d probably for right now forecasted it mid-single. I think we\u2019re going to have to see some \u2013 it\u2019s a big number. I mean, first of all China is a big market. So we\u2019re talking about growth on top of a big number. And so you got the lot of big numbers working against us there. But I\u2019d say mid single for now is a safe assumption and beyond that, I think, we\u2019re going to have to kind of see how it goes. Glenn Novarro : Okay, great. Thanks for \u2013 thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with capital allocation and then product-related question. So I think, Brian, when you announced the St. Jude deal a year ago, you talked about a goal of getting down to 3.5 times debt to EBITDA in 2018. Is that still a realistic goal, given the Alere deal now? And how should we think about your uses of cash priorities? One of the concerns investors have is that with the debt you have right now that \u2013 or post the Alere deal that you\u2019ll be constrained and you won\u2019t be able to do even small tuck-in deals to augment, let\u2019s say, the St. Jude business, or other business. So can you talk a little bit about that and I have one follow-up? Miles White : Yes, Larry, we see a path to the 3.5 for 2018 in closing Alere. I think something to keep in mind and remember is, we divested a couple businesses and we received full and fair value there. And so that gives us some optionality such that the debt we would take on under Alere is less than what you might have originally modeled in your deal model. So at Alere point in time, we\u2019ll come back and help you reconcile that. And as you know, we talked about this. Cash flow has been a focus for us. We projected very strong operating cash flow and free cash flow as a percent of net income for this year. And that remains on track, I\u2019d say, in the first quarter, let\u2019s wait till the Q comes up, but we may even be a little bit ahead here in terms of our efforts here to make improvements in our working capital process and also just further strengthen what was also a strong process around our capital expenditures. So we feel good about that. Our priorities go back to strategic flexibility and nothing changes about those commitments we made sometime ago. Larry Biegelsen : That\u2019s helpful. And then on the product side just two. One is on EPD, you touched upon the demonetization, which doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s had much of an impact based on your Q1 results. But how are you thinking about the impact of the goods and services tax in India later this year? And just lastly, on the heart failure results this quarter, which were a little week, I think that\u2019s primarily the Thoratec business, which has been strong in prior quarters. Can you talk about the outlook there and why it might have been weak this quarter and obviously you have HeartMate 3 coming in the U.S. later this year hopefully so that that should help. Thanks for taking the questions. Scott Leinenweber : Sure, thanks Larry, this is Scott. With respect to the monetization, yes, it did have a little bit of transitory choppiness on the overall economy quite frankly in India and we saw a modest impact on our results. That impact is diminishing and will continue to diminish we think going forward. With respect to the goods and services tax, as you know the government is looking at implementing a new tax scheme. They have been looking at this for quite sometime. The date has moved once previously. So we are certainly going to monitor that decision. At current time, the expectation is that they would implement on July 1. If they do that could have an impact potentially on the way distributors manage inventory before and after that implementation. So, we didn\u2019t make that into our guidance per se, because the timeline has been a little bit fluid here. But if we go through the quarter and that solidifies, we\u2019ll update you at the appropriate time. Miles White : I think it\u2019s important to stress though, it\u2019s hard to predict what the distributors will do to manage inventories and so forth based on this, but that they will at some level. And so we could see some less predictable numbers in the second \u2013 between the second and third quarter. If the timing, what Scott said, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to affect our overall business. And it\u2019s going to affect all players in the market, you know all manufacturers or all retailers et cetera. And at the end of the day, I think it\u2019ll stabilize, but we\u2019re just going to go through a lumpy start. And then I think it also depends on whether or not people recover this tax with price or other thing, so we\u2019ll just have to see. Scott Leinenweber : With respect to your question on LVADs or the heart failure bucket, you know as you know that that market can be a little bit choppy from time-to-time. There is some interplay between LVADs procedures and the heart transplant procedure, so we saw some of that. We did see as we exited the quarter growth rates start to improve and as you mentioned, we do expect to see acceleration in the second-half of the year when we bring HeartMate 3 to U.S. here. So we\u2019re well positioned in that market, we have the market leading product. We are \u2013 although albeit on a smaller base, we are continuing to see some nice strong growth on CardioMEMS as well. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to start, just a follow-up on your comments Miles on the FDA warning letter. Can you just refresh us on whether or not there are any non-CRM products that come out of the Sylmar facility. And then also you mentioned that the warning letter wasn\u2019t completely unanticipated. How are you feeling about some of the other St. Jude facilities and just I think if you could comment specifically on the neuromodulation facility in Plano where there was a historic tribulations with an FDA warning letter? Miles White : Okay while I don\u2019t have any comments about Plano, I mean I don\u2019t have any update for you there. I would say any time you get a warning letter or even observations, 43 observations on GMP at any facility or any plants, it behooves us to go back and look not only at that plant, but all of our plants across the board. So that the corrective actions we take whatever they may be are consistent and our systems and processes are consistent across all facilities. So any time you get an observation like this or any observation at a single facility, our practice is to go back and look at all facilities. And I\u2019m comfortable that we\u2019re not sitting here at risking our other facilities, but that said we always go back proactively and preemptively and look at every facility to make sure that whatever we\u2019re correcting in one is something that we\u2019ve looked at checked out, assessed, evaluated whatever you want to call it in all of them. So that\u2019s standard practice. And frankly I think that\u2019s one of the reasons we have the track record we have in GMP in our facilities and the reputation we have with the FDA, so I think that\u2019s a good thing. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not sitting here with a lot of nervousness about other facilities. We\u2019ve had a chance to look at all of St. Jude\u2019s facilities. We had a chance to assess that. Right now I don\u2019t see an indication of something like this elsewhere. So, but that said, we\u2019re all over everything in this \u2013 with this warning letter everywhere. I can\u2019t remember what I missed in the question, because it was a long question. Scott Leinenweber : Yes, I would say \u2013 yes, I would say with respect to the products, the most significant products there are the defibrillator and the CRM products. There are others that are smaller that go through generally a 510(k) process, but the biggest ones are the defibs that you pointed out. Josh Jennings : Understood, I was hoping just to ask a follow-up question on just the CardioMEMS product line. Are there any updates on interactions with the CMS and the path to national coverage termination. And just your outlook on that asset, it had been one of the growth drivers I believe when the deal was announced last year and any update would be fantastic. Thanks for taking the questions. Scott Leinenweber : Yes. Our longer term perspective on CardioMEMS is unchanged and we\u2019ve said that since we announced the St. Jude acquisition, quite frankly that we think that there is a lot of long-term potential here. Near-term, we\u2019ve pointed to the fact that there\u2019s more work to be done. We have had interactions with the respective bodies with respect to CardioMEMS and what it will take to get into a better position from a reimbursement standpoint and those are ongoing, I don\u2019t want to get into too many specifics. But with what we have today, the product is growing nicely, growing 20%, above 20% quite frankly, albeit again on a smaller base. So we are making progress with it. The real world results that we\u2019re seeing, physicians are seeing with it, are strong. Probably better than expected in terms of what most physicians give us feedback on. So, we\u2019re happy with the way the product is performing. We think there\u2019s great long-term potential and we\u2019ll work through the process here and generate the data we need in the near term. Miles White : Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Lewis : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in, I\u2019ll be quick. Brian, just a quick follow-up on Alere and two fast ones. So, is it safe to assume as it relates to Alere, I know you\u2019re not giving a specific accretion. The way to think about it is, we probably have some less synergies based on operating performance and some of the divestitures, but you\u2019ve got a lot more financing flexibility that helps to make up the difference, is that a decent paraphrase of what we\u2019ll see? Brian Yoor : It\u2019s a decent paraphrase over the coming year, you know once we bring this business under us I\u2019ll compare the assessment, David. David Lewis : Okay thank you, and two quick ones. The first is, Miles, maybe for you, you talked a lot about India and some on China. I wonder just for this new two invoice policy in China as it relates to your EPD business and device franchise. Any disruption we should be thinking about this year? Any changes to distributors regarding the two invoice policy? And then if there\u2019s any update on the PHP product within heart failure that would be great. Thanks so much. Scott Leinenweber : Yes, this is Scott. Within China we don\u2019t see any disruption, in fact our EPD business continues to perform extremely well in China as does our diagnostics business double-digit growth on both fronts. So we expect strong growth going forward there as well. With respect to the PHP, we did temporarily pause the trial and commercial implants. We continue to investigate that and we\u2019ll give an update at the appropriate time, a very modest financial impact though it\u2019s a small product. David Lewis : Thank you. Scott Leinenweber : Okay, well good. Well, thank you operator and thank you for all of your questions and that concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11 AM Central Time today on Abbott\u2019s Investor Relations website at abotinvestor.com and after 11 AM Central Time via telephone at 404-537-3406, pass code 86879273. The audio replay will be available until 4 PM Central Time on Wednesday May 3. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone has a wonderful day.",

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian, and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjust the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange, as well as current year and historical results for Abbott\u2019s Medical Optics and St. Jude\u2019s vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude\u2019s historical sales related to administrative fees paid to group purchasing organizations in order to conform with Abbott\u2019s presentation. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.62 which exceeds our previous guidance range and reflects double-digit growth. Sales increased 3% on a comparable basis in the quarter and we continue to expect accelerated sales growth in the second half of the year. We started the year targeting double-digit EPS growth and we\u2019re adding to it today by raising midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.45 to $2.48, which represents 13% growth over last year. Halfway through the year, we\u2019re on track with all of our key priorities. The integration of St. Jude continues to go well and we\u2019re right on track with our deal model and projected synergy targets. We\u2019re also right on track in terms of our new product launch expectations, which includes bringing our MRI compatible rhythm management devices to the U.S. During the first half of the year, we received FDA approval for our MRI compatible pacemaker and we completed regulatory submissions for our MRI compatible defibrillator devices including submission of our CRT-D device in June. We\u2019ve also seen significant growth contributions from several recently launched products across our portfolio, which I\u2019ll highlight, as I summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Brian. I\u2019ll start with diagnostics where we achieved sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter. Growth was led by strong performance in core laboratory and point of cure diagnostics. This business, which is already a global leading and growing faster than its market, is in the early innings of significantly enhancing its competitive position with the launch of Alinity, a highly differentiated and innovative suite of new systems across all areas where we compete. During the quarter, we achieved CE Mark approval for Alinity hq, our new hematology system which quantifies different types of blood cells to help diagnose blood-related diseases. This represents the fifth new Alinity system we\u2019ve launched in Europe since November of last year and will continue this launch cadence next year by bringing these systems into the U.S. market. In nutrition, sales grew modestly in the quarter. Internationally, as you know, market conditions are expected to remain challenging in China over the near-term in advance of pending regulatory changes in that country. Outside of China, we\u2019ve seen some softening in our few international markets. While volume continues to grow at levels consistent with historical trends, pricing power which has previously contributed to overall market growth has moderated. As a result, we lowered our full year nutrition growth guidance earlier this year and we now expect the global nutrition market to grow in the low to mid single digits over the longer term, which is still a healthy growth rate for a market this size. We remain focused on outperforming the market with our well-balanced portfolio of leading brands which we\u2019re achieving in U.S. pediatric nutrition where sales grew 8% in the quarter as we continue to capture share with recently launched infant formula products as well as our strong growth of our nutrition toddler brand. In established pharmaceuticals or EPD, growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in China, Russia and several markets in Latin America including Brazil. During the quarter, sales were impacted by channel dynamics associated with the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax system in India. Excluding this impact, EPD sales would have grown high single digits overall, in line with our previous guidance. This business is fulfilling the vision we had when we created it. There is no other business like it in the world. We\u2019re in the right countries, in the right therapeutic areas, and our unique model is driving consistent above market performance in the fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world. In the medical devices, sales growth was led by continued double-digit growth in electrophysiology, neuromodulation and diabetes care as well as high single-digit growth in structural heart. In neuromodulation, sales growth of nearly 50% further strengthened our leadership position in a fast-growing market for treating chronic pain from spinal stimulation. Our strong growth in this market has been led by recently launched products that offer improved pain relief and fewer side effects. In structural heart, sales were led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market- leading device for the minimally invasive repair of mitral regurgitation. In June, we completed patient enrollment in our trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MitraClip in patients with functional mitral regurgitation. We expect the final results from this trial around this time next year, which could result in a significant expansion of U.S. market opportunity for MitraClip. In electrophysiology, which achieved another quarter of double-digit growth, we continue to anticipate U.S. approval of our Confirm Insertable Cardiac Monitor during the second half of the year. And at heart failure, we continue to anticipate U.S. approval of HeartMate 3 later this year. I\u2019ll wrap on medical devices with diabetes care where international sales growth of 25% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks. During the quarter, Libre achieved regulatory approval in Canada and we continue to achieve national reimbursement status in a number of counties, most recently France and Switzerland. Today roughly half of our Libre sales come from patients with full or partial reimbursement. And just last week, we announced an agreement with Bigfoot Biomedical to develop and commercialize diabetes management systems. This collaboration will help bring these best-in-class technology to more patients with the goal of transforming the way diabetes is managed. So, in summary, we\u2019re on track with all of our key priorities, including growth contributions from recently launched products and achievement of important regulatory milestones across our pipeline. The integration of St. Jude continues to go very well, and we\u2019re on track to achieve our projected synergy targets. And we\u2019re raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range which continues to reflect double-digit growth. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and our outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Okay. Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable basis, which is consistent with the guidance we previously provided. Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 2.9% on an operational basis. Excluding the transitory impact of the new goods and service tax system implementation in India which lowered our sales in our established pharmaceuticals, total operations sales would have grown 3.7% in the quarter, which is in line with previous guidance. Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on total sales, resulting in reported sales growth of 2% in the quarter. As you know, exchange headwinds have eased somewhat since the beginning of the year. I\u2019d note that the majority of the lower foreign exchange impact on our sales has been driven by strengthening of the euro and other developed market currencies. And when these particular currencies move, the follow-through impact on our result is relatively modest, taking into account our European cost base and our hedging programs. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.8% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 30% of sales. Before I review our financial outlook, I\u2019d note that our sales and adjusted earnings per share forecast do not include any contribution associated with the Alere acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2017, subject to certain closing conditions. As previously communicated, we will provide an update regarding expected financial impact of this transaction at a later date. So, turning to our outlook for the full year 2017, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.43 to $2.53. We continue to forecast full year 2017 operational sales growth in the mid single digits. And based on current rates, exchange would have a negative impact of around 0.5% on our full year reported sales, which is modestly lower than the negative exchange impact of around 1% back at April rates. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat about 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7.5% and SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2017. We forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.64 to $0.66. We forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits and at current rates expect exchange would have a negative year-over-year impact of around 0.5%. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense around 29% of sales. Finally, we project specified items of $0.35 in the third quarter, primarily reflecting intangible amortization and expenses associated with St. Jude acquisition. Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter comparable operational sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast high double-digit sales growth. In nutrition, we forecast low single-digit sales growth. In diagnostics, we forecast sales to increase mid to high single digits. And finally, in medical devices, for cardiovascular and neuromodulation, we forecast sales to increase double-digits across our combined high growth areas of electrophysiology, structural heart, heart failure and neuromodulation which will be partially offset by sales in our foundational areas of rhythm management and vascular, which we forecast in combination to be down low to mid single digits in the third quarter. And in diabetes care, we forecast double-digit sales growth. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Mike Weinstein : Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe a couple of quick ones to start with. So, first, the FX delta since the start of the year, Brian, what does that mean to EPS? I know you moved your guidance since. Is that the full impact of the EPS swing from FX or is there a greater impact or are you giving yourself more push? And then, second, Miles, could you just spend a minute on the adult nutritional business? We focused so much time on pediatric at the U.S. adult business, has been disappointing so far this year. Probably you could spend a few minutes talking about why that is and kind of what drives the turn around. Miles White : Okay. Brian, do you want to talk FX first and then\u2026 Brian Yoor : Yes. Mike, I would say that 3 -- and we acknowledged in the first half, maybe $0.02 or $0.03. And could it be a little more? Yes, if rates continue to hold. It depends on the mix of currencies. But right now, we\u2019re not factoring that in because that\u2019s getting down to a level of precision that for a penny or two, we\u2019re just not ready to project that yet, as we don\u2019t want to necessarily forecast the mix of currency changes the rest of the year. Miles White : Okay. Then, U.S. adult nutrition, I agree with you, Mike. We\u2019re disappointed too. And I would say, what we\u2019re seeing -- first of all, I commented in my remarks that we\u2019re seeing softening markets worldwide here, at least in a lot of markets. And as I\u2019ve looked at a lot of the data, first, the volume rates are all still there; it\u2019s mostly loss of pricing power in some of these markets. And we see the same phenomenon in both ped and adult nutrition. In the U.S., it\u2019s a little different version than other markets. In the U.S., we\u2019re seeing a fair amount of intensity around private label competition. And every few years, this will happen. We got a competitor in U.S. in Nestle that is also feeling the same pinch, as we look at our market data. We know that the competition right now is private label and there is contingence and the way private label is being marketed I guess on the shelf and so forth in terms of its positioning, proximity to our brands and so on. So, we\u2019re seeing some of the impact of that. It\u2019s something we\u2019re addressing. Every few years, we see private label crank up and then it subsides again. Right now, we\u2019re having one of those years when we see a lot of intense pressure on that particular segment, and that\u2019s taken some of the growth off that. Last year and year before, both we and Nestle invested in the category. And when any of us invest in the category, all of us benefit. As soon as that larger investment sort of subsided, the private label cranked up and went right back at it. So, it\u2019s kind of an ebb and flow thing, but it\u2019s definitely taking an edge off the growth that we\u2019ve seen historically. We\u2019re aware of it, we know it, we\u2019re taken the actions we think we can and should to mitigate and deal with it, try and correct it and so forth. But that\u2019s what the intensity that\u2019s coming from. Mike Weinstein : Okay. And then just one quickly follow on Libre. You didn\u2019t give us much of an update on the U.S. I know inter quarter miles and we\u2019ve talked about this; you started a couple of trials to confirm the accuracy of Libre to the FDA. Does that mean that approval is likely more like yearend or early next year? And do you have any sense of whether the FDA has gotten comfortable with the idea of a factory calibrated device? Miles White : Well, there\u2019s been a lot of conversation back and forth with the FDA. We\u2019ve explained to the FDA how our factory calibration is done. And I think that conversation has gone well. I never want to predict the FDA. I think we have what we consider to be a fairly proprietary process for this factory calibration. So, it\u2019s not something we are anxious to share widely. And it\u2019s unique. So, I guess I\u2019m not surprised that it needed further discussion. But I think that\u2019s gone well. I don\u2019t know that I can predict at all, Mike, when the FDA will come to a conclusion of its process. It was submitted almost a year ago. So, we are coming up on a date here, an annualized date. But, I don\u2019t have any evidence that says, gee! It\u2019s going to be a year end or longer. So, I don\u2019t know that I could -- I certainly wouldn\u2019t say that because that may not be true. So, I don\u2019t have that common indication. And I would say look, there is good, active, ongoing dialogue back and forth. That\u2019s always a good sign. It\u2019s the right kind of dialogue. I just wouldn\u2019t forecast it. I don\u2019t know. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Taylor from Barcalays. Your line is open. Matthew Taylor : The first thing I wanted to explore was you mentioned in your opening remarks, thinking about your MRI safe device approvals in the U.S. is being on track. And I was hoping you could talk about, not the submission but what\u2019s going on with Sylmar, any progress you have made there and confidence that you can get timely approvals, just given what we have seen with the warning letter? Miles White : Yes. No problem. Thanks for the question, Matt. First of all, with regard to Sylmar, we are making good progress. And I don\u2019t mean that just in a generalization. We had a very detailed plan that we shared with the FDA of course after we received the warning letter. The good news is, as I mentioned in previous call, we have been in Sylmar with the St. Jude management since August of last year. And St. Jude was very open to us and allowed our quality operations, GMP people and so forth in to participate with them. So, we have been working with them on a lot of issues, questions, processes and so forth in Sylmar for a year now. And that is a huge positive because it gave us a real running head start on things the FDA observed when did it inspection early in the year. So that gave us a big lead. So, we have the ability to put before the FDA a very comprehensive plan of corrective actions, remediations et cetera at the site. And that plan is nearly complete. So, we are coming up on -- we will put all the things in place, change processes and so forth that we needed to change. That\u2019s all positive. We will be updating the FDA on that in the coming weeks. I won\u2019t give you a specific date, because I don\u2019t want to create a trigger here. But I would say, look at this point, we are absolutely on schedule with our own pace. And it was seem as if we did it rapidly. The fact is, it will be about a year and all by the time we are done here. But relative to the timing of the warning letter itself, it was seem like a rapid turnaround but there was quite a lot of work before that inspection that took place. So, we are getting through the completion of that comprehensive plan we put in front of the FDA and we\u2019ll have dialogue with them. I\u2019m very optimistic about what we\u2019re doing with Sylmar. I\u2019m very happy with the progress of our theme there. So, I feel good about that. And as I said in the last call, I have no reason to change in a meaningful way, the expectations around the couple of key product licensors of products that come out of that facility. And I know that there is a fair amount of question about, well will they be impacted or not. I think I\u2019d have to say look, they might be impacted by couple of months. But in a meaningful way, I don\u2019t think so. So, I\u2019m not willing to change those launch dates for the purposes of projecting or modeling or anything yet, because to be honest, we don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve not had a conversation with the FDA, specifically about that. I know that the review side in medical devices has continued to review all of our products; they\u2019re licensor on the same pace anyway. And I know what that pace is and I know where the standing of those products it, and it\u2019s all very good. So at the end of the day, the agency\u2019s reaction to the remediation actions and so forth will obviously influence it. It clearly has the ability to license those products, if it chooses to. And we will wait and see. Matthew Taylor : Thanks for the feedback on that. So, one other area I wanted to ask you about that has been very active is in diagnostics for the Alinity launches outside of the U.S. I guess the core of my question is I was wondering when you think we might start to see a pickup O-U.S. growth from those launches. I know it\u2019s kind of a slow battleship that\u2019s turning here through your install base. So, when could we actually see some pickup, and how much might that be? Miles White : Well, let me just correct one thing that you might have inadvertently said. You said when do we see the growth in the U.S.? U.S. won\u2019t start launching until next year but they\u2019ve been in effect and licensed and launched in Europe. So, let me respond to Europe. And frankly, the question you\u2019re asking is the same one I keep prodding our management with. And I do that just to keep the feet to the fire. But, the launch itself is going well. And customer response has been very positive. We\u2019re taking what I would call a fairly systematic and careful and methodical approach. Because when you launch new systems, you don\u2019t want your customer to have to debug something in the field. You want it to go to the field day one. And the history of launches of instruments in diagnostics in general as an industry has not been that. As you may know, I used to run that business years ago before I was the CEO of the Company and was responsible for R&D at point When we launch systems, you get so much data, so much use early on from your -- clinicals but you tend to find all the little bugs you missed in development. So, when we launch products or systems in diagnostics, you\u2019ve got a big installation or big changeover from their current systems and so forth. So, it does take time. And because of those early installations are where you do a little bit of your learning, you want it to go well. So, I would say I give them that slack early on in the launch in terms of early, slow, methodical, careful whatever and yet there has actually been really good order activity, really good uptake. We\u2019re on track I would say with numbers of closed accounts, instruments placements et cetera, we\u2019re getting some pretty nice sites closes; we\u2019re getting some pretty I\u2019d say great reference accounts in all of this. So, while it starts a little slow, I think we will see that order rate pick up. We will see it in Europe, we will begin -- in 2018, we will see clearly some impact there. A lot of our early installations will have heavy cannibalization of existing systems and existing volume, but we are getting new accounts as well. And I like the mix of what I\u2019m seeing, both in experienced Abbott customers and those who have the competitive take away and so on. So, I think the launch is going well. I think it is going to be hard to see for a little bit here, at least in 2017. We are trying to figure out how we show you, investors, the success of that launch and how it\u2019s going, without giving away a lot of competitive information to our competitors and so forth. That\u2019s a little bit of an issue or least a challenge, communication wise. But I would say that launch is going really well. And I\u2019m pleased with that. It\u2019s one of those things we are -- it\u2019s kind of a slow motion launch. It\u2019s not an instantaneous kaboom, but it\u2019s a rolling launch where you are going to see rolling impact that picks up more and more momentum over the next couple of years, and you will see that. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open. Rick Wise : Let me start with a Alere, which seems to be marching toward completion here. A couple of things. We saw an asset sale announced. Is that it? Is there more to come? And maybe, I know it\u2019s early and I know you would like to be conservative. But, can you just help frame in those general sense, is it fair to assume that Alere is neutral this year to EPS? How do we think about it just directionally, broadly in 2018? Is it neutral, is it accretive, is it dilutive? Any color would be really helpful? Thank you. Miles White : I assumed somebody would ask that. Well, couple of things. First of all, there is one more asset sale that has not been made public. It was one that was required by the regulatory bodies for antitrust proposes and so forth. And we\u2019ve got a good buyer, good price et cetera. The other party just hasn\u2019t said anything publicly. So, we don\u2019t want to say if they haven\u2019t said it. But yes, there is one more and it\u2019s modest in size. But, it\u2019s on track. I don\u2019t see any hiccups with it or anything. It just hasn\u2019t been made public. And I expect that that will be soon. And that\u2019s progressing really well. I would say, we are very happy with the status of divestitures for antitrust purposes, where that stands. We are happy with the buyers; we are happy with price; we are happy with transition, plans and so forth. That\u2019s all good. We are in fact, I would say, racing toward close. I\u2019m anxious to get it finished and I\u2019m quite confident that it will. At this point, I would love to have one of those surprises you didn\u2019t expect where all of a sudden regulatory bodies approved it and you weren\u2019t ready but we are ready. And we have named our transition team internally here at Abbott and how we are going to manage it, how we are going to integrate it and so forth. Those plans are all very well underway. And so, we are prepared for that and ready to go. With regard to this year, I had indicated and I would continue to indicate, neutral. I wouldn\u2019t plan for any accretion. I think because this particular deal has gone on so long, I am reluctant to make projections about accretion. As we are into the second half of the year and if the deal doesn\u2019t close until September as is currently projected, that gives us all of about three months with the business in our hands. And so, at that point, I think look, -- I don\u2019t know that I could project any accretion. I would like to get the business on the path to integration as rapidly as possible in anticipation of rolling into 2018. And so what I\u2019m communicating and the guys are communicating here is assume it\u2019s neutral, assume there is no accretion in 2017 and the question then rolls to 2018. And originally, I think we estimated, this is probably well more than a year ago now when we first announced the acquisition of Alere. We had estimated I think it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.11 to $0.13, something like that of accretion for the first full year. At this point, I have no reason to change that however and no negatives that I would tell you cause we pause. And I don\u2019t intent to be conservative for cuteness or sandbagging or anything else. But I would say, I want the get the business in our hands and evaluate that more directly than we\u2019ve been able to over the last year and a half. So, before I reconfirm with any precision or any estimate, accretion for 2018, I want to have few months of the business in our hands, so we can reconfirm for ourselves while managing the business, synergies, sales rates, all that sort of stuff. Because when we gave that first estimate of accretion, we had not taken into account the divestiture of the Triage business or the pieces we had to divest for antitrust. And they had not at that point lost the Arriva business with CMS in U.S. So, I would like see, during the first few months when we have this business, what we\u2019ve really got, before I give any kind of accretion estimate for 2018. I do expect that it will be accretive, I just don\u2019t know exactly where. I don\u2019t mean that to be an indication of, gee! It\u2019s likely to be less or whatever. I\u2019m not even prepared to say that. I\u2019d just like to be able to evaluate it in our hands because we\u2019re well beyond deal model in terms of timeframe for close here. So, I think we\u2019ve got to have it in our hands, so we can make those estimates more directly. With regard to Arriva, we\u2019re looking at whether or not we can restore that and at what level restore that standing with CMS that makes a difference in our estimates. There is a number of things that would make a difference in how we evaluate the ongoing performance of the business and the timing of that. So, we got a few moving parts on Alere before I can be -- even give you a range of accretion but I would tell you that I expect it to be accretive. And at this point I\u2019m not prepared to change what we already put out there as an estimate little over a year ago. Rick Wise : That\u2019s really helpful. And just on a separate topic. One of the compelling aspects of combining St. Jude and Abbott on the device side, it does seem to be -- obviously be the compellingly broad portfolio. Can you talk, Miles, a little bit about the progress you\u2019ve made on the contracting side, dealing with large hospitals, large integrated delivery networks, GPOs et cetera, presenting the whole bundle, just progress you\u2019ve made broadly since post merger? And do you see that contributing to growth in 2017 and 2018 that aspect of the story? Thank you very much. Miles White : Yes. Thank you. I\u2019d say, since we announced the acquisition a year ago, St. Jude had already started to make changes in the way it approached large national account type organizations in United States. And we with them took that further. There were some promotions, management hires, new changes, new changes in the way we went to market at St. Jude; we contemplated the, call it the full offering across our product lines. And I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve made terrific progress internal in our approach to St. Jude. We have had some success. We\u2019ve had a lot of positive reaction from customers, in general, positive reaction to Abbott, positive reaction to the breath of product line, positive reaction to St. Jude\u2019s pipeline and the products that are coming. So I would say all in all, I think all that\u2019s been really good. I also would stress, a lot of times when people refer to bundling with large national accounts, hospital groups and so forth, there is a presumption of one product line subsidizes another and there is leverage in that. And while that\u2019s true and can be true, there is also a greater positive synergy of the full offering, the full service level, and the service and account gets across product lines. And as you know, these large integrated health groups, they don\u2019t want to deal necessarily with five or six suppliers in a given area; they generally deal with two or three. And we are finding that in the mix, in the breadth of our portfolio, one of the places it really benefits us and St. Jude is that it\u2019s very easy for us to be one of the two. And it\u2019s a lot easier when you got the broad product line, when you got innovation with those product lines, when you got a good compelling medical and value proposition. And it\u2019s not always about just subsidizing. And so, I find that with the mix, and this is one of the strategic reasons we wanted this acquisition, I find that the breadth of that product line, the innovation across the product line, the depth of products, that full offering makes us extremely competitive, and I think both from a medical and the value proposition standpoint. So we definitely see that. I think we will see that increasingly over the course of 2017, 2018 and beyond. I think if you just look at the dynamics in the medical device business at large, the consolidation that\u2019s taken place across a lot of product lines has been well-documented and talked about for several years. I think this puts us in a really strong position in the field now. As we look at our product line, of course we and other competitors think there are holes. Well, we need this product, or we need that product, but I would say small holes but all of us one way or another are always looking to fill either through our own R&D here or other M&A activity. But I feel like we are very, very competitive in all regards now. And that\u2019s a good positive. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Glenn Novarro : My first question is on the cardio and neuromodulation line. It came in better than expected, and I have got to believe that\u2019s function of St. Jude. So, Miles, can you comment on how St. Jude performed in the quarter? What was the growth rate that the St. Jude business in total deliberated in the second quarter? Thanks. Miles White : Yes. St. Jude, if we carve them out standalone, was up by 4%. And if you recall, before we acquired St. Jude, its prior -- or before we announced the deal, its prior four years have been flat. And we discussed how we thought over that period of time. They\u2019d made great investments in their product pipeline across their businesses, their internal organic R&D I thought had been very productive and very successful, so had they. And it was a point of quite a bit of, let\u2019s call it, negotiation during the deal process. They had rather robust forecast for their sales going forward. And of course that ultimately is part of a whole negotiation. I would say this, their representation about their pipeline I thought was valid and proves to be. And as I have said before, both in the calls we\u2019ve made about the deal itself or in our quarterly earnings calls, our forecast or our deal model was built on the expectation of sequential improvement in their sales going forward due to first of all, correcting the MRI compatible issue, which is well-underway; and then the launch of a lot of new products, and we\u2019re seeing that. And then frankly, in our own deal model, we had pretty much aligned it with what analysts collectively viewed as how St. Jude would look going forward. And so far, the expansion of the growth rate and its sequential performance quarter to quarter has been on our deal model and is steadily growing. And we estimated in our deal model, they get up to 4.5%, 5%, something like that and this quarter they were at 4%. And each quarter is successively better than the last. We\u2019re seeing improvement in CRM and we\u2019re seeing share recovery with the low voltage pacemaker. As I mentioned, I guess it was at the end of the first quarter, St. Jude, we estimated lost about, I think it was 7 points of share in the low voltage pacemaker business last year between April and December and in the first two months or three months here of launch with the MRI compatible claim, they\u2019ve regained 4 of those share points already. So, we\u2019re seeing quarter to quarter sequential improvement in share in CRM; you can see it in the growth rate comps; it\u2019s getting better and better and quarter to quarter. We expect that to continue. New products launches are occurring according to expectation. I think the whole thing is remarkably going according to our deal model, according to our forecast and according to what we told analysts. And right now, I think the quarter of 4% out of St. Jude is pretty good thing. Glenn Novarro : Yes, I agree. And then, just I don\u2019t know if you or Brian have these numbers, but just as a follow-up, would you be able to give us your U.S. and worldwide pacing growth and U.S. and worldwide ICD and CRT growth? Thanks. Miles White : I don\u2019t think I can do that right this minute. You prepare a lot of things for these calls. That\u2019s one I don\u2019t have at my fingertips. We can probably follow up with you Glenn. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Larry Biegelsen : I wanted to ask one about how to think about Q3 given some of the onetime items in Q2. And then I have product related question. So, I think it was 2.9% growth in Q2 on a comparable pro forma basis, but I think you had an 80 basis-point hit from headwind from EPD, and I think you had about a 50 basis-point hit in vascular from the royalty. So, is the starting point really about 4.2%, 2.9 plus 1.3 and we get back the 80 bibs or about the $50 million loss in EPD from the general services tax in Q3? And I had one follow-up. Miles White : Yes. I would say a couple of things. First of all, what you describe there, the ins and outs going into the third quarter, you\u2019re right, and that\u2019s a good assessment. And your assessment of, I think it was a little bit better than 4%; I think that\u2019s a good assessment too. With regard to EPD, this Goods and Services Tax in India, as you -- I think others have already noted, clearly impacted the second quarter. I think it\u2019s been hard for everybody to forecast how it\u2019s going to come back in the third quarter. In the first couple of days of the quarter, we saw a clear response to restocking by distributors, and then it softened for a couple of days, and then it came back again for a couple of days. So, we are seeing it restore. Whether we will see it completely restore in the quarter, I don\u2019t know, but so far so good. It\u2019s going according to what we projected. So, whether it will come back like full dollar per dollar, I don\u2019t know, but so far it looks that way. And I would say so far projections look good that way to truly be a quarter-to-quarter shift. And that\u2019s kind of the experience we are seeing thus far. Larry Biegelsen : And then, Miles, XIENCE has been an amazing product, but given the issues with Absorb, do you feel -- what is the pipeline, the long-term strategy there? Do you feel you need a drug eluting stent with the bioabsorbable polymer, similar to Boston Scientific SYNERGY, which seems to have been successful? Thanks for taking the questions. Miles White : Yes, I\u2019ll tell you what, Absorb has become a very much in niche product; that\u2019s for sure. And I would have wished for it to be a lot bigger than that. But XIENCE remains best-in-class stent. That\u2019s still true. Do we need a bioabsorbable coated stent? I\u2019ll tell you, I think the bigger issue is I think we need an even more deliverable stent. The issue right now with physicians is deliverability. And I think that\u2019s been one of the hallmarks of Boston SYNERGY stent is the deliverability. So, I think the issue is more the deliverability than the coating. And we will launch early next year, Sierra, next generation of XIENCE, which will address that. So, that\u2019s what I think is our single -- most important focus right now. Do I think long-term that there is still improvements and performance improvements and so forth to make in stents, whether it\u2019s coating or material or deliverability et cetera? I do. I am not going to detail what that plan is from our standpoint, but our next focus in stents is primarily that deliverability with Sierra. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Hopkins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Robert Hopkins : I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question. So, just I\u2019ll start with the product question. I just want to be clear on MRI, the outlook for MRI safe for ICDs. What is the latest official guidance on when you expect that to come to market? And do you have a sense for whether you\u2019ll need a warning letter to be lifted to get that through? Miles White : The warning letter doesn\u2019t have to be lifted. The FDA has the ability, if it chooses to, to license it if they\u2019re satisfied with remediation actions and so forth. They always have that ability. So, it\u2019s not dependent on particular formal lifting of warning letter. At the same time, the FDA always has the right to decide what it wants to do. And I would say with regard to expectations at this point, we\u2019ve said second half or a year-end and I think that\u2019s probably, for right now, at least as modeling and planning purposes go, probably fine assumption. I can\u2019t be more specific than that because I can\u2019t read their minds and don\u2019t want to forecast and put them in a tough spot. So, I would say, as far as modeling goes, model second half somewhere and year end, but I don\u2019t know that I can give anything more precise than that. Robert Hopkins : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s 2017 obviously, right? Miles White : Yes. Robert Hopkins : And then one another, Miles, bigger picture question on the outlook for revenue growth for Abbott, because when you look through your results here this quarter, one thing you notice is that if you look at your different businesses, there is a very wide range of growth rates with some businesses like neuromod, just doing extremely well and other struggling a little bit. If we think about 2018, there is some strong incremental drivers of growth and there is something like neuromod that will probably slow a little bit. So, when net all that out, do you think as we kind of look forward into next year that you can again start to talk about Abbott again as something better than a mid single digit revenue growth company? Miles White : Well, I think that depends on a whole lot of things including the businesses. I think it depends on what\u2019s happening with global markets et cetera. I mean that\u2019s always our goal. In our goal, we always start every year with the notion that we are going to grow profits double digits. And to do that, you\u2019ve got to have fundamental revenue growth, as you know. And as we look at the mix of the business, I think the observation you make is correct. I mean, I\u2019d love it if everything grew like neuromod, but it doesn\u2019t. And there are some of these businesses that I would say are much more mature, like CRM and even the stent business, much more mature. The good news about those businesses is, they are extremely profitable and they generate high cash flows. So, in the mix of our portfolio, that\u2019s positive, that\u2019s a good thing. On the other hand, if you\u2019re maintaining a growth profile, you\u2019ve got to have lean toward growth in the mix. And we\u2019ve got a pretty good lean toward growth, I would say of late. The one that\u2019s got my attention from a longer term perspective is nutrition, particularly internationally and what I\u2019ve seen there is a slowing. I think that business longer term or at least on a stable basis for now, looks like it\u2019s going to be a low to mid single digit business, call that 3 to 5, something like that, 3% to 5%. But that\u2019s a mix. There are some countries that are 1% or 2% or some countries and geographies that are double digits. The global volume growth in that business for infant formula for example, tends to be 3% to 3.5% and the biggest change in the growth has been price. Not that the price has come down, it just isn\u2019t going to go up much. And I think that that\u2019s perhaps indicative of some maturing in some of those markets. We\u2019re looking at that closely right now. So, as I forecast it, interestingly enough it\u2019s also very profitable and a high cash generator. And as I\u2019ve talked about nutrition in the past and the mix of Abbott Laboratories, it\u2019s been one of the biggest cash generators in the Company for a long time. I used to refer to it as the bank as it funded a lot of M&A. So it\u2019s a very healthy business that way. I think our questions right now are assessing the shift of market tone. China for example is actually much more stable than the last 12 to 18 months. I like what I\u2019m seeing in China right now. We still have the government regulation continue and it\u2019s impacted competitors, there is a lot of reaction to the shrinkage of the number of SKUs in the market and so forth. And we\u2019ve talked about that. But as far as what we\u2019re seeing in 2017 here, we\u2019re performing according to our expectations. I think the comps obviously get better here in the second half; we will see. So, as I look forward, yes, it is our goal to be a healthy grower to be able to generate that double-digit bottom-line growth. I think that we\u2019ve got to continually look at the mix, as you suggest. How many growers we\u2019ve got, as you observe, the growth rate of something like neuromod will come down simply because it gets bigger in the base, but it\u2019s actual raw dollar growth I don\u2019t see changing for quite a while. So I think that\u2019s a plus. And I think we see improved growth in other areas. So, I know there is a lot of ins and outs there but at the end of the day, we are always looking to build our Company, grow the Company, expand the Company, gain market share for the Company. And the acquisitions of St. Jude and Alere were part of building that core leadership base in the businesses that we are in to continue to drive that growth, and the goal hasn\u2019t changed. Scott Leinenweber : We\u2019ll take one more question, operator. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Lewis : Brian, just a couple of quick ones for you and then one strategic one for Miles. So, just a couple of incremental financial questions. The incremental change to gross margin in the guide of 50 basis points, what was driving that? And then, as you just thinking about the pacing of the back half of the year, obviously you\u2019re guiding to improvement in the third quarter. Is the right way to think about it that back half is going to be mid single digits and obviously better than the first half or do you think the business gets a little better in the fourth quarter from an organic growth perspective than the third? And just a quick one for Miles after that. Brian Yoor : I think to your last question, you will see sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. There is a lot of items that Miles talked about in the acceleration, including new products and just the momentum of our businesses. So, I think that\u2019s the fair assessment. With respect to question on gross margin, our operational improvements and gross margin underlying continue to be there that we\u2019ve talked about it before. You do get a little noise around the mix of FX and what that does, and that\u2019s a simply math there. Nothing has changed about our aspirations to continue to expand our gross margins on an underlying basis, probably 50 to 75 basis points on that, David. David Lewis : Miles, just thinking about the strategic importance of the Bigfoot announcement and I don\u2019t want to make too much of a single investment. But just as a natural extension of building the brand and the reach of Libre and CGMS, or does it suggest an interest in pumping? And maybe said another way, I mean do you think to win in diabetes going forward, do you need to have an integrated pump and sensor under one roof? Miles White : No, I would say, in the grand scheme of things with diabetes care, I don\u2019t think we need to have a pump. But, I think there is a strategic, what would I call it, change happening or there will happen over the next couple of years in the market, particularly for type 1 diabetics and for multiple daily injectors which could be type 2s that are insulin-dependent. And what\u2019s interesting about Bigfoot is they are taking a different approach to the ease and the integration of what those multiple daily injectors have as solutions to manage their disease, separate from pumping. And it\u2019s a fairly clever service and approach that I think will create, not just an alternative that makes the management of the disease or management of someone\u2019s insulin easier but I think the value proposition of it is going to be pretty compelling. And I think that will change the competitive dynamics in that realm that is pumping. I mean the penetration of pumps or pumping relative to the market size of multiple daily injectors is really quite small. You would say wow! There is a lot of potential for further penetration. The question is the value proposition. A lot of times, the reason it hasn\u2019t penetrated further is, it might be too costly or viewed that way. And I think what Bigfoot\u2019s doing, if I could comment on it from a distance, because I\u2019ve never had a conversation with them myself, is they\u2019ve come up with a pretty unique value proposition that not only is good from the standpoint of the patient or even the payer, but also in general, in the cost of managing the disease for a diabetic. I think it\u2019s a pretty interesting use of technology to make it simpler, easier and affordable. Now, I probably sound like a brochure from them. I think it\u2019s -- I just think that their approach is interesting. And in our case, the technology that is Libre is a component of that and a fairly compelling piece of it that expands the use of Libre beyond what Libre can even do today. And then beyond that, there is other expansions and improvements to Libre that aren\u2019t just in that segment. But I think that the sensor technology and the nature the way Libre works has a lot of applications beyond how it\u2019s used today. And the Bigfoot approach is just one of those. And I think it\u2019s a pretty unique, compelling idea that puts Libre as a part of the competition in that sort of pumping or multiple daily injector world. It\u2019s a great opportunity for us and I think it further enhances the management of the disease for patients. Scott Leinenweber : Good. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. And that concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11 am Central Time today on Abbott\u2019s Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com, and after 11 am Central Time via telephone at 404-537-3406, passcode 41003454. The audio replay will be available until 4 pm Central Time on August 2nd. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian, and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjust the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange, as well as current year and historical results for Abbott's Medical Optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude's historical sales related to administrative fees paid to group purchasing organizations in order to conform with Abbott's presentation. Earlier this month, Abbott completed its acquisition of Alere, given there are only three months remaining in the year. I'd note that comparable sales growth guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 do not include Alere, which is consistent with the guidance methodology we've utilized since the beginning of the year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.66 at the high end of our guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. We also raised midpoint of our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.48 to $2.50 which is at the upper end of the range, we said at the beginning of the year. Sales increased more than [technical difficulty] in the quarter led by strong performance in established pharmaceuticals and medical devices. At the beginning of the year, I commented that we were entering a period where innovation and new product launches when enhance our competitiveness and fortify our leading market positions. We're seeing this play out through the first three quarters of the year with significant growth contributions from several recently launched products and important advancements across our innovative new product pipeline. I'll highlight several examples as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Brian. I'll start with diagnostics where we achieved sales growth of more than 5% in the quarter which was led by strong international performance during the quarter. We continued the initial European launch of our Alinity family of systems, which now includes five recently launched instruments in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening, hematology and Point of Care testing. As we've stated previously, our primary focus during this initial launch period has been to convert a number of long tenured Abbott customers to Alinity and we continue to make progress on that front across all of the major European countries. We continue to anticipate CE Mark for our Alinity molecular diagnostic systems in the coming months and expect to begin the launch of the Alinity instruments in the US in 2018. During the quarter, we also announced our acquisition of Alere establishing Abbott, is the global leader in Point of Care testing. This combination creates the broadest Point of Care testing portfolio in the world with leading positions across cardio, metabolic, infectious disease and toxicology testing. In nutrition, sales grew very modestly in the quarter. And pediatric nutrition continued above market performance and the US was led by recently launched infant formula products and strong growth of our PediaSure toddler brand. Internationally, we've seen some market stabilization in China and we prepare for the pending new food safety regulations that are set to go into effect on January 1 of next year. Outside of China as expected, we continue to see soft market conditions across few international markets and then adult nutrition international growth of 5.5% was led by our market leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. In established pharmaceuticals or EPD double-digit sales growth was led by strong performance across our key emerging markets including double-digit growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China. As expected and contemplated in our third quarter guidance, we saw a modest level of channel restocking in India after the implementation of a new tax system in that country on July 1, which contributed approximately 2.5 percentage points of growth in the quarter excluding this impact total EPD sales would have grown around 12% in the quarter. With our unique geographic footprint and business model as well as our scale and leading positions in several geographies, EPD is well positioned for sustained above market performance. And in medical devices sales growth was led by double-digit growth in heart failure, electrophysiology, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care. In addition to strong growth we achieved several important new product approvals and clinical trial milestones across our portfolio during the third quarter. In heart failure, we received US FDA approval and launched our HeartMate 3 pump which provides crucial support for advanced heart failure patients as they wait for their treatment including heart transplants. HeartMate 3 offers a number of advantages compared to existing options and further strengthens our global leadership position in this area. During the quarter, we also received US FDA approval of our MRI compatible ICD or implantable defibrillator which follows FDA approval of our MRI compatible pacemaker earlier this year. These approvals significantly enhance our competitive position in the US Cardiac Rhythm Management market. In structural heart, double-digit growth was driven by continued global uptick MitraClip. During the quarter we achieved several important clinical milestones including completion of enrolment in our US trial for Portico, our TAVR product and we began enrolling patients in a new tricuspid valve disease trial which utilizes our market leading transcatheter valve repair system. In Neuromodulation, we achieved growth of approximately 50% for the third consecutive quarter driven by recently launched products that offer improved relief for chronic pain patients and help for those suffering from movement disorders. With our broad portfolio of innovative solutions, we continue to advance our leadership position in this fast growing market. I'll wrap up with diabetes care, where international sales growth of nearly 35% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks. Libre now has more than 400,000 users internationally and during the quarter we obtained national reimbursement status in Japan and the United Kingdom which represent two of the largest diabetes markets in the world. In the US during the quarter, Libre received US FDA approval as a replacement for blood glucose monitoring. This revolutionary technology is the only system available that comes factory-calibrated thus eliminating the need for daily finger sticks that are required to calibrate other systems currently available. So in summary, we exceeded expectations for the quarter and raised the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance which is now at the upper end of the range, we said at the beginning of the year. Our sales growth increased sequentially and recently launched products are contributing significant growth across our portfolio and we're particularly pleased with the productivity we're seeing across our new product pipeline which is delivering a study cadence of approvals and launches of innovative technologies. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more details. Brian? Brian Yoor : Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on a comparable basis and do not include Alere, which is consistent with the guidance methodology we've utilized since the beginning of the year. Turning to our results, sales for the third quarter increased 5.6% on an operational basis. Exchange had positive impact on sales of 0.6% resulting in reported sales growth of 6.2% in the quarter. The favorable impact of exchange rates on our sales this quarter was driven primarily by strengthening of the Euro and other developed market currencies which considering our European cost base and hedging program have a relatively modest follow-through impact on our earnings. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.9% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.4% of sales. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2017, today we narrowed and raised at the midpoint our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.48 to $2.50. Before reviewing our outlook in more detail, I'd note that Alere which we acquired earlier this month is expected to contribute around $475 million to our reported sales and we forecast a neutral impact on adjusted earnings per share this year. We continue to forecast full year 2017 comparable operational sales growth in the mid-single digits and based on current exchange rates, would expect exchange to have a positive impact of nearly 0.5% on our full year reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7.5% and SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017, we forecast an adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 to $0.74. We forecast comparable operational sales growth in the mid-to-high single digits and at current rates would expect exchange to have a positive impact of somewhat above 2% on our fourth quarter [technical difficulty] sales. Before I open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter operational sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecasted double-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast low single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast sales to increase mid-single digits and in medical devices, we forecast sales to increase mid-to-high single digits which reflects continued double-digit growth in diabetes care as well as several areas in our cardiovascular and neuromodulation business. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Mike Weinstein : Miles, if we could touch on two topics. First is Alere now that it's closed and second is Libre, now that you have an FDA approval. First Alere, can you talk now about how we should think about the outlook for Alere both topline growth and in accretion obviously or it is familiar what you initially were expecting from accretion with $0.12 to $0.13 year one, including [ph] $0.20 in year two, but a lot happened to your business over that time. You renegotiated terms, you've divested some assets. So I think everybody would appreciate an update on how we're viewing that business and then we'll circle back on Libre. Thanks. Miles White : Yes, I think it's premature Mike to give real specific about Alere. We closed the deal a couple of weeks ago, literally. And our new management team is taking over the business, but obviously very rapidly getting up to speed, meeting all their employees and going through all the things you do to start integration and so forth. And I'd say first of all, that's gone very well. The management team we put in place has moved very quickly and I'd say very deliberately to get their hands around everything, but that takes some time. As we've said the people given the timing of when we close it, we expect no accretion this year. So I wouldn't look for any particular impact on the bottom line in 2017 and with regard to 2018, since our initial estimates of accretion that were quite some time ago, as you know when we first announced this deal because it's taken a very long time close. There have been a number of changes including divestitures and so forth. So I don't want to give you a specific number. I'd say it's fair to think that the accretion will be much more modest and what we have initially indicated for the first year. We will get a full year, we'll get a quarter's head start. And obviously our intent is to be accretive to our company and our business and we believe that with the acquisition we've positioned ourselves as the leader in Point of Care testing worldwide and all of that has the intent of good solid growth and profit growth for our investors, but I'm going to be cautious about what I communicate for 2018 at this point until we've really had a chance to assess it more thoroughly. Mike Weinstein : And do you think the business as you own it and they call it the proforma that we're under Abbott, does that business grow in 2018 and is low single digits an appropriate expectation. Miles White : I think it's a good target. I don't know that we know yet, but that's certainly I think an expectation we Abbott ought to have and the question is, how rapidly we can do that. Look I think it's a fair expectation and if I was and I'm totally honest with you. I wouldn't have a lesser expectation. Mike Weinstein : Okay, all right. Let me switch to Libre, if I can. And maybe try and ask, get couple questions in. So one, obviously everybody is excited not only based on all your success outside the US with Libre that now that you had this opportunity in the US. What would you view as a successful launch for Libre in 2018? Is there something you could characterize or wrap in a number, is it a $50 million, is it $100 million, if you wanted to take a stab at that? And then second, what is your expectation commercial payers. Can you tell us about the conversations you've had and the willingness and the timing of you think commercial payers getting onboard? Thanks. Miles White : Well I'd say couple of things. Your estimate is - let's just say your estimate I'll take. And you gave me a nice range there, so thank you. And I think that you can assume that we'll be looking at this from a lot of perspectives because we've got a lot of data. Having had a run rate in Europe, we launched in Europe and it basically went country-by-country. We started as full patient pay and we had really terrific uptake in consumer interest and that was the first introduction of Libre to the market. The fact that there was no reimbursement early on, was an unknown to us and it was a new concept and a new way for diabetics to test. And we experienced tremendous demand. Our first year, we were capacity limited and yet, we had a fair bit of demand. Second year, obviously has gone exceptionally well and so as I indicated we've got over 400,000 customers. It was remarkably well embraced for reimbursement by government bodies in Europe and regions in Germany etc., that's extremely gratifying that the value proposition that we see with Libre is strong and it's intended to be. And consequently we believe that part of the appeal is not just, what Libre can do and the information that it provides to a diabetic was a very informed patient and a very self-managing patient. It provides them tremendous information, tremendous guidance in the management of diabetes and I know that first-hand, I wear one. And I got to say it's just a phenomenal device, it's a super product. I can see why consumers like it as much as they do and that's true for both Type I and Type II's and we're seeing that universally across the board, they use it in different ways or at least the information mean something to them in different ways. Whether they're managing insulin or whether they're managing diet and exercise and other things. So I'd say first of all, I expect demand to be pretty strong. Secondly, the US market knows about Libre, it knows a lot about Libre because of all the experience that we've had in the last year in Europe. So I do expect a more educated, ready, prepared, anticipating, demanding market in the US as it relates to payers, which I would call the second dimension of this. I think our value proposition is quite strong. The product is priced at a very economic and affordable level. The intention there is as much and broad access as possible and as rapidly as possible. And I think that value proposition is stunning compared to competitive offerings and I think that's going to be making it strong. We are in discussions with payers and we're in discussion with payers about that value proposition and I believe that will all go very well. I know that's not as much detail as you'd like to have, but it's as much I'm willing to share at this point because right now I would tell you we expect a good strong out of the block performance like you described and beyond that. I mean right now, Mike we're adding about 50,000 patients a quarter and that's across a continent that we had to go at one country at a time, one reimbursement system at a time. Of course the US is quite large, and Japan and UK as additions to this are also quite large. So I mean, we have a fair amount of optimism and trying not to get too far ahead of ourselves. Mike Weinstein : And obviously I've a lot more questions, but I'll let someone else jump in. Thank you Miles. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. Matt Taylor : First thing I wanted to ask about was, certainly it was encouraging that you got MRI-conditional labelling for your ICD in the quarter, so just hoping we could get an update on how things are going in Sylmar and then when we might expect the approval for CRT-D and maybe the ICM as well. Miles White : Yes, I'd say a couple things Matt. First of all let me back up and give a bigger context to this. Over the course of the year, there was a lot of scepticism on the part of analyst end or investors about all the things that we had to get accomplished, that were back end loaded. A lot of third quarter, fourth quarter things and depending on how you're looking at it, it looks pretty daunting and we all know everything doesn't go right. And the Sylmar inspection put some of that in doubt. Now having said that, we stuck to our guns on what our estimates were and our projections were about when we would get product approvals and claim approvals, licensure approvals and so forth. And the third quarter alone here has been pretty gratifying in that. We basically got every approval we forecasted and let's call it, within 30 days or so of what we forecasted and I think that's been pretty gratifying, that what we said is what happened and that includes Libre, that includes the high voltage MRI claim, that includes HeartMate, it includes the closure of Alere, it includes Libre, it includes lot of things. I don't generally like being backend loaded because it feels like a lot of risk that everything has to go right, but everything did. And our progress with Sylmar is no exception as I've indicated on prior calls. Our team that has been working with the Sylmar team and so forth has done an exceptional job that we have provided all information, taken all actions, done all remediation, everything basically done on time, delivered to FDA, discussed with FDA etc. And at this point and we're just experiencing those new systems populating with new experience, new data, new decision making etc. and all of that is going exactly as planned, exactly as forecasted, exactly as communicated with the FDA and thus far without a hiccup and I think that's recognized by the FDA. I think it's recognized, they have discretion, they don't have to license new products out of that facility, but they have. And I think that is evidence of how we're progressing with Sylmar and the fact that the FDA is giving it all the scrutiny that they would and should and what we've submitted to them for approval has been given fair and objective consideration and we've gotten our approval so far. With that said, the remaining ones, I'm not going to change my estimates on. I'm not going to change what we forecasted. I have no reason to believe otherwise. They clearly have the discretion not to, but that's not been our experience and so consequently I remain optimistically that we're on track that we'll deliver what we said. Matt Taylor : Thanks. And I wanted to turn to another thing that you mentioned in your prepared remarks. On China you said you were preparing for these regulations to change the Nutrition in the New Year and did improve a little bit sequentially. Could you talk about, what kind of opportunity you could have in China, if that comes to pass on time with regards to being able to maybe soak up some of the capacity that gets lost at local players have to shut down or change their operations. Miles White : Well I'll tell you what, I'm not sure. I would tell you this. First of all, we have product approvals we need. We're ready for the transition. Building inventory for such etc. So as far as responding to the new law and I think this is true for at least the large multinational competitors. I think most of us, if not all of us have our product approvals. We are ready for the transition etc. How we all manage that, who knows. But I think at least we are and I think others are, ready with new approved replacement products etc. as we've been required to do. So I think we're all ready for the transition on January 1. What you can't know very well, at least about everybody else is how much inventory everybody has in various channels? How long that transition will take for any given competitor and so forth. We are comfortable with our inventory levels were comfortable with our inventory levels both on current product and post January 1 product. So we're comfortable what we think we have to do with our own transition. What's hard to project is not just multinationals, but all the hundreds of other Chinese competitors that are faced with the same regulation. So I'd say we've seen a stabilizing of China, it hasn't been as choppy as it was in the last two years. I'd say our estimates around market growth are hard to pin down. We were more conservative on market growth than recent data we've seen. The market growth is better than we indicated or better than we believed or better than we thought and we're looking pretty closely at all the sources of our market data because there are many and they're not all perfectly comprehensive across all channels and then all sources of products or even all geography, so it's a hard win. China is a particularly difficult one to pin down because there are a number of channels, there are a lot of competitors, there are a lot of data sources, it's not like going to AC Nielsen in the US or something. So I'm cautious about it. I think we've seen the tough part and I think we're going back into a phase where it's the same kind of hand-to-hand competition, we've always had across multiple channels, I like that. I think that's better because at least then whether we do well or don't do well is a function of our execution, I haven't been particularly pleased with our execution and I don't exclude a number of other countries where we do see soft market conditions, but I also see less than great execution on our part. So this business is getting a lot of attention from us and from all of us top to bottom and it will get some attention. I think it's probably the one soft spot in our release. That make a lot of things you know are going awfully well as I just commented to you in the device area. But this one is going to get a lot more attention. I feel that China is at least reasonably stable or predictable. We haven't been right about the market growth rates. Those looked better than we expected, so that's a plus and I guess I would just leave it at there. Matt Taylor : Great. Thanks Miles. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Bob Hopkins : So first, I just wanted to clarify something now as you said on Alere. Obviously I heard you that the accretion for 2018 will be lower than you originally thought, that's not surprising. But I just wanted to confirm, do you still think it will be accretive in 2018 and is roughly half the original accretion reasonable placeholder? Miles White : Yes, I expect it to be accretive. We've got a lot of work to do, to identify our synergies and identify growth opportunities. We're going through reorganization of the business right now and I think that's actually going to be a plus. I don't want to describe how it was organized because I think that's kind of waste of time and it will take a long time, but we went through a restructuring of the old structure of St. Jude and we did it within six months and as you know organized in integrated business units that I'd say organization is still kind of setting, the glue is still kind of setting, but we move to within six months that might have been aggressive but the organization is very stable. The restructuring activities that we had to go through and a lot of synergizing as far as people go, we've gone through, changes and management we've gone through etc., that all got done. But about the six month level at St. Jude it all got done in Alere in six days. So that's a running start. And we've announced what we're moving to, I think it's an organization like all organizations all people want to do well. They want to achieve, they want to grow, they want to be proud of the businesses they're running, they want to do well and I'd say, our early days with the employees of Alere have been positive and we announced that we're going to go to that kind of structure, we've announced how we're going to do it, why we're going to do it etc. and I think that's well received at this point. So as far as we look into 2018, I think your question about was half of that, a good placeholder. I'd say, yes it's a good placeholder. I can't tell you with any precision that that's what it will be, but I think it's a good placeholder. Bob Hopkins : Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then I'm sure there will be a lot of other questions on Libre but I want to focus on the rest of pipeline for a second because there are number of other things in addition to Libre that could help in 2018 and you touched on the MRI safe approvals, but I just wanted to kind of ask specifically on some of the other things that you've got in the pipeline and just to make sure that the timelines and your thoughts on those, haven't changed at all, relative to what you've been saying previously. And so, that would include things like the new stents that you've talked about Sierra that [ph] Confirm implantable cardiac monitor that's entering what is a very attractive market and so I'm just curious on those couple of things, the timeline is still the same as what you've been saying previously. Miles White : Well couple of things, first of all with regard to Sierra the same schedule, no change that will be first quarter of the year, we think. And with regard to Confirm, it's partly approved already. As you may understand it gets approved in pieces and so far, so good. There are some peripheral pieces we're waiting for approval on, but the first and very critical portion of that is approved. So yes I think that's - so far everything we've seen is very encouraging and no change. Bob Hopkins : Okay, so Confirm can be a full launch in 2018? Miles White : Well right now, that's what I bet on. Bob Hopkins : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. That's all I had. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open. Rick Wise : Miles, just after a solid quarter again coming out in the 2017 to the upper end of the range. I know it's early on to put all these pieces together in 2018, but as I reflect on it. And 2018 was multiple large new product opportunities launching St. Jude, Alere working shouldn't we expect at least similar topline growth and potentially better, if not accelerating topline growth against especially when you think about some of the headwinds you've faced in and worked through 2017, is the right way to think about it? Miles White : I'm trying to think about how to sound conservative to you. Look, we got our acquisitions closed. We're going to have a number of product approvals that happened in the third quarter and fourth quarter that obviously should hit their stride. I mean ideally you look at 2018 and you'd like to have your product approvals exactly where we got them, going into next year. We've had a really good 2017, we beat all expectations not just in the numbers, but in the approvals. You all have to admit you had a lot of scepticism about some of this and maybe rightly so after 2016, but look we hit every target, we had for this and with all those approvals, one ought to think that, should bode positively for 2018. That said, when we go through our budgeting every year it's kind of negotiating tussle with our managers around the world, about what's possible in their given market and so forth. But I think we ought to have pretty good momentum going into 2018 What can I say, all the organic R&D projects and system projects and launches and approvals and so forth, they're all happening. And the Alinity products probably most miraculously five of those began their launch process in Europe and they'll start in the US next year, that's been a huge, huge undertaking, we're extremely excited about Libre, we're excited about all the medical device products, everything that St. Jude represented to Abbott about its pipeline has come to fruition and is coming to fruition and so, we're very, very bullish about all that. And I think we're - and I think there is an awful lot of validation in this about that acquisition. We don't know as much about Alere yet, but we will. And whether it's a big impact for 2018 or if it's beyond 2018, either way I think we're pretty happy to have that business. So you know Rick, I think your assessment is right. It'd be kind of hard for me to say, no it's going to be a tough year. Rick Wise : Miles, that's a great answer and I'll take it. Another big picture reflection. One of the concern is obviously with two major acquisitions was balance sheet, cash flow, but my sense is in the first half at least you ran ahead of your cash flow generation commitments and goals. Maybe, can you give us any feeling how the third quarter went, remind us where your targets in terms of leverage and just again as we think about next six, 12 months or where do you think you can, where do you think you'll be from leverage and cash position? Thank you. Any color would be welcome. Miles White : Okay, well first I'd tell you that, this got great leadership and attention from our CFO and our EVP's and SVP's from day one and I'm going to let him answer that question because they've exceeded all of our targets not just by a little, but a lot. The cash flow is strong and I'll let him tell you that. Brian Yoor : Thanks, Miles. Rick, we continue to make great progress in our programs. If you recall, I talked about operating cash flow being around $4.5 billion for the full year. I won't quote you an exact number for Q3, but I think you'll safely assume that when you see the quarter filed, that we're well on track to that and I will say ahead of it. So we're going to continue to make that progress. As you talk about some of the ratios, I think it's important to keep in mind both debt and net debt. So at the end of the year, we projected a debt to EBITDA ratio of around four, however when you look at the cash flow programs and look at our net debt position, we'll be closer to three when you look at the net debt as a ratio to EBITDA. So we're in great shape and we want to keep the momentum going because this is number one priority to build back strategic flexibility here. Miles White : I think [indiscernible] commercial out there. This all gets even better if there is tax reforms. I'm hopeful. I wouldn't put odds on any more than anybody else watching our government but we're extremely hopeful of the territorial system that and it gives us access to our cash flows and earnings around the world at a reasonable rate and at a competitive rate and that does make it difference to us, in addressing current debt and cash flow, but cash flow itself, super good. Rick Wise : Appreciated. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Larry Biegelsen : I just had two. One it was noteworthy that you didn't mention the impact from the weather. You still had a strong quarter despite the weather. I imagined it had to have to some impact. So is there any color, you can provide and I have one follow-up. Miles White : Yes it did. I would comment a couple of things. First of all, it was a strange quarter for us in that, multiple hurricanes whether in the Texas Gulf Coast or across the Puerto Rico impacted, anybody who had operations there. The earthquake in Mexico impacted us. The brush fires and forced fires in California actually impacted us the day after we closed Alere had a key Alere facility there. And to be honest, it was more impact on our employees than on our plant operations. We had a little bit of roof damage and a little water leakage here and there, but it would appear the hurricane effected different companies, different ways going across Puerto Rico because I've noted that some competitors have indicated more damage or more impact than we've experienced. It took up a super human effort by a lot of our people to try to address some of that, which we did. The biggest issue was access to power generation in Puerto Rico and our folks address that really rapidly and we're very happy about that. Our plants, I guess back up and running, is the right way to say it. There is one that we're starting this week and we're back up, is what it amounts to. And so there is - I would call it a modest impact, it affected us, I'd say in a modest level, not a material level. Our first priority was to find all of our people and aid them, which we've done. And so in Puerto Rico, we have not experienced the kind of disruption that some others have. I noted that, another large healthcare company yesterday I think had similar comments that they've been able to address it. We're kind of large in Puerto Rico, so it could have been worse, but it wasn't and the St. Jude facilities that we inherited there with the acquisition. St. Jude were not particularly impacted, I mean they were but not to the degree we might have expected I mean everything is been more about power generation than damage. And unfortunately that's not true for our employees and it's not true for some other competitors and I wouldn't wish that on anybody. But we've been pretty fortunate to get everything back up and running. So we don't have an impact to report for the fourth quarter that we haven't somehow managed or absorbed already in our estimates. The facility that was threatened in California was not damaged. We were able to move things out of that facility and prepare for damage, but there wasn't damage and so we'll be back up and running soon, we did have employees who unfortunately lost homes and so forth and we're dealing with that as a company. But from the standpoint of the operation of the business, we are in good shape relatively speaking and to the extent that there is any impact, we've already included in our estimates for this quarter and absorbed it. Larry Biegelsen : That's good to hear. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about with management. That's the one business where if you improve that dramatically that really impact positively your growth. So I'm just curious what your expectations are for that business going forward, could it be potentially flat in 2018 and just a few to clarify at Confirm or X [ph] is going to be booked in that line or not? Thanks for taking the questions. Miles White : Okay, I'm going to have Scott answer that one for you. Scott Leinenweber : As you know on the MRI safe [ph] side, we continue to see good progress on the pacemaker. We received approval for the ICD very late in the quarter, so that certainly didn't have an impact this quarter here and the third quarter. But we do expect to have an positive impact in the fourth quarter. So yes I do think you'll see a nice step up in growth starting quite frankly next quarter and then as we move into 2018. Miles White : It's gratifying that our experience with the pacemaker has matched our experience in Japan and Europe with the MRI approvals in terms of share recovery and so forth. So I think that bodes well for the ICD as well. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Glen Novarro : Miles, you guys are doing a great job in terms of cash flow generation, you're going to get to your targets faster for 2018, but it sounds from Brian's commentary that 2018 is not going to be any type of deal here. It's going to be more about paying down debt, is that a fair assumption? Or do you actually have more flexibility there. If something does pop up, that's really interesting that you can do it next year. That and just some housekeeping questions after that. Miles White : Well let me answer it, this way. I don't really want the organization focused on M&A right now. I think I would give you that answer regardless of what Brian said about debt and cash flow and so forth. And secondly, I wouldn't forecast it even if I had it in my gun sights. Most of the - my experience with you guys over the past 19 years has been you liked to have some indication on what's coming, usually that surprised you more acquisitions or other things that we've done that hasn't always been particularly well received but they've always turned out pretty well, but I generally don't like the forecast where we're going or what we're doing until we announce it and so I probably wouldn't tell you anyway. Glen Novarro : But is there some powder [ph] for next year or is next year really let's focus on St. Jude, let's focus on Alere, before we think about anything else. Miles White : Honestly I think there is focus on St. Jude and Alere and right now that is paying off. Look the focus on St. Jude it's clearly paying off, the focus on Alere will pay off. The focus on the internal product launches of Alinity and so forth, these things will pay off. These are fundamental drivers of sustained growth. I mean it's the hallmark and the identity of the company is sustained growth and we target double-digit earnings growth every single year, your organic performance both in terms of R&D, pipeline, commercial performance etc. has to be sustainable that is where the focus is, and we've acquired a couple of businesses that initially were criticized that's not growth and I beg to differ and I think that we're demonstrating so far with St. Jude that there is a terrific pipeline and growth and share gain, etc. and I think you can see that. You can see that in the initial couple of quarters here, so yes I think there is going to be a lot of focus on not just St. Jude and Alere, but the fundamental organic performance of all of our businesses. You know it took a while for analysts and investors to appreciate the uniqueness of our strategy in established pharma and I think it sort of called out that there is a segment of pharma that's not commodity generic, that's branded generic, that's higher margin, higher growth, etc. in pretty key markets around the world and right now that's our fastest growing business other than neuromod. And neuromod's hard to touch, but we're growing that business at double digits. The team is doing a terrific job. Those markets represent the kind of opportunity we said they did and those kinds of growths from an operating standpoint growth rates out of the business that's what you want. So to some point if we can add to our footprint and add to our strategies, we want to be in a flexible position to do that. We obviously want to get to a position where we have the strategic flexibility that we always felt we had, so I don't think it's a bad idea for us to focus on the operations. Keep pushing our cash flow, keep pushing that debt down. So that's where the focus will be next year and I think we get ourselves back to strategic flexibility quicker that way, which is a good thing. Glen Novarro : Yes. Okay and then just I agree with everything you said, just some housekeeping. Maybe for Scott. You said Portico you finished in ruling next to US trial, would that put you on pace for 2019 US launch. And then I think you talked about Mitro [ph] which is the Tendyne program and I think you said you started enrolling, is that enrolling in the European trial and then is there an update on the start of the US trial? Thanks. Miles White : I'm going let Scott answer that. Scott Leinenweber : Sure, Glen. On Portico, we would expect to file in the US in the first quarter of 2019 to your question, so then you have the regulatory process after that. With respect to the Tendyne in Europe, we expect to complete enrolment here in the first quarter. It's a one-year endpoint so you can kind of do the math after that, but we're in the 2020 range or so on approval on the Tendyne product. Really great opportunity though, really it's structural hard portfolio here in totality is really come together what Abbott brought - almost St. Jude brought [indiscernible] so we're excited about it, longer term. Miles White : It's a really good to know, that's one that came out of our own venture group from our own investments and so forth and we've been able to combine these things, with St. Jude in a way I think is pretty synergistic, pretty favorable so we're pretty excited about that one. Glen Novarro : Any update on when you start the US trial for Tendyne? Scott Leinenweber : Yes, we could initiate US trial here in 2018. Glen Novarro : Okay, great. Thank you. Scott Leinenweber : Okay, thanks. Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Lewis : Miles, I thought I'd end on couple of questions on growth, I guess I'm little surprised that neuromodulation has not come up in this call, given it's been biggest growth driver for St. Jude this year, 50% growth through the first three quarters. I think every single quarter we expect that growth rate to come in a little bit. It's been extremely durable across the three quarters. Can you just give us a sense of factors that are driving that growth and sort of how you think about the sustainability of that growth in due 2018? And I have a follow-up after that. Miles White : I mean I think anybody that claimed 50% growth rate was sustainable will be an idiot, but so I'm not going to be one. Look we're very pleased with the performance in Neuromod. I think it's obviously driven by the fact, we've got three great products there. They're being exceptionally well received by the market. They have an impact in real life on patients in their P&L levels. We're seeing great with real world results from Burst and DRG. I think it's a really great group of products and a strong organization. I think the products hit a segment that's in kind need of improvements for patients and particularly the time when pain drugs and so forth are a national issue. So I don't know, I think the new products are driving the growth and the execution is been strong, the uptick is been strong. We've got three quarters in a row, 50% better growth. How long will it be like that? [Indiscernible] lap it, with all big numbers we'll start to diminish the growth rate, but the actual raw growth will still be pretty strong, so I don't know, I like what we see but it's hard for me to hold it up with an example to all the other business, so you should do this. David Lewis : Sure, very clear. And then I think Brian or Scott just to wrap up here. Into the fourth quarter because I think you can set the tone for investors as we think about next year's growth rate. You're certainly guiding to sequential acceleration sort of mid-to-high. Can you just kind of run through kind of sequentially what are those key components that get that acceleration because as I said, I think it sets the tone for 2018? Thanks so much. Brian Yoor : I'll take this. I think it's just - Miles had talked about the continued growth of brand and generics business, it's been performing at a double-digit range. I think you should expect more of the same there. If we look in diagnostics just sustained what you're doing, we do expect improvement at that business overtime as we continue rollout out our Alinity platforms across the globe. Diabetes care you know that story, it's growing very strong and we're excited to bring that here to the US. And most notably, I mentioned this in my guidance on the medical device side, that's where the step up is, where I talked about the mid-to-high single-digit and Scott caught a broad color to that, by saying you should expect further sequential improvement on the CLI side of the business because we've always said the magic formula is just bring that back to flat and the double-digit growth of all these high growth areas will shine through and deliver 5% or 6% on our medical device business. Those are really the key catalysts here, so we look forward to have good fourth quarter here. David Lewis : Okay, thanks so much. Scott Leinenweber : Very good. Thank you operator and thank you for all of your questions. And that concludes Abbott's conference call. a replay of this will be available after 11 AM Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com, and after 11 AM Central Time via telephone at 404-537-3406, pass code 88967373.

Welcome to Abbott\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. During the question and answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the star, one key on your touchtone phone. Should you become disconnected throughout this conference call, please redial the number provided to you and reference the Abbott earnings call. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question and answer session, the entire call, including the question and answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us. I\u2019d like to apologize here at the start for the late start - we had a few difficulties with the phone connection. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1a, Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.  Please note that fourth quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.  Unless otherwise noted, our 2017 commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjusts the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange, the current year and historical results for Abbott\u2019s medical optics and St. Jude\u2019s vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of last year, as well as the current year sales for Alere, which was acquired on October 3, 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude\u2019s historic sales related to administrative fees paid to Group Purchasing Organization in order to conform with Abbott\u2019s presentation.  With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Thanks Scott, and good morning. Today I\u2019ll discuss our 2017 results as well as our 2018 outlook.  For the full year 2017, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.50, representing 13.5% growth. Strong performance across many of our businesses enabled us to achieve adjusted earnings per share well above the midpoint of the initial guidance range that we shared at the beginning of last year. This past year was a very good and important one for our company. We performed well and our new product pipeline was highly productive, and we took some very important strategic steps forward, as you know. Also, a key element of our long-term success has been our ability to proactively shape our company to ensure we\u2019re in the right businesses that provide the best opportunities for growth. This past year was important in that regard. It began with the acquisition of St. Jude in January followed by the sale of our medical optics business and in the fall our acquisition of Alere. The additions of St. Jude and Alere will enhance our leadership, scale and presence in attractive areas of healthcare. We\u2019ve long been a major global player in diagnostics, and Alere adds rapid diagnostics to our existing leadership position in the $50 billion global diagnostics market. St. Jude, on the other hand, made us a leading player in medical devices, particularly in the very important cardiovascular area, where were previously had leadership in only certain focused areas. Adding St. Jude made us a major player in nearly every area of the $30 billion cardiovascular device market. St. Jude also brought us into a promising new area, neuromodulation to treat chronic pain and movement disorders. While we were adding these pieces, we sold AMO, our medical optics business. Though this business was very successful for us, we didn\u2019t see a path that would move us into a broader leadership position across the larger vision care market, so we sold the business to J&J who is already in that position, which allowed us to focus on other priorities and growth opportunities.  As we enter 2018, we\u2019re more diverse and better balanced than ever before. We\u2019ve sharpened our focus and enhanced our leadership positions and opportunities for growth. Importantly, our R&D productivity is at a new high. Over the past several months, we\u2019ve launched a number of products that will increase our competitiveness, open new markets and contribute to growth in 2018 and beyond. Great products are coming from our pipeline, which I\u2019ll highlight as I review each of businesses in just a moment. All of this translates into our expectations for another year of strong financial performance in 2018. As we announced this morning, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 to $2.90, which reflects 14% growth at the midpoint.  I\u2019ll now provide a brief overview of our 2017 results and 2018 outlook for each business. I\u2019ll start with nutrition, where sales grew low single digits in the fourth quarter, reflecting a modest sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. In the U.S., growth this quarter was balanced across our pediatric and adult businesses. In pediatric nutrition, growth was led by Pediasure and Pedialyte, and in adult nutrition growth was driven by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. Internationally, while much has been discussed regarding market dynamics in China, particularly the evolving regulatory environment and ongoing channel dynamics, I\u2019d note that we\u2019ve continued to see improving market conditions there. As expected, the new food safety regulations went into effect in that country at the start of this year. We were well prepared for this change and the market is in the early stages of transitioning to new products. As we look at the overall $30 billion global nutrition market, we see a market that remains attractive. Favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends remain intact, which provides strong foundational support for market growth going forward. Our position within the market remains highly competitive with well known and trusted brands in both pediatric and adult nutrition and a great global footprint that spans both developed and emerging markets. Our focus is to continue enhancing our competitiveness and to capitalize on future growth opportunities in this market. Turning to established pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where we achieved another quarter of double digit sales growth led by broad-based performance across several countries, including India, China, and Latin America. As you know, over the past several years we\u2019ve shaped this business through a series of strategic moves. These actions not only shaped how we participate by adding scale and strengthening our product portfolios, but also fundamentally enhanced where we participate. Our business is unique in that we are focused exclusively on emerging markets. There is no other business like it in the world. Emerging markets are growing rapidly, their populations are aging, their middle classes are expanding, and their healthcare systems are developing. Our strategy to build significant presence and scale in these fast-growing markets is unique and has been highly successful. Moving to diagnostics where we\u2019ve consistently achieved above-market growth with our leading platforms in core laboratory, molecular and point of care testing, the fourth quarter was no exception with sales growth of nearly 7%. This past year was important for this business on two fronts : first, the addition of Alere expands our presence in one of the few areas in diagnostics where we weren\u2019t already a leader, the highly attractive rapid diagnostics market. Over the past few months, the team has made good progress integrating this business and we continue to see several levers for growth acceleration, including opportunities for geographic, platform and test menu expansion. Secondly, we initiated the launch of the Alinity platform of instruments, an integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. As we previously discussed, the global launch of Alinity will be a multi-year process. We initiated the launch last year in Europe and will launch in additional geographies, including the U.S., over time. This highly differentiated platform promises to be a significant sustainable growth driver for this business over the coming years. Lastly, I\u2019ll cover medical devices, where sales grew nearly 10% in the fourth quarter led by strong growth in electrophysiology, heart failure, structural heart, neuromodulation, and diabetes care. As I mentioned earlier, adding St. Jude was truly a game changer for us, instantly transforming us into a broad-based medical device leader with scale, presence, and a great pipeline of next-generation products. One area in particular that shined this past year was our new product productivity.  In rhythm management, we closed the MRI safe product gap across our portfolio in the U.S. including FDA approvals of our pacemaker, ICD, and CRTD devices. These approvals enhance our competitiveness tremendously in this area. In electrophysiology, we launched EnSite Precision, our best-in-class cardiac mapping system. We also launched our next generation Confirm insertable cardiac heart monitor in Europe and the U.S. With its slimmer product profile, easy insertion procedure, and smartphone connectivity, initial customer feedback on Confirm has been very positive. In heart failure, we launched HeartMate 3 in the U.S. This lifesaving system helps pump blood through the body for advanced heart failure patients as they await further treatment, including heart transplant. We also have an ongoing development program to expand our indications here to include destination therapy for patients where transplant isn\u2019t an option. In vascular, we launched Xience Sierra, the newest generation of our leading Xience stent system in Europe. Initial market feedback has been positive and we anticipate bringing Sierra to the U.S. in the next few months. In structural heart, in addition to double digit growth, we continue to advance our pipeline in several areas, including minimally invasive new approaches for mitral and aortic valve replacement as well as tricuspid valve repair. As you can see, the combination of Abbott and St. Jude created a best-in-class cardiovascular device portfolio with depth, breadth, and innovation to help patients restore their health and deliver greater value to customers and payors. We had a long-term strategy to become a leader in cardiovascular care. We laid the foundation over a number of years and the combination of Abbott and St. Jude brought it to completion. St. Jude also brought us into neuromodulation where several recently launched products led to 30% growth in the fourth quarter through both share capture and market expansion. This leading portfolio of products offers (indiscernible) relief for patients living with chronic pain and helps those suffering from movement disorders. The positive effects of these products are nothing short of amazing. In diabetes care, sales grew 28% in the fourth quarter led by Freestyle Libre, our highly differentiated glucose monitoring system. Over the course of last year, we also achieved a number of important regulatory and reimbursement milestones for Libre. Notably in North America, we received regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Canada. On the reimbursement front, we obtained national coverage in the U.K., France and Japan, and earlier this month we announced that Freestyle Libre obtained Medicare coverage in the U.S. In summary, 2017 was a very good year for us. We performed well, our new product pipeline was highly productive, and we took some very important strategic steps forward which yielded both immediate results and strengthened our long-term growth opportunities. We\u2019re entering 2018 with very good momentum, we\u2019re more diverse and better balanced, our leadership positions are stronger, and importantly a significant number of recent and upcoming product launches position us for strong growth in 2018 and beyond. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2017 results and 2018 outlook in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Okay, thank you, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to 2017 sales growth, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable basis and do not include results from our earlier acquisitions, which is consistent with the guidance methodology we utilized all of last year. Turning to our results, sales for the fourth quarter increased 7.7% on an operational basis. Exchange had a positive impact of 2% on sales, resulting in reported sales growth of 9.7% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.9% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 28.9% of sales. Overall as we look at 2017, we delivered strong adjusted EPS growth of 13.5% and significantly exceeded our cash flow objectives with full-year 2017 operating cash flow in excess of $5 billion and free cash flow in excess of $4 billion.  Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018, today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 to $2.90, which reflects 14% growth at the midpoint. In terms of our 2018 sales forecast, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. On this basis, our 2017 sales baseline would be $26.7 billion, which excludes sales from Alere, or rapid diagnostics as we call it, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of last year, and also excludes sales from our former medical optics and vascular closure businesses, which we sold during the first quarter of 2017. So for the full year 2018, we forecast organic sales growth of 6 to 7%. In addition, we expect rapid diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion for the full year 2018.  Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of a little below 2% on our full year reported sales with more than half of this favorable impact driven by strengthening of the euro. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, when the euro moves, the fall through impact on our results is modest, taking into account our European cost base and our hedging programs.  Before I review our outlook for the P&L, I\u2019d note that we\u2019ve reclassified certain pension-related items in order to comply with recent changes in pension accounting standards. As a result, approximately $150 million of net pension-related income has been removed from operating lines of the P&L, primarily cost of goods sold and SG&A expense, and now will be reported as non-operating income. With that in mind, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 30.5% of sales, which reflects the pension-related reclassification I just mentioned as well as incremental investments in the businesses to support recent product launches and to further strengthen our pipeline. We forecast net interest expense of around $775 million. This forecast includes the net interest impact of $4 billion of debt that was repaid earlier this month as well as anticipated additional debt repayments throughout 2018. We forecast a gain of approximately $5 million on the exchange gain/loss line of the P&L for the full year 2018, and around $110 million of non-operating income which includes, as mentioned earlier, pension-related net income in accordance with the recent changes in accounting guidelines. Lastly, as a result of U.S. tax reform and our forecasted mix of global income, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of 14.5 to 15% for the full year 2018. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2018, we forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.57 to $0.59. In terms of our 2018 first quarter sales forecast, please note that the first quarter 2017 organic sales baseline would be $6.15 billion which, as we commented earlier, excludes sales from our former medical optics and vascular closure businesses which we sold during the first quarter of last year. On this basis, we forecast organic sales growth of 6 to 7%. In addition, we expect rapid diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $5 million in the first quarter. At current rates, we would expect exchange to have a positive impact of around 3.5% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment around 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 33% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $200 million in the first quarter. Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In nutrition, we forecast low single digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In diagnostics, we forecast organic sales growth of mid-single digits in the first quarter and mid to high single digits for the full year; and in medical devices, we forecast sales to increase mid to high single digits for both the first quarter and for the full year. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Mike Weinstein : First off, congratulations on a very nice close to 2017. I think it\u2019d probably be helpful, because the fourth quarter of \u201916 to the fourth quarter \u201917 has some moving parts, what do you think the clean organic performance was for 4Q17? Scott Leinenweber : Yes Mike, I would just chime in - there are a couple but they\u2019re relatively modest. As you know, St. Jude had a battery recall in the fourth quarter of last year which suppressed that baseline a bit, and we had a little bit of timing in EPD, but other than that, that\u2019s about it. Our organic growth would be around 7% this quarter - really strong. Mike Weinstein : And the confidence in the 2018 outlook, Miles, that the 6 to 7%, which I think if you would have surveyed the street before, they would have said you guys would have said mid-single digits, so obviously this is at the upper end or more bullish than that, is it the momentum that you\u2019re seeing particularly in the device side of the business, and could you speak specifically to a couple of product launches? One of them I think everybody would like to hear about is Libre; another one is Confirm, which our check suggests is off to a very nice launch. Miles White : Yes, I\u2019ll tell you, look - the forecast we put out, it\u2019s a strong forecast. It just is, I mean relative to peer groups, competitors, segments, the whole thing, and even relative to us. To be honest, even looking at that, yes, I feel pretty confident about it. I don\u2019t know the unknown, I don\u2019t know what exchange may or may not do - that\u2019s always unpredictable, but based on everything we know at this point, my view is yes, 6 to 7, and probably closer to the high end of that. If I look at the underlying performance of the business and in different segments, and I\u2019ll just recap some of this, the drag on some of the growth here has been in nutrition, and even that is sequentially improving. The situations that we\u2019ve seen that have set that business back a little bit have all improved and are all improving, so I think first of all, that\u2019s a good omen. Secondly, in all the other areas, take EPD, very sustainable growth. They had a very strong fourth quarter - I think it was 14%. I don\u2019t expect 14 for the whole year \u201918, but let\u2019s face it - they\u2019re running strong. Then I look at diagnostics and devices and they\u2019ve both got just a tremendous bunch of new product launches, and they\u2019re not flash in the pan product launches. These are going to sustain growth over a number of years because these are big and broad product launches. The Alinity product launch, I think is going to make a big, significant difference in diagnostics. I think we\u2019re going to see increasingly better performance out of Alere. But look, Alinity is across six segments of diagnostics, so I think that\u2019s a pretty sustained momentum. They\u2019ve been doing a terrific job, frankly, in the 6 to 8% growth range with a lot of, I\u2019d say, aging systems and older systems, and now they\u2019ve got an entirely brand-new product line out there in all categories, so I think that bodes well. Then, I finally look at the whole cardiovascular device area. You\u2019ll recall, Mike, many people challenged whether St. Jude was really growth, and there was a lot of grumbling a year ago about that acquisition. Sequentially over the course of this year, St. Jude\u2019s going from first quarter 2.4% to 4% in the second quarter, 4.2% in the third quarter, and 10% in the fourth quarter. I won\u2019t tell you that I think 10% is sustainable for the year, but they had a 10% fourth quarter and they didn\u2019t have to stretch to do it, and the product launches and approvals, mainly the product approvals particularly in the U.S. that I forecasted to you in both July and October, all happened, and there was some skepticism about that because of the situation in Somar but, frankly, our team has done a terrific job in Somar and a terrific job communication with our U.S. regulators, and we got all those product approvals and those launches are all out of the blocks and going well. So you know, knock on wood - I looked into 2018 and it all feels remarkably strong and sustainable, and I think that\u2019s terrific. Tax reform was a nice boost, and there\u2019s a lot of things here that are all looking up. Then I finally come to Libre, which--you know, I enjoy the fact that every time something is announced with Libre, it\u2019s a surprise to somebody because everybody seems to have such low expectations for it, and I think we\u2019re going to continue to surprise people in that category. We\u2019re investing several hundred million dollars in expansion. This is a big product. I think you estimated at one point $50 million to $100 million in the U.S. this year - I think that\u2019s a good range of estimate. But you know, frankly, it\u2019s going strong. We\u2019re adding probably 50,000 customers a month right now and that\u2019s increasing, and that was primarily Europe. That doesn\u2019t even reflect much U.S. yet. So as we came out of the fourth quarter, the growth rate of that product is just tremendous and we\u2019ve got a series of enhancements and approvals and additions to it coming that only make it better. As I said, it\u2019s not an niche product - it\u2019s a mass market product, because there are tens of millions of Type 1 diabetics, and frankly the same in Type 2s trying not to be Type 1 diabetics, and I\u2019m one of them, so I wear the product, I live the product, I know the product, and I think this product has a long track road ahead of it. So as I look at all the growth drivers of the company and then some of the elements of St. Jude, like neuromodulation and structural heart and other things, I think there is just an awful lot of growth here. So I go into \u201918, I look at the numbers that we forecasted, and yes, I feel pretty confident about it, so at this point I\u2019m looking at the success we\u2019re having with cash flow and the balance sheet, investment in expansion, investment in capacities, investments in R&D and SG&A, which I put more money into, and everything looks pretty good. Mike Weinstein : Miles, if I could ask-- Miles White : I realize it was a long answer, but you kind of asked a big question. Mike Weinstein : No, no, that was perfect, thank you. Just so you guys know, the sound quality isn\u2019t great on our end, so just FYI. Miles, I did want to ask you about capital allocation and the benefit of tax reform. Tax reform is going to lower your overall tax rate in 2018 by 150 to 200 basis points. You\u2019re also getting access to previously trapped cash in your global cash flows going forward. Can you just talk about what you plan to do with the trapped cash and then how the access to global cash flows changes at all your capital allocation plans? And then I\u2019ll drop, thanks. Miles White : Yes well, it\u2019s not trapped anymore. It\u2019s terrific to have access to it, I have to say. I\u2019m pleased with where tax reform came out. As a multi-national and a company that had a lot of debt in the last two years because of the acquisitions, I had concerns about some of the structures they were looking at, but it all turned out pretty good. I think it will stimulate a lot of growth and investment in the U.S. in particular, and you can see that in a lot of the things that companies are communicating, and the same is going to be true for us. As far as capital allocation, Brian mentioned in his remarks we were up to a gross $28 billion of debt because of our acquisitions of St. Jude and Alere, and a little bit of lingering debt we had just over time, and we just paid off $4 billion of that so we\u2019re down to $24 billion. Over the next six months, we\u2019ll pay off probably $3.5 billion to $4 billion more, and we\u2019ll be down to $20 billion by the end of \u201918. The cash flows in the company are strong. Brian\u2019s run a program with our EVPs to be very conscious of cash generation, and that\u2019s been extremely successful, and our cash flows and profits and so forth right now are as strong as they\u2019ve ever been. So as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re going to make a priority out of getting that cash or getting that debt down to a more balanced level. We will--we\u2019ve already exceeded the targets that the rating agencies had for us, and we\u2019ll be below--on debt to EBITDA, we\u2019ll be below 3 at year-end, and on a net debt basis we\u2019ll be below 2. So we\u2019ll be in a very strong metrics position at year-end, and that puts us in, let\u2019s say, a position to be at a more normal capital allocation viewpoint at that point. We raised our dividend in December by 6%. I\u2019d anticipate we\u2019ll raise it again at the end of the year probably more than that, because we like to maintain a payout ratio of a little better than 40% of EPS. So I think our capital allocation, our cash flow is strong, we\u2019re pushing down the debt fast, faster than we anticipated by at least 18 months, so all of that right now is frankly looking quite good, largely due to the tax reform and the management of cash flow here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. Matthew Taylor : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. The first question I wanted to ask was specifically on diagnostics. I guess I was just a little intrigued by the fact that the guidance you gave for the year implies some improvement, and you also talked about that in your comments. I wanted to explore two things. One is can you talk about how the Alinity roll-out could cadence through the year, and then secondly, now that you have had Alere or rapid diagnostics under your belt for a little while, can you talk about the state of that asset and how you expect that to grow over the coming years? Miles White : Yes, thanks Matt. Let me start with Alinity. First of all, it\u2019s six different systems, two in particular that are in the core laboratory, one that will address transfusion, one that will address point of care testing, one that will address hematology, and one that will address molecular diagnostics, so there\u2019s multiple dimensions to this. You\u2019ve got approvals around the world. They\u2019re all approved in Europe at this point. A couple are approved in the U.S. We expect more approvals the following year. We tend to be pretty much on those approvals. The menu expansions in our development have gone extremely well in the last, say, 10 to 12 months, so they\u2019ve got very full menus, and therefore the pace of introduction can go much faster because accounts don\u2019t really want to address change until they\u2019ve got full menus, or close to it, so that momentum picks up. Then you\u2019ve got to deal with the life cycle of contracts that are out there in the world. Now, today we\u2019ve got, I want to say, 25, 26, 27,000 instruments out there in these main categories, main core lab categories, and my goal is to replace that entire base and of course take a fair amount of share over the next five to 10 years. So there\u2019s a ramp there, there\u2019s a scale there. It\u2019s a significant scale, and our attention now is all about scale-up and all about pace and magnitude. This is not going to be some incremental, slow-rolling thing. It starts that way initially - it starts as a slow roll, and then it\u2019s going to pick up tremendous momentum because it\u2019s our intent to replace that entire base and frankly take a lot of share with it. So I think we\u2019re in a really great position with Alinity. Our challenge now is just mass scaling as we attack that market.  On Alere, I\u2019d say our team has done a terrific job. We have an entirely new, from Abbott, management team there. I\u2019d say their progress in terms of integration, reorganization, etc. has gone extremely well. Literally within a couple of weeks, we reorganized the entire company into business units, fully integrated business units with management teams and so forth. I\u2019d say that our assumption of the business has gone at warp speed and gone well. We\u2019re ahead of schedule on literally everything, on target on our synergies. We\u2019re ahead of our targets on sales and profit. Flu and strep seasons in the U.S. have aided that to some degree, but thus far I\u2019d say everything is sort of on point as we\u2019ve projected.  Beyond that, I don\u2019t have a lot more detail to give you, other than so far, so good, and I think our transition management has been excellent. It\u2019s been that way with St. Jude too. What we did at St. Jude, we\u2019ve done faster at Alere, and St. Jude was pretty fast. We went through sort of the same things with St. Jude - we reorganized a lot of businesses there into fully integrated business units, we did it in the first six months. That\u2019s usually very disruptive, but we managed to do it without disruption, and we did it with Alere in a matter of weeks, so I\u2019d say we\u2019re in a strong position. I\u2019m very pleased with the management team and how rapidly it\u2019s up to speed. We\u2019ve got a couple of new hires on some of the business, but I\u2019d say this team has gotten up to speed quick. Matthew Taylor : Thanks. One follow-up - this is probably the most pleased I\u2019ve heard you sound in while on how things are going and the results kind of speak for themselves, but I know you\u2019re never satisfied. What areas would you point us to where things aren\u2019t going well, that you want to improve, and how do you think about dropping all this good growth on the top line through to the bottom line versus investing in all the things that you have to invest in now? Miles White : Well, I\u2019d say two things. We\u2019ve still got improvement to make in nutrition, and we know that and our nutrition team knows that. We\u2019ve had a lot of discussion about that - I\u2019ve personally talked to our (indiscernible) around the world and so forth, and there\u2019s no point in having your (indiscernible), we simply want to do better. I\u2019d say even where our growth rates are right now, sequential improvement is a plus. Now, there are a number of places we\u2019re pretty positive and pretty happy with performance. I\u2019d say the U.S. stands out as executing really well. There\u2019s a number of countries around the world executing well, and the ones that had difficulty are improving, so that remains a point of attention to us. I\u2019d say in terms of the happy column, a lot of our success right now and what we\u2019re focused on is organic growth. We\u2019ve never had such productivity out of R&D at Abbott, and frankly so has St. Jude, and I now consider them Abbott. What St. Jude had said about their pipeline to the street over a number of years is true - they had and do have a terrific pipeline of products. We\u2019ve gotten the approvals, we\u2019ve closed the gaps where they had deficiencies, and there\u2019s a lot of growth there, so what I\u2019m particularly happy about is that the organic growth opportunity here across all of our businesses - nutrition, EPD, pharma business, the new product launches in diagnostics and devices, including St. Jude and Alere, it\u2019s just--its broad and it\u2019s deep, and it\u2019s exciting to have that much innovation and new product to be launching. So our challenges aren\u2019t so much fixing problems or deficiencies; our challenges are how fast we can scale and how fast we can run. I\u2019m pretty confident that it\u2019s sustainable and it\u2019s sustainable for a long time because it is organic growth of new products, so I\u2019m pretty happy about that. I\u2019m not out looking for M&A and I don\u2019t have any significant M&A on the radar screen - in fact, I don\u2019t have any M&A on the radar screen because I want to hit those debt targets by year-end. Our targets are more aggressive than the ratings agencies. I want to get back to where our capital allocation flexibility is as flexible as it\u2019s ever been, and I want to get their fast and I\u2019m going to get there fast. So you know, I think our challenges are how to keep the pedal down on that growth, because all of these businesses have opportunities at the same time and some of it is some fairly significant scale-up, and Libre is a tremendous opportunity. It\u2019s a mass market product and it\u2019s unlike any other medical devices. Medical devices by nature are sort of niche therapies - this one is not, and this one has a totally different rhythm to it, and the pace of scale and the magnitude of opportunity is more like tech than it is med-tech. That\u2019s an interesting challenge for us, it\u2019s a positive challenge, it\u2019s a good challenge, and fortunately we\u2019ve got such strong cash flow, we can afford the capital investment that we want to spend while we\u2019re paying down our debt and paying our dividend and so forth. So I mean, as challenges go, that\u2019s a pretty nice set of challenges. You don\u2019t lose sleep on those. Matthew Taylor : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Lewis : Good morning. Miles, there\u2019s a lot of conversation this morning on growth, but it was fairly robust EPS guidance for Abbott to start the year. I think for us, what\u2019s interesting is unlike a lot of your peers who are dropping through all the tax down to the bottom line, you\u2019re reinvesting, which makes sense given your premium growth. But I wonder if you can sort of give us a sense of where that reinvestment is going, and given your flexibility, how you\u2019re feeling about this sort of mid-teens EPS growth over the next couple of years. Miles White : Well nice try - I don\u2019t give guidance that far ahead. Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I have seen that a number of companies have dropped through quite a lot of tax benefit to the bottom line, and frankly I expect to see that. I mean, there are some industries and some businesses that really benefited from tax reform. If the primary source of your sales and profits is the U.S., obviously you got a really demonstrative benefit. If you\u2019re a multi-national or you had a lot of debt or something, it\u2019s not as demonstrative; but now having said that, we\u2019ve dropped through some of that tax benefit into our EPS, and I think that\u2019s reflected in our guidance this morning. I did direct a significant amount of the benefit from tax into R&D and SG&A, and I think that\u2019s warranted given not only the new product launches and how fast we want to run with some of these, but--so I\u2019ve directed some of the benefit to increased R&D investment, and you can imagine--I mean, I\u2019ve directed some of that at diabetes care and Libre, I\u2019ve directed some of that at neuromodulation and other cardiovascular products, I\u2019ve directed a fair bit of it at SG&A expansion and so forth. When you\u2019ve got these kinds of opportunities, you\u2019ve got to invest in them and put fuel behind them, and fortunately tax reform has given us that ability.  We will spend some of that money investing in manufacturing in the United States as it\u2019s predicted that that would happen. We will - I won\u2019t tell you where or what products and so forth, because I don\u2019t want to forecast that to competitors and so forth, but in fact the U.S. will benefit, as will some locations overseas where we\u2019ve got already existing capability, facilities, expertise, etc. But we are directing a fair amount of this to help ensure we\u2019ve got not only a sustainable product pipeline and rapid innovation and enhancements to products, but that we\u2019re also doing our best in marketing areas and so forth to maximize the opportunity that\u2019s in front of us as rapidly as we can. We don\u2019t want to think about it so incrementally, because I think sometimes when you\u2019ve got these new products and opportunities, you\u2019ve got to go hard and fast, and I think when you do that, you establish a better share position, a better market position, a better use position with customers, regulators, etc., and that\u2019s much more sustainable over time. So as you ask me, I think if we get our job done particularly in the areas where we just--you know, that I\u2019ve just highlighted, which is a lot, I think our growth rates are pretty sustainable. We start every year with a double digit earnings growth target, and as we\u2019ve indicated this year on an apples-to-apples comparable growth basis, we expect 6 to 7%, and I\u2019m in the upper half of that range in my beliefs. But I\u2019d like to see that growth rate increase, even substantially going forward. We\u2019re always trying o be double digit earnings. I\u2019m not concerned about having a double digit earnings growth rate on a sustainable basis for the next few years. I want to drive the top line so that I can sustain that at an even higher rate, and that\u2019s where my focus is. David Lewis : Okay, that\u2019s very clear. Thanks for the color, Miles. I think St. Jude has gotten a lot of attention on the call but Alere less so. What\u2019s your focus for 2018 for Alere? Can this asset definitively get back to underlying growth in \u201918, and how quickly can Alere get back to what you would think is market growth for point of care? Thanks. Miles White : Well, I\u2019d say slower than St. Jude. St. Jude, as you all remember it, it went through about a four or five-year period where it didn\u2019t have much growth and the street was unhappy with that, and it even missed its earnings targets a couple of times. What they were right about was they had a robust R&D pipeline and a product pipeline, and they were right about that and I think the people that led and managed St. Jude should feel vindicated about that. We do, because there was a fair amount of concern and criticism when we acquired St. Jude, but frankly as you can see in the numbers, there\u2019s growth here and there\u2019s going to be growth here, and it\u2019s not just small incremental growth . It\u2019s significant, and I\u2019m really happy with the performance of St. Jude. I think Alere is a little longer story. The company had a lot of internal operating challenges. It hadn\u2019t been invested in, so I think pipelines are going to take a little longer to develop. I think restoring the cohesiveness of performance of functions in the business, in some of the business, it\u2019s going to take a little longer. So I expect Alere to emerge, I\u2019m going to say over two to three years, because we want to put more investment into new products, refreshing products, R&D, SG&A, etc. We do have some rationalization to do - that doesn\u2019t mean restructuring, that means the integration of those functions and businesses, and figuring out what are old products, what are new products and so forth.  I think Alere will be a little slower emergence than St. Jude has been. St. Jude sort of exploded on the scene here over one year, and I don\u2019t think Alere will explode on the scene but I don\u2019t think Alere is going to be flat either. I think we believe there\u2019s a lot of growth here in this entire rapid diagnostic and point of care space. I think there\u2019s a lot of growth, and I think that growth is sustainable over many years, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be--I\u2019m not going to be telling you the same story about Alere at the end of the year. At the end of \u201918, I\u2019m going to tell you we had a good year, it tracked better than we thought, it\u2019s showing growth. I\u2019m going to tell you all those things at year-end, I\u2019m pretty sure, and we love the underlying assets and products and so forth. I mean, that\u2019s all going to be true, but I think operationally it\u2019s going to take a little longer to get this back on an investment cycle in products and launches and so forth that we\u2019ll want to see.  The good news is we\u2019ve got so many other opportunities at the same time that I think it\u2019s nicely staged. You don\u2019t want everything to show up at the same time, so I think it\u2019s nicely staged to help sustain the growth in diagnostics while they're dealing with the scale-up of Alinity. David Lewis : Great, thanks Miles. Congrats on the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning, and thank you for the question. Very nice quarter. Can we turn a little bit to EPD? That area of growth tends to be a little bit of a black box for investors. How do we think about the sustainability of that growth rate? This is the second quarter in a row of mid-teens growth. Miles White : You know, Joanne, I think the fundamentals underlying the markets drive an awful lot of the growth. You know, the managers in that business and I sort of have this ongoing debate - I\u2019m always chronically dissatisfied and they\u2019re always telling me, hey look, we\u2019re really growing fast here. But the fact is the underlying dynamics of the market drive a lot of the growth because we\u2019ve selected markets and countries, emerging markets in particular that have growth characteristics which I characterized in my remarks. So the underlying fundamentals of those markets are all very positive in terms of growing healthcare systems, growing middle class, spending on healthcare, etc., but succeeding in those markets requires a certain amount of presence and strength and scale, meaning you want to be in the top five competitors in most of these markets. China is a little different, but you want to be in sort of the top five competitors. You want to have very broad product lines and you want to have some depth in various therapeutic categories, and you want to have a strong brand. I think our teams around the world have done a super job at that, and I think there\u2019s countries where we believe we can do even better, a lot better.  So I\u2019d say, first of all, the underlying dynamics are strong. We\u2019ve put a fair amount of emphasis in renewing and broadening our products. We\u2019ve put a lot of attention into our own, let\u2019s call it development productivity, registration productivity, etc. We\u2019re putting more and more investment into India and our distributor organizations to do just that, because we believe we can and should. We\u2019re putting a lot of attention on gross margin management to improve our gross margins, whether in procurement or things that we source from third parties that we should do ourselves, and so forth. So there\u2019s a lot of emphasis on margin improvement, and frankly the margin is already good, better than good, but we know that there\u2019s opportunity to improve it still further. A lot of people think of generics as commodity, generics that don\u2019t make much money. These are branded generics where the brand matters. It\u2019s sort of an OTX type thing in a lot of these markets, and we make pretty good profits here, so the characteristics of these markets have been that. That said, the last couple quarters had some anomalies that bumped these numbers up and down. We went through a couple of disruptions in India, for example, which is a big part of our business, where we went through the demonetization issue and then the GST tax thing. We actually managed that really well, I think, but that affected inventory management by wholesalers and distributors, which are a big part of our business system here. So sometimes I think we\u2019re going to see some of these quarters look very up, and other times they\u2019re going to be a little less up, but they\u2019re always up. You know, I think--I don\u2019t think the 14% we saw in the fourth quarter is something we expect every quarter. If it starts to happen three or four quarters in a row, I\u2019m going to be back with my managers, saying I think you were a little conservative, but I think it\u2019s a double digit grower. I think it\u2019s easily sort of 9 to 11% on a very sustainable basis on the sales line, so a lot of that is fundamentally in the markets and then we\u2019re pressing to kind of broaden our product lines and gain share because of the way we manage the business. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. As my follow up, neuromodulation sales were up 30% in the quarter after being up 50% for the beginning portion of the year. How do we think about that growth going forward, and there was a lot of good buzz coming out of NANS. Could you please update us on that? Miles White : Yes, I\u2019m going to have Scott help me with that, but--because I asked the same thing. I said, jeez, why are we down to 30%? It\u2019s because of the comparison to this fourth quarter last year. Scott can give you a little color on that, but the growth rate here remains strong and the opportunity remains strong. This is one of the bright--well, we\u2019ve got a lot of bright spots, but this is one, clearly. Scott? Scott Leinenweber : Yes Joanne, as you recall, we launched first in deep brain stimulation products in the fourth quarter of last year, to Miles\u2019 point. Obviously the business is coming off a great year - we\u2019re number one now in the chronic pain segment. We do expect to capture more share next year. The market is growing in the low teens and we expect to grow faster than that. Joanne Wuensch : Perfect, thank you very much. Miles White : You\u2019re welcome, thank you, Joanne. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the strong finish to 2017. I wanted to start back on St. Jude. You guys laid out some synergy targets around the acquisition. I just wanted to get an update on whether or not you think that there is upside to those historic targets, particularly on the revenue synergy side. We\u2019ve been assuming revenue synergies hitting in year two, but are you already seeing revenue synergies come?  Also just on the margin contribution, with the rebound in top line growth for the St. Jude franchise, is it safe to assume that the margin contribution outlook for that unit in 2018 is going to step up nicely? Brian Yoor : This is Brian. I think those are the right assumptions. We\u2019re right on with our synergies as we\u2019ve tracked. We\u2019ve always said $500 million by 2020. We had a great year, we executed very well. We integrated and achieved our synergies, expect that to continue, and that\u2019s incorporated into our guidance. As Miles discussed earlier, we\u2019re very excited about the acceleration of top line growth here, and there\u2019s a lot of opportunities and I think the continued growth and sequential growth momentum \u201918 over \u201917 should be accretive to the operating margins, not only for that business unit but for Abbott as well. Josh Jennings : Thanks. Just a follow-up one on nutrition. The food safety law took effect in China on January 1. I know it\u2019s very early, but can you help us think through what you\u2019re seeing initially and what you expect to see over the next couple of quarters in the pediatric China market, and also an update on nutritional pricing in the U.S.? Thanks for taking the questions. Miles White : I\u2019ll answer part of that and then I\u2019ll phone a friend here at the table. I\u2019d say first of all, I personally was concerned that this switchover in the food safety law, what we had to all do to comply with product labeling in a number of products and so forth, I was afraid it was going to be terribly disruptive, and it turns out we\u2019ve already experienced the disruption in the past two years as the market was flooded with many products and a lot of volume and a lot of channels and so forth. The single biggest issue we all had to deal with was reregister products and comply with the elements of the law, and all of our concerns were would we get our products through the regulatory bodies in China and be ready for that transition, and the answer is we made it. So you know, I think that, I\u2019m happy with. We\u2019ve been careful to monitor our inventories of previous product versus new product, etc., so to the extent that we can have visibility to that, I think we\u2019re comfortable with how that transition has gone. I think we\u2019re not seeing the kind of disruption that we might have or that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple years, so thus far I\u2019m glad we don\u2019t see unpredicted disruption, so hopefully we can now stabilize back into a more normal, call it competition in the market. It\u2019s a very, very dynamic market anyway in terms of channels and numbers of competitors and the intensity of competition and so forth. We didn\u2019t need the disruption of the food safety law, but I think that\u2019s stable and kind of behind us at this point. Brian or Scott? Brian Yoor : Sure. On the U.S. side, you asked about the price, and I would just say we\u2019ve never historically really relied on price. It\u2019s about volume, and we had a great year in our pediatric business in the U.S., and that\u2019s all about share capture in the infant milk formula market part of the pediatric business, with innovations that we introduced, and we want to continue staying to be a share leader there. But also, bright spots there in that pediatric portfolio are Pedialyte and Pediasure, which also have done quite well in the U.S. and are great brands for us. Then I think the story in the adult is we knew we had some adjustments to make. We\u2019re making the right adjustments. We know we have some innovations coming and we\u2019re seeing sequential improvement even here in the fourth quarter \u201917, and we want to continue to sustain that momentum and compete on share and market expansion on the adult, because we just typically hadn\u2019t relied on price in the U.S., or anywhere for that matter. Scott Leinenweber : We\u2019ve gained some share back in adult - that\u2019s nice to see. I think the team\u2019s done a terrific job in the ped market, and we remain the clear leader in that market. At this point, as Brian said, we\u2019re not relying on price. I think there\u2019s a clear value proposition to be marketed out there, and we haven\u2019t tried to stretch that, nor will we. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I\u2019ll just ask two quick product-related questions and drop. CRM, I think you grew about 2% in the fourth quarter. Is that how we should think about 2018, or do you think that could better? Then there was a question asked earlier on Confirm Rx, maybe just setting expectations, could you do, say, $50 million in 2018 on that product? Is that realistic? Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. Scott Leinenweber : Thanks Larry. Yes, I think on CRM, you\u2019re about right - we would expect something in the low single digits on that front. To your point, Confirm, really great opportunity. Obviously we\u2019re still early in the launch of that, first quarter. The feedback, though, we\u2019re getting from physicians on that one is very positive. This is the only device out there that\u2019s smartphone compatible, so there\u2019s a big benefit on the patient side of it as well. Your forecast on that one, I think seems reasonable as well. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Glenn Novarro : Hey, two quick questions me as well, and both are for Brian. Brian, the weaker U.S. dollar has become a tailwind to the top line. Does any of that fall to the bottom line, or is that completely hedged away - question one. Then number two, the lower tax rate for this year, is this a sustainable new run rate for the next couple years? Thanks. Brian Yoor : Sure. Let me take the exchange question. As always, it\u2019s early in the year, so we\u2019re reluctant to necessarily flow what\u2019s through there. It\u2019s a little modest. We know we have the hedge there, so we have a modest impact from the sales I quoted. You know, I think Miles has said this before - let\u2019s see how things go. If rates hold and things pan and history is an indicator, it\u2019s similar to last year, we may see some of those flow through; but I think it\u2019s just too early. There\u2019s a lot of events that we watch throughout the year. Go ahead, Miles. Miles White : Yes, let me just add one comment to that. As you plan a year, we all can calculate what we believe our tax reform impact is going to be given our geographic mix and so forth, as you know, and then there\u2019s exchange. If you\u2019re a multi-national, you\u2019ve got a lot of currencies to deal with. It\u2019s not so predictable. The exchange happens to us a lot of times, so we try to prepare for that with hedges. That said, going into the year, what we chose to do was say, listen, we\u2019re going to put some of the tax benefit from tax reform into the EPS, and we\u2019re going to put some of it into investment, as I described earlier, because that we can forecast, we can predict, it\u2019s knowable.  Exchange isn\u2019t so knowable, so if exchange continues to benefit us, there\u2019s really not enough time in a given quarter or year to reliably invest back the benefit of exchange, so the likelihood is if exchange runs better than we forecasted at this point, the investor is likely to see some of that. Obviously we hedge some of it to protect the stability of earnings, but you can\u2019t hedge it all, so if we are favorable, yes, you\u2019ll probably see it. Glenn Novarro : And on the tax rate? Brian Yoor : Sure. As I mentioned earlier, the range we got was 14.5 to 15% for \u201918. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts to tax reform. I\u2019d just note that regulations are still being formed, interpretations are ongoing, but from where we sit today, we believe we should generally be in the same ballpark of this range and we\u2019ll provide further updates as we learn more too, as the tax laws unfold here. Glenn Novarro : Okay. Thanks Miles, thanks Brian. Scott Leinenweber : Thanks Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Bob Hopkins : Thanks very much for fitting me in. Just two quick questions. One is on emerging markets. Just wanted to see what emerging market growth was in the quarter and if that accelerated in fourth quarter versus earlier in the year, and then what your outlook is for 2018 from an emerging market perspective, because it seems like things have been really going well in emerging markets generally. That\u2019s just the first question. Scott Leinenweber : Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair characterization. Generally when it\u2019s quiet, things are going good in emerging markets, and it\u2019s been fairly quiet. We did deliver double digit growth in emerging markets this quarter. To Miles\u2019 point, there\u2019s a lot of strong fundamentals in those markets that would point towards growth going forward. Bob Hopkins : Then the other one I wanted to ask about was just back on Freestyle Libre, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that you\u2019re bringing on 50,000 new customers, I believe you said a month. Miles White : A quarter. Bob Hopkins : A quarter? Okay, that makes-- Miles White : Yes, I\u2019m sorry if I misspoke. It\u2019s per quarter. Bob Hopkins : Okay, that makes more sense, but still a big number. I assume right now the majority of that obviously is outside the United States. Can you give us a sense as to the pace of your sign-ups in the U.S. and what you think for 2018 from a patient perspective for Libre in the U.S.? Scott Leinenweber : Yes, I would just say, look, we launched pretty much right at the end of the year. Obviously there was very modest sales in the fourth quarter number there. Without giving a number, I would say the strips are basically tracking right with our expectations. I think Miles had mentioned a quarter or so back when asked what a reasonable estimate for year one sales would be, and it was agreed upon it\u2019d probably be in the $50 million to $100 million range, and that\u2019s still where we sit today. Bob Hopkins : Okay, thank you very much. Scott Leinenweber : Very good. Well, thank you, Operator, and thank you for all your questions. That concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 am Central time today on Abbott\u2019s Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com and after 11 :00 am Central time via telephone at 404-537-3406, pass code 8277348. The audio replay will be available until 10 :00 pm Central time on February 7. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, through our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that first quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.  Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which adjusts the 2017 basis of comparison to exclude the impact of exchange and historical results for Abbott's Medical Optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017, as well as the current and prior years sales for Alere, which was acquired on October 3, 2017. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we reported the results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $0.59 at the high end of our guidance range and reflecting 23% growth. Sales increased 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, led by continued strong growth in Medical Devices and improving performance in our Nutrition business. Our full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.80 to $2.90 remains unchanged and reflects mid-teens growth at the midpoint. Back in January, I commented that we were entering the year with strong momentum, which has continued as we forecasted. Strong growth we're achieving is a direct result of the steps we've taken to position the company in the most attractive areas of health care as well as the outstanding productivity of our new product pipeline. I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Brian, and I'll start with diagnostics where we achieved sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter. We remain focused on accelerating the launch of our new Alinity systems in Europe where we've made good progress on test menu expansion and where we're seeing increasing competitive win rates. Diagnostics has been our most consistent growth business over the past several years, and Alinity is a highly differentiated platform which will build upon that strong track record for years to come. In Rapid Diagnostics, which we created in the fourth quarter of last year with the acquisition of Alere, we achieved sales of nearly $560 million, somewhat ahead of our expectations and partially due to the strong flu season in the United States. This is a very attractive area of diagnostics testing and our integration of this business into Abbott continues to go well as we put in place the building blocks to drive sustainable growth and margin expansion. In Nutrition, sales increased more than 4.5% in the quarter, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of improving performance. Sales growth this quarter was balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses. In Pediatric Nutrition, above-market growth in the U.S. was led by Similac, our leading infant formula brand. Internationally, performance improved across several countries and we continued to see stable market conditions in China following the implementation of a new food safety -- of new food safety regulations in that country at the beginning of this year. In Adult Nutrition, sales growth was led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands in both the U.S. and internationally. In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales growth of 7% was led by double-digit growth in India, China and Brazil. Our unique branded generics model was built to focus specifically on key emerging countries with socioeconomic and competitive conditions that provide a favorable environment for long-term growth. We serve each of these markets with a broad product offering tailored to address local needs. This unique and successful approach positions EPD to continue delivering superior performance in the fastest-growing pharmaceutical markets in the world. And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices where sales grew nearly 10%, led by strong growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care. In Electrophysiology, growth of 19% was led by market uptake of several recently launched products, including our EnSite Precision cardiac mapping system and Confirm, the world's first and only smartphone compatible insertable cardiac monitor which helps physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias. The first quarter [Audio Gap] by our market-leading portfolio, which includes several recently launched products that offer improved relief for patients suffering from chronic pain and movement disorders. I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care where sales grew over 30% in the quarter, driven by FreeStyle Libre, our highly differentiated sensor-based glucose monitoring system. Libre now has over 650,000 users across the globe which represents an unprecedented level of patient adoption in the industry. As we've discussed previously, we're investing significant capital to expand manufacturing capacity which will allow us to meet anticipated demand over the coming years. Libre offers a true mass-market opportunity with its unique combination of affordability, accessibility and ease-of-use, and we're positioning ourselves to maximize its impact. So in summary, as expected, the momentum we carried into the year has continued as reflected by our strong first quarter results. We continue to see significant growth contributions from a number of recently launched products across our portfolio and we're well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for the year, including top-tier sales growth and mid-teens EPS growth, as we continue to make investments to sustain our growth momentum into the future. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Okay. Thanks, Miles. And as Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with the guidance we provided back in January. Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 6.9% on an organic basis and exchange had a positive impact of 4.2% on sales. The favorable impact of exchange rates on sales this quarter was driven primarily by strengthening of the euro and other developed market currencies which considering our cost base and hedging program, has minimal fall-through and impact on our earnings. Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 33.2% of sales, all in line with our previous guidance. Turning to our outlook. For the full year 2018, we continue to forecast organic sales growth of 6% to 7%. And based on current rates, we expect exchange to have a favorable impact of a little more than 2% on full year reported sales with more than half of this impact driven by strengthening of the euro. In addition, we continue to expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, reflecting underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. Adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 30.5% of sales. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2018. We forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.70 to $0.72. We forecast organic sales growth of 6% to 7% and at current rates, would expect exchange to have a positive impact of a little below 3% on reported sales. In addition, we expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales of approximately $500 million in the second quarter. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 30.5% of sales. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide an overview of our second quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast double-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast a modest sequential improvement in sales growth of around 6%. And in Medical Devices, we forecast sales to increase mid to upper single digits, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Michael Weinstein : Let me start, if I can, on a couple of product launches. I was hoping you could provide some additional color on how the U.S. launches are going for both Libre and Confirm. And then second, the EPD business had a slightly weaker quarter this quarter than was expected. Brian commented in the second quarter guidance that he expects the business to rebound to double digits in the second quarter. So if you can just call out if there -- anything in particular that might have impacted the first quarter that you would view as one-time in nature. Miles White : Okay. Thanks for the question, Mike. And before I go into those answers, I'd like to take a minute and just acknowledge you as an analyst in our space for just the terrific job you've done over the years and acknowledge your change of career. We won't have you on these calls anymore, but you've always had great questions and you always hit the right points. And good luck to you in whatever you're going to do and we'll miss you here. Michael Weinstein : Thank you, Miles. Miles White : Let's start with Libre. The Libre launch, I'd say, has gone exceptionally well at the -- and is going exceptionally well. We obviously expected to keep going exceptionally well worldwide. As I mentioned, we're up to over 650,000 patients at this point. We're adding over 50,000 patients a month. We added about 150,000 just over that this last quarter. So if I look at the acquisition rate of patients, we expect to obviously be over 1 million patients at year-end and trending in a pretty healthy fashion. And then, I'm pretty gratified by that growth. It's true globally and I'd say in terms of color, the mix of patients is very strong. Our reimbursement is -- I think we're reimbursed at about 2/3 of all sales now internationally. That's strong. We keep getting reimbursement approvals in countries. I think that the value proposition of Libre, the affordability is particularly strong and appealing to patients as well as the performance, ease-of-use of the product and so forth. We get a lot of feedback that way. About 2/3 of the patient base are type 1 diabetics and about 1/3 are type 2 patients. So we've got -- we're seeing validation of the appeal and use of the product in both segments. We're investing a significant amount of capital in capacity expansion, anticipating that the growth legs on this product are going to be long because it's got a real mass-market appeal and fit. And there are, as you know, tens of million of diabetics and tens of millions of insulin-using diabetics, the majority of which are actually international. And in our case so far, the vast majority of our patients are international, but we're off to a strong start in the U.S. as well. At this point, we're a little over 50,000 patients in the U.S. and trending strong. And I think as far as starts go and continuations and expansions and so forth, I guess that's all good news. So we're running hard and the reception of patients here and abroad has been exceptional. I think that the opportunity in the category is quite large. And the category gets a lot of attention and for us is a future growth driver. We think it's pretty strong. I'm not sure what other detail to fill in, but nice thing is it's the kind of growth challenge you like to have, we are not having to overinvest in SG&A because the customers are our strongest marketers. And given social media and so forth, that's been a huge plus. So everything about it is doing really well. And I think we'll see this be a major growth driver for the company for quite a long time. With regard to Confirm, also off to a strong start. The -- we're capturing share, physician feedback has been very positive. It's a simple procedure. And I think one of the appeals, it is the only device that is smartphone compatible. It's a nice market opportunity and it's been a nice bump up in the growth rate. I know there's competition out there, there's competition in every category we're in and competition always makes you pay attention to innovation and next steps and next improvements and so forth. And I suspect we'll see response to the success of this product but in the meantime, doing quite well. And then finally, EPD. You know it falls into the category for me of it's always something. And given the focus on -- whether it's emerging or high-growth markets, we seem to have a given market that affects our EPD or even our Nutrition business from time to time somewhere. And in this particular case, it's Russia. And in the case of Russia, the market has been -- the market growth rate has been slowing. We still see that in our IMS data and so forth. As you know, we have 2 businesses in EPD there, the EPD brand and the Veropharm brand. The Veropharm brand has withstood that slowing market growth rate far better than the EPD brand because a lot of it is hospital-based whereas the EPD brand is more pharmacy-based. There's been a lot of expansion on pharmacies, but that doesn't mean that there's expansion of prescriptions. And so the overall market, I think, is one of temporary distribution channel dynamics as those pharmacies expanded. And that has now ceased to -- at that rate. And the market, I think, will stabilize in terms of distribution channels, outlets and so forth. But that's created a little disruption in that market temporarily. And that's all this is -- is that in Russia. And without Russia, we'd be in the 8.5% to 9% range as a business, and this would look healthier. So I'd say, you got that and then maybe a small dynamic in Mexico where we've seen a couple of distributors consolidate. And when distributors consolidate, there's a little more negotiating power and so forth. So we've seen a little bit of disruption in Mexico. But to be honest, that one hardly makes the radar screen of impacting the overall global growth of EPD. The biggest issue was this quarter Russia. I think we'll still see Russia impacting the numbers next quarter. So I'd say, we're probably going to look at the same kind of a number, particularly given the Russia impact next quarter, and then I think we'll start to see it turn. Michael Weinstein : That's good color. Miles, let me just ask one follow-up. So you grew 6.9% organic this quarter. Your guidance for the year is 6% to 7%. If there's probably a bigger-picture question people will have, it's on sustainability. So would you mind just spending a minute? It's obviously only April of 2018, but just -- could you just give us your thoughts on your ability to sustain this type of revenue growth. Miles White : Yes. I think, overall, I'd say this range of revenue growth we're going to sustain. I know that I indicated on the last call, I expect to be at the higher end of this. And each day that goes by, whether you have a Russia or a tweet or something that affects the expectations in the market, it adjusts. I'm less concerned about a couple of tenths of a point of growth and I'm less concerned about the details of each quarter. I mean, I pay attention to that because obviously it matters to investors. I'm much more concerned about the long-term sustainability of the overall growth trajectory of the company. And that, I'm pretty confident in. I'm not sure I can predict every quarter to the 10th. And -- but I would tell you that the overall sustainable growth of the company, I feel pretty confident about and particularly in this range for now for this year and beyond because there is so much new product launch and so much sustainable launch. I mean, just between the series of Alinity analyzers and Libre and the new products launched by our Medical Device groups, there's an awful lot of new product tracking here. And so -- and that's not just a temporal thing that goes a couple of months or a couple of quarters. Our objective was to make sure that we had really healthy, robust R&D pipelines and a good cadence of new product launches so we could sustain growth organically. And then, whether we ever do anything else opportunistically in M&A and so forth becomes purely that : opportunistic and very strategic. So I think with the underlying baseline, I'm pretty confident of the current sales trajectory of the company. And I think we've got some pretty solid validation points here with the performance of the new products that have launched that are quite visible, quite trackable, quite predictable to validate the growth prospects going forward. So whether it's 6.5%, 6.7%, 6.9% might vary quarter-to-quarter because lots of things happen quarter-to-quarter. But overall, I think that growth range is pretty doable. Operator : And our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Scott Leinenweber : [indiscernible] David's having some technical [indiscernible] [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : I wanted to start with Nutrition and then ask a couple of follow-up questions on Libre. Obviously, the bright spot here in the quarter was the acceleration in Nutrition. So Miles, can you talk about the sustainability of that? The International Pediatric Nutrition improved and also the Adult Nutrition business in the U.S. also improved. Those are areas that saw some challenges last year. And I was just curious as to why you're guiding to low to mid-single digits for Q2. And then I had a follow-up on Libre. Miles White : Okay. Let me deal with Nutrition first. I think for the long term, I'd be cautious about setting expectations much higher than low to mid-single digits in this business because markets around the world have slowed to a degree. They're not growing at as high a growth rate as they have historically. There are still healthy markets and I think particularly some international, call it, emerging markets and so forth still have some hefty growth opportunity. The -- but I think overall, when you put it altogether, it's probably a low to mid-single-digit business from a growth standpoint. It is profitable. It does generate a lot of cash and it is a fundamentally very strong and valuable business. So I'm happy about that. I would say that we've seen some sequential improvement because we've been attending to what I think have been adjustments to how we market, how we sell, adjusting to digital, digital channels or online channels and so forth in some markets where there's been a tremendous amount of distribution channel shift and change. China sticks out. But it's been true in a lot of places. So I think that it's a highly competitive business in a branded space. We've reacted to that pretty well. I give our U.S. team a lot of credit for how well they've done in the pediatric and adult space. It's extremely competitive and it's competitive in both pediatric and adults, not just pediatric in the U.S. And we will see from time to time a competitor try to pulse advertising or other things to take momentary share. But I think overall, we've not only sustained our position, but steadily grown it from a share standpoint. We certainly see that in the U.S. So I'm feeling pretty good about how the U.S. is doing overall. And in some markets where we've had some either competitive issues or just disruption like the disruption in China for the last 2 years over this change in food safety and so forth, the law, I think we've responded to that pretty well. And I think we're seeing that stabilize. As I said, we're making adjustments in how we market, what channels we go to, where the emphasis is. I think we've got some stability in China. But I would tell you, we also have a lot of ambition to do better competitively in China which we're getting our hands around. So right now, I think if we're able to see steady, stable growth in this business at the rate we're at or even sequential improvement going forward, that'd be pretty good. I wouldn't want to get out over the tips of my skis on that and predict a whole lot faster or higher. Right now, I'm happy that it's stable and headed north. Larry Biegelsen : That's very helpful. And then on Libre, clearly, the launch is off to a good start in the U.S. and the international numbers have been spectacular. But I think investors want to get some confidence about the sustainability of that. So I guess my question is, first, earlier in the year, you seemed comfortable with $50 million to $100 million for the U.S. in 2018. Is that still the case? And second, what can you say on the pipeline? I know you don't want to disclose much, but investors obviously want some visibility beyond 2018. Is there anything you can tell us to give investors confidence that there's more to come here? Miles White : More to come on Libre? Larry Biegelsen : On the pipeline. I mean, you have collaboration with Bigfoot, you're expected to deliver next-generation device to them with alarm, that kind of thing. So the pipeline and the sustainability. Miles White : Got it. Got it. Yes. Okay. So let me go back to your first question about the -- we previously said $50 million to $100 million of sales in year 1 seemed reasonable and so forth. Absolutely. And we'll be at the higher end of that range and we're tracking that way now. And it's very early in the year as you know, so yes, I have no concern about that at all. And let's just say, we're ahead of our expectations here. And you can see that in the growth rates and the numbers and the patient acquisition rates and so forth. I think we'll go out at the end of this year, $1 billion or more on run rate and 1 million patients or more. In fact, I think we're going to have well over 1 million patients at that point because our patient acquisition rate right now is pretty steady and rising. So yes, I think all of that is pretty reasonable. I'd validate that for you. And then with regard to pipeline, the product improvements and so forth, yes. I mean, as you know, we've got a pediatric claim in Europe. We'll have that in the U.S., that'll file this year. There's improvements, alarms and so forth that will be -- that's coming. I'm trying to think of all the things coming. But I would just say, yes, there's plenty coming and other dimensions of it in -- coming out of R&D that we'll have announcements for this year and next year. So there's a steady cadence of improvements, variations, claims, et cetera, in the product going forward that I think keep this going for a long time. Operator : And our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Okay. Can you hear me? Miles White : We can now. David Lewis : Perfect. Glad we got that fixed. So Miles, wanted to start with Diagnostics. Two things to focus on there and maybe a follow-up on the balance sheet. Two things, Alere to our model kind of recovered faster than, I guess, we expected. So can you talk about Alere recovery and how the integration is going? And then secondarily, Alinity and how you see the pipeline building there, U.S., ex U.S. throughout the balance of the year? Miles White : Yes. I'm just the making notes so I can remember all that okay. All right. I'll start with Alere. Yes. I'll tell you what, I'm really pleased with our management team. We've -- I'd say the integration, the bulk of hard work of the integration of that and St. Jude is pretty well complete. I mean, there's a lot of things we'll keep improving in both businesses over time, investments we want to make and so forth, but I think the notion of making it part of the company, getting everything under control, getting a management team established, getting strategies and directions established and so forth, that's all gone exceptionally well. We're on track with all our synergies. I think we've benefited. We've -- it's been a blessing there's been a particularly strong flu season. And a big chunk of Alere's business, probably 15% or so, Alere sales is seasonal and somewhat dependent on things like the flu season, it's not the flu season in particular. So we saw an obvious upshoot in our flu-related and strep-related testing and so forth from late fall into the winter, and that's clearly reflected in the numbers. That will vary from year-to-year depending on morbidity and the flu season and so forth. But some years it will probably be lighter. But this year it was particularly strong and that was a big plus. Now underlying that interestingly enough, as we've told you, and we think they have a lot of good product lines that were undermarketed. We've had increasing success with a number of those product lines and strategies. One of the things that's on our radar screen that we're working at and we want to put a lot more money into R&D, product refreshments, product improvements, that sort of stuff. That's a multiyear thing. That's not going to be next quarter kind of evidence. But I think we've got our hands around the commercial opportunities, there's places where we see room for correction, improvement, et cetera. But I think we've got the management team stabilized. I think it's financially stabilized. I think the uptick in sales, while largely driven in this particular period by the flu season, there's also underlying improvements in key product lines and key sales that I think are going really well that we're pretty, pretty happy about. Then Alinity... David Lewis : Okay. It is... Miles White : Yes. Go ahead. David Lewis : No, sorry. Just Alinity, yes. Miles White : Alinity. We've taken some pretty deliberate steps to dramatically tip up our launch activity. The -- with these large systems and their multitest menus, it's really important to have full or nearly full menus at launch because customers when they switch over a lab or switch over given instruments and so forth, want to be able to switch all the tests on that product and not to have to run 2 different systems and so forth. And we're sort of hitting stride now on the completion or breadth of the menu offerings, particularly Europe, U.S. is coming along, et cetera. Our blood screening system, Alinity s, has a full menu, that's up. So we've got some pretty ambitious plans about not only conversion of the existing install base, but share capture and account capture. I would say about 15% of accounts come up for renewal or contracting each year. So this will be a fairly steady multiyear rollout and trend. But if I -- I track things like our prospect list or prospect bank, how many prospects, how many actively in the sales process, what's our win rate with existing accounts, what's our win rate with new accounts and I'd say, the magnitude of the prospect banks and accounts that we're in has increased about sixfold. And our win rate in our existing accounts is extremely high, up in the -- well over 90% category, which you'd expect because we've got happy customers and they're always easier to sell to than new ones. But our win rate in new accounts is quite high also. And so that's been pretty gratifying. And that's -- so far, Europe [ end ] is evidence. And so we're investing in expansion of sales force and expansion of installation, service teams, expansion of support. It's well underway and it's going well. So we're pleased. David Lewis : Okay. Miles, very clear. And then just a quick one from me. I think a lot of commentary this morning on growth drivers, but one of the big successes for us this year is debt pay down. It looks like you could be at 1.5, 2 turns net debt to EBITDA by the end of the year. I just wonder how capital priorities could change towards the end of the year. And do you have capacity for sort of growth-oriented M&A towards the back half of the year? Miles White : Yes. In terms of debt, we paid down $6 billion already this year, it's April. And we -- I'd say we expect to pay down another $2 billion before year-end. And cash flows are strong. We've paid a lot of attention to that because it is our intent to bring our debt down. As you know, when we completed these 2 acquisitions, we had about $28 billion in gross debt, and we're already at $22 billion and we'll be $20 billion or a little lower at year-end. That will put us at about 2x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, not 1.5, but 2. And I still think that's pretty healthy, and it's a pretty rapid rate of pay down on the debt. So the -- do you start to change your capital priorities at that point? As -- I can tell you right now, we think the dividend is important for a category of our investors, and we like to target our dividend in 40% of EPS to maybe a little more than 40% of EPS range, 40% to 45% of earnings. And we like to maintain that range and we've been steadily raising the dividend. And I think that remains a priority. Obviously, debt pay down remains a priority. But we're in a -- we're getting rapidly to a very healthy range and healthy balance. Would we keep paying down debt? We would. And yet I think to answer your point, will we have capacity if we choose to? We would. But I would tell you right now, that's not my priority. And we're not looking at M&A. We're not looking at anything. It's not in our priority list just now. I do want to keep paying down debt, do want to pay a healthy dividend. And frankly, we've got some organic capital opportunities here internally both between the launch of Alinity and the capacity expansion with Libre that are worthwhile. And I don't see that impinging on us so much that it squeezes us. We have the flexibility you refer to. And of course, as we get into '19, we clearly have flexibility. But right now, I don't feel constrained, but I also don't have anything on the radar screen that I'm particularly interested in pursuing because we've got so much organic growth opportunity as it is. And I'm feeling pretty good about the debt balance, feeling pretty good about the ability to fund our internal needs, our dividend, all of those things. We're in a good spot. Operator : And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Frederick Wise : Miles, just a big question to start off with. Maybe you could talk a little bit about your internal investing priorities. It seems SG&A stepped up a little higher than I might have thought. You're clearly investing in R&D, and you've highlighted some topics, Libre, Diagnostics. But maybe where are your priorities more broadly? And do you see that extra investment or that extra opportunity to investment as sustaining or accelerating the kind of 6% to 7% organic growth outlook you're talking about? Miles White : Rick, I don't have an investment at Abbott that doesn't think they can use more money or a business at Abbott. It's actually a good problem to have. They all believe with more sales and marketing expense and resources that they can expand faster, run faster, et cetera. And of course, there's always kind of a prudent balance to that. But I'd say we're kind of lucky. We've got a lot of things that are launching, a lot of new product opportunities and we've got some market expansion opportunities in EPD and so forth. So -- and the combination of it is, adding sales reps, adding service and support and increasing our penetration in a number of places. So we're very fortunate I think with Libre in particular that it's not as sales and marketing intensive from an expense standpoint as you might think. We get a lot of benefits. It's extremely, let's say, productive, what I'll call the digital world, social media world, et cetera, the places that I think would benefit from a lot more resource. Obviously, there's various device areas that would, but you also got -- make sure you've got the product ready to go and so forth. So we've got a nice steady pipeline. I'd like to put more money behind it. And Nutrition, it depends. It's dependent on given countries and given channels. It's more selective. Would I put more money behind it? Yes, I think so. I think our spend rate could stand to improve in some areas of Nutrition. I think it could stand to improve in EPD. If I put more behind Libre, I don't know. I mean, the growth rate right now is pretty hefty. So the good news is we're always going to be in this balance between how much we beat earnings by and how much we feedback into the business. And what I've tried to do over the years is find the balance there, a balance for the investor and a balance for the business to keep sustaining it and keep up with it. We watch on a percent of sales basis and where our opportunities are. I think right now, I'm going to put a lot more into Alinity. And because I think that clearly gets a bit of a boost and it's labor intensive. So I know that's a bit of a ramble, but the good news is I don't have a problem figuring out where to put money. It's a bigger challenge at making sure I always keep the balance between what the investor would like to see and what we keep plowing back into the business because I know you guys want to see sustained growth. I'm confident we have sustained growth and then it's just a question on how hard to push on the gas pedal. Frederick Wise : Got you. And just last from me, that, on a more focused basis. Maybe you'd reflect a little bit about the current dynamics in cardiac rhythm management, CRM. The business was flat this quarter. We had assumed a low single-digit growth. Your portfolio's filled out. I assume you were -- did well on the de novo side, maybe not so well on the replacement side. But just -- what's the outlook from here? What are you expecting? Is this -- can this business grow? And just how are you thinking about this longer term? Miles White : Yes. Thanks for the question. The business can grow. And you're exactly right, that's a tale of 2 different situations, the de novo and the replacement. We're doing very well in de novo, to be honest. And that's pretty gratifying. And it's a little slower in replacement for a reason that some of that got pulled forward when there was a battery issue a couple of years ago. So a lot of that replacement got pulled forward. So it's a little bit out of the sync of the normal rate of sales that come from replacement versus sales that come from de novo. So I do think that's kind of a temporary phenomenon while we move out of that zone. But the de novo side is quite robust, and I'm pretty happy about that. So as we move forward, do I think this business grows more than 1% or 2%? I think it can. So -- and I think we see that evidence and we've given that attention. I also think we've got a lot of opportunity in Electrophysiology. I mean, there's parts of this business that whether it's stents or CRM, they're lower growth rates because they're mature and established markets. And you say to yourself, can you grow these at a little healthier growth rate than 1% or 2%? In both cases, yes. Our Vascular business was slower this quarter. We lost a couple of share points in the United States over the last few quarters. And yet with the approval and launch of XIENCE SIERRA in the United States, I think that changes. So we've got plans. You run your more legacy and mature businesses one way and your new product launches another way, but you can't ignore the large, established positions you've got in CRM and stents and so forth. And we're not, we're not. It does go up and down with different competitive launches or improvements and so forth from time to time. It pulses a little here and there. But we believe we can drive CRM and our vascular stent business at better rates than we see right now. The CRM numbers you see are exactly the anomaly you called out between de novo and replacement. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Christopher Pasquale : One question on Libre and then one on the Neuro business. First, can you give us any color on who's using Libre in the U.S. today? And I'm thinking in particular about how the patients you onboarded so far break down in terms of type 1 versus type 2 and then CGM naive versus competitive wins. Miles White : Yes. Okay. I'm going to have Scott take that question for you. Go ahead, Scott. Scott Leinenweber : Yes. I would say in terms of the mix, it generally as best we can tell, it's a little bit harder with data in the U.S. than some of what we get out of Europe because we sell a lot through our web shop in Europe. But we're getting -- we estimate around 2/3 type 1 and 1/3 type 2 in the U.S. just like we are internationally. We think that would hold. And we're also getting -- we feel a nice balance of competitive wins versus people that are trying CGM for the first time and expanding that overall category. So a nice balance kind of across both dimensions. Christopher Pasquale : Okay. And then Neuro continues to be a really strong segment for you. Last year, you actually became the market share leader in the SCS space in the U.S. I'm curious with all the focus on the opioid epidemic in the country right now and pain management in general, do you see an opportunity to move spinal cord stimulation up the treatment continuum to reduce the dependence on drug therapy for those patients? Scott Leinenweber : Yes. I would say -- look, that has been a great space for us and we're now the #1 player in chronic pain. So certainly, we have a great portfolio, and that's playing out with physicians and with patients and they're seeing great results and whatnot in the real world. So I do think that, that category continues to expand. I think it will take some market development certainly with respect to reimbursement and guidelines and things of that nature. So it may build itself over time. It's not going to be a spike. But certainly, we feel that's a really nice space longer term. Operator : And our final question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Miles, I have two questions on China. The first is relating to all this tariff noise that we're hearing. Abbott has a major presence in China, but I don't believe you manufacture a lot in China and then send manufactured product back to the U.S. So maybe can you discuss the impact of any of these tariff threats between the U.S. and China on your sales and EPS? And then the second question is on China nutritionals which did perform better than our expectations. Is China recovering sooner than you expected and why? Miles White : Let me take that one first. No, it's not recovering sooner than I expected. I expected it earlier than this. But I'm glad that it is it stabilized now. I think we expected stability much sooner than this. But we're there now. So I think we've got a reasonably stable predictable market. Are we doing as well as we'd like? Well, we'll see that over time here. We're doing better, but I'd like to do better than better. So there's still room to go to improve performance and improve share gain, improve channel shift and so on. But yes, I wouldn't tell you that this is ahead of my expectations or whatever because mine may have been running a little ahead of where we are. Then with regard to production in China, I hate to disabuse you of this notion, but we do produce in China. And we do bring product to the U.S. from China. And that happened because Alere produced a lot in China or at least a reasonable amount. So what we manufacture in China that is exported from China or imported to the U.S. is almost entirely diagnostic products in the Alere acquisition. And so there could be some impact financially on that if something were to happen from a tariff standpoint. We have done that analysis. And ironically, we've got a lot of business in China. We export a lot to China. We do manufacture infant nutrition in China as it is. So we've got a balance. We've got a balance of things that we manufacture, import, export, et cetera. When we net out the impact of potential tariffs, the tariffs we might experience exporting to China or into China are minimal. The tariffs we would experience coming back to the U.S. from products manufactured in China are where the impact would be. And I would say that based on everything I've seen so far, total magnitude of impact on us if it were to happen at all, about $0.01. And so we think we've got a highly manageable circumstance if what we've seen and estimated and the degree of tariff, tariff rates, products they apply it to and so forth, about $0.01. And so I put that in the category of I'm always solving for $0.01 somewhere. So that's a manageable outcome. Scott Leinenweber : Very good. Well, thank you, operator. And thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, through our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.   Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.   On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which adjusts to 2017 basis of comparison to exclude the impact of exchange and historical results for Abbott's Medical Optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017 as well as the current and prior year sales for Alere, which was acquired on October 3, 2017. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.73, above our previous guidance range. We also raised our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.85 to $2.91, which now reflects 15% growth at the midpoint. All 4 of our businesses exceeded expectations in the quarter and contributed to 8% organic sales growth overall, above our previous guidance range. Over the past several years, we've executed a very deliberate strategy of shaping our portfolio, both adding and pruning. At the same time, we've also invested organically in growth areas that have resulted in game-changing technologies such as FreeStyle Libre and Alinity. These steps have created leadership positions in attractive areas in health care, where innovation makes a big difference for the customers we serve and consequently for our performance. The strong results we're achieving are a direct result of this strategy. Over the past 4 quarters, we've averaged more than 7% organic sales growth, a true differentiator for a company our size. And with synergies from recent acquisitions and our focus on margin expansion, we're able to fully fund our growth opportunities while at the same time, growing earnings significantly faster than sales. We continue to forecast strong performance for the remainder of the year, as evidenced by the fact that we're raising our full year earnings guidance despite the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Clearly, we'd be raising guidance a bit higher if based solely on the underlying performance of our business. I'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning the call over to Brian. I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 6.5% in the quarter, including 8% international growth in our core laboratory business. The pace of our Alinity launch in Europe continues to accelerate, driven by strong competitive win rates and even stronger retention rates. This business, which is already a global leader and growing faster than its market, is well positioned for sustainable growth for years to come as we capture share and roll out the full suite of Alinity systems across additional geographies, including the U.S. In Rapid Diagnostics, second quarter sales were driven by infectious disease and cardiometabolic testing. The management team has done an excellent job integrating and stabilizing the business, identifying and realizing synergies and implementing strategies to drive long-term growth. In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where we built leading positions in the fastest-growing pharmaceutical markets in the world, sales grew more than 12% in the second quarter. EPD continues to execute its unique strategy and is growing faster than the market in several of its priority countries, including India and China. Our focus on enhancing the depth and breadth of our product portfolios and local capabilities continues to strengthen our position and long-term growth opportunities across these markets. In Nutrition, sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance across our international business. We've now achieved several consecutive quarters of improving performance for this business. In Adult Nutrition, growth was led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands, most notably internationally, where we saw double-digit growth. In Pediatric Nutrition, strong performance was led by balanced growth across several countries in Asia, including Greater China and Latin America. And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew more than 8%, led by strong double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In Electrophysiology, growth of 22% was led by our advanced cardiac mapping and ablation portfolio as well as Confirm, the world's first and only smartphone-compatible insertable cardiac monitor. During the quarter, we further strengthened our product portfolio in the U.S. with the launch of our Advisor HD catheter, which includes a first of its kind configuration to create highly detailed maps of the heart. In Structural Heart, strong growth across several areas of our portfolio was led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive repair of mitral heart valve. Earlier this month, we received U.S. FDA approval for our next-generation version of MitraClip, which includes design enhancements and an additional clip size to enable more patients to be treated. In Vascular, during the quarter, we received FDA approval for XIENCE Sierra, the newest generation of our leading coronary stent system, which will enhance our competitiveness in the U.S. market. And we also received national reimbursement for XIENCE Sierra in Japan during the quarter. Lastly, in Diabetes Care, sales grew over 30% for the third consecutive quarter, driven by FreeStyle Libre, our highly differentiated sensor-based glucose monitoring system. Libre offers a true mass-market opportunity with its unique combination of affordability, accessibility and ease of use, and it's achieving a level of patient adoption that's unprecedented in the industry with more than 800,000 current users globally. So in summary, this was another very good quarter as we execute on our strategic priorities. All 4 of our businesses exceeded expectations for the quarter and contributed strong growth overall. And lastly, we started the year with strong double-digit EPS guidance. And despite recent currency shifts, today, we're raising our outlook even higher based on the strength of our underlying performance. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 8% on an organic basis, above our previous guidance range. Sales in Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired late last year and is therefore not included in our organic sales growth results, achieved sales of $484 million. Exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1.7% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen versus several currencies, resulting in a less favorable impact on our sales this quarter compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 7.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 30.7% of sales. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018. Based on our strong performance and momentum, we're increasing our organic sales growth forecast to 6.5% to 7.5%. At current exchange rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 50 basis points on full year reported sales, which would be around 170 basis points lower than expectations based on exchange rates in April. In addition, we continue to expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, which includes underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat below 30.5% of sales. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2018. We forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.73 to $0.75. We forecast organic sales growth of mid- to high single digits. And at current rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 2% on reported sales. And in addition, we expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales of approximately $500 million in the third quarter. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide an overview of our third quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid- to high single-digit sales growth, which takes into consideration our strong third quarter results last year when quarterly sales patterns in India were impacted by the implementation of the new tax system in that country. In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digits growth for the third quarter and are increasing our full year forecast for 2018 to mid-single digits as well. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid- to high single-digits sales growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for the third quarter and are increasing our full year forecast for 2018 to high single digits as well, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Miles, 2 dynamics that really stand out to us this quarter in addition to, obviously, the stronger organic number. Just international Nutrition recovery and obviously, the Libre progression. So can you just give us some details on sort of the drivers of Nutrition acceleration, the sustainability in the back half of the year? And then Libre, where it is relative to your plan and your comfort with maybe $100 million number in U.S. Libre this year, and I had a quick follow-up. Miles White : Okay. In the Nutrition business, I'd say, first of all, we're pleased with the success in performance. It's across the board. It's not in any one place. We've been through pretty detailed reviews and plans by geographic area and so forth. A lot of times, we're talking about Nutrition in terms of either the U.S. or China. In this case, it's actually not concentrated that way. It's really across the board in all the countries we're in. So I'm pretty pleased to see a uniform increase in performance and our plans taking hold and working in a lot of countries internationally. And like a lot of things, it's small things and a lot of them in coordination, blocking and tackling and just doing a better job with our marketing, our positioning in products and so forth. So as far as sustainability goes, I feel like this business ought to be able to perform in a, call it, low to mid-single-digit range on a fairly sustainable basis. And if we can stay in the range we're in, that's pretty good. I feel pretty good about that. And it's up and down depending on promotions and given geographic areas from time to time. We'll see a competitor put on a heavy promotion in something like adult nutrition in the U.S., and it goes away. Share doesn't change much in that case. But long-term sustainable growth here. We continue to maintain our position as the market leader and even advance it in a number of cases. So I feel like it's pretty solid and look forward to it staying at a, call it, a mid-single-digit level. With regard to Libre, we can't be anything but pleased. It's going extremely well. We're on track with where we want to be in terms of patient acquisition and growth, et cetera. We have nothing to compare us to. No real market dynamics to compare ourselves to other than the acquisition of patients, and we expect to go out of the year with over 1 million patients, which is unprecedented and unseen. We think this is a mass-market sort of a product as opposed to a very niche-y medical device type product because there are so many people that are either insulin-dependent or trying not to be insulin-dependent. And so I think the opportunity here remains enormous. I think the growth is quite sustainable. There's quite a lot more to do to keep enhancing not only the product, the offering, the market, so forth. We like the mix of patients we're getting. We like the geographic mix. We like the geographic advancements. The reimbursement has been very good. Just about everything about this is going better than planned. So I think this is one of the key big sustainable growth drivers of the company, along with the system family Alinity in the diagnostic area. We got a number of growth drivers here. Either big innovative products like this or a collection of, call it, smaller innovative niches like we've got in \u2013 a niche is probably, to describe it, too small, but a lot of places where innovation makes a big difference in medical devices. And then you've got market growth. And in spite of the volatility at currencies with -- that affect our pharmaceutical or Nutrition business, the underlying market still had very strong growth. And I -- so I think all of our growth drivers look very reliable for the long term. David Lewis : All right. And just another quick focus for me was the neuromod focus for the quarter. I mean, you're kind of anniversarying some fairly explosive growth in that business. But can you just discuss the relative change in neuromod growth this quarter, the drivers of it, what you're doing to address it? And do you believe this portfolio can get back to market growth? Miles White : Yes, good question. I think you've got a couple of things going on here, one of which you observed. Explosive growth last year, which is actually interesting part of the problem, I think this was a bit of a self-inflicted wound. We did -- this is a business where the business is very dependent on the involvement of the representative, the sales representative, et cetera, not only with the physician but also with the patients. And we did not expand our sales force in concert with the rate of explosive growth we experienced. And when we finally did expand our sales force recently, it turns out to be pretty disruptive to do that the way we did it. And I'd say the issue we created for ourselves was disruption in our own sales here with the additions of new salespeople and new service people in the field and so forth. You recut territories, you have a lot of training and so forth. So I think we've added to our comp issue here. So do I think it gets back to market growth? Yes, absolutely. I think this is a temporary condition created by us. It will be fixed by us, and we'll figure out how to successively expand our sales force in concert with our growth in a, let's just call it a much smoother fashion in the future. I think we did this to ourselves. Operator : And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : So it looks like based on the guidance, you're forecasting similar growth in the second half once -- adjusting for the Indian GST benefit that we saw in EPD in the first half. So I guess my question is, Miles, why do you feel confident you can sustain similar underlying growth in the second half given that the comps get significantly tougher in the second half? And I had a follow-up. Miles White : Well, first of all, the underlying dynamics of our markets underlying are pretty strong. Our single biggest, I guess, forecastable -- or not forecastable concern, is currency. And I think you're going to hear that from a lot of companies. I think we're all seeing a stronger dollar. And in our case, I'll speak for us, we have a significant portion of our business in high-growth markets, most of which are unhedgeable currencies and are volatile currencies, emerging markets, et cetera. And we like the growth and we like the underlying trends and dynamics of those markets, and I think those have proven to be pretty robust and beneficial. But they also come with the unpredictable volatility of currency from time to time. So as I said in my opening remarks, we'd probably be raising guidance even further here, but for currency headwinds that we see for the remainder of the year. And having been through this cycle a number of times, you're always cautious about the second half of the year until you get to about now and see what the currency is doing because the first half of the year, you think you know what it's going to do, but you really can't predict that far out. And it's clearly made a big change since the first quarter. So we've absorbed a fair bit of that negative currency headwind already, and we'll probably end up absorbing more here in the second half. But we think we've got a pretty good handle on what we face. But the underlying dynamics of the real business are all pretty good. Now that said, things never go exactly like you except them to go. And you take a business like our pharmaceutical business, it's lumpy. It's got -- if you've got a year with GST or other factors that create oddball comparables from year later quarters and so forth, you're automatically going to be lumpy the following year again. So in a business that has a mix of emerging markets, it's almost always up-down, up-down, up-down. The good news is even when it's down, the growth rate is still pretty high. So we go from a good growth rate to a great growth rate, to a good growth rate back and forth because it's a bit volatile. One -- last quarter, it was some dynamics in Russia. This quarter, it's comparables to GST. We'll probably have the same thing because, as you recall, that created a sequential quarter comparable issue in the EPD business last year. So we're going to see ups and downs that way in some of these businesses. And like you guys, our first question is, is there something fundamental about the performance of the business, the performance of the market? Or have we just got timing dynamics or volatility dynamics and so forth? The underlying growth rates in EPD remain very strong across our collection of emerging markets. So I think we tend to look at it that way. We address everything we see. I think we're going to see ups and downs here in a lot of these businesses. Look, we see neuromod at a slower growth rate this quarter, as David just pointed out. Do I think the underlying growth dynamics of that market are somehow unattractive? Absolutely not. That market remains very attractive. And do I think we'll do well in it? Yes, we'll do really well in it. But next year, we'll be referring back to this quarter from a comparable standpoint and so forth. So I am quite confident that what I see in the underlying trends of each of these businesses is pretty good. I'm very pleased with Nutrition, very pleased with the acceleration in Alinity, in Diagnostics. I'm pleased with the steady ramp, which only gets better and better with Libre. And those are big, big growth drivers across the board. So while they may go up and down a couple of percentage points here and there, the underlying overall growth rate is pretty strong. And like I said earlier, we'll probably raise guidance further, but for the concern about exchange. Larry Biegelsen : That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I had to follow up on David's question. Within med tech, there was some pockets of strength like Diabetes and Electrophysiology, but there were a couple of soft spots, like CRM. You've already addressed Neuromodulation and Heart Failure. So any more color on CRM and Heart Failure, how we should be thinking about those segments in the second half of the year? Miles White : Yes, there's a couple of dynamics going on with CRM. That one gets a fair amount of my attention, I would tell you. First of all, we got a little bit of a tough comparison to last year because we launched the low-voltage MRI-compatible products then and obviously, had stocking dynamics in the second quarter and so forth. But beyond that, there's also sort of an underlying battery replacement timing thing going on here because when St. Jude, prior to us in '15, '16, had its battery issues, it pulled forward a lot of replacements and -- to replace those batteries. And so you see fewer replacements now because they were pulled forward. Whereas, in the de novo segment, where we got new patients, we're doing extremely well. So when you kind of take it apart, you look at it and say, \"Well, if we're right about our diagnosis and analysis here, we should see this pick up in the future with a bit of a tailwind once we get past this replacement phenomenon relative to 2016.\" So we've looked at that. I think for the rest of this year, we're probably flat in CRM, but that's not a satisfactory position for us. So my expectation is we keep improving the growth rate here. We're not happy with what the growth rate looks like, but we think we understand why. With regard to Electrophysiology and others, geez, they're doing great, as you pointed out. Heart Failure, we need a destination therapy claim, and I think we're going to be in great shape. I think it's that simple. Operator : And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : I just have 2, one kind of big picture and one on a divisional level. From a big picture perspective, I think you guys have been very clear on the topic of durable revenue growth. I have a question on durable earnings growth. And the reason I ask the question is that your earnings growth has obviously been running well above your targets. As we go forward, if you're successful in driving the kind of revenue growth you think you can drive in this business, what does a durable earnings growth outlook look like for the company? Is it closer to 15% than 10%? Just any thoughts on that topic would be appreciated. Miles White : Many times in these calls, somebody tries to get me to forecast future earnings growth, and I think we start every year with a goal of, in fact, even a long term of double-digit earnings growth. And that -- you might say, well, that sort of backs you into 10% or 9.999% or whatever. And we don't necessarily hit it every single year, but pretty darn close. In some years, it's a lot more than that. So I would tell you that our overall strategy is we want to grow at a double-digit rate. Otherwise, difficult to call yourself a growth company. We got a lot of pieces in this company. We've tried to position it in growth markets, growth segments, growth products, innovative areas and so forth. And we also have some extremely profitable cash-generating legacy businesses that grow slower, but they're still growth. And those businesses, we do look for incremental growth and the kind of delivery of profit that's above the sales growth rate. And overall, that mix has to deliver that double-digit target for us, which is why we've shaped the company as we have over the last 6 years to add growth and prune away some things that may not fit us over the long term. We've tried to put ourselves in the right geographic markets, the right innovative spaces, the right growing health care areas and so forth so -- we've talked about. So -- and we always look for leverage on the bottom line by improvements in margin, gross margin, even our spending efficiency and so forth. So I don't know that I can predict whether it's 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%. But I can tell you, we start every year with the presumption, that's our identity, that's our hallmark, that's the mix of our businesses, that's the mix of our products. And we build our product strategies and business strategies to deliver that. There's a lot of things that change, as you know, over the course of the year. A year never goes quite like you expect it to go. And I'm eliminating exchange for a minute here, even just the dynamics of markets, trade, whatever it may be, new product approvals or delays, et cetera. So we got a lot of moving parts. And I think that as a mix of businesses, we've got a really robust, strong, powerful mix of innovative, profitable businesses. We're in a really great new product cycle of launches. Every piece of this has a nice, sustainable long term ahead of it here. And the businesses, you can see the evidence of it growing. So beyond that, I'm not sure I can predict more accurately for you what it's going to be other than we put a lot of growth drivers here. We're not organically getting a lot of growth out of the Alere business this year, as you know, because we're settling that in, but I'm really pleased with its performance. It's above our expectations. And we haven't even begun to see how that's going to deliver for us in the coming years. So I just look at the way we're managing the delivery of the various pieces of our business. We always got a lot of shots on goal here and a lot of products to expand. So I'd tell you, our goal is always double digits. And beyond that, I'm not ready to tell you how many double digits for next year. Robert Hopkins : Fair enough. But I appreciate the detailed answer. And then one other thing I wanted to touch on really quickly was just if there's one business that seems like it's really done better than you thought at the beginning of the year, it's maybe nutritionals. So I was wondering if you could just talk about what's driven the improvement and how sustainable that is. Miles White : Well, I think I'll go back to there's no one thing. Our markets are all a little different. You'd think that infant formula and Ensure wouldn't be that complicated, but it actually is at some level. And the dynamics of each market are a little different. And some -- we've got, in some ways, the same multinational competitors in most of our geographies, but even they don't have the same strategies or even the same products in every market. And then there's always a lot of local or regional competitors. And in a country like Vietnam, we had a very strong state competitor there in Vinamilk. A fine company, and they execute very well. They happen to be really strong in rural areas. We happen to be very strong in big cities. That's a dynamic that's unique to Vietnam. The dynamics we face in the Middle East or other markets in Asia are different. It's -- so it's no one thing, I'm afraid. We can try all those consultant 4-box matrices to sort of say all of these countries are like this and put them in the upper left-hand corner box and so on. But even doing that, that's artifice. It's -- each country is a little different. I'd say, overall, we needed to improve several things. The focus of our products. You can have too many. You can have too few. But you got to have certain ones, you got to have certain innovations, you got to have certain ingredients, and you got to have marketing that appeals to the consumers and/or physicians or hospitals that you're trying to appeal to. It's a little tailored to each market. We literally went country by country, call it, top 15 countries and went through a detailed analysis and new strategies and so forth. You say, well, \"Was there a lot of management change?\" Actually, not. In a few places, yes, but not that many. It's really us and our execution, and we took that bar up and it shows. It shows. We've got a pretty strong business there. I think we slipped off the rail a little bit for a while. And I'm pleased to see that the top management, which -- some of which is new, has established pretty good direction for each of the major geographies now. And beyond that, it gets to be a lot of little details that you got to execute better. We've seen a lot of channel change. We've seen a huge impact of online or digital marketing, digital shipment, et cetera, as channels. We've seen specialized channels of all baby stores and so forth. We've -- so we've -- I think we were slow to adjust and adapt to that. I think others did it faster than we did, and we got left behind. We now understand what we missed. We understand what we needed to do about it. And we've either done it or we're doing it, and it clearly shows and makes a difference. So I think we had to be pretty honest with ourselves about mistakes we'd made or things we'd missed. And now we're correcting that with a vengeance and running hard here. So I think the execution is a lot better. Operator : And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Miles, 2 questions on Libre. First, can you give us a little bit more color on the U.S. rollout and where you are with commercial coverage? And are you still comfortable with your Libre guidance for the year, which, in the U.S., I think is $90 million to $100 million? And then I had a follow-up. Miles White : Yes. A real quick answer to that, yes, we're absolutely comfortable with the guidance for the year. I'd -- we're on track, Glenn. It's -- yes, I'd like to go even faster. As I've said before, we're even investing heavily in capacity expansion and so forth to anticipate even greater growth in the future. And I -- it's -- there's really nothing to compare it to. There's -- I think the whole space is getting increasing attention. And we have, as you know, carved out a very economic position that's extremely profitable for us, but we're in a very, let's call it, economically accessible price point, which has made the uptake and the reception by the patient or the consumer or even reimbursing bodies pretty attractive. And I think we found a real value proposition point here with the product. Our manufacturing is extremely automated. It gives us a big advantage in terms of cost. And everything is kind of working well here. I'm pretty excited about this product. This -- it's got so much potential because I think a lot of times, whether it's a pharmaceutical or medical device, et cetera, they can be expensive in the health care system for recovery of cost and so forth because the numbers of patients may not be that great. And yet, there's a lot of diabetics in the world, including me. And there's millions that are insulin-dependent and millions that don't want to be insulin-dependent, et cetera. This product hits the sweet spot. And to be a mass-market product, it's got to be accessible. It's got to be affordable. And it's got to be affordable in a way that it's not hard for people to commit to it, use it and find out what it can do for them and so forth. So I'd say that's all going super. We like the split we're seeing of type 1s versus type 2s. We're probably globally about 2/3 type 1s and 1/3 type 2s. I think that's a pretty good mix, and it speaks to the clinical efficacy and the benefits of the products and the 2 different types of users that benefit from it. So at this point, it's all about how fast can we run. And I think the uptake by consumers, the retention, the repeat, all that, all of our data says this is going well. And as I indicated to you, we'll go out at the end of the year with more than 1 million patients worldwide, a significant number in the U.S. I think we'll probably be -- well, we are so far and away the global leader in this space now. It's almost -- there's no way to kind of look at share. We've looked at, what you call, sensor days. How many -- if you take the sensors, numbers of patients, whatever, and how many days of testing you get out of that, we're already well above 90% globally. And it's -- there's nothing to compare to. It's -- and it's a huge market. So I think that just the opportunity here -- we're comparing to us and how fast we can run. And that's really an exciting product, I'll say. It's nice to see a product that has that kind of impact, and this one is just fun. It's just fun. Glenn Novarro : And then let me just one quick follow-up. Can you discuss what's next in terms of features for Libre and timing? Miles White : I could, but I'm probably going to -- I'm probably not going to set any expectations around that because I don't want to create trigger points or talking points or whatever -- catalyst. I don't know all the terms you guys like to use. There are a number of things that we have planned in place, done the work, et cetera, for enhancements to the product, obvious ones, some of which are already available overseas. It's a little different challenge working through the FDA here in this country. And so I don't want to get into the space, but -- or the discussion. But yes, we got plenty of enhancements and thoughts here for advancing the product still further, Glenn. Operator : And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Frederick Wise : Maybe starting off with a big picture question. You, in some of your earlier comments, sort of lightly touched on this. But when we think about your priorities right now, should we imagine that you're focused, now that everything is coming along, should we expect you to be largely focused just on continued execution with the portfolio you have? Or do you think the portfolio is in good shape as it exists? Or are you thinking about not just M&A? And of course, I'm always interested in hearing about your interest in opportunistically adding technology or inorganic growth. But with your existing portfolio, are you more -- now more aggressively looking at the pieces you have and thinking you might be more actively thinking about trading out, the net benefit of which would be to enhance growth and/or margin? Both ways, in and out. Miles White : I get this question in one form or another on every call and every visit to investors and so forth, and it's always a fun, speculative question. But the honest answer is, look, I think we did some very deliberate shaping of the company, let's say, since the AbbVie split over the last 6 years. And that's not been accidental or reactive or opportunistic. It's been with intent and a plan and so forth. At this point, I also think companies can get a little too transactionally oriented. Everything is a transaction as opposed to you got to run it and run it well. So philosophically, here's how we operate. Our first baseline is we've got to operate and execute well organically as a company. I know it's a word we've used a lot today, but I want to make a distinction between what we do as part of the ongoing operating of the company versus transactions one way or the other. And our whole goal has been to establish the company with its own internal growth drivers, productive R&D, productive innovation, productive positioning in the right markets, the right segments, the right growth things because our investors expect us to make them money and do well with their investment and grow the company. So we position ourselves pretty deliberately and intentionally in those kinds of spaces across the board. I don't know that you're ever done and I don't know that you ever feel totally comfortable. You shouldn't, but I think we're in a pretty good place that way. We've got a lot of what I would say was our intentional repositioning done. That means for us that we got to integrate it all. We've pretty much done that. I mean, the integrations of St. Jude and Alere, pretty well done. I mean, it's finished. There's not -- other than capturing synergies as we go and establishing R&D pipelines where they may not have existed and so forth, speaking primarily of Alere, they are not St. Jude because St. Jude has got a robust pipeline. Those kinds of things, it's all about the ongoing delivery of new technologies, new products, new innovations, improvements in the ones you have and so on. So over these last 6 to 8 years, those R&D pipelines and everything have been well established, not just within Abbott but within St. Jude, too. So we like the hand we're holding. And that means you got to make sure that, as a baseline, you can deliver your company's strategic goals. And in our case, it does. So that means any transaction for us becomes opportunistic. And does that opportunity fit us strategically? Is it something we're prepared to react or respond to? We'd like to be in a position where it's a choice, not a necessity per se. And I think that's where we are. And right now, we've said, for this period of time, because we took on a lot of debt to conclude the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, we wanted to pay down that debt. Well, we're way ahead of schedule paying down our debt, as you know. And shortly here, we'll -- we wanted to pay back $8 billion this year. We're just about there. And we'll be there well before year-end in terms of debt paydown because we've had really good cash management, really good cash flow, et cetera. We've been able to pay a dividend. We'll raise our dividend at some point. We'll have a steady march with our dividend, like we always do. We've been able to fund the capital expenditures internally that drive our growth in our business. We've got some heavy capital investment right now in both Libre and Alinity, and I anticipate that will continue to be the case. But it's not an affordability issue for us. So I think our priorities in terms of cash use and investment internally, we're easily making. We're easily making those goals. So we can afford to be opportunistic if something attractive comes along, but I would tell you that I haven't seen anything that compels me or is sitting on the edge of our radar screen at this point. The single biggest opportunities we've got are all in our own pipelines and in our businesses now and in the markets we're in. The biggest opportunities we've got are right in front of you. The question is, how big and how fast and those trends -- what we think we see going forward looks awfully attractive. And if at some point, well, how far would you take debt down? How far would you pay down debt? What are you going to do when you hit the point where you think that, that's enough? And I think there's a couple of answers to that. A lot of people seem to get comfortable somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion. I remember with $15 billion of debt, still a hell of a lot of debt. And so I think -- and I also observe, as many of us have, I think you analysts as well, share buybacks right now aren't particularly economic. And they're not paying off all that well in the market. So you try to make your moves at prudent times. I think right now, prudence for us, we've got -- we always have our periscope up looking at what's on the reader screen out there. I think there's places in Medical Devices and other things where we might opportunistically think there's something that would be a nice addition to our portfolio. But I don't think anybody should be holding their breath waiting for a great big move here. I like the portfolio we've got. I'm always questioned about the portfolio because everybody wants to help me tweak it, but it's a pretty strong portfolio because all the businesses are operating well. And for the most part, they're at the early stages of growth cycles driven by new product innovations and technology innovations and so forth that are pretty healthy. Because we've got a higher index in emerging markets than a lot of companies, we're going to endure that bumpy road, but the underlying development of those economies in health care systems has been a big plus for us, both for pharma and nutrition. And honestly, it is in devices and diagnostics, too. There are some of those markets that don't economically work in those businesses, but some do. So I think our platter right now says we can afford to just be opportunistic. I don't have big M&A on the radar screen or big transactions on the radar screen. I'd say from a capital or cash allocation standpoint, I'm going to keep paying down debt because I think that's a prudent path for now. I always like having maximum strategic flexibility for the company. I think our path here is clear. We've been prudent about when it's good to buy back shares and when it isn't. I think our capital allocation has been pretty good. And the good news is we got plenty of cash and capital to have choice, and we can afford to be that discretionary about it. There's a constant stream of friendly investment bankers in and out always telling us what's coming on the radar screen, so I don't think we're missing anything. And right now, I like our portfolio a lot better than I like somebody else's. Frederick Wise : Yes. Appreciate that comprehensive answer. Just last for me. You had a couple of notable... Miles White : That means I talk too much, right, Rick? Frederick Wise : I would never say that, Miles. No, really, it was very helpful. You had a couple of notable new product approvals this quarter, the next-gen MitraClip and XIENCE Sierra. XIENCE Sierra is coming in the context to a vascular business that did slightly worse this quarter than the first quarter. Structural Heart, obviously, incredibly strong, accelerated. Just -- so maybe a little color on what we should think for MitraClip. Does the bigger reach open up more procedures? Does it accelerate growth? Does XIENCE Sierra get you back on track in Vascular? I'll stop there. Miles White : Okay. Sure, thanks for the question, Rick. Yes, I think MitraClip definitely opens up to more patients just because of the size changes and so forth that we've got more flexibility with that product. And any time you can do incremental improvements of products and enhance them further, you're extending their reach, extending their life, their -- the competitiveness, et cetera. So I think all that's good for our Structural Heart business, and then we got more things in our pipeline coming. The XIENCE Sierra, okay, early returns in Europe. Excellent and performance excellence. I think same with Japan. We've just launched in the United States, so all I've got is anecdotal feedback. The U.S. and Japan and Europe, they're not the same, but they're close. So I expect Sierra to do well in the United States. When you say, \"Will it get you back on the track?\" I think the track in the stent business is the low single digits at best. I don't think -- there's always a lot of competition in this business. We've talked about that. There's 3 or 4 pretty strong competitors here. I think the market has kind of said, look, the multitude -- the magnitude or the base magnitude of innovation has been had. There's incremental improvements we can all make, but it's a very competitive space. So I think being on track here is low single digit. And that's at least right now what I'd kind of expect out of this. And I expect XIENCE Sierra to claim its share of the market, do well, be more than competitive, and we'll see that. We're seeing it in Europe. We're seeing it in Japan. So I expect to see it in the U.S., too. But I don't think this is a space where there's gigantic quantum leaps in offerings. But it's one of those very strong, very profitable important legacy cornerstones of the device business that's important for us to maintain our leadership in and our competitive position in. And I think XIENCE Sierra definitely kind of puts us back on that track. Operator : And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : Can we spend a moment or 2 looking at the Diagnostic business? Alinity has been launched in Europe for over a year. It's rolling out in the United States now. How should we think about that contributing and also the whole business holistically now that Alere is part of it? Miles White : Well, Joanne, Alere is part of the Diagnostics business, but it's not integrated in the core lab business. What we got here is kind of a collection of businesses by major segments. So I think -- and let me just take that last part first. I think the space that Alere expands us in, point of care and your patient testing, distributed testing, et cetera, which is also kind of a collection of spaces, I think we're in a very strong position. One of the things we'd like to do, obviously, is renew or update or enhance a number of products and so forth, and others put a lot more in innovation and R&D there. But we've got, I think, a very, very strong portfolio. Right now, I'd call it a stable portfolio that's at a low growth point, but that's not where we ultimately expect it to be. And since the time we acquired Alere, we've said for a while here, that's not going to be a high grower, but we expect it to be, and we do. And I'd tell you that so far, everything that you'd have to do to integrate a business, make it part of the company, put management in place that hasn't been there before, and so that's all gone exceptionally well, way faster than we might have thought. So we're really pleased with that business. We're really pleased with it in the portfolio. We're super pleased with how the management team there is doing. All good. All good all day, and we look forward to its contribution to our growth and innovation over the future here because I think that's exactly what it's going to do. Back to Alinity, there's a couple of things to kind of understand about this space or spaces. We don't always determine when the customer wants to buy or when the customer has to make a decision. So first of all, because these are big mainframe systems, core laboratories, blood screening, enterprises and so forth, they tend to be contracted or tenders that are 5, 7 or even 10 years. They're usually longer-term contracts. They're big installations. The change from one competitor to another, old systems, new systems, so forth, it's not quick. It'll take a couple of months and so forth. So these are big mainframe sorts of enterprise decisions, and we're kind of on their schedule. So we can do a lot to enhance that or even speed it up, which we're doing. The receptiveness to something new, if you're replacing old systems, depends on the completeness of your menu so that you can do a full swap-out and not have to run 2 different systems at the same time, et cetera, even though a lot of labs do. So those are just dynamics we deal with in the market every day. I'd say our menu in Europe is full and robust. It's a big menu in the U.S. and other countries. Not as big as Europe, but coming fast. And we're talking anywhere from 150 to 200 different tests here that have to be on that box, each of which have to be individually approved and licensed, et cetera. So that's -- we're in a really strong position that way in Europe. That menu ramp-up obviously takes a little bit of time. It takes a little bit of time in the U.S. and everywhere. So we're getting through that or past that now. The -- we're tracking, like you would in any capital business, prospects, which I think has more than, gosh, quintupled in the last several quarters here. And we're tracking close rates. If we're in a competitive situation where we are already in there, I think our win rate is about 97%. I mean, we're keeping everything that we've already got and then expanding beyond that. In places where we're trying to replace competitive systems, our win rate is well above 50%, and that's really good. From the standpoint of -- those accounts have to make a decision that they're actually going to swap out everything that they've had for a number of years. And to have that kind of initial win rate here is pretty strong. And so we like the win rates we're seeing both in retention and new instruments and new placements and expansions and so forth. And a lot of times, you'll get the first installation, then it expands from there. So I would say, all the metrics that we would track, including how fast it is to get up and running, test the record and so forth, they're all tracking exceptionally well. We're expanding our sales and service organizations in Europe as we speak. That hiring is going very well and very fast. It's a lot better than we did in neuromod, I can tell you that. We'll take a lesson there. And so the ramp-up is moving faster and faster now. We've got a very specifically detailed plan about how many, how fast, on what pace, et cetera, gosh, for years ahead here. And we've pretty well got every country mapped, every account mapped, et cetera. So now it's just a question of execution and how fast we can execute, and all that's doing really well. So I'm pretty excited about the path ahead here in the Diagnostics business on all fronts. Joanne Wuensch : And my follow-up question is on your MitraClip franchise. We have the next generation product, which was just FDA-approved, and the COAPT trial reading out in September. Can you just give us an update on where that business is? Miles White : Yes. I'm going to ask Scott to help me with that, Joanne. Scott Leinenweber : Yes. With respect to MitraClip, you can see the performance in the numbers there, and Structural Heart is doing quite well. We will get a read-out rate out on the U.S. COAPT trial data later this year, very likely at the TCT Conference in September. So that will be a big event for us. We're also doing quite a bit with respect to geographic expansion as well. We received national reimbursement in Japan here in the second quarter. That's a nice opportunity for us, too. That market is quite sizable. So MitraClip is hitting on all cylinders with a lot of growth in front of it. Miles White : So Joanne, I'd wrap up. I like the way Scott wrapped that up. It's hitting on all cylinders. Obviously, in a company our size and diversity, everything doesn't hit on all cylinders all the time. But I'd say right now, I think for the markets we have and let's call it, the exchange and the currency volatility we've all got out there and so on, I think the company is performing exceptionally well and feel pretty good about all the underlying performance and the strength going forward here. Operator : And our final question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Christopher Pasquale : Miles, just a couple quick ones here for me. One on the EPD business and the situation in Russia, I think you had previously said you still expected that to be a headwind in 2Q. Did that come back earlier than expected? And then just quickly on Diagnostics, the legacy Abbott Point of Care business has slowed a little bit over the last few quarters. Is that a function of the integration work being done there? Or is there something else happening? Miles White : Well, let me take the Point of Care first. Yes, there's a couple things going on there, and I'd say a little bit of it in integration. We had a number of management changes because we were populating the new Rapid Diagnostics business. So we had a lot of new over new over new there, and we may have lost touch with ourselves a little bit in the transition. And yes, there's a couple customer dynamics, big accounts and so forth, where we had some challenges that have since been addressed. So I expect that to improve. I don't think that's a long-term condition. But yes, we've had a couple of, let's just call it, slip-ups here that slowed our growth rate. And I think we'll be seeing that come back to much healthier growth rate. With regard to Russia and EPD, I'm going to get a little bit of help here from Scott and Brian. But generally, I'd say, look, yes, it's as predicted. I think it's -- we're seeing the cycle pass through here in the second quarter, but I don't know that it's completely done. But everything we kind of thought would play out is or has. And so we're seeing that come back to, let's call it, a better position. You guys can add anything. Brian Yoor : Yes. I would just add, our end customer demand remains in line with our expectations. We're tracking that. And I'd say, this quarter, we actually returned to growth in Russia, which is a good sign based on the stabilization we're seeing and how the destocking has progressed as we had planned thus far. Miles White : I'm actually kind of surprised we got it that close. Usually, you try to break these things and you're never right. And it's actually turned out to be more right than we thought. Scott Leinenweber : Well, thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of the call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.  Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, through our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which adjusts the 2017 basis of comparison to exclude the impact of exchange and historical results for Abbott's Medical Optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017 as well as current and prior year sales for Alere, which was acquired on October 3, 2017. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.75 along with sales growth of approximately 8% on an organic basis, reflecting well-balanced growth across all 4 of our businesses.  I'm particularly pleased with the continued productivity of our new product pipeline and would like to highlight a couple areas where our products are creating and fundamentally shaping markets. I'll start with Structural Heart, where we're the world -- or the global leader in minimally invasive treatments for mitral regurgitation or a leaky heart valve. We've recently made several significant advancements in this area. In July, in the U.S., we initiated a pivotal trial for Tendyne, our device that's designed to replace damaged mitral heart valves without the need for open heart surgery. We also received U.S. FDA approval for our third-generation version of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the repair of mitral heart valve. And in September, we announced the results of our landmark COAPT trial, which demonstrated the MitraClip improved survival in clinical outcomes for patients with functional mitral regurgitation, the most prevalent form of this condition. We expect to submit this study data to the U.S. FDA in the coming weeks to support consideration of an expanded indication for MitraClip. These advancements will further enhance and strengthen our leadership position in this large and highly underpenetrated disease area and will bring new therapies to patients where effective treatment options are currently limited.  Diabetes Care is another area where our technologies are making a big impact, specifically FreeStyle Libre, a revolutionary glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks. In the U.S., we received FDA approval for a 14-day sensor with a shorter 1-hour warm-up, making Libre the longest lasting wearable glucose sensor available. And in Europe, we obtained CE Mark for our FreeStyle Libre 2 system, our newest generation 14-day system with optional real-time alarms.  In a relatively short period of time, FreeStyle Libre now has more than 1 million users across the globe, a testament to the mass market appeal of this product, which is fundamentally changing the way people with diabetes manage their disease.  I'll now summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Brian. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. Alinity, our family of highly differentiated instruments, is achieving accelerated growth and strong competitive win rates in Europe, where more than 50% of our Alinity instrument placements, thus far, are coming from share capture. The global rollout of Alinity positions this business for consistent above-market growth for years to come, as we capture share and bring the full suite of systems to additional geographies, including the U.S.  In Rapid Diagnostics, third quarter sales were driven by cardiometabolic testing. We just completed the first year anniversary of our acquiring this business, and we're pleased with the progress we've made to position ourselves for growth and margin expansion going forward.  In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales were led by double-digit growth in several geographies, including Russia and China. As expected, sales growth in the quarter was impacted by a difficult comparison versus the prior year when we saw channel restocking across the market in India following implementation of a new tax system in that country.  Our unique branded generics business focused specifically on key emerging, markets continues to execute its strategy and grow faster than the market in several of our priority countries, including India and China.  In Nutrition, sales increased 6% in the quarter, led by a strong performance in our international business. In Pediatric Nutrition, global growth was well balanced across infant and toddler nutrition as well as above-market growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth broadly across our international markets. And in adult nutrition, growth was led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands, most notably internationally, where we achieved 7% growth overall in adult nutrition Lastly, I'll cover our results for Medical Devices, where sales grew 10% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care.  In Electrophysiology, growth of 20% was led by double-digit growth across our heart mapping and ablation portfolio as well as Confirm, the world's first and only smartphone-compatible insertable cardiac monitor.  In Structural Heart, we achieved strong growth across several areas of our portfolio, including more than 20% growth of MitraClip and double-digit growth of AMPLATZER PFO, our minimally invasive device that plugs life-threatening holes in the heart. And in Diabetes Care, sales grew 40% in the quarter, led by FreeStyle Libre, which achieved sales of over $300 million in the quarter, an increase of more than 100% versus the prior year.  So in summary, this was another very good quarter with all 4 businesses contributing to strong growth overall. Our pipeline continues to be highly productive, including significant recent advancements in Structural Heart and Diabetes Care that are creating and shaping markets.  And lastly, we're forecasting EPS and organic sales growth at the upper end of the range, as we said at the beginning of the year.  I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 7.8% on an organic basis. Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired late last year and is therefore not included in our organic sales growth results, achieved sales of $481 million. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.7% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthened versus several currencies, resulting in a larger unfavorable impact on our results this quarter compared to the expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in July.  Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense is 29.7% of sales.  Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018. We forecast organic sales growth of approximately 7%, at the top end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. At current rates, we expect exchange would now have a slightly negative impact on full year reported sales. In addition, we continue to expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion.  We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59.5% of sales, which includes underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of a little less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales.  Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2018. We forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.80 to $0.82. We forecast organic sales growth of mid- to high single digits. And at current exchange rates, we'd expect exchange to have a negative impact of a little more than 3% on reported sales.  In addition, we expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales of around $500 million in the fourth quarter, which, as I previously mentioned, is not included in our organic growth rate this year. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide an overview of our fourth quarter organic sales growth outlook by business.  For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth, which reflects the difficult comparison in our noncore other business segment relative to the fourth quarter of last year when sales increased strong double digits. In Nutrition, we forecast low- to mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid- to high-single-digit sales growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast high-single-digit sales growth, which reflects double-digit growth in several areas of this business.  With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Scott Leinenweber : We cannot hear the question, operator. David Lewis : Can you hear me now? Scott Leinenweber : Yes. David Lewis : So Miles, 2 questions for you. Obviously, a lot of business momentum here in 2018 and meaningful drivers ahead, like Libre 2 and MitraClip. So as you think about sort of sustainability, is sort of 6% to 7% range sustainable over the intermediate term? And how are you feeling about Abbott's ability to deliver double digits or low teen earnings given the currency environment in all of these various opportunities to grow? Miles White : Okay. Thanks, David. Let me take the first part of that. The answer is sort of definitively and absolutely yes on the sustainability of earnings. In fact -- rather, sales top line, and I'll get to earnings in a minute. In that 6% to 7% range, I say yes. And frankly, I'm even looking at 7% and better. But if you look at the underlying momentum of each of these businesses today and the underlying growth of each of these businesses, there's actually some places, I think, it could get better. There's places we're, obviously, trying to improve. I wouldn't forecast it yet, but I still see plenty of growth, plenty of opportunity, frankly, with the new product pipeline for years to come. And you're seeing the evidence of that right now in the performance of all the businesses. The Diagnostics business growth rate is clearly turned up. That is clearly the impact of Alinity taking hold. It's having great success in Europe. Libre is doing super well. And on top of that, we haven't really put a lot of promotional emphasis behind it. So I see a strong future for both of those. The new product cadence coming out of Medical Devices is really good. And frankly, we expect another approval imminently here in the U.S. So I think that in terms of the sustainability of top line, I feel very good about that. I feel really good about the underlying growth of the company, the sustainability of it, et cetera. The little elephant in the room is clearly exchange. And I think that's true for practically every multinational out there. I think all of us, all investors, all companies doing business in international markets are experiencing the upturn in exchange now. And frankly, a bit of uncertainty about how long it lasts because every time we enter a new year, we kind of think we've got a notion of what exchange and currency and so forth is going to do, and it never last the entire year. We always see a change once or twice during the year. And some of that is just driven by news. Some of it is driven by trade talk and other things. But it's -- I think, for all of us, it's a little hard to forecast. So we see that -- in the third quarter, we've seen a tick-up in currency impact. We're clearly moving into a headwind here. We'll see that in the fourth quarter. And I think that's going to continue into next year. The question is, how far into next year? And how heavy is that headwind? And on our case, we look at the overall business and say, \"Look, the underlying growth rates, the underlying strength of the business is really strong.\" And we've been able, historically, to absorb exchange, mitigate exchange, deal with exchange, et cetera, and be a very reliable performer for our investors. And that's always our goal. We always start the year with a double-digit earnings goal every year. And it's the rare year when we don't achieve that, hit it or exceed it. And this is no different. I think, right now, we're a few months ahead of next year. And a lot always happens in the first quarter. So we don't have any way to reliably tie down what we think currency is going to do. I don't think anybody does, obviously. I know that it will be a headwind starting out. What happens from there, who knows? But we go into the year looking at double digits. And with underlying growth like we have in all of our businesses, I'd say, that was pretty solid. David Lewis : Okay. Miles, very clear. And the second, just a follow-up for you is just, can you help us put the Robert Ford announcement into perspective and sort of share your thoughts on what it means for you over the intermediate term? Miles White : Well, what it means to me over the intermediate term is I get a lot more help, which I'm happy about. Look, it's obviously a succession step. And one of the things that I think any good leader's got to do with his company is make sure that there's always good, strong succession, building, growing, et cetera, in the company. And that applies to me, too. So I think, for the continuity of the performance of this company, the continuity of its strategies, the continuity of it sustainable growth rates and so forth going forward, that's important. Robert Ford has been in this company this entire year. I've known him 22 years and pay a lot of attention to his career, as you might imagine. And he's been an excellent operator. He's handled our entire St. Jude integration, done a terrific job with Medical Devices. And consequently, I want all of those Medical Device businesses continuing to report directly to him, even as he takes on more responsibility. And I'd say, with time, this will develop pretty nicely. And I think it's a very good strong move for the company. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Miles, wanted to ask you about COAPT. A lot of us were at the TCT conference in San Diego last month and saw the great data there to a room of standing ovation, which we don't see in Medical Devices that often. So us on The Street, we can think about big numbers with such a large patient opportunity. Maybe tell us how you're thinking about MitraClip over the next few years and how you think The Street should be thinking about it. Miles White : Well, I'll tell you what. Obviously, the performance of MitraClip in that study was a real home run. And it's not often that studies are so definitively positive and so good in terms of their impact for patients. So we're, obviously, very happy about that and very proud of that. Our objective will be to move through the regulatory processes as rapidly as can be done and make it available for that use as rapidly as we can. I think the medical community sees tremendous medical benefit in that. And when you can make that kind of a difference, it's obviously big, important, good thing. And how rapidly we go through that regulatory process, hard to predict. We have not got a lot of -- well, we don't have any particular impact for next year in our roadmap for next year, at this point, for any impact from that product, so anything that happens is upside. And obviously, beyond that, I think it's got a pretty sizable opportunity. And it's not a broad mass market product, but the number of patients that will benefit from the product is significant. And so I think it will clearly make a difference in the overall performance of the company, this Medical Device business, the company, et cetera. It's not one that's going to get lost in rounding error, I can tell you that. Scott, do you want to add anything to that? Scott Leinenweber : No, that's fair. We'll submit, as Miles mentioned in his prepared remarks, to the FDA in the coming weeks. And after that, it's in their hands, and we'll let that process play out. Robert Marcus : Okay. Great. Maybe a follow-up on Libre. This is a product that's been wildly successful and now over $100 million run rate in the U.S., over $1 billion globally. And you really have one major competitor here that's, let's call it, at the upper end of the technology scale. And Abbott, I view as the low cost, easy to access, very easy-to-use product in continuous glucose monitoring. So as we think about the evolution of Libre over the next few years, how do you think about Libre staying at the lower end of the cost and ease-of-use curve versus moving up and trying to compete with your main competitor there? Miles White : Well, I'll tell you, interestingly enough, I don't actually look at it the way you just described. I think Libre is a pretty different product. It's a -- it's got tremendous capability. But given that value point that we have it priced at, it is accessible to patients all over the world. And when we first launched in Europe, we launched without any government reimbursement. And for the first time, glucose monitoring was patient pay. And it had wildly great acceptance just on that basis, which actually encouraged governments to reimburse the product. So I think with health care today, a lot of things that come to market are very expensive, whether they are pharmaceuticals or devices. And in this particular case, it was important that this have a medical and a -- an economic value proposition that made it accessible to all patients or as many as possible. And there's tens of millions of diabetes patients out there. Obviously, there's type 1s and insulin-dependent patients and there's type 2s trying not to be. And so the product has a much broader appeal across a much broader patient base. And in our case, we have a much lower cost and far greater automated manufacturing capability to not only allow that cost, but to allow for mass production. And that's the path we've taken. And we've gone at this from an access standpoint that's far more retail and direct-to-consumer-oriented. It's made a big difference. So I'd say, at this point, we're making healthy profits on this product. We have no intention of changing the value proposition at all. I mean, your question sort of suggests that we would raise price in order to be competitive. I'd say, you ought to be asking the other side what are they going to do to make themselves a value proposition because this product is an incredibly good value proposition, which is why it's got such high demand. And to be honest, we don't even measure ourselves relative to any competition, including finger stick, at this point. We know how many potential patients that are out there. And it's our intent to capture the vast majority or possible maximum of them that we possibly can in just a few years. So I look at Libre right now, and a lot of people call it a wild success. I kind of think we're just getting started. And we're investing heavily in capacity to allow even more rapid expansion. And people will say, \"Well, how do you model that?\" And I think I'm not sure we can model it. It's that good. So I'd tell you, you probably need to think about this a little differently in terms of value proposition and the kind of access that affords. And I think the future of health care kind of demands that from us, from all companies. There are certain products, obviously, there are small volume, there are niche medical treatments and so forth that are costly to develop, costly to make and provide and so forth. But there's others that have much broader impact and much broader appeal. And part of the future of health care and the necessity for companies like ours is making those things as broadly accessible as possible. And we still, obviously, have to earn our return. And I could assure you, we're making a nice healthy return on Libre. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : So 2 quick questions. First a product question and then an earnings growth question. On the product side, obviously, the context here is that Abbott is a company delivering absolutely top-of-class revenue growth. But the one thing in the quarter that I wanted to ask about was Neuromodulation. That was a little slower like the last quarter. I'm just curious, is your outlook for that business changed at all? Or this is just still temporary hiring issues? And when do you think you can return to more like double-digit growth in that division? Miles White : Okay. Thanks. I think it's more of the same from last quarter. And I do think this is temporary. I think it's going to take us couple of quarters to work through, let's call it, the commercial execution issue we have. And you don't fix that overnight, but we will fix it and fix it in the near term. And I do think that this is a business that should return to double-digit growth. So I can look at that as something that gets better for us. It was, obviously, very strong last year. It hit a stall point during this year. But I do think that upside is there. And it's strictly in our hands at this point. So yes, I'm pretty optimistic about it. Do you go to bed happy about it? No. Can you fix it? Yes, and we are. Robert Hopkins : Okay. Two other quick little things. What was the U.S. -- imminent U.S. product approval you guys were highlighting in your prepared remarks? And then I also wanted to just follow up really quickly on David's question on earnings growth. And I realized you start every year at 10%. The Street is modeling roughly 12% earnings growth for really the next couple of years. Given all the puts and takes, is that a reasonable place to start? Or could currency make that a little challenging? Miles White : Okay. First question is really easy. I was referencing HeartMate 3 and a new claim. Second question, good question. I know The Street is where it is. The Street, generally, in its consensus, hasn't tried to factor in or tried to model exchange. And we're all looking at the same exchange trends right now, even The Street. So I'd say, look, if I privately pull the 20 analysts or so that -- on the sell side that cover Abbott, or any company for that matter, you'd probably all say, \"Well, this is my current estimate based on underlying growth, but I'm not sure how exchange is going to impact it.\" And secondly, I'm not sure how much everybody is going to try to absorb in their P&L and how much they're going to pass through in their estimates and so forth. I think we're all kind of in that boat together right now. Do I think that 10% to 12% range right now is reasonable? We start every year at double digits. And whatever -- I think, as I said earlier, the underlying growth of these businesses is there. There's puts and takes. There's ins and outs. There's not just product ins and outs. There's tax rate. Everybody that experience tax reforms is going to experience some adjustments in tax rates this year. There's puts and takes. We, obviously, made a change in some of our debt cost with euro debt. That's a positive for us. So there's a bunch of pluses and minuses we've got to sort out. The one that's hard to forecast in some way is exchange. And yet, we were on the dot to the penny or penny above or better every single quarter. So we tend to like a lot of precision on our forecasting. And the hardest thing to forecast here is exchange. So do I think that could be a bit of a mitigator here? It might be, but we're all going to know a lot more about that in a few months when it's time to set our guidance for next year. Historically, as you know, we have always tried to offset in some fashion or mitigate as much exchange as possible, so that we can reliably deliver what our investments -- what our investors expect. I mean, there's -- look, there's a lot of moving parts in the world, and we're always trying to synthesize all those moving parts and give you, the investor, reliability to the penny every quarter. And so far, I think for the last 15 to 20 years, we've been pretty damn good at that. Going into next year, our goals will be no different. And right now, I think that even analysts and their estimates that inform that 12% consensus that you referenced as being out there now is subject to change by analysts factoring in exchange or any number of other things. But in our case, we're always trying to mitigate that. I don't know where it will come out. But I think somewhere in that range is probably right. We'll be starting at 10%. And we'll see what happens after that. I would tell you this, if exchange mitigates and we suddenly see a weak dollar, we're not going to have a problem making you happy. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Vijay Kumar : So Miles, maybe the first one on the sustainability question. If I'm looking at '19, you have MitraClip FMR indication, which is incremental. Libre continues its strength. You have HeartMate 3, which is incremental. Portico U.S. launch, which is incremental. A stable CRM outlook. Neuromod, your comps get easy. Alinity, it should be ramping in the U.S. It really feels like all the strength we've seen in '18, they should continue into '19. So maybe can you just talk about some drivers or how we should be thinking about the pluses and the minuses? Miles White : Well, Vijay, you forgot to mention Alere. You forgot to mention COAPT. You forgot to mention some improvements in EPD. It's interesting. I've never, in my career here, seen such breadth across the company in new products, new product launches, market conditions, et cetera. Even Nutrition, right now, is doing considerably better than it has the last couple of years. I wouldn't forecast better for Nutrition, but I like what it's doing right now. And EPD, it's in high growth or, at least, moderate to high growth markets with great tailwinds. It of course has a currency headwind, like everything else. But all of these things are performing really well. And even the ones that you can see and forecast and track pretty well, like Libre or Alinity, et cetera, they're actually accelerating. And that just gets better. So I think the sustainability of the growth and the diversity of it is a huge plus. It's not like we're reliant on a single product or a single country. We're not highly indexed in China. And we're not overdependent on a single product. There's just great diversity of growth opportunity across the board. And I think the -- I'm really proud of the company from a productivity and pipeline standpoint. That goes for St. Jude as well. As I've said a number of times, St. Jude, in the course of our acquisition negotiations with them continued to talk to us the veracity of their pipeline and how good it was. And to be honest, they were right, and that's proven. So I'm pretty bullish on just the diversity of opportunity here. And while we can try to point at 1 or 2 of them, I think Libre and Alinity stick out. But incremental matters. And incremental in any business here, whether it's HeartMate 3 or Neuro or even EPD or Alere or anything us, Portico, all of these things contribute to the growth of the company, and that's how we like it. We like every bit of this company performing well. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. And maybe one for Brian. Brian, when you look at the guidance for Q4, any implication for '19? So gross margin is at 59.5%. That would imply an acceleration to Q4. Any particular reason why GM sequentially should step up? How much did FX cost you guys in the EPS? There was a lot of questions on why guidance was not raised for the year. And it looks like, at least, $0.05 cents hit in the back half here. And is that sort of a similar number we should be thinking about just given where FX is right when you think about for '19? Brian Yoor : All right, Vijay. Let me start with the gross margin. Our underlying gross margin improvement has been strong. It's ticking up nearly about 0.5 point year-over-year, and that's largely the effect of our synergies that are going on, both with respect to Alere and its integration. And also contained synergies with St. Jude. And every year, we put an emphasis on improving our underlying gross margin of all of our businesses. So we had the healthy reinvestment back into the business. FX really not -- it mixes -- it moves around a little bit here and there. It changes every day, but it's not really having too much of an impact. So we're seeing close to 40 bps of gross margin improvement. That's all underlying for the year. Your observation on FX as far as earnings is pretty spot on. If you recall, we came out at the beginning of the year and we thought that FX would actually be a tailwind of about $0.05. It's probably now closer to that $0.03 to $0.04 down on a full year basis. So we're powering through that. We're powering through that with all the underlying performance that Miles has talked about with respect to all the businesses. So when you look under line, it's outstanding, very strong performance that carries momentum into 2019. Miles White : I would just add one comment that blame it on the CEO comment. I don't get overly worked up about raising in the fourth quarter. We've been ahead all year. We're performing strong. Like you, I'm looking at next year and the continuity and sustainability of it all. Whatever the fourth quarter is, it will be. And we're not going to miss -- that's incredibly unlikely. We are all observing that exchange is a bigger headwind. But when you get to giving guidance for the fourth quarter or raising, I think, generally, one is tweaking. And at this point in the year, I think tweaking for one quarter is kind of -- I'm looking at next year. And so I wouldn't read too much into that other than, look, the obvious. We all know exchanges is getting headier. And -- but beyond that, I think the story here is the underlying growth, and that is pretty strong and pretty sustainable. So don't read too much into it. Operator : Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : Wonder if I could maybe ask about one of the areas in Medical Devices that continues to be sort of a little slower, and that's Vascular. So couple questions there. One, is there anything you can give us in terms of how the initial launch of the XIENCE Sierra stent is doing? And second to that, also the PHP, your percutaneous pump is still -- that trial is still halted. So any updates in terms of when that might get restarted? Scott Leinenweber : Raj, this is Scott. Yes, I would just say with respect to the Vascular business, I think the big news item earlier this year was the U.S. approval of our XIENCE Sierra stent. That's off to a very good start. When you're going in to that, that physician feedback, I know it was very positive to our experience in Europe there. So we've added Sierra to a number of our contracts here in the U.S. We've actually recaptured several share points in the U.S. during the quarter. We also launched a product in Japan recently, and it's performing there very well. So the business had some momentum. But honestly, Sierra stent, it's is a very good product. There's a little bit of masking of that growth with respect to some of the noncommercial royalty revenue that we get, but that's noise. The commercial side of the business is really performing quite well with respect to that launch. With respect to PHP, that's a program we're still committed to very much so. We have not provided any updates on the time line of late. I would expect we will in the future at some point. Raj Denhoy : Okay. Fair. Maybe just -- for my second question just kind of a broader one on kind of the tone and outlook for the business broadly. Obviously, it depends a lot on the portfolio that various companies have. But is there anything you can offer in terms of how procedure volumes and pricing broadly are tracking in the industry right now? Scott Leinenweber : Yes. No change, really. I mean, procedures and demand volume from that side of things are fairly constant to the way they've been running and trending for the last several quarters. Pricing in some of the segments, such as CRM and Vascular, is a modest headwind. But demand is strong, offsetting most of that. Those are really the only 2 areas of the Medical Device business where we think about price. The others are very healthy. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Two quick questions. First, Miles, on Alere, you'll do $2 billion in revenue this year. I think that's hitting expectations. But Alere is going to be folded into organic growth in 2019. So can you help us think about Alere growth in 2019 and beyond? That's first question. And then quickly on Libre 2, can you give us an update on the U.S. approval timing? Miles White : Yes, let me do Alere first. So our first year -- you're spot on, on all your observations. Our first year was obviously stabilized, integrated, organized, put management in place, et cetera. All done, all done well and so on. And we benefited in this last year from -- and probably one of the stronger flu seasons in a long time, so the infectious diseases business in Alere, the infectious disease testing business did well in that context. Going forward, obviously, we now need to turn to driving growth. And I can't give you a forecast or prediction on that for '19 yet, or even '20 beyond that. But that's where the attention turns. I think we're mostly through all the disruption and/or transition synergies, et cetera, all that activity. In fact, I've got an update on that after this meeting later today. And at this point, our entire emphasis turns to what kind of sustainable growth rate we can now generate and trend out of that business. So I don't have a specific answer for you yet, Glenn. But I think that's one of our growth drivers of the future. And that's kind of next steps with it. And I'm sorry, what was the second half of your question? Glenn Novarro : Timing, Libre 2 in the U.S. Miles White : I might have to ask Scott for some help on that because I'm not sure we can give you timing on that. Scott Leinenweber : Yes, that's right, Miles. We haven't provided timing yet on Libre 2 in the U.S. Obviously, we will bring an alarm version to the U.S. at some point in time. The current version is obviously doing quite well as well. So that's just another opportunity in the pipeline, but we have not provided specifics on time line yet. Miles White : I would tell you this. It should take a lot less time than it seems to. The U.S. lags Europe and the rest of the world on some of these approvals in a way that I find hard to explain, but it is what it is. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : One on capital allocation, one on Nutrition. Miles, you've been paying down debt. You've been quiet on the M&A front in 2018. Do you expect that to change in 2019? And I just had one question on Nutrition. Miles White : Okay. Let me deal with that one first. Well, first of all, I think the organization has done a terrific job on cash generation and debt pay down. And I give Brian Yoor and the management team total credit for that because what we've done for cash management, debt management, debt pay down and stuff has been led by him and terrific job. And to be honest, when we took all the borrowing down in order to do the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, our debt to EBITDA ratio was, gosh, I think, like, 4.3, something like that. And we made commitments to the rating agencies that we would get that down pretty fast. And we're down to, I think, 2. So we've obviously paid off a lot of debt very fast. And we're happy with the rate of that. And it gives us a lot of flexibility from a capital allocation or strategic flexibly standpoint. But will we continue to pay down debt? We will. But I think we also -- we have other capital needs, where, for example, we want to target our dividend in a certain range as a percent of our EPS. And we are completely able to do that and meet those targets and those goals for dividend payouts. Some of our capital attention has been paid to growth. And we are investing in Alinity, and we're investing in Libre. We're making a large investment in capacity expansion for Libre that, I think, you'll see drive even more growth out of Libre than you can see now and fulfill kind of the larger mass market ramp-up we see for that product. We're putting a fair bit of investment into the expansion of Alinity. So when we can invest our capital in growth not only near term, but long term with high return, that's a good use for our capital. And we're obviously doing that. We haven't, to be fair, seen a lot on the M&A front that interests us. And as I've indicated in the past, we always keep our ear to the ground. We're always doing our homework on what possibilities may or may not be out there and what might interest us, what might fit our portfolio. But right now, we haven't seen anything that draws our attention that way. So we don't have anything on our radar screen from the standpoint of M&A that, we think, is beneficial to us. We've got so much more opportunity in the company organically and out of our pipelines and the expansion of all the things we've talked about earlier that, that's really where our focus is. And fortunately, for us, it can be and ought to be. So we just haven't seen anything to draw our cash or capital investment from the standpoint of an M&A. I mean, there may be little things here and there, but nothing that I would say is particularly needle moving on a big scale here in any near-term way. And then finally, I suppose the fifth, last opportunity is -- or that I haven't mentioned is not last and priority, but -- is share buyback. And right now, we haven't been. What you're seeing in our EPS growth and so forth is pure growth and not enhanced at all by share buybacks. And to be honest, as we've all seen during the year, that hasn't been a high return investment for a lot of companies. And we've had better uses for our capital that do have high returns for us. And so consequently, it doesn't rule it out. It doesn't rule out that we could do it, but we'll only do it if it's got a good return for us and our investor, et cetera. And right now, our best investment is us. So we're directing our cash that way. I think our cash flow is strong enough that we've got a lot of good choices. We will continue to pay down debt. But we're at a point where we've got strategic flexibility. It's just a question on where we'd use it. And I think that's all good. Larry Biegelsen : Very clear. And just last for me, Miles, on Nutrition. A year ago, that was the slowest growing business. That's clearly turned around. The international Pediatric Nutrition business is doing really well. Any color on what's going on in China? And lastly, on that, the Adult Nutrition business in the U.S. has been a little weak recently. Is that still private label competition? What's the outlook there? Brian Yoor : Okay. Yes, I'll take the last first, Larry. This is Brian. With respect to the U.S., what you're seeing is the impact of a wind-down of a noncore product line for us. You'll see that here in Q3. Otherwise, the U.S. business will be growing. You'll see in Q4 as well. It's noncore to us and it's -- we've just decided to wind it down. That's the only thing going on in the U.S. With respect to China, the transition is going smoothly. The food safety law transition is going smoothly. I think behavior has been rational in the market. The market growth rates in China have been strong. And we're always fighting there to grow share. But our greater China business has done quite well this year. And we expect the markets there in China to remain strong and stable going forward on the pediatric side of the business. Miles White : Yes. I would only add that the whole Nutrition business, obviously, is doing a lot better this year than it did last year. Where it is right now, there's various countries or various segments of business where we want to do better. There's ups and downs. But overall, if you take it as a whole, a lot happier where it is today than where it was a year ago. Operator : Our final question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Christopher Pasquale : I wanted to follow up on the FX commentary and try to make sure we're all on the same page. As we think about next year, Brian, if rates were to stay where they are right now, what would the earnings impact from currency be in 2019? Brian Yoor : It's going to be somewhere probably between 3% and 4% of our earnings. And we've seen that before. And as Miles said, we always work to mitigate as much of that as possible. And the great news is that we have a lot of underlying growth in the businesses and the sales growth that we're going to power through as much of that as possible. Miles White : And I would add to that, Chris. It always comes as a judgment trade-off. If you could predict currency for the whole year or beyond, that would be one thing, but we can't. And so we take a lot of different actions to mitigate the volatility of it or the impact of it. We've got a very sophisticated and, frankly, complex rolling hedging program on the currencies that we can hedge, so we take out a lot of the unpredictability with that. Obviously, over the long term, we're not currency traders and we're not trying to be, but we're trying to be able to make our earnings and our sales more predictable, more stable, more reliable in terms of what our investors want to see and, frankly, the impact on us, so we can plan and manage. That said, gosh, today's currency rates, if sustained, it'll be a heavy headwind. Do I think all of that somehow passes through to the investor? I do not. Do I think that the currency rates will be the same 3 months from now or the same 6 months from now? I do not. If you ask me, do I think they will be up or down? I have no idea. All I know is, as I told you earlier, we look at the right balance of what is right for us to try to mitigate or hedge or whatever we're going to do to perform to the investment identity that our investors expect of us and where are we in a prudent range of how we manage that balance and how we deal with exchange and so forth in the performance for our investors, and we always start with a double-digit target of growth. So a lot of moving parts, and we'll see. Right now, I think that's kind of the only elephant in the room for us. And everything else looks positive and strong and -- or is in our hands to manage. And the one that's not entirely in our hands to manage is what currency hands us. But then, we do have a lot of things to do to try to minimize its impact on the overall performance of the company for our investors. Christopher Pasquale : And Brian, just to make sure that I'm hearing you correctly. You're saying about $0.10 headwind for next year, give or take. Brian Yoor : It's a range. Exchange currency moves every day, if you look, 3% to 4%, about that. Christopher Pasquale : Sure. Okay. And then Miles, just one last one on Alinity in the U.S. What's the latest on the timing there and when you think you'll have a broad enough menu in place to really make a big push domestically with that product? Scott Leinenweber : Chris, this is Scott. I would just say, as you know, that the clinical chemistry and immunoassay instruments, the core business there, the instruments are approved. And we are building our test menu at a pretty ratable kind of rate quarter to quarter, so to speak, and making progress on that front. It will still take a few more quarters until we get what we consider a critical mass there. So you'll probably looking back half of 2019 on what we feel like we're really going to have the menu and the systems we need to go out and get business.  Okay. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.  Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.  Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that fourth quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.  On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, I'll discuss our 2018 results as well as our outlook for 2019. For the full year 2018, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.88, representing 15% growth versus the prior year. Strong performance across our businesses, along with underlying margin expansion and our synergy capture from recent acquisitions, enabled us to achieve EPS at the upper end of the initial guidance range we issued at the beginning of last year despite unfavorable currency shifts as we progressed through the year. With our recent strategic shaping completed, our focus in 2018 was on running the company we've built, and the result was an excellent year by every measure. All 4 of our major businesses performed well, contributing to overall organic sales growth of more than 7%, which is above the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of last year. At the same time, we generated operating cash flow of more than $6 billion, returning $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends, and announced a 14% increase in our dividend beginning this year.  We also increased our investments in capabilities for the future, including expanding manufacturing capacity in 2 important areas that will drive significant long- term growth : FreeStyle Libre, our revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system; and Alinity, our family of highly differentiated diagnostic systems. And lastly, following 2 major acquisitions in 2017, we repaid more than $8 billion of debt, which significantly enhances our strategic flexibility going forward.  Our performance this past year demonstrates the strength of our strategy and execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting another year of strong financial performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25, reflecting double-digit growth. I'll now provide a brief overview of our 2018 results and 2019 outlook for each business. I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased mid-single digits in 2018, reflecting a notable improvement in our growth rate versus the prior year. Sales growth this past year was well balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses. Internationally, our focus on enhancing competitiveness with our well-known and trusted brands led to strong growth in both Asia and Latin America. In China, we saw improvement in both the market and our performance after the government transitioned to new food safety regulations in that country at the beginning of last year. And in the U.S., growth was driven by our Pediatric Nutrition business, led by above-market growth of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand; and Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand. Overall, the fundamental demographic and socioeconomic trends in the global nutrition market remain favorable, and our position in the market remains very competitive.  In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 7% in 2018, led by double-digit growth in both India and China. Our strategy in EPD is unique and quite simple : to build significant presence, scale and leadership positions in the most attractive emerging markets where long-term growth in medicines will be driven by aging populations and the related rise in chronic diseases, increasing incomes and expanding access to care. We've built our business over time through a series of strategic steps to be powered globally but driven locally. Our global scale sets us apart and provides a unique competitive advantage versus local players, particularly when it comes to manufacturing and innovation. And our local decision-making allows us to be nimble and navigate the complexities of each country. Health care spending in most emerging markets is less than half that of developed markets, which means there's lots of room for future growth. And our focus continues to be on strong execution across all elements of our business model to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead.  Moving to Diagnostics, where we've consistently achieved above-market growth with our leading platforms. 2018 was no different with global organic sales growth of 7%. This past year was particularly important as we accelerated the launch of Alinity, our family of highly differentiated instruments in Europe and other international markets. Customer feedback has been outstanding, which, quite frankly, isn't a surprise to us given that Alinity was designed based on countless hours of listening to and observing the needs of our customers. These systems are designed to be more efficient, running more tests in less space, generating results faster, minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results. In 2019, while the international launch continues to gain momentum, we anticipate obtaining U.S. regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our test menu over the coming months, which will allow us to accelerate the launch of Alinity in the U.S. later this year. 2018 was also an important year for our newly formed Rapid Diagnostics business. We achieved our sales and synergy targets for the year and are very pleased with the pace and progress of the integration of this business. We also made important advancements in our pipeline with new product launches in the areas of diabetes and cardiac care as well as molecular rapid tests for infectious diseases. These new products, along with continued focus on strong execution across our portfolio, will drive accelerated growth for this business going forward. And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 9% in 2018, exceeding the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of the year. Strong growth this past year was led by several areas, including Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care, as well as stabilization in our Rhythm Management and Vascular businesses. In Electrophysiology, growth of 20% was led by our heart mapping and ablation portfolio. During the year, we advanced our product portfolio in this area with the launch of our Advisor HD Catheter, which creates highly detailed maps of the heart. And earlier this week, we announced U.S. FDA approval of our innovative TactiCath Sensor Enabled Catheter, which will further strengthen our competitiveness in this highly underpenetrated market.  In Structural Heart, 2018 was a landmark year for our business. We achieved double-digit growth and, perhaps more importantly, announced clinical trial results for MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive repair of the mitral valve, which demonstrated improved survival and clinical outcomes in patients with the most prevalent form of this heart disease. We submitted this study data to the U.S. FDA during the fourth quarter to support consideration of an expanded indication for MitraClip. If approved, this advancement would further enhance our leadership position in this large and highly underpenetrated disease area and offer the potential to create a new multibillion-dollar cardiac device market over time. And lastly, in Diabetes Care, we achieved growth of 35% in 2018. Growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, which achieved global sales of more than $1 billion, an increase of 100% versus the prior year. During the fourth quarter, we added 300,000 new users. As of the end of 2018, there are now approximately 1.3 million active users worldwide, of which approximately 2/3 are type 1 diabetics and 1/3 are type 2. In the U.S., we saw an accelerating trend of new users as we ramped up our awareness efforts during the second half of the year, and pharmacy insurance coverage continued to increase, including an emerging trend of seeing Libre granted preferred copay status versus competitive systems due to its compelling overall value proposition. In Europe, during the fourth quarter, we initiated the launch of Libre 2.0, which includes optional alarms that warn patients if glucose levels fallout range. Due to our unique product design and a highly automated manufacturing process, we're able to offer this feature to Libre users without increasing the cash pay price. This affordable and simple-to-use device is fundamentally changing the way people with diabetes manage their disease. And given the fact that more than 400 million people are living with diabetes around the world, Libre promises to be a significant growth driver for years to come. So in summary, 2018 was another outstanding year for us. We achieved our strategic and financial objectives despite challenging currency shifts during the year. Our top-tier performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy, our portfolio and our execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting continued strong organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2018 results and our 2019 outlook in a bit more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 6.4% on an organic basis, in line with our guidance of mid- to high single-digit growth. Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired in late 2017 and is therefore not included in our 2018 organic sales growth results, achieved sales of $548 million. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on fourth quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen modestly, resulting in a somewhat larger unfavorable impact on our results in the fourth quarter compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.2% of sales.  Overall, as we look back at 2018, we delivered strong organic sales growth of more than 7%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% and exceeded our cash flow and debt repayment objectives. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2019. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25. For the full year, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses, partially offset by the impact of currency. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 29.5% of sales. We forecast net interest expense of around $600 million and nonoperating income of around $200 million. Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 15% for the full year 2019, which contemplates the anticipated impact from U.S. tax reform. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.60 to $0.62, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of a little less than 7%, which contemplates a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of last year, when we saw abnormally strong sales in our Rapid Diagnostics business due to a record flu season. At current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 5.5% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 58.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales.  Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business.  For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter, which is comprised of mid- to high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging markets, along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent discontinuation of a noncore low-margin third-party supply agreement. For the full year, we forecast Established Pharmaceuticals growth of mid- to high-single digits. In Nutrition, we forecast low- to mid-single-digit growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy Diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of Core Laboratory, Molecular and Point of Care, to grow mid- to high-single digits for both the first quarter and full year, driven by the continued strong sales momentum across our portfolio of instruments.  Rapid Diagnostics, which will now be included in our organic sales growth results in 2019, is expected to be relatively flat in the first quarter, reflecting the difficult flu season comparison I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we forecast Rapid Diagnostics growth of low- to mid-single digits.  And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Matt Taylor from UBS. Matthew Taylor : Wanted to ask about FreeStyle Libre to start off. You had another good quarter of patient adds, and it seems like you're expanding more into type 2 with the new disclosure. Could you talk about the trends there, what's the 2.0 adds and some of your longer-term vision for Libre? Miles White : Yes, sure, Matt. Well, a few things about Libre -- or actually several things about Libre. First of all, it's going extremely well. We did add 300,000 patients last quarter. That's almost equivalent to the entire user base of the #2 competitor in the space. So I'd say that's going very well. We got over 1.3 million patients now. 2/3 of those are type 1. Our intent with this device has been to serve the entire diabetic community and not niche it because we think it has mass-market potential worldwide. So we target both segments, both type 1 and type 2. And we're doing very well in type 1 segment -- the type 1 segment actually. And as our capacity expands, we'll put even more effort behind the expansion with type 2 patients. There's a constant, I'll say, cadence of enhancements, et cetera, to the product. We've recently launched 2.0 in Europe. That should come to the U.S. shortly. We're -- we've obviously invested a fair bit in capacity expansion. And at the rate we're adding patients, obviously, that's something we started paying attention to a couple of years ago. And I'd say, a significant quantum of capacity will come online in the second half of this year. And from my perspective, that allows us to open the floodgate much wider. At this point, we're having a tremendous amount of success with Libre without putting much push behind it. And at that point, we're going to have an ability to turn on a lot of push. So -- and then we've got steady cadence of capacity additions after that. And because of the magnitude and the size of the diabetic market, both for type 1 diabetics and type 2 diabetics, our view was this had to have a value proposition for patients and for the health care system that was accessible and affordable by everybody and not just driven by a rebate system and so forth. So we've got a very low cost position. We've got a good value access price point. And I think all of that is playing through our markets and our patient groups and influence groups and so forth very well. The product obviously is getting all the emphasis in development, et cetera, that anybody would like to see. I think this is a very big, long-term, sustainable growth product for the company. I don't have any other way to say it. This is a happy, happy topic. Matthew Taylor : Yes, it's been phenomenal growth. I was just curious, as you look forward in segmenting the market, you now have Libre 2 with alarms. You have partnership with a pump company. Can you talk about how you might bifurcate your strategy to go after different segments, whether you need low-cost offering and a higher feature offering as you kind of expand through the Libre portfolio? Miles White : Well, I think -- I'm going to be careful how much I say publicly on the phone. I think you can assume that we're obviously developing every aspect of this product that you can imagine. And that's all going very well. I wouldn't communicate what I would forecast as time lines. I think that the current growth rate speaks for itself. The current submissions and features of the product that we're adding speak for themselves. We're pretty highly focused on bringing that capacity online, and not because we're constrained yet, but right now, we're adding as, I said, 300,000 patients a quarter and growing. And so you have to pay attention to keeping that momentum increasing. And at this point, with that many patients and the magnitude of the opportunity, our intent is to make this very much a mass-market product. But with 40 million type 1 diabetics out there, mass market means every one of those type 1 diabetics ought to be able to access this product economically, and that's worldwide. And then of course, there's an enormous type 2 market beyond that. So this is not a product that's targeted solely at type 1 or solely at type 2. Its accuracy and performance obviously has meaning and efficacy in all segments. Our low -- our cost position is as low as anything in the industry. We have probably #1 cost position, #1 volume of patients position. I think we can pretty easily declare ourselves the leader in continuous glucose monitoring and growing faster than everybody else. So I'd just say that all of the things that you would expect us to be doing, including working with other third-party partners who would benefit from this technology, all underway, have been for some time. Operator : And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Miles, maybe I can ask a guidance question. So Abbott's guidance for 2019 is 6.5% to 7.5%, basically in line with 2018 and a bit better than The Street was expecting to start the year. So maybe you could give us a little background what your confidence is at the starting point? And maybe specifically, touch on some of the key growth drivers for 2019 that people are focused on. MitraClip, you talked about Libre, and maybe hit on an Alinity. Miles White : Yes. Well, I think you've touched base there on several of them already. What you should read into that guidance is we had an outstanding '18 and we just gave you guidance that's even better than '18. And the underlying growth rates are strong. The pipelines are strong. It's all organic growth. It's not dependent on lapping an acquisition. It's not driven by lapping an acquisition. It's not dependent on acquiring something. And all the things that are driving our growth are coming right out of our own pipeline and launching globally. So if I take that a piece at a time, Libre as a story just gets better and better and better. So obviously, that's a pretty big and high-growth driver. That's a good thing. The Alinity program has had an outstanding year rolling out in the Core Lab, which is primarily driven by Europe. And we haven't really unleashed it yet fully in the U.S. or even fully in Asian markets. And as that menu reaches what I'll call critical mass, that will tip up as well. And so far, everything we've seen with the rollout in Europe has been exceptional. Our share capture, our retention of rolling over a lot of our own customers and our own installed base, our price point and value point were, I'd say, extremely competitive, but it's better than that. And so that's going well, and that momentum only gets better as we expand geographies. And frankly, there's a couple of aspects to that program that haven't really gone to market yet fully, our hematology piece, et cetera. So I think those are strong drivers. When we acquired Alere in the diagnostic space, it was a declining to slightly best -- at best, flat business. And that's been a nice story for us in terms of integrating it. We're going to be looking for now improving the growth of the new product pipeline and momentum going forward in that business, which is incrementally positive for the business. As I already mentioned, Nutrition, compared to the prior 4, 5 years, has a nice, steady, sustainable forward-looking growth in the, let's call it, 3% to 5% range, somewhere in there. And that's a plus, that's an upside. The pipeline in devices is strong. It's good. I mean, we spoke earlier in the year about the COAPT trial driving MitraClip in Structural Heart. And there's a nice pipeline of products and enhancements coming behind that. We just launched or got approval for HeartMate 3 for destination therapy, some additional catheters in our Electrophysiology business that help us be even more competitive than the 20% growth rate we've got now. Just everything across the board gets better. Where do we see problems? Well, we got a couple of places that we're not too happy about our own performance in. We know neuromod is a super good growth business. We expect to see sequentially improving growth out of that business over the course of the year. I've talked about that on previous calls. We believe we're in control of our destiny there. And if we -- if anything, I probably estimated the speed at which we could correct our direction there wrong. It's taken a little longer than I would have guessed. But that's going to get sequentially better, and I think that's a plus. The Point of Care business that's part of our Diagnostic business, not Alere but the -- our own Point of Care business, we had some corrections to make in our strategy, and we've done that. And so I'm quite optimistic that our management team there has a good path, a good management team, et cetera. That'll improve. So if I had a concern at all, it's the things I can't control. I think our fundamental underlying strategy in the pharmaceutical business is solid. I think the underlying growth rates in emerging markets are solid. I know the world worries about the volatility of those markets and the reliability of those markets and, in particular, currency. And we're all going to live with currency if we're a multinational company, and I don't think we're any different. And to be honest, we're not that differently indexed now with the addition of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics and so forth in the company. So while we may have, let's call it, individual spotty circumstances in any given emerging market in any given year, which we kind of expect, I think the underlying growth of that business, driven by the development of those economies, the health care systems, is solid. So I look at all aspects of the company. Whenever we're not performing where we think we should in a given business, we do take corrective steps. And as I look across the portfolio, every single business which had such a great year last year actually had a little better one this year or a lot better one this year and on a sustainable basis going forward. So as I look forward into '19, I note that there's a lot of caution in the world about economies and any number of other things. We base our growth rates and our growth projections on our products, on the market dynamics we see in each of our product areas in the segments we compete in. And we've got a rich portfolio of products right now and a rich portfolio of products coming out of our organic R&D and a lot of longevity on the driving of those products in the market for years to come. So whatever the windiness of the currency markets or other things may be, we've demonstrated through '18 and will demonstrate into '19 that we can power through that and continue to deliver the kind of growth that our shareholders reliably expect. Robert Marcus : Great, that's really helpful. And maybe one for Brian. On the bottom line, EPS guidance implies growth of 9% to 13% on a reported basis, closer to mid-teens on a constant currency basis. This is higher than what we've seen in the past from Abbott but also off the higher starting top line. So as we go through the year, if there's incremental upside, how should investors think about the willingness to allow that to fall to the bottom line versus reinvesting in the business at these growth rates? Brian Yoor : I'll defer to Miles on that question because I know he makes the choices ultimately between the balance of growth, the sustainable growth versus what we give back to shareholders. But I think we've shown a good propensity to be balanced in that. We showed that demonstration even last year as we gave some pennies back to The Street when we had a variable tax rate but invested heavily in the growth opportunities that Miles talked about that creates the kind of sustainable growth that we're looking for. Your math is right. I said back on the October call that exchange would be around 4% to the bottom line impact. It's just a little touch above 4%. You could imply that, that would mean about mid-teens EPS growth. And even as you look at our quarters, I mentioned in my script that FX would be more front-end loaded. It's a first half phenomenon. But underlying growth that we're portraying here for the first quarter and the full year is pretty range-bound in that underlying double-digit earnings per share growth of the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of points. And there's a lot of underlying gross margin improvement still going on across our businesses. There's a lot of synergy still being captured in gross margins as well as in SG&A as it pertains to our continued integration with St. Jude and also with Rapid Diagnostics. So you're seeing the margin expansion come through in our op margin line in our guidance. Miles White : Yes, I'd reiterate a couple of things. This is Miles. First of all, Brian mentioned, exchange, as we know it right now, is factored into our guidance, and we're still at a double-digit EPS growth. The exchange that we're, I don't know, seeing in our guidance is a factor of last year, meaning '18, that we've got to lap. And so it's that roll-through that is currently taking us from what otherwise would have been 15% to what at the midpoint would be 11%. So we're still at healthy double digits and it's, in effect, caused by lapping last year's guidance. None of us are currency traders, so there's no way to kind of predict what's going to happen with the year, and I hesitate to do so for fear that fates strike us down. But with regard to profits and performance and so forth, I'd say the company has always been fortunate that it's had strong profits and strong cash flow. And with regard to forecasting and so forth, we start every year with a double-digit target and a high bar, and that's our aspiration every single year. And gosh, more often than not, that's where we start with our guidance. Now having said that, out of the last 11 years -- and why do I not go back further than 11 years? I don't have the data, but I could get it. But in -- out of the last 44 quarters that we have reported, we have beat 39 of them, exceeded the investors' expectations, beat 39 of them and met on 5. And so I think the company has demonstrated that if it exceeds its expectations, if it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, if it exceeds in performance, we do share that back to our investors in increased profitability or increased return to the investor. And there's no reason to see a change to that. We've got strong cash flow. We are able to cover all of our cash and investment needs from a capital standpoint, from a dividend standpoint. We have the capacity to buy back shares to offset dilution and, frankly, buy back shares if it's the best investment that we can make. We have the capacity to do M&A. We've obviously been able to pay down a lot of debt and very, very rapidly so that we would have the balance sheet flexibility that we want. So we had very strong performance, strong profitability, strong cash flow. And so if we exceed our expectations and our performance, then obviously, we have the decision -- and that's a nice place to be. We have the decision to share that with our investors, which is exactly what our investors would expect. And you can tell that 90% of the quarters for the last 11 years, investors have benefited. Operator : Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Miles, just a couple for you. In thinking about or listening to your commentary on 2019, the one comment that comes to mind was balance, your commentary that most businesses get better or a lot better. That being said, a lot of investors are still very focused on Libre and MitraClip. So as you think about the guidance and how it was formulated, how dependent is 2019 guidance on a significant inflection for MitraClip or a Libre 2 product launch? Miles White : Zero. David Lewis : Okay, that's pretty clear. I guess we can leave it at that. The second point, so... Miles White : No, it is. I mean -- I think, I mean, to be honest, I'm not trying to be coy with you. It's very hard to predict what the regulatory timing will be, for example, on MitraClip. So -- and there's no reason for us to kind of play with the number and play with something that we're not sure we can predict. So what we do know is when it comes, which is very compelling -- there's a number of things that have to happen. FDA has to approve it. We obviously would want CMS to reimburse it and so on. And I think it'll have that kind of compelling story with the regulatory bodies. It's obviously -- the COAPT study was very powerful, and I think the regulatory bodies will give that all the right consideration. But trying to pin that down and trying to pin down timing and so forth is not something that's easy to do. And I'm not sure we'd be doing our investors any good service by trying to predict that. What I do know is it's compelling. When it comes, it'll come and it'll have impact. And rather than put it in our estimates, we haven't. David Lewis : Okay, very clear. And then just following up on another point you made in this morning. Thinking about the balance sheet, I mean, you went from 2 years ago an overlevered company to now, frankly, relative to peers an underlevered company. I think debt paydown and free cash generation were sort of unsung heroes of last year. So many of other companies have picked up the relative pace of M&A. You're still growing at a pretty robust 7-plus percent rate without significant M&A the last couple of years. So where do you stand now as you think about reinvestment for growth? How active are you likely to be in '19 relative to '18 on the M&A front? Miles White : Well, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, you earn your highest return on organic growth and not your highest return on M&A. And then I mean, as you know, a lot of M&A deals struggle to return a good return to shareholders. We've had, let's say, an excellent track record -- going back deep in our history with Knoll and Humira and so forth, we've had a really good track record with the M&A we've done over time. And we've managed those companies and their products well over time. So I'd say, first of all, you make much higher return on your organic growth. The growth we're getting from all of our businesses and even St. Jude is coming out of pipeline, and it's coming out of our own organic development, et cetera. And right now, those are the highest returns, those are the highest, biggest opportunities, and we certainly don't see gaps right now that we have to fill with M&A. So we're able to return a pretty good sales and profit growth rate across the business. We've also been careful over time. There's times to be in the M&A markets and there's times not to be. And when multiples are really high, bad time to buy. And -- but to be honest, I don't see anything right now that is so appealing that we feel like that's necessarily a good direction for us. And the kinds of things we might look at, well, I would never tell you anyway, and you know that. But right now, our opportunities are so good with our own organic products and execution that we don't need it. And there's not something that's so attractive -- all of the various investment banking houses that you can imagine have put many things in front of us as opportunities as they do every company, et cetera. So it's not like we're not aware of what opportunities may be out there. It's just they wouldn't meet our criteria. I don't see something compelling. I don't see something that we need. And right now, we're in a fortunate position where we've got very strong products and pipelines and strategies across all of our businesses. I will say we can execute better in some places, but you can't buy that. So we fix our own execution with our talent and strategies and so forth. But it's just not necessary for us to put our money into M&A right now because I don't think we'd turn a better return for our shareholders now or at least in the foreseeable future doing that. We're going to make a lot more money for our shareholders, investing in our growth, investing in the products we have, investing in our expansion, investing in our own capital. And as you know, we have plenty of cash flow to do that, and we have plenty of cash flow that we can still return increasing dividends. And at some point here, we'll have a choice. We're going to keep paying down debt because I think it's a good idea. Our debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now is below 2, and as you know, it was more like 4 to 4.3 when we completed the Alere and St. Jude deals. That wasn't that long ago. So to have brought our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down that far and that fast, and particularly, as we look forward in a rising interest rate environment or potentially so, depending on what you believe, I think we're doing the right things in the management of our balance sheet. I wanted to get that debt down fast; we have. I wanted to have strategic flexibility; we have it. What I really want is capital allocation flexibility to earn the right returns and the optimal returns for our shareholders, and I think we're in that position. So I just don't see M&A right now as a high priority. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : I'm going to take the flip side of David's question. Instead of thinking about M&A and adding things, how do you feel about having all 4 legs of the stool remain in the Abbott house? I think there was some lay press discussion regarding a possible sale of the nutritionals business. Miles White : Well, I get that speculation, jeez, if I don't get it every quarter, it's almost every quarter. So thanks for asking the question, Joanne. We like our mix right now. There's a role to everything in our portfolio. And the one I'm asked more frequently about than anything is Nutrition. And you can transact, you can try to make money for your shareholders with transactions, but I would say this : as you know, Joanne, I've been in this job a long time. And earlier in my tenure, there was a role for Nutrition in our portfolio. And I got the same question then. And one of the roles was it's got a global presence, global infrastructure. It's highly profitable, generates a lot of cash. And a lot of the M&A activities and other things that we did back in my earlier years benefited from the cash flows and position of Nutrition. And even today, there are great benefits to our Nutrition business to the company. And that's not to say that any given part of the company has to be part of it. It's clearly a different business as is our pharmaceutical business, et cetera. But today, I'd say, look, it makes sense as part of our company. I don't think we need to be considering a transaction just to do it. We're well valued. We're performing well. I don't honestly think I would create more value for our investors by separating it. If everybody asks you about it often enough, you go look at it. Okay, I've looked at it. I don't think we can create differential improved value for our shareholders than what is already being executed by us. I think that's a plus. I think that in general, while a lot of people might ask me about it, it's also performing well. I'm happy that it's performing a lot better than it did for a couple of years there. So it's just not on my radar screen. I don't think we're going to improve Abbott. I don't think we're going to create value by considering it. And I think we'll distract ourselves with that at a time we don't even need to be distracted. So it's just not on my radar screen as a way to create value for shareholders because I don't think it will. And I think it's being well valued as part of Abbott as is the rest of Abbott. So it's just not on my radar screen and -- nor do I think it's necessarily beneficial to us. I guess that's the simplest thing to say. Joanne Wuensch : Okay, appreciate that. As a follow-up, 2 businesses I just want to talk about the pipeline. Neuromod, what does it take to reaccelerate that growth rate? And then you talked about an Alere pipeline, which I don't think The Street is really focused on. If you could just give us some highlights there. Miles White : Yes. So first of all, the single biggest thing that immediately will change how we're doing in neuromod is actually our sales force expansion in the U.S. and our training and execution there. And that's what we're focused on. Then longer term, we put a lot of emphasis in our R&D pipeline. We have a number of new people, new management, broader pipeline under development, I'm not going to give you any kind of insights to it and so forth because I don't really want to get the world focused on it. But it's an area where we think there's a lot of opportunity in the types of products we have. We don't think we've sort of fully gotten the benefit of the 2 main products we have now. And so I'd say it's got our attention. We've doubled our investment in R&D there. And I think in the coming years, we'll see that roll out. What was the second part after neuromod? Joanne Wuensch : Pipeline in Alere. Miles White : Rapid Diagnostics. We've reorganized the Rapid Diagnostics business into 4 segments. Each of them has their emphasis, their target. Each has an R&D plan. Each has a new product plan. We are increasing our investment in R&D also there. I can give you a couple of high points and examples. Infectious disease product, ID now, which we think has got a lot of potential that we're rolling out. The Afinion 2 cardiometabolic platform, another opportunity that we're putting emphasis behind. But I think there's -- generally speaking, there's a lot more possibility for us in incrementally updating and renewing a number of these platforms, and then there's newer stuff than that. And so when we took over the company, which we've now had in our possession a little over a year, one of our targets was to get our hands around the R&D of each of these segments and make sure we had an R&D plan in place, so there was a steady cadence of improvements and new products in each of these businesses. That does take a little time. In our first year, a lot of our focus was stabilizing the organization, its structure, the management, people, execution of what we've got, synergies, et cetera, which we've talked about. Now our attention turns to this, and it has been. I mean, we've been increasing our spending and increasing our focus on this. And that's what the management team is focused on now, is that new product cadence. So beyond that, I don't want to be more specific. Otherwise, we'll be tracking it all here. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Just wanted to follow up, if I might, on the commentary earlier on MitraClip given its visibility. Can you just give us a sense as to what the growth rate of MitraClip was in the fourth quarter? And then to be clear, relative to your earlier comments, do you really not assume U.S. approval and reimbursement for MitraClip in FMR at all in 2019? Is that -- that's not assumed at all? Miles White : No, that's not what I said, and that's not what the question was. I'm not assuming that. But the question was whether or not that was pivotal to making our earnings guidance for the year or our sales guidance. And the answer was, it has no bearing on our sales and earnings guidance for the year. But you're asking me a different question now, do I expect approval? And I'd say, well, we'll see. I mean, we're certainly hopeful that we'll get that kind of consideration. And is it possible? I suppose it's possible, but we don't know. We just don't know. Scott? Scott Leinenweber : Yes. With respect to the MitraClip growth rate, MitraClip grew about 30% in the fourth quarter. Robert Hopkins : Okay. So it accelerated a little bit. Okay, I hear you on MitraClip. And then the other sort of product-oriented question that I wanted to ask is that you mentioned in your remarks that Libre is getting some preferred copay status. And I was just -- I found that intriguing. I was just wondering if you could expand on what that means specifically, how broad the program is. Is that just because Libre is a little lower cost? Or are payers trying to incentivize patients to use Libre? So maybe just a little color on the copay status. Scott Leinenweber : Yes. I mean, as you think about copay status and the way payers use it, that is essentially what they're trying to do, is they're trying to incent a preferred offering with respect to the value proposition that, that offering brings. So as we progress in the second half of the year in our payer dialogue, we saw that certain payers were starting to put Libre in a higher tier, Tier 2, which would result for the end patient in a lower copay, quite frankly. And again, I think as they look at the overall value proposition, the outcomes data and whatnot, they see a compelling argument to do it, and we're starting to see that trend. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Glenn Novarro : Two device questions. First, on Rhythm Management in the quarter, down 2% to 3%. Is that market softness? Or are you guys just losing share to Boston Scientific because of their HeartLogic feature or losing share to Medtronic because they've got Micra, the leadless pacer? So that's the first question. And then the Vascular business, down 5% in the U.S. That would -- that's surprising to me given you're launching XIENCE Sierra. So similar question, is this just the market is weaker in drug-eluting stents for the U.S.? Is it more pricing pressure? Or is the product simply not gaining traction? Scott Leinenweber : Yes. I'll start with Rhythm Management here. And as you know, when we acquired that business, it was declining at a fairly heavy clip. We've been able to stabilize it. The overall market, to your point, is down modestly, and our performance is generally in line with that. When it comes to Vascular, same thing. Again, the market is down modestly. XIENCE Sierra is doing well. It's capturing share. In fact, we gained about 5 share points since the launch of XIENCE Sierra. Pricing in the space remains a challenge for all of the market, but XIENCE Sierra is definitely performing there. And quite frankly, our performance overall is a little bit above the market. Miles White : Glenn, what you're also seeing there is a reduction in third-party royalty revenue, not share. The stent and the system, XIENCE Sierra, are capturing share, but what you're seeing is the roll-through of loss of a third-party revenue. Glenn Novarro : Okay. And one follow-up. Can you give us an update on both your TAVR and mitral program? TAVR, specifically Portico, when do we see a U.S. filing and approval? And then mitral, update on Tendyne enrollment and then maybe comment on the latest acquisition. Scott Leinenweber : Yes. On TAVR, we would expect to file that here in the second half of this year. We're wrapping up that trial as we speak. With respect to Tendyne and Cephea, obviously, we're expanding them. We've had a long-term vision here in the mitral space to really build a toolbox. Tendyne, we filed actually for CE Mark before the end of last year. So we could possibly see approval here this year. The U.S. is still several years away. And the Cephea program looks like a really great program, but again, still several years away. Operator : And our final question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Frederick Wise : Maybe just one big picture and one product question. Brian has done and the team has done a fabulous job paying down debt. You highlighted some thoughts about the -- your comfort in not doing M&A in today's portfolio. Obviously, that suggests share buyback and dividend. You've touched on it a little bit. But just wondering, are you feeling strongly about taking your excess cash and dividing it equally depending on stock price? I mean, do you have a priority? Is there some -- how are you thinking about it? Miles White : No, I don't think about it as dividing it equally. There's -- for any particular capital use, there's a timing, and there's -- or there's a need. If we got to invest in capacity internally and manufacturing and so forth, obviously, that's a good thing. And as I've said, we can afford all of that and more. We're keeping our dividend healthy. We target our dividend generally in a range 40% or higher of our EPS as a payout ratio, a nice healthy range. And a number of our peer group don't do that at all. So I think we've got a good healthy dividend. And that matters to us because we have a large segment of investors that care about that. With regard to M&A, M&A is necessarily opportunistic. It depends on the product, the company, the business, the timing, market values, multiple, all sorts of things. And right now, I don't see any of that lining up to say, \"Wow, there's something we're dying to go look at.\" And then with regard to share buybacks, Rick, it sort of depends on valuations in the market. There's times when share buybacks aren't that economical and other times when they're high return. And on our case, right now, we've got the flexibility. If we want to do any kind of share buyback just to offset dilution and so forth, we can do that. And -- but I think you kind of -- you got to look at it and say, \"Is that my best use of cash?\" I still want to pay down debt. I don't want to assume we're just going to carry this forward. We paid down a lot of debt fast. It would actually be in our interest to keep doing that, to keep paying it down. I think we're well into a reasonable range now of debt, but we still want to keep paying that debt down. And our cash flow is strong enough that we do have choice. We do -- we have the ability to pay the dividend. We have the ability to do all these things. We can satisfy our capital needs internally. So I think -- I guess the best thing about it is we don't think about it in any mechanistic or formula way, dividing it in half or whatever. We kind of look at where the best -- where the need is and where the best return is. And I think it behooves us to leave ourselves also in a very strong position at a lower debt level. So we got places to use it and places to use it economically. When -- before tax reform, when so much cash was trapped overseas, we were fortunate that we had M&A opportunities to invest that cash for good return. We're not stuck like that now. We can manage cash, manage the cash flows of the company and so forth far more efficiently in terms of the best returns or the best needs. And that's kind of how we look at it. If we find that our best use of the cash or a strong use of the cash is share buybacks, we'd certainly consider that. But right now, I wouldn't say that's our highest priority either. It's still a high priority to just keep paying down the debt. And a couple of years down the road here, depending on what happens with interest rates and so forth, we'd probably be glad we did, and we'll have tremendous strategic flexibility and still have very strong cash flow. So I think it just depends on circumstances at a given point in time. Frederick Wise : Yes, that's a great answer. And just last, maybe quickly, I know you love to talk about what could push you to the upper end of your 6.5% to 7% guidance for '19. But there were some wild cards that helped out. You exceeded your initial 2018 organic growth guidance in '18. Maybe just touch on quickly, if you would, what could push you to the upper end or above for your '19 range? Miles White : Oh, I think there's -- Rick, I think there's a number of product things that could do that. We've already mentioned MitraClip is a possibility. And it wouldn't take a whole lot, a couple of ticks in any of these businesses of improvement. Last year, our Nutrition business actually did better than we expected. We thought it would do better than prior years, but it did better than that and better than we expected. And some of those tick-ups make a big difference. And so I think if we turn the corner as we expect to and plan to, things like neuromod and other places where we know the fundamental underlying business is strong, it doesn't take a whole lot to sort of correct the underperformance of some businesses, whether it's our Point of Care business or neuromod or some of individual countries in the pharmaceutical business. And the upside here is fairly strong. Scott Leinenweber : Very good. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that first quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we announced results for the first quarter and we're off to another good start. Our sales growth was strong and right on target, coming in at 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, and ongoing earnings per share of $0.63 exceeded our previous guidance range. Our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.25 remains unchanged and reflects midteens growth at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. As we've discussed previously, our emphasis today is on organic execution in the company. Today, all of our businesses have positive long-term outlooks and are well positioned with excellent products and attractive markets. At the start of the year, we issued guidance that reflected another year of strong performance. And for the first quarter, we're right on track with those expectations. We're particularly pleased with the exceptional performance of several long-term growth drivers that are leading the way, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and the Alinity systems. These life-changing technologies are positively impacting lives and achieving impressive results. I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Brian, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales were led by Core Laboratory growth of 10%. Alinity, our family of next-generation diagnostic systems, is driving strong growth internationally, and we continue to achieve significant above-market growth in the United States. In Europe, we are both converting existing customers to Alinity and winning competitive bids for new business at a very high rate. We also recently increased our launch efforts for Alinity h, our hematology system, and obtained CE Mark for Alinity m, our highly automated Molecular Diagnostics system along with several infectious disease tests. And we're expanding our menu of tests in key markets such as China and the United States. With a steady menu expansion on multiple different instruments across geographies, Alinity will be a significant growth driver for years to come. In Nutrition, sales increased more than 6.5% in the quarter, reflecting strong execution and new product introductions. We continue to see good underlying market demand and growth, and we're achieving above-market growth in several geographies, particularly Asia and Latin America. Sales growth this quarter was balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses with our core leading brands of Similac, PediaSure and Ensure all contributing to strong growth overall. In Established Pharmaceuticals, sales growth of 5.5% was right in line with our expectations and was a sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by a 7.5% growth in our key emerging markets, which represent the most attractive long-term growth countries for our branded generics portfolio and include India, Brazil, Russia and China, along with several other emerging countries. Underlying growth dynamics in these countries continue to remain strong and intact. And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 10%, led by strong double-digit growth in Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Diabetes Care. In Heart Failure, growth of 23% was led by rapid U.S. market adoption of our HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device following FDA approval of a long-term use indication late last year. The superior patient outcomes demonstrated in the clinical trial that supported this approval have been a critical component of the growth and the share capture that we're achieving. In Structural Heart, several products across our broad portfolio contributed to strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, a condition caused by a leaky heart valve.  During the quarter, we announced U.S. FDA approval for a new expanded indication for MitraClip, which significantly expands the number of people that can be treated. The formal process of seeking Medicare reimbursement for this new indication has been initiated. During the quarter, we also filed for CE Mark for our new triclip device, a first of its kind minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve. We plan to initiate our U.S. pivotal trial for triclip in the coming months. I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where sales grew over 40% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, or CGM. Libre continues to perform exceptionally well with worldwide sales of $380 million in the quarter, reflecting growth of 80% with global leadership among CGM systems for both type 1 and type 2 users. In order to meet the tremendous demand that we're seeing for Libre, we're adding a significant amount of new manufacturing capacity, which will come online starting in the second half of this year.  So in summary, we're right on track with our high expectations to start the year. All of our long-term growth drivers are intact and achieving significant growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. And we're well positioned to achieve the top tier sales and EPS growth targets that we set at the beginning of the year. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.  Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 7.1%, and exchange had a negative impact of 4.8% on sales versus the prior year. Reported sales increased 2% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.6% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.3% of sales. All of these ratios were in line with previous guidance.  Turning to our outlook for the full year. We continue to forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current exchange rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales for the full year. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.81, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of around 7%. And at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 4% on our second quarter reported sales. We forecasted adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of a little less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $150 million in the second quarter. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit growth, which is comprised of mid- to high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging markets along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent continuation of a noncore, low-margin supply agreement. In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy Diagnostics business, which is comprised of Core Laboratory, Molecular Point of Care, to grow mid- to high single digits. In Rapid Diagnostics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Matthew Taylor : So it was encouraging to see a lot of the big growth drivers here stay on track and really drive healthy double-digit growth. I was wondering if you could spend some time on each of those and specifically address Libre. I think a lot of investors are anticipating Libre 2 and other enhancements that you could make there in addition to all the capacity you're adding. So can you talk about the pathway for Libre and some of the other big growth drivers? Miles White : Sure, Matt. Thank you. I think I would say a couple things first before I focus just on Libre. We're seeing strength across the board in a lot of device and diagnostic areas. There is a geography here and there, a product line here and there that we might not be completely satisfied with. But I think if you look at us, our product areas, even competitors in various spaces in medical devices, this whole sector is doing pretty well and the growth rates have improved in a number of cases. I know that there was a lot preearnings noise out there about the continuity of the med device sector. I have to say from my perspective, I see nothing but a strong sector going forward. While we've got great pipelines and great products, I think the entire sector has a bright future ahead of us here and the markets are all pretty attractive for us. So first of all, I think we're in a much healthier environment than might be reflected right now, and I think a lot of companies are actually doing really well in that environment. There's a lot of good new products and pipelines out there. I think the whole thing is pretty healthy. And then specifically to us, we've got, in our case, I think great pipeline, great new products and launches in many of the segments and sectors we're in. To focus on Diabetes Care as a start, that's been a particular bright spot where, clearly, new technology and affordable technology has made a very big difference in life for diabetics, both type 1 and type 2 worldwide. Libre has been a pretty powerful leader in that segment on all accounts and all points. We've been pretty enthused about its success, its uptake, its reception by patients all over the world. In a fairly short amount of time, we've achieved global leadership in terms of continuous glucose monitoring in both type 1 and type 2. I think part of the attraction to patients is obviously not having the finger stick. The information, the continuous nature of it, the way it allows diabetics to manage their health and manage diabetes has been life-changing, and that's been reflective. And I think very importantly, it's been affordable to a degree that it's really -- it's become a very broadly accessible technology, which was our intent with it. It's got a unique ease-of-use and it's got appeal for any kind of patient. So I think that's pretty important and it's reflected in the reimbursements worldwide. 80% of sales are now reimbursed internationally over 30 countries. Well over half of U.S. lives commercially -- commercial lives are covered. So we're seeing a lot of support for the product in all ways. We've mentioned a number of times that we've invested heavily in capacity expansion. That is correct. We put significant investment into that. And as we've noted a couple of times, the first waves of that come online in the second half of this year, and then there's a steady cadence of capacity expansions underway that will come online sequentially after that. There won't be any constraints to the growth that's possible there. I think it's going to be a very different kind of device or diagnostic product than we've seen in the past. Because there are so many of millions of diabetics worldwide, this is not a niche product, not for type 1s or type 2s. There's not a niche here. There's a massive population around the world that needs to manage diabetes, and this product will be broadly accessible to all of them. So it calls for quite a lot of capacity and in the second half of this year that will be initiated. We have a number of things we're expecting and waiting for. You asked about Libre 2. That is under review at the FDA. We have filed Libre 2 with alarms in the U.S. as an iCGM. We're not going to forecast FDA review time lines, but we clearly have expectations to achieve that milestone. I'm trying to think of what else to tell you about that. It's already on the market in Europe. Matthew Taylor : Maybe just one, that was very comprehensive, and I'll give you a second to think there. I think the one follow-up I had was just on Libre 2. You mentioned iCGM. Can you talk about your confidence in your ability to get that? And I also wanted to ask about the payer dynamics. Before -- last call, you talked about some preferential co-pays. Can you talk about any developments that you're seeing on the payer side in terms of support for Libre? Miles White : Yes. I'll tell you what, I'll let our Chief Operating Officer, who's come from that business, answer that question for you. Robert? Robert Ford : Yes. So on Libre 2, specifically in the U.S., the filing of iCGM, I'll just say we know what the iCGM standards are. We know what needs to be achieved. And we filed in the U.S. as an iCGM knowing what the standards need to be achieved. So we look at what we filed and we look at the standards, and we look at what we filed and we know that we meet those standards. So to Miles' point, we're not going to forecast here as to when that approval will come through. But I think it's clear in terms of what we filed and why we filed. Regarding payers, specifically in the U.S., I think that what we've always intended for this product is to remove some of the hurdles, and affordability was one of those. And if you look at a lot of the evolution of the reimbursement here in the U.S. that's slowly moving from something that was -- with a lot of prior authorizations, only going through mail order to now looking very much like the blood glucose monitoring market where we start to see less prior authorizations, formulary positions that are allowing patients to go to a pharmacy and pick that up. So a lot of our managed care strategy was focused on driving that shift, and a key part of that is the access and affordability. So we're seeing that in our managed care coverage. As Miles said, we're over 50% now of managed care life coverage in this patient population. And you see the shift into pharmacy. If you look at the script data, total Rxes, you can see that shift. You can see that occurring with Libre. And that was a very intentional strategy to accelerate adoption, specifically in the U.S., by going to pharmacy, which is something that hadn't been done before with CGM systems. And we did that, and we're starting to kind of move that category into the pharmacy. Miles White : Matt, I know you guys like that. You can track publicly. You can track that every week. And we've been pretty pleased with the performance going through pharmacy. The patient acquisition and so forth continues to be obviously strong, frankly, right in line with our growth rates around the world, as you'd expect, because we're not trying to drive price here. We're trying to drive the volume and acquisition of patients. And obviously, that's going pretty strongly. So there's nothing but happiness about this product. I can tell you, we're pretty happy with it. It's doing really well. I actually think we're kind of in its early stages. And at this point, there's over 1 million type 1 users of Libre around the world and those only make up 2/3 of our user base. So with this kind of a growth rate, that kind of a user base with the capacity expansion coming online, we're obviously expecting this to be a continuingly big and bigger product for us. Operator : Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Just a couple questions for me. One, more broadly for Miles and maybe a quick follow-up. Miles, I just wonder if you can kind of share with us how you see sort of the pacing of the year from here. I think in the fourth quarter, the messaging was core growth drivers very much intact, some one-off dynamics were suppressing growth and you expected that growth to improve in the first quarter. And sure enough, that's sort of what happened here, back in sort of the 7% range. As you think about the balance of the year, you had these core growth drivers doing relatively well, a couple of businesses probably not performing where you'd like to perform. So how do we think about the pacing of the business from the first quarter on given some of these very solid businesses and some of the businesses that are not performing as you'd like? Miles White : Well, a couple of sort of baseline comments there. Every year, we're going to the year and the gating of earnings per share for any given quarter tends to start out lower at the front end of the year and it always looks back-end loaded and -- toward the third and fourth quarters. I'd say, increasingly, that's leveling a little bit in that it's still a climb as the year goes on. But in our case, it's reflecting growth and penetration of new products. And there's a couple of seasonalities in there, but they're not big enough to really affect the overall earnings profile. We've increasingly seen stronger and stronger first quarters. But to be honest, third and fourth is always strong, but it's driven right now by the incredible growth of Alinity, Libre, HeartMate, MitraClip. There's so much real growth in the new products that are launching that it just gets better and better as the year rolls on. So I think it's always hard to gate to the penny. We try to get our estimates to a point like that. Then we're always subject to a couple of lumpy comparisons to whatever happened last year and so on, I guess, because it looks optically weird when it's bumpy. But the fact is the growth is steady. As you said, it's not only intact, it's strong. But there are a couple of places you could poke and say, \"Okay, you must not be satisfied with that.\" And I'd say, \"Yes, you're right about that.\" But while we've got some places we're putting a lot of more focus on and we've obviously miscalled the pace of improvement, I'd say, in general, I'm glad that what we have to work on for improvement is where it is and not in these major growth drivers. So Alinity is performing strongly. We are winning over 95% of accounts where we already have the business, and we're winning almost 2/3 of the accounts where we're head-to-head with an entrenched competitor. That's pretty powerful data when you consider that customers have to switch out mainframe systems. It's a big commitment. It takes months. There are long-term contracts. So -- but winning almost 2/3 of those new business, new accounts, that's pretty significant. That's a pretty powerful endorsement by the market of the Alinity systems and the laboratory solutions we're offering. We're seeing improvement in growth just about every place. I'm really pleased with Nutrition. I had to sit here on this call a number of times and explain, well, we're expecting it to get a little better. But it's performing really well and I think consistently so across all geographies and across both major product lines there. That's been a nice story. And we've estimated to you that the growth rate of that business going forward we will look for in the 4% to 6% range. And obviously, we're a little beyond that. I don't know that we're going to constantly be beyond that. But that 4% to 6% range is all good. So anywhere in there is pretty good for us. There does tend to be some up and down with it in some countries depending on holidays and seasons and so forth. But overall, if we're not watching it week to week, that's a pretty strong business right now and we like what we see. The management has done a great job worldwide. So as far as quarters coming, I'm hard-pressed to find a lot of things to point at as watchouts other than, as you pointed out, we got a couple of places where we think we've got work to do and to improve the performance of the business. I'm pleased that we can show that we know how to correct the performance of an underperforming business. But as you would probably rightly point out to me right now, there's a couple that are taking longer than I might have guessed. David Lewis : Okay. Miles, very helpful as we think about the balance of the year. So I guess my follow-up would just be the other major growth driver investors are focused on is MitraClip. So by our math, it looks like the U.S. business accelerated for MitraClip even before the NCD. And I wonder if you could just sort of, A, talk about your time at the NCD, what you're seeing in the U.S. And then we had this other study, MITRA-FR, in the European business and our sense on diligence is that's maybe suppressing some performance ex U.S. So maybe time of the NCD, U.S. trends and sort of what you're seeing ex U.S. and outlook for the year. Miles White : Okay. I'm going to have Robert take that. Robert Ford : Okay. So yes, we had a very good quarter in Structural Heart, and we showed growth across many of our different franchises and geographies. Obviously, MitraClip was a big driver and we're right where we wanted to be with MitraClip. The FDA approval was a few months ahead. But I think that speaks to the data and the evidence that was generated through COAPT. Label is very much in line with our expectations and reflects the COAPT patient enrollment criteria. So we're now obviously working on CMS. Process is underway. These usually take between 6 to 9 months. If you look at our experience when we achieved the primary MR reimbursement indication a few years back, that took us about 7.5 months from when we started to when we got it approved. So we know how to do this. We're currently in the process. And it'll just be a little bit difficult to forecast here, but we're very optimistic. But I'd say reimbursement is only one of the building blocks. It's definitely an important building block, but it's not the only one to really think about this business as a multiyear, double-digit kind of growth driver for us. There are other building blocks here that are very important that we're currently already underway. Opening of new centers is a key aspect here, and the timing and the framework and the cycle of how we do that is important. We have currently about 350 implanting centers in the U.S. And I think over the next few years, we'll see that number get to about 550. There's a lot of training that's involved here also, sales force training, center training, implanter training. And if you look at a sales rep, it'll usually take them between 6 to 9 months until they get fully proficient on MitraClip. So -- and then there's obviously the development, support and sustaining of a patient referral network as we build awareness of the therapy and the technology amongst the physician groups and ensure that those got funneled into our implant centers. So those are some of the key blocks. But I'd say we know how to do this. We've been doing it in the U.S. for the last 4 years and we're not going to wait for final CMS approval before we start hiring. We're already hiring more reps. We're expanding our sales force. We're expanding our clinical specialists so that we're going to be ready to go. So we're definitely taking an invest ahead approach here. So I like our position. The mitral is a tremendous opportunity, unmet need and an opportunity for Abbott. And quite frankly, we've been -- this position didn't happen just because of COAPT. We've been building this position for over a decade. So whether it's mitral repair or mitral repayment, we're in a pretty unique position. So I do see kind of sequential growth as we go through the year. Your question on MITRA-FR, yes, we did see that impact some of our European markets. And we know it's a French study, so it did have a little bit of an impact on some of the kind of implanting rates in some key European markets. But I think that's more of a transition thing. I don't think that's a fundamental change in the market in Europe. And we had expanded internationally to other large opportunities. Japan is another market where we see a very large opportunity for us. So that is also going to help kind of drive the growth. I think the Mitra-FR study will take another quarter or so to play out, but I -- we do expect the international business to kind of continue its growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Just have 2 pretty direct questions here. One more to focus on the growth drivers. On Alinity, a question on the U.S. launch. When do you think we'll see the full impact of that launch in the U.S.? When does that really show up in results in a meaningful way? Miles White : Bob, I'd say show up, we expect to get the almost full menu by the end of this year. Now that's kind of a running thing and we don't want to put a whole lot of effort out until we've got significant menu. We do have significant menu now, but we'd like to get more of it approved and then go. So I think you'll start to see the U.S. show up in the numbers really in 2020 because even if we were launching now, I think you'd be hard-pressed to see it relative to the size of the business worldwide. We're growing at 9% right now in the U.S. without much emphasis on Alinity. So I'd say you're probably going to see a measurable impact from it in 2020. But frankly, right now in the U.S., growth rate is pretty high even while we expand that menu. Robert Hopkins : Okay. And then the other question I just wanted to ask, obviously, you've got a lot of growth drivers that are driving really strong results in devices overall. One thing that's been a little weak is on the neuromod side the last couple of quarters. So I guess my question on neuromod is, do you think the weakness in the U.S. is related to a slower market at all? Or are these Abbott-specific issues? And when do you think we could expect a turn? Miles White : A good question. I kind of anticipated this one. This is the one where I'm going to fall on my own sword for how fast I forecast the turn here for us. Okay, there's clearly an Abbott issue here, our own management, which I've said before. And I think we, I in particular, have miscalled the pace at which we would turn our own performance. And where we underestimated that was we're expanding our sales force by 40% to 50%, and that's been a little more disruptive than I think we had expected. But I'm confident in the business. I'm confident in the management. I'm confident in the direction we're headed. I clearly wasn't right about the timing. So I'm not worrying about it from the standpoint of, boy, this business is really broken or hurt. It's not. And so I have a lot of confidence about that. As far as growth goes, I don't think that it's a high double-digit grower, but it's a double-digit grower. And I think in med devices and in some of these markets as it becomes established, to be maintaining a double-digit growth rate as a market segment, I think, is pretty healthy. So I haven't -- we're not losing any confidence in the segments or the potential in the segments or the growth in the segments. I put the growth sort of in that double-digit range. That's what we would expect. And it's not 50%, but it's not 5% either. So our performance in this particular segment is clearly underperforming what it should be. So I'd say if you want to know if the market is slowing, well, it's not 50%. But slow is a relative thing. I'd take any double-digit market, and I think this is a healthy market. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Miles, a couple of product-related questions starting with Rhythm Management and Heart Failure. U.S. Rhythm Management was a little soft. Was that market-related or Abbott-specific? And I understand you made some management changes there. How quickly can you turn that around? And secondly, in Heart Failure, that was obviously very strong. Could you talk about the sustainability of that? And I had one follow-up. Miles White : Thank you. I could talk about that, but I'm going to hand it to Robert to talk about. Robert Ford : Yes, so in our Electrophysiology business, Larry, we definitely had a lower kind of growth rate in the U.S. of about 6% when international grew 20%. And that was -- that's -- it's not a market thing. That's more of an Abbott as we get ready to launch -- as we're launching our new ablation catheter, TactiCath SE, in the U.S., which we have already launched OUS. We obviously saw some kind of inventory depletion of the older product in getting ready for the new product. So we expect that to get back to the double-digit growth rate in the U.S. on the EP side. On CRM, that is definitely another area of disappointment and obviously, focus for us. We showed some recovery in the international markets, and I think the team there has done a good job at execution. But we're obviously not satisfied with our U.S. performance. It's an important business for us and we got to do better. But what we've seen internationally is where we've deployed dedicated EP and CRM teams, the business does better. It does better in CRM. And quite frankly, it does better in EP. So we -- as you saw, we recently made some organizational changes here to sharpen our focus and create a more, I'd say, stand-alone vertical business unit in CRM. We think that's going to get the accountability and the focus that we need out in the commercial field, especially in the U.S. And we've got several new product innovations that are progressing very nicely. Our next-gen ICD and our 2 leadless programs. And now this structure will ensure that they get the focus that they need. In Heart Failure, as you mentioned, our sales were up 23%. U.S. was up 26%, and that was the impact of, I'd say, the rapid share capture that we achieved in the U.S. in the destination therapy, I'd say, a pretty strong execution of the commercial team with the product, achieving about 20 share points in that quarter. So we expect that share to kind of maintain. The product has done very well, not only on our, I'd say, traditional Abbott accounts, but even in our competitor accounts, that's doing very nicely also. So we look -- we think Heart Failure has got strong potential also throughout the year with CardioMEMS. It's a little bit smaller product here, but it also continues to do very well. Larry Biegelsen : That's very helpful. And just lastly for me, Miles, as you pay down more debt, we're starting to get more questions on capital allocation. Can you please provide us with your latest thoughts, especially as it relates to M&A? When can we expect to see a pickup in M&A? Miles White : You're welcome. Well, a couple of things. First of all, I think the company has done a great job of paying down debt, cash management, cash generation, et cetera. It's been a little unprecedented, I think, for as much debt as we had. I mean, when we were done with the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, I think we were at about $28 billion, something like that. We've paid down more $10 billion of that. So -- and almost $8.5 billion of it just last year. Another $0.5 billion in the first quarter this year. So our debt -- everybody watches net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We're down to about 2x right now from what was, I think, about 4.3 when we completed the second of the 2 acquisitions. That's a pretty rapid paydown. We expect to be about 1.5x by year-end. So I think I could declare strategic flexibility achieved. Obviously, we want to keep paying down the debt. We've got nice, strong cash flow. We've got a number of choices. We increased the dividend, as you know, back in December by 14%. And we tend to target that dividend at around 40% to 45% of EPS. And I think right now, we're at 40%, something like that. EPS is growing pretty rapidly, so probably be adjusting at some point. But the -- there's good times and bad times to purchase shares, as you know. And our share repurchases, we haven't done a lot of share repurchasing. We've done some primarily just to offset dilution, but that has not been a big consumer of capital. We have made significant investments internally in our growth with Alinity expansion and with the Libre capacity expansion. And again, while those are important users of our capital with high return, we still have pretty strong cash flow. So back to the point of your question, we have strategic flexibility. We have strong cash flow. We have choice. The -- I think the question is whether or not at any point there's something out there that fits us or we're particularly interested in or that we're focused on, et cetera. And as you know, I've told you in the past, even if I have that, I wouldn't tell you, that would be true. I would say today, what is also true is we are very much focused on our internal organic execution, and that's getting sort of 95% of our attention. We're not paying attention to other opportunities. We always are tracking and monitoring other opportunities. But I have to tell you right now, I don't see a very robust target-rich environment out there. It's not target-rich. I don't think it is anyway. And I don't see a lot of meaningful adjunctive things that necessarily fit what we're trying to do. So obviously, as we move forward here, one of our challenges is going to be capital deployment because we're going to have a lot of it. And I think we're going to generate a lot of cash over the coming years. I think we're going to generate a lot of profit. And we obviously want to either invest at or return it to shareholders at the highest possible return. And if it means there's opportunities in M&A, as you know, historically, we've always been pretty attentive and diligent about that. I wouldn't forecast it when or what. We -- but we are out of the range where we're constrained about our choices. We are no longer constrained. And I think that's a positive. We've gotten there pretty quickly. And that means that we can consider whatever. We don't happen to be focused on M&A right now, but M&A isn't a steady every year thing. It's opportunistic when it fits the strategy and the intent of the company and when an opportunity fits and a return can be earned. And so if something like that comes along, I'd say we're well positioned. We'd be ready to do something. But to be honest, we haven't seen something that attractive. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on a nice start to the year and thanks for taking my question. So maybe I'll start one on the guidance, and I have a follow-up. On the guidance, Miles, MitraClip approval came in earlier. I know in the last call you said you're not expecting any inflection in MitraClip, but it looks like there might be some contribution in the back half. And I think FX assumptions changed modestly. It's slightly better. We had a I/IIb. Nutrition coming in better. I'm just curious on the guidance not being tweaked or changed. I know it's not your style, but I'm just curious on your guidance for the year. Miles White : Yes, Vijay, thanks for the question. You kind of answered it at the end of your question there when you said it's not my style. I rarely, if ever, raise in a first quarter. I kind of feel like if I raised in the first quarter, why didn't I put it in the original plan 3 months ago or 6 months ago? But I have generally waited to consider such a thing in the mid-year because at various points in time, well, there's been a number of times we've all been burned by exchange around April, May, June or something for the remainder of the year. I don't actually expect that this year. I'm no forecaster of exchange and we're not currency traders, as you know. But just based on what we all see, we were all -- like all industries, all companies, all multinationals and so forth, we were all cautious about China trade and exchange and volatility, the price of oil, even Brexit. These were sort of the big factors everybody talked about. Oil is almost $70, and I don't think Brexit is weighing on a lot of minds. It's weighing on a lot of European minds, it's weighing on a lot of U.K. minds and it depends on how much business you got tied up in the U.K. But companies have had time to figure out how to mitigate a lot of these things and deal with them. So I'd say the reason that we didn't look at raising in the first quarter is because I just don't raise in the first quarter.  We're obviously off to a strong start. As I told you before, all of our growth story is solid and intact, not seeing any -- gosh, I feel like I should knock on wood. I'm not seeing any threats to the growth vehicles in the business. And while some analysts have speculated that med tech or med devices is somewhat slowing, I'd tell you, I don't see that. And I don't think a lot of other CEOs in medical devices are seeing it either. In fact, if anything, I see projected growth rates rising across competitors. I take that as a very healthy signal from the industry that people are seeing positive, robust opportunity. I think a lot of people have new products and robust pipelines. And I think that's healthy for the whole sector worldwide. There's a lot of things that haven't changed, but we've been navigating those kinds of things for a while and doing well as an industry and as a company.  So could we have raised in the first quarter? Well, a lot of you may think so. I'm a little more cautious than that. I always kind of wait until the midyear so -- to kind of assess things. I like how the company is performing. I think the company is performing really well. I'm not sure we've ever had such healthy pipeline so broadly across the line in the company. So I don't have any negatives. I'm just thinking that one quarter into the year seems a little early to me. That's about as much as I can tell, that's a honest answer. Vijay Kumar : That's fair enough, Miles. And so this is -- whatever it is, it's the macro, it's not the fundamental. I guess related to that, I guess, the question we're getting a lot and not maybe just specific to Abbott, but the sector, is the sector, the fundamentals that we're seeing, is this sustainable? And I think specific to Abbott, Libre -- can Libre be a north of $5 billion product for you guys longer term? And the reason I ask is sustainability. I think you guys gave some numbers on MitraClip in terms of TAM. Libre, I think you've kind of left it open ended saying it's a multibillion-dollar product. And I'm just curious whether the Libre 2 that was submitted to the FDA, is that the same product as the Libre 2 in Europe? Or was the algorithm changed for the U.S. submission? Robert Ford : It's a similar product. Vijay, this is Robert. It's a similar product. It's just got a different label. Vijay Kumar : And on the TAM for Libre, can this be north of $5 billion for you guys longer term? Robert Ford : Listen, we've always thought of this as a -- I mean, if you look at the amount of diabetic patients in the world where this technology tends to have a greater impact, it tends to have a greater impact with insulin users, right? Whether you're a type 1 or a type 2 on a conventional kind of injection therapy, and there are 40 million of them around the world. 20 million of them in emerging markets and the other half in developed markets. So we think this is, as we said, a multibillion-dollar opportunity. Whether it's $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion, I mean, you can look at these patient segments and patient numbers and it's very big, so yes. Miles White : Vijay, I'd add a couple of things to that. We're investing in capacity expansion accordingly. But there's sort of more to the story. As you know, there's a Libre 2 in Europe. There's a Libre 2 under review in the United States. There's a Libre 3 in development and has been in development for some time. And there's a lot of potential for expansion of this product to other analytes besides glucose or additional analytes to glucose for the diabetic. There are other improvements that we can make in the product. All of that is in development. We know this platform well. It is a platform. It is not just a glucose test kit. And so there's, I guess, what I'll call an R&D development innovation strategy with it that is underway, has been underway. Our capacity expansion plans are well planned. We've already got almost 1.5 million users of Libre. And to be honest, we haven't exactly let the floodgates go. So I think you can kind of back into the math of that. This product is already great. Look, it's probably $1.5 billion or more in sales more and it's growing at 80%. So it doesn't take very long to figure out the math to what you just asked. Operator : And our final question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Christopher Pasquale : Miles, one follow-up on Bob's neuro question. We've seen new product launches drive momentum for a number of companies in that market over the past couple of years. You guys really haven't talked much about your pipeline there. Are there new products coming that could help turn that segment around? Or is it really just a matter of letting the dust settle on the sales force expansion? Miles White : Well, I'd say it's kind of like when you've got some issues with your own commercial execution and your sales force and you know you got to go fix them, it's kind of like ducking the question to go talk about your pipeline. So my own thought has been let's just address the sales force answer and not try to dodge and weave here about our own execution, which we admit we can do better and we're going to do better. Now having said that, yes, is there a pipeline in development? Robert? Robert Ford : Yes. So to that point, we also know that our first and foremost priority is the field execution. We also know that innovation and evidence also has an impact on our ability to kind of grow. So we've doubled our R&D investment in this business since taking it over about 2 years ago. And I do expect to see 2 new systems in the pain area come to market towards the end of this year or beginning of next year, and I think that will have a positive impact, obviously, ensuring that our sales force is getting up to speed and doing what it needs to do. Evidence is also another important driver here. So we do have trials that we're investing and working on for differentiated claims, whether it's pelvic pain or a pre-back surgery kind of claim. So your point of, yes, we are investing, we have to make sure we address the field force, but we do have a pipeline here that we know we're going to need to be able to have a sustainable double-digit growth business. Christopher Pasquale : That's helpful. And then my last one, just Structural Heart, already a bright spot for the company today and feels like it has the potential to get even better as the pipeline there matures. Can you just go through the latest thinking on Tendyne in Europe, which we should be getting relatively close to here, and then also Portico in the U.S.? Miles White : Yes. So I think that's one bright area in the device portfolio. We've made a lot of investments here. We talked a little bit about triclip that we should see towards the end of this year. Tendyne, to your point, we filed it last year for CE Mark. So we're also right now on target to see that come to market at the end of this year. We've got a fourth-generation MitraClip product that will be coming more towards the second half of this year also. So we're excited about that. And TAVR, we expect to see that in the U.S. -- Portico in the U.S. in the first half of next year. Scott Leinenweber : Okay. Well, good. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.  Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, risk factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.  On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Thank you, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. Sales increased 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter with all 4 businesses exceeding expectations. I'm particularly pleased with our ability to consistently achieve these types of strong results. Over the past 2 years, our quarterly organic sales growth has averaged more than 7%. And importantly, we're well positioned with our portfolio and new product pipeline for this type of strong growth going forward. Based on our performance and momentum in the first half of the year, we're raising our full year outlook, and we now forecast adjusted earnings per share of $3.21 to $3.27, reflecting nearly 13% growth at the midpoint on a reported basis and even faster growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. While we achieved broad-based growth across several areas of our portfolio, I'd like to highlight just a few areas where we continue to perform exceptionally well. I'll start our Medical Devices business with FreeStyle Libre, where we achieved sales of $430 million and continued to add significantly to our global user base, as reflected by our organic sales growth of more than 70% in the quarter. We also continue to make excellent progress expanding reimbursement and access in the U.S., where Libre is now reimbursed for approximately 75% of people with private pharmacy benefit insurance. Libre offers a unique value proposition. And as by design, it provides great clinical benefits, and we priced it to ensure affordability. Peers recognize that value -- that recognize that value and are increasingly providing reimbursement coverage for Libre, which also lower out-of-pocket costs even further for patients. As I've mentioned before, we've been investing significantly to expand our manufacturing capacity for Libre to meet demand. The first wave of that expansion will come online in the next couple of months, followed by a cadence of incremental capacity after that. There's a massive population that needs help managing their diabetes, and our intent is to make Libre broadly accessible to all of them. Turning to our Structural Heart business, where we achieved mid-teens growth. This was led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, which had global sales growth of more than 30% in the quarter. And MitraClip grew more than 50% in the U.S., where we recently received a new expanded indication. Earlier this week, we announced U.S. approval of our fourth generation MitraClip device, which builds on this leading platform with enhanced features and new clip sizes, providing physicians further options when treating the disease. We've been building our position in Structural Heart for more than a decade and have a deep pipeline of technologies and development, including Tendyne and Cephea, which are minimally invasive devices to replace faulty mitral heart valves. TriClip, a first of its kind device for the repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve; and AMPLATZER Amulet, our left atrial appendage device, to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. With the rapid adoption of MitraClip in a highly underpenetrated market as well as a pipeline of technologies targeting new growth areas that will launch over the next several years, our Structural Heart business is well positioned for strong, steady growth for years to come. Next, Diagnostics, where we remain focused on the global rollout of our Alinity suite of instruments for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. We're making great progress with our systems for immunoassay in clinical chemistry testing in Europe, where the launch of Alinity is helping to drive double-digit growth in our international core laboratory business. We're now also in the early stages of launching Alinity instruments for hematology and molecular testing in Europe. In the U.S., we're making steady progress achieving regulatory approvals for our broad menu of core laboratory tests. And just last week, we announced the FDA approval of Alinity s for blood and plasma screen. Abbott screens the majority of the world's blood supply, and this system is designed to be faster and more efficient within a smaller amount of space while maintaining the highest levels of accuracy. The global rollout of Alinity is an ambitious undertaking that positions our Diagnostics business for sustainable, strong growth going forward.  So in summary, all 4 of our businesses exceeded expectations in the quarter. Our growth is strong, it's accelerating and it's sustainable. We've strategically positioned ourselves in some of the most attractive areas of health care, and our key growth platforms are delivering impressive results. And today, we're adding to what was already a strong growth forecast by raising our outlook for the year. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Okay. Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 7.5%. Sales in medical devices grew 10.5% with double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In Nutrition, sales increased 5.1%, led by a strong growth in Adult Nutrition. Sales in Established Pharmaceuticals grew 6.1% with 8% growth in our key emerging markets. And sales increased 6.2% in Diagnostics, led by high single-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics and sequential improvements in point-of-care and Rapid Diagnostics.  Exchange had an unbearable impact on total Abbott sales of 4.6%, which was approximately 0.5% more unfavorable to our expectations at the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.4% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 7.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.9% of sales.  The second quarter adjusted tax rate was 13.7%, lower than our previous full year guidance of around 15%, due entirely to continued implementation of and adaptation to the U.S. tax reform regulations. Our second quarter tax rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for the first half of 2019 with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.5%.  Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales, which is in line with the expected impact we had at the beginning of the year. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales for the full year. This is modestly lower than our prior forecast and reflects the temporary effect of investments to support the unprecedented ramp-up and market adoption of our Alinity diagnostics systems as well as investments in Libre capacity expansion. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. And as I mentioned previously, we forecasted an adjusted tax rate of around 14.5% for the full year 2019.  Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we forecast adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.85, which reflects strong double-digit growth. We forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, and, at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 1.5% on our third quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29% of sales. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid- to high single digit growth. In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's legacy diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of core laboratory, molecular and point-of-care to grow high single digits. And in Rapid Diagnostics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. And finally, in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business. With that, we'll now open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Congrats on the quarter and the guide. And Miles, I have 2 questions for you, the first on diabetes, the second on the outlook for the year. So just starting with diabetes, ADA, Miles, ushered in some concerns around the Libre 2.0 iCGM designation. Should investors read anything into the lack of approval? And what's your confidence level on iCGM approval? And what does the trend in BGM this particular quarter tell us about the Libre adoption? Miles White : I'm going to give you a couple of answers here. One, no, we shouldn't have concern. We're confident that we're going to have the approval we expect and what we applied for. So I know that there's always uncertainty until the day comes and questions from investors that know we're confident. And actually, let me ask our COO to give you a little bit of more background and detail on that. Robert Ford : Yes. I mean, we -- David, we filed this in iCGM. We made that comment in our last earnings, and we filed as an iCGM. The standards and special controls for the iCGM, they're very clear and they're very transparent as it relates to accuracy, thresholds, alarms, sensor shutoffs, et cetera. So we wouldn't have filed an iCGM if we felt that we're going to fall short of those special controls. In fact, we were encouraged by the agency to file Libre 2 as an iCGM. So I know people want to speculate and kind of tie it to the exact date. We're not behind our timelines, so we're not going to expect there an exact date here, but we expect it relatively soon. David Lewis : Okay, very, very helpful. And then the, secondly, Miles, for you is just guidance for the year. So the guidance range suggests, you obviously see 2019 as a year of acceleration over '18. I'm just sort of curious, what gets better into the second half of the year? And if you think about the middle part of the range versus the upper part of the range, what are the key success factors in the back half that gets you to that top end of the range? Miles White : Well, I'd say a couple of things, first of all, about the guidance. We are seeing strength in our growth drivers. We've got a lot of launches going on in all segments across the board. We're going to be opening up the capacity, new manufacturing and so forth to supplement Libre. The Alinity systems are obviously successfully rolling out. MitraClip is picking up momentum. A lot of the businesses that I've been sort of chronically dissatisfied with from time to time have also in sequential improvement, which I'm happy to see. I'm never quite satisfied with that. But the pharmaceutical business, the cardiac rhythm management business, the stent business, neuromodulation, the point-of-care Diagnostics business, the Rapid Diagnostics business, which is primarily the Alere acquisition, they're all showing sequential sales growth improvement, which is what we've planned, what we've worked for, et cetera. So based on the strength across the board of all of that, we felt comfortable that, frankly, our growth rate on the top line going forward, we sort of see in that 7% to 8% range. And I challenged the team. I said, is this temporary for the quarter or for the half year thing? Or do we feel fairly sustainable about this? And we feel sustainable about it. So I think that's all good. And then with record earnings, there's a step-up in earnings here in the second half, earnings growth rate. And it's just an unusual quarter. I mean, we always target, as you know, at the beginning of the year, double-digit growth. We always had kind of an aggressive or at least ambitious target for ourselves going into the next year. That's no different now. So in the second half, our earnings remain strong. I don't know, I'm kind of -- I feel pretty good if we do the numbers we say and we never fall short. So it's 18% on the bottom line right now. So you're asking me about what we do to get to the high end of the range? I'm thinking, geez, isn't that good enough? It's a pretty healthy growth rate. So 7% to 8% on the top and high double digit teens on the bottom, I think, is probably best-in-class in the peer group that we're compared to and several different peer groups that we're compared to. And quite frankly, with the breadth of products launching and rollouts, obviously, there's always challenges somewhere in the world in some way, but we seem to be doing pretty well across the board here in all areas, and I think that's a pretty good investment. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Great, and congrats on a good quarter. Maybe 2 product questions for you. I want to hit on MitraClip and Alinity. Maybe you could comment on the status of CMS reimbursement in MitraClip. It doesn't seem to have hindered your growth at all in the quarter, but maybe just give us some update on the timelines, and then maybe some considerations for the trend line of uptick going forward there once you do get approval. Miles White : Okay. I'm going to have Robert answer that question for you, and we'll come back to Alinity. Robert Ford : So Robbie, so you saw we had a great quarter of MitraClip, global sales over 30%, really driven by U.S. over 50%, the majority of that growth in U.S. really coming through increased productivity in the existing accounts. So we obviously were constantly doing market development, opening new accounts, but a majority of that growth coming through increased utilization. So we've continued to invest in clinical and field sales expansion. And when you do this, they have this direct impact in account utilization and productivity. International was up also double digits in the quarter. You've got Japan, where we believe is a significant opportunity for us long term there where we're building our capabilities in Japan. And Europe saw a rebound in Q2 versus where we were in Q1. I think the teams there, the clinical and medical teams have done a really good job at putting into context and framing some of those conflicting trials that came out in the second half of the year. So we think there's a lot of sustainability here not only in the U.S. I mean, our penetration rates here, in terms of the opportunity, are still kind of low single digits. So we've got a lot of runway here. Regarding your question on CMS, I mean, there's obviously a lot of coordination that's been going on between CMS and the physician societies. We expect the NCD to be opened up a very soon as part of that coordination. As I say, we're not going to forecast an exact timeline here, but we anticipate getting through the process around year-end early next year. But as you said, the process here hasn't really kind of impeded our growth. We have seen a dozen or so private commercial insurance companies already reflect updates to their decision to their coverage to include the new indication. Obviously, the larger segment there is the Medicare segment, but it's good to kind to see that traction in the private segment. So very good quarter. We continue to see this expansion in the second half of the year and towards the end of the year looking at achieving the CMS reimbursement. Robert Marcus : Great. And then following up on Alinity. This is one -- it hits all of your different product lines and diagnostics, so it's hard to really pick out, but maybe you could just give us a status update on the progress of the launch in Europe and the just starting launch in the U.S. And maybe any competitive data points you could give us. We see some of your competitors struggling, both on the top line and the margins side, as it relates to competitive systems. Anything you're seeing out in the market that could be useful. Appreciate it. Miles White : Sure. Well, so first, you made a comment that it touches every part of diagnostics. That's true. And these are 6 different systems, the immunoassay system, the clinical chemistry system, obviously a smaller point of care system for that market. There's a dedicated blood and plasma screening system, and then, of course, hematology and molecular. And they're all at various stages of rollout. The one that is the furthest along would be the rollout of our immunoassay and clinical chemistry systems in the core laboratories of Europe. We're also in the process of expanding menu approvals in the United States and China and Southeast Asia, where customers want to have a certain critical mass of menu as they make the conversion from whatever they're using to these new Alinity systems. So I'd say we're running as fast as we can, I think, at this point, in Europe, and that's going pretty well. There's over 3,000 systems placed now running test, generating revenue, et cetera. We do measure not just the deal, the close of a deal, et cetera. We measure what is called test of record when the account is up and running, generating results, generating tests, et cetera. And so I'd say that process is going well. That's going to begin to pick up more momentum in the United States as we're getting more and more menu breadth. Same with China. We're tracking all of that pretty closely as we build those menus. We're talking hundreds of tests. We did recently get approval for the Alinity as the blood and plasma screening system. Today, we screen about 80% of the world's blood supply as it is. This is -- it's an important transition product that labs, I think, will find more efficient, more economic, et cetera, but that's a plus. We closed and started up the Japanese Red Cross, which is the largest Japanese blood screening organization, and we took that from a long-standing Japanese competitor. So that was a big win for us. So there's just a lot of success that way. Hematology's in the very early stages of rolling out, the molecular system in the earliest stage of rolling out. And which is why this will be, I guess, a slower moving launch that's got sort of years of growth and momentum in it as we look over the next, call it, 5 to 7 years to completely replace an existing installed base and add a lot of new share and new volume. And to that end, I think we've quoted you before, that remains true. In accounts where we already have the business, we're winning about 95% of the time. And in accounts where we do not have the business, and there's an entrenched competitor of ours, we're winning about 60% of the time. Those win rates and penetration rates and share gains and so forth in our experience so far, over now what I said is over 3,000 instruments, tell us that we've got a very competitive system. We do run into, on the occasional accounts, a heavy-duty price-cutting. We've got a very disciplined system of our pricing and contracting in accounts. We have not had to do that. I think that speaks to the superiority of the instrument and assay offering. So we're feeling like our offering is uniquely competitive. It's borne out by the win rates no matter what type of account. It's unprecedented to launch these many systems across-the-board in all areas. So I think this only picks up momentum and gets better as the assay menu expands and as there's some experience in the field with the analyzers. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Just 2 quick questions, one for Miles and a big picture, and then one quick financial question if okay. Miles, if okay, I wanted to ask a question on the management team additions that you announced recently. Congrats on hiring Lisa to run devices. And I guess, my  question is, when Robert was promoted as COO back on October of last year, Abbott said that Robert would keep devices. So just wondering if you could comment on kind of the reasons for the change, what Robert will do with all his newfound free time. And investors are always curious about your long-term plans. So it's a question on the recent hire. Miles White : Okay. Well, I can tell you he's not playing golf. We -- I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we anticipated that for the time being, we wanted him to stay directly on top of the medical device business because he's been responsible for the bringing onboard St. Jude. As we acquired that, he was integral to that entire integration. We went through, with St. Jude, a reorganization of the business to align with the way we like to run a business at Abbott. And I guess I would describe that as we like to have a fully integrated business, meaning the general manager of that business, president of that business has responsibility for commercial -- the commercial people, commercial sales, of the customers, et cetera, but also manufacturing, R&D, technical support, service, et cetera. We like all those functions reporting into one GM. And so we realigned St. Jude. We did the same with Alere, quite frankly, when we took them over. And so each of the business has full integrated general management responsibility. And that was a transition, and Robert led that. It's all in place. That meant that we added a number of experienced general managers. We replaced some who had left us as part of the St. Jude or Alere acquisitions and so forth. So we went through a management transition. And at the same time, there's been a little bit of a generational change happening here. Quite certainly, there's been an awful lot of people that has been part of my management team for a long time. And a lot of our managers are long-term Abbott groomed and grown management team, but we've also been thinking about making sure that with all the growth we've got, the new products, the new organization, the new structure of that organization that we're always looking at the talent and the experience of our management team as we look forward now toward, let's just call it, a decade of what I think is going to be pretty robust growth. So in that, we needed to replace the EVP role that Robert has held previous to his Chief Operating Officer role. We did that. We went outside for that and, of course, sourced Lisa, who we think has terrific background and experience for that. We're very pleased to have brought fresh perspective and great experience and great energy level into the company. So we're very pleased with that. We went through a little further, I'd say, organization change to kind of break up what had gotten big and perhaps unwieldy, in some cases, into slightly smaller units because we are managing some pretty aggressive growth capital improvement, plant building, et cetera, in a number of these businesses, including diagnostics. And to give us more focus around it, we've done some of that adjusting. I feel like that's gone very smoothly and very well. Obviously, we read into Robert, who's in his mid-40s, moving up into the COO role, that we expect him to be in a key leadership role at the company for a long time. Read between the lines. And so there's a preparation process going on. And I think one of the most important things I can do, after leading the company for so long, is to make sure that when a transition comes, nobody notices. And the best legacy to leave is that the momentum of this company. Its growth and its prospects are every bit as good going forward as we think they are now and, from my perspective, a smooth leadership transition, which is not just me, it's literally right down through the upper ranks of all management is key and important. And I feel like of all of the sort of track record of legacies that I can give this company, I think a transition that way is probably the most important of all. So you can read into it that we're preparing for continuity of leadership, what I would call it, with no speed bumps. And I think that actually is going exceptionally well. Will I give you a time frame? No. Do I think we should be nervous about it? No. I think that this company is so poised to perform well across the board for years to come that I've got great confidence in that continuity and the management team because we've got a nice mix here of very experienced and trained Abbott people and people we've brought from other companies on the outside like Lisa. And I think the mix we've got in that team is exceptional. Robert's been with the company over 20 years. I've known him every bit of those 20-plus years, and I think he brings to his job right now tremendous experience, perspective, everything you would look for in a leader, as a COO of the company. So from my perspective, I think this is nothing but good and just keeps getting better. Robert Hopkins : Very, very helpful, Miles. That's great perspective. And just, it seems like an odd transition, but I do have a little question on the tax rate. Just quickly for Brian. You guys have been doing a great job over the last couple of years of kind of slowly and steadily bringing the tax rate down. And I know you made comments on the year, but maybe if you could just talk bigger picture. Is -- where are you in that process? And are the current rates that we're seeing here today sustainable down here in the kind of low-ish teens? Brian Yoor : Yes, Bob. We always set the tax rate to where we think it's sustainable. We don't like it to be bounced around. We want to be steady. And we assess the rates as they come out. We had a series of rates come out just recently and digested those. We're always adapting to that and adapting to the situation to be as efficient as we can here. 14.5% is where I'd call the sustainable rate right now as we look forward. I will say, and we can't predict the future, but there's another series of clarity around rates that will come up in Q3. And when that happens, we will digest that and adapt accordingly as well. But as we sit here today, we're happy with the efficiency of our tax rate and continue to manage it for sustainability. And we just don't want to see it bumping around on you or us. Operator : Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Barclays. Kristen Stewart : Congrats on a great quarter. Miles, I was wondering if you could just talk through your thinking on just the level of investments in the company and just how you think about how much of this really impressive top line you let flow through, and then also, just from a capital allocation perspective, how you're just thinking about going forward with the company, just given the growth dynamics that you have and/or opportunities you could see to maybe strengthen some of the other business lines that maybe offer a little bit more lackluster growth with the medical devices. Miles White : Okay. Well, I'd give you a couple of perspectives. First of all, the great thing is we've got a lot of things to invest in. From a capital standpoint, obviously, it was important for us to pay down debt. We did. We've paid down a significant amount going on $10 billion at this point. And as we've said before, we're in a comfortable position of strategic flexibility, but that doesn't mean we're dying to go use it. So the next need was, obviously, we've got some capital to put into plant and expansion, and we've put a fair amount into both Diagnostics and Libre at this point. We're investing in expansion of plant and manufacturing for MitraClip and other products. So given that we've got an awful lot of growth happening and the potential for more, obviously, we've got to support that growth from a plant and capital standpoint in a timely fashion and appropriate quality and so forth, and we're doing that. And so there's capital use, et cetera, there. Will we continue to pay down debt? We will. We'll be prudent and careful about making sure it makes sense it's the right debt, right time and all that good stuff. We'll maintain a healthy, strong dividend. We increased it substantially at the end of last year. We'll continue to grow our dividend. Given where the PE is now, I've been told by a number of shareholders that trying to get that yield rate upward dividend funds are happy as is difficult, but that's a nice problem to have. We will continue to grow our dividend. It's been a hallmark of the company for decades, and it will continue to be. And then it's not always that prudent to buy back shares. The timing matters, the return matters, et cetera. Is it an option? Yes, it is. I probably won't get too carried away because, frankly, we're able to grow and return cash to shareholders a number of different ways and return good return to our shareholders. So it's always an option as it presents itself. We've just got a lot we can do. If you're asking about M&A and other things, we don't feel like right now that we need something, nor do we think we see something that we can add sufficient value to, to make it worth it to invest in. And we've got so many organic growth opportunities that, while we continue to monitor and we're always tracking opportunities in all of our businesses, I can't tell you that, that's real front burner right now. We don't ignore it. We don't -- we try to maintain our currency on the things that we might be interested in. We just did a small acquisition in Germany. That's a nice adjunctive thing to our Diagnostics business in terms of automation and so forth. There are things like that, that I think are valuable for us. But we have so much growth potential and opportunity in devices, diagnostics, even nutrition and pharma that we're just not out cut and real hard on the M&A front right now, nor do I foresee that being true for quite a while. So that's the capital side. On the expense side, we're always trying to balance the voracious appetite of investors for growing earnings with investing in the growth of the business. And I doubt that there's a general manager or business at Abbott that wouldn't claim that if we gave them more money, they could spend it effectively and efficiently to grow our products faster. So we're always trying to find the right balance of how much gas that's thrown in the fire or the growth of the products with returning a healthy return to the expectations of our investors. I think that's always a balance because there's always some investor who thinks there must be an extra $0.01 in the quarter. And I was speaking to somebody this morning who asked about that very issue of another $0.01. And I said, \"The issue here is much bigger than $0.01.\" We've got tremendous growth. Our top line were accelerating. It's strong. It's sustainable. This isn't about $0.01 in a given quarter, this is about a pretty, healthy sales growth rate and a commensurate healthy growth rate on the bottom line that's unusual in our sector and particularly unusual for companies of our size to be able to sustain such a healthy growth rate with so much new product richness for the coming years. And it's not a coming quarter, it's coming years. So you raised the right question, is how do we keep investing in the spending in R&D and the sales and marketing expenses to drive that growth? And we're trying to find that right balance as well by putting enough fuel to the fire here to drive the growth rates even higher Kristen Stewart : Okay, then. Just one question on how do you view -- the medical device business growth was phenomenal this quarter. How do you just think about the ability to sustain that level of growth? It seems that Medical Devices has a bit of a tale of 2 cities with several businesses reporting really nice, strong double-digit growth, but a couple of obvious businesses kind of still lagging around that flattish growth. How do you kind of think about the longer-term dynamic there? Miles White : Yes. You've got a mix of business this year. You've got some that are a little mature than others, some that have brand new products that are perfect innovations. In general, in Medical Devices, innovation is what drives the growth. And over time, that's the case. And different businesses are at different stages of either maturity or new innovation. We believe there's still a lot of opportunity there. I remember in my discussions with Dan Starks when we were renegotiating over the acquisition of St. Jude, Dan felt pretty strongly that the pipeline of St. Jude was underappreciated and, that in their own internal models, that the growth rate was out there in the high single digits. The Street didn't agree with that at the time because it didn't see it yet, et cetera. But Dan was right, and I think that we've seen that in the performance of the medical device business we acquired from St. Jude because it's been performing at sort of a 9% to 10% level as new products have gone to the market, either replacing older products or just simply brand new products altogether. So I'd say the first thing about Medical Devices is you've got to keep innovating in new spaces. MitraClip's new space, Heart Failure and HeartMate and so forth, these are new spaces, new technologies, et cetera. Libre is that. Libre is unique. It approaches a mass market, not a niche market. Most medical devices address niches of therapy. But diabetes is something that affects more than 80 million people around the world who would benefit from Libre in about a 50-50 split of type 1s and type 2s. And that is massive. It's unlike anything seen before in device for diagnostic businesses. And so there's just an enormous, enormous opportunity there. To be honest, traditional medical device companies aren't used to having to deal with at that kind of scale. And so we're addressing that by investing very heavily in manufacturing expansion, so that we can go after the mass market, not a niche. And so I think the sustainability of the growth is driven not only by the innovation, but the ability to go after much bigger markets at a much more affordable level. More people will have access. There will be more growth as we make technologies and products more and more affordable. And then finally, you asked about some of the businesses that aren't growing that fast. And I'd say, well, I'm always disappointed that they're not growing as fast as we'd like them to, but I am pleased that we've seen sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter in almost all of them. We've seen that in CRM. We've seen it neuromod. We've seen it even EPD and stents and so forth. We're seeing incremental improvement. Some of these businesses as more mature businesses may not see strong or high single digit or double digit growth, but I think they're still capable of pretty strong growth in the low to mid-single-digit area, and there's still a lot of upside. If we take a CRM business from what is flat slightly negative to 3% or 4%, that's a pretty big bump in growth. We'd be -- if it was going from 10% to 14%, we'd be all excited about it. So the same incremental growth improvement, I think, is possible. It's just at a lower level. So I think that there's a lot here to sustain the kind of growth we're seeing. There's always going to be new products like Libre or a MitraClip or a HeartMate that singularly for a period of time disproportionally drive the overall growth. One of the benefits of having many businesses in the device arena is there's always going to be somewhere that's growing that way and other places where we're innovating for the future. Operator : And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Joanne Wuensch : I'd like to spend a little bit of time on Nutrition, particularly international nutrition. And the adult piece of that really did well in the quarter. Is there anything you could give us as an update on that particular franchise? Robert Ford : Yes. So we had a, as you've noticed, sequential improvement in our Nutrition business. We're very pleased with the performance. We continue to see kind of above market growth in several of the countries. We've made a lot of enhancements and changes in people and strategies to enhance our competitiveness over the years, new products execution, and we get to see that. We do think it is sustainable. We are executing well. We kind of see the market in that 3% to 4% range. So -- and we're always striving for something above that. And you saw that again in this quarter with a 5% kind of growth and good execution in our adult business specifically coming out of Asia. Miles White : To OUS business, Joanne, was up a little over 10% in the adult, OUS adult business. And a lot of that is new product innovation, new formats, expansion in given markets like Vietnam and other places, where we've got pretty good strongholds, but also a lot of opportunity for further growth. So we've put a lot more intention on some of those. I'd say historically, in this business, the U.S. and China always get all the attention. But there's a lot of opportunity in, as Robert said, Southeast Asian markets and others, where there's still a lot of growth, India and the like, and particularly in the adult segment. Joanne Wuensch : And as my second question, one of the \"problem children\" in Medical Devices is in neuromodulation. Can you walk us through a pathway to the recovery in that? Robert Ford : Yes, sure. So we saw an improvement in Q2. Obviously, that's not our landing spot. We're obviously not where we want to be, but an improvement there. We completed the sales force expansion that we've been talking about. We increased the sales force by about 40%. And when you go through something like that, Joanne, there's some disruption that occurs in terms of cutting the territories and the training, et cetera. So we've completed that, and now, obviously, the focus is improving the productivity of that sales team. And we saw that in the second quarter. If you look at some of the KPIs, we look at whether it's trials or trial to permanent implant conversion rates. We saw definitely sequential improvement versus Q1, and we expect that to improve as we go into the second half of this year. A big portion of this also is, I'd say, product innovation life cycle. You've seen a couple of quarters now where there really hasn't been any kind of launch from competitors in this space. That's a key driver also. So sales force productivity and execution, we'll start to see some of our innovation output we made double the investment in that R&D business over the last couple of years. And we'll start to see some output of that in the second half of this year, beginning of next year in terms of new products that will provide, I'd say, more for the sales team to kind of work with. Operator : And our final question comes from Matthew Taylor from UBS. Matthew Taylor : I wanted to circle back on Libre on 2 points. So the first is that you mentioned that you're working on increasing the capacity. There was an article yesterday, and Reuters said that you're expanding capacity by 3x or 5x. And so if we think about Libre this year as approaching maybe $2 billion based on consensus, does that mean that ultimately, you think it could be a $6 billion to $10 billion type of product as you go mass market? And can you talk about how you can step on the gas in the second half of the year without additional capacity in the approval of Libre 2 to more rapidly expand use? Miles White : Man, you are one aggressive guy. I remember I've got this call or this question last quarter, I can't recall if it was you, on whether we thought we could get the $5 billion and how soon, and gosh, 3 months later, it's $10 billion. I've got the same ambitions, to be honest. I just wouldn't have expected them 90 days later. But to answer your question, I think that kind of potential is there. I think it's awfully hard to speculate about a number that big. But will we -- do I think we'll get the $5 billion? And do I think we'll do it in a reasonable time, $5 billion of sales over? Yes, I do. And I think it's -- the growth rate here is reflective of not only the size of the market, but the need and utility and affordability of the product. And I think it's just, as I've said many times, it's a very different market where affordability and the utility, the access, all those things make this a mass market product, not a niche. And it's designed for that. It's priced for that. It's a very profitable product. And we're going through the large-scale, scale-up of addressing that kind of growth, which is unprecedented for products in our space. So do I think it can grow to that sort of level? I won't jinx anything by trying to make some prognostication about $10 billion, but I would say that I think it's got enormous potential. And it's got potential beyond glucose. It's got potential as a wearable in other analytes and other products over time. We have R&D programs underway, not only for the repeated enhancement, improvement, expansion of Libre, but also in the other categories beyond diabetes and other analytes and so forth. So I think that there's just a lot of things that will evolve over the coming years here that, today, people weren't even contemplating with the product. We're going as hard as we can at the glucose opportunity, which is enormous. But there's so much more beyond that, that, I think, at least to your aspirational consideration, to be honest, has validity. I'm just not ready to put any numbers around it. Matthew Taylor : And then maybe one last follow-up. That was a great answer, but just wanted to get your feedback on what you think is misunderstood about Libre today when you get feedback from investors that bubbles up to you. Where do you think that the internal view of Libre really differs from The Street's perception or people's perception? Miles White : Geez, I don't know. Let me ask the COO. He's been living with it a long time. Robert Ford : Yes. I think when we went out about this several years ago, the challenge here, Matt, wasn't to get an accurate reading of glucose from interstitial fluid. Navigator, when we have launched it back in 2008, we were able to do that. It was very accurate, and we're able to get an accurate reading. The challenge that we went about with Libre is how to do that in a way that is cost-effective for the health systems and for consumers and for all of that. So that was what we really went after, is how can you get the accurate reading at a cost position at the core of Libre? And you might remember at the time, Navigator at the time was considered the most accurate sensor. In the core of Libre is that chemistry, is that core technology of Navigator, which provides accurate, reliable readings, but we're able to do that at a cost position that now makes sense for the insurance and for the payer community and the health systems to cover it. It wasn't a question of whether the outcomes were right or whether the outcomes were enough. They were convinced that the outcomes were there for sensor-based glucose monitoring. It was just, can I now do it in a way that makes sense for me to do it on a mass scale? And Miles just talked about this about mass scale. That's what we went after 10 years ago. And that's at the core. And I think maybe that's misunderstood because a lot of this discussion gets focused on, well, accuracy at this level and accuracy at that level. And the reality is accuracy is obviously important, but our goal here is to make this massively available without having to sacrifice accuracy. And the fact that we priced it at a different price point wouldn't say necessarily imply that it's somehow missing something, we just have a different strategy and adjustment view of what we could do. Miles White : The only product out there that The Street has been able to compare it to is expensive and high cost and aimed at a niche in the United States. Ours is not expensive, and it's not high cost. It does not lack for clinical performance, accuracy or any of the like. But because the manufacturing is so sophisticated and automated, we were able to achieve a pretty low cost in what is a pretty sophisticated product. It's a highly profitable product, so we haven't compromised that it's a product that is successful in terms of profit. That's not been compromised at all. It has a completely different design and approach and cost structure. It relies on scale for that cost, and we've actually seen improving gross margin. We've told you before the gross margin is over 60%. It is and rising. And that's with a heavy capital investment, so that we can produce the kind of volume that is broadly available. So I think among the misunderstandings out there, I think people say, \"Well, geez, how do you make money?\" Oh, we make money. We do just fine, thank you. And the product is designed to be affordable and accessible. I guess, there are some days when we think, if the health care market community ensures payers, Congress, patients, whatever, I always say it's got to be lower cost. The health care has got to be more affordable. Here's our example. And it is. It's massively so. And so we've gone at it with that approach to make it broadly available. Broadly, in this case means 80 million people worldwide. That's unprecedented. So I'm not sure that the device community has totally understood it because it's so different. But we keep saying so. And I think now as the new capacity comes online, we've also staged the capacity so that literally, every 90 days, we're adding another increment, significant incremental capacity. We will not be capacity-constrained. And that kind of release is a lot of freedom to market and push the product forward and even open up markets we haven't opened yet. So I think there's a lot of opportunity here. And I think to, I think, opportunity -- there's opportunity for a number of things like this, as I mentioned earlier, in what's called the wearables market, the more affordable and accessible technologies make products like this, then I think we're going to see a very different market expansion. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.  Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in items 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.  On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.84, reflecting 12% growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of currency. Sales increased more than 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices and sequential improvements in Established Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. We also narrowed off our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $3.23 to $3.25, which, at current rates, would reflect high-teens growth, excluding the impact of currency and is at the upper end of the range we set at the beginning of the year.  As we've discussed previously, following our recent strategic shaping and acquisitions, we've been completely focused on running the company we built. This focus on organic execution is delivering strong performance on a remarkably consistent basis. Over the last 8 quarters, we've averaged 7.5% organic sales growth worldwide with very little variation. We've also continued to strengthen our portfolio with new products, expanded access on reimbursement coverage and generated new clinical data that further enhances the sustainability of our strong growth outlook going forward. I'm particularly pleased with the continued exceptional performance across several of our key growth platforms, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity, which I'll highlight as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail. And I'll start in our Medical Devices business where sales increased double digits for the second quarter in a row. In Structural Heart, we achieved 16% sales growth led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation or leaking heart valve. MitraClip sales increased more than 30% in the quarter, including U.S. growth of nearly 50%. During the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our next-generation MitraClip device, and we initiated the first-ever U.S. pivotal trial for the minimally invasive treatment of tricuspid regurgitation, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of our TriClip repair system.  Turning now to FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine fingersticks. We achieved sales of $0.5 billion in the quarter and continued to add significantly to our global user base, as reflected by organic sales growth of nearly 70%. During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre obtained public reimbursement coverage in Ontario and Quebec, becoming the first and only sensor-based glucose monitoring system to be listed by any provincial health plan in Canada. We also continued to advance our strategy to develop integrated solutions where people with diabetes can seamlessly manage their condition across devices, including recent announcements that we're seeking to integrate Libre with the insulin delivery technologies of Sanofi and Tandem as well as the digital care platform of Omada Health. This easy-to-use, affordable device is changing the way millions of people manage their diabetes. And our ongoing efforts to expand awareness, adoption and access for Libre around the world will drive tremendous growth for years to come.  Turning now to Diagnostics where sales grew 6.5% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics. The rollout of Alinity in Europe and other international markets continues to drive strong growth in our Core Laboratory business outside the U.S. In the U.S. where we continue to outperform the market with our legacy ARCHITECT system, we've made good progress achieving regulatory approvals of immunoassay and clinical chemistry test for Alinity and are beginning to ramp up our launch efforts in these areas. With highly differentiated instruments and a matrix rollout across multiple geographies and diagnostic testing areas over time, Alinity is well positioned to be a multiyear growth platform for our Diagnostics business. In Nutrition, sales increased nearly 4% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in international Adult Nutrition for the third quarter in a row. In Pediatric Nutrition, above-market growth in the U.S. and several other countries was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in Greater China, which comprises a little less than 10% of our overall nutrition sales. While consumers continue to trade up for premium brands, which is the segment where we compete, we've seen volume in the market decline due to historically low birth rates. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and competitiveness across the various segments and purchasing channels in China and given our broad portfolio and global footprint, anticipate continued strong performance across other geographies and long-term growth opportunities such as Adult Nutrition.  I'll wrap up with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 8% in the quarter led by strong growth in several geographies including India, China and Brazil. Sales growth in EPD has now improved sequentially for each of the last 3 quarters. With leading market positions in several international growth geographies, EPD is well positioned for sustained above-market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world.  So in summary, we're performing extremely well across several areas of the portfolio, resulting in another quarter of strong sales and earnings growth. We continue to strengthen our product portfolios and key product platforms with a steady cadence of new product approvals, reimbursement coverage and clinical data. And we're well on track to deliver ongoing EPS and organic sales growth at the upper ends of the ranges we set at the beginning of the year. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Okay. Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.  Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 7.6% on an organic basis. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen modestly, resulting in an unfavorable impact on sales of 1.9% from exchange or 50 basis points higher than if rates held steady since the time of our call in July. Reported sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.1% of sales. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.94 to $0.96, which reflects nearly 17.5% growth at the midpoint. We forecast organic sales growth of around 8% and at current rates, would expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat above 1.5% on fourth quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense approaching 27.5% of sales.  Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit growth. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid- to high single-digit growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast growth similar to the third quarter, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business.  With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Just a couple of questions for me. Miles, just want to start off on growth. So I mean this time of year, investors are very focused on sustainability. And you obviously said you've been averaging 7.5% for 7 to 8 quarters. So a couple of questions. One, your guidance for the fourth quarter implies a little bit of momentum deceleration in the business. Anything specific to call out there? And then more specifically, as you think about 2020, what are those drivers that get you confident that you can deliver your growth in that 7%, 7.5% range that you've been doing the last couple of years? And then one quick follow-up. Miles White : Okay, David. Well, I'll start with what you said. We have had 8 straight quarters averaging 7.5%. Going into the fourth quarter, we actually are going to be close to 8%. And then going into next year, I think where we are in the range we've given, I think we gave a range at the beginning of this last quarter of 7% to 8%, somewhere in that range. And frankly, I've seen no change to that. I don't see any change to momentum at all here. If anything, we've got pretty strong momentum across the board. We've got sequential growth in a number of areas that we've expected improvement in, and we're seeing that. EPD comes to mind. Obviously, our growth drivers, Libre and MitraClip and the Alinity systems, et cetera, are all very strong, Structural Heart is very strong. So as I've said in the past many times, this is sustainable and strong going forward. I see no change to momentum, no change to progress, no change to growth rates. If anything, it gets better. So -- and it clearly will in the fourth quarter. So it's pretty strong, and the earnings flows with it. And we're not going to make any guidance forecast or anything, but I think directionally here, all fundamentals are strong for us. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful. And just one quick product question, Miles. There's been -- Libre 2, obviously, an important driver for next year. I just want to get your commentary. The longer this product has not been approved, it's led to a kind of concern about the product, the regulatory time line. Your view, your Tandem partnership yesterday suggests to us that you're still confident in Libre 2 iCGM. Are you still confident in Libre 2 iCGM? And how are you thinking about the timing potential for that product? Miles White : I'd say I'm going to comment myself and then I'm going to hand it to Robert Ford here to comment as well. But first, are we confident? Absolutely. The product is performing wonderfully. The growth is strong. The expansion is strong. There's a lot to be pretty encouraged about. And while I recognize a lot of people, including us, are feeling impatience, impatience doesn't translate to concern. We're all inpatient and we'd all like everything yesterday. But it's not quite working out as yesterday. And Robert can comment on that here, but there is nothing but good here looking forward with Libre. And we anticipate a lot of expansion with this product, including with some of these partnerships that we've announced and working with the interoperability with various partners for what I think will be the future of glucose monitoring and diabetes management. I think all of this is not just on plan, but spectacular, particularly for diabetes patients. And I have nothing but confidence in it. So let me turn over to Robert to expand on that a little bit. Robert Ford : Sure. Yes, David. Listen, admittedly, it's taking longer than we had expected. We obviously misjudged that. We're currently working through a handful of open items with the agency. And what I can tell you, I'm -- I've got the same confidence level that Miles does. I'm confident in the data. I'm confident in the product, right? In the meantime, if you look at Libre in Q3, we had an exceptional Q3. Sales of just under $0.5 billion, that puts us on a $2 billion run rate here with growth rate over 70%. Our international business grew 50%, and that's on a large base. And then the U.S. sales nearly tripled. So -- and it's tripled because we're adding new patients at a strong and steady rate. And it's a high rate. And you could see that progression in our total Rxs. So -- and one of the challenges we've had over, like, the 9 months here has really been about how to pulse our demand generation activities with aligning to our supply, and we talked a little bit about kind of some of those supply constraints. So we've now released in the third quarter, towards the end of the third quarter, our next tranche of manufacturing capacity on plan, on schedule. And I can tell you, the commercial team right now is really feeling excited about not being able to have that constraint over and really start to intensify the commercial promotional efforts, whether that's advertising, whether that's sampling, et cetera, both in the U.S. and international. I think that gives us a lot of excitement as we exit the year going into next year. The value proposition still continues to be very strong to patients and physicians and to payers. And as Miles mentioned in his opening comments, we achieved reimbursement in Canada, public reimbursement, the only sensor system reimbursed in Canada. And it's important because it's one of the top 5 largest glucose monitoring markets in the world. And similar to what we saw in some of these large markets when we obtained national reimbursement, we see a pretty accelerated kind of explosive growth. We saw that in Germany, we saw that in France and U.K. So we expect to see that same trajectory in Canada. And early indications suggest that kind of same curve. So that'll be also exciting for the team as we move into Q4. And as Miles also said, we're pleased with the partnership strategy that we've adopted. We've gone through it at a very intentional phased approach first with Bigfoot, as you know. We then moved into announcing our agreements with insulin manufacturers, like Novo and Sanofi, that connect Libre to their pen systems. And the next phase here, we'll start to move into insulin pumps, and that was the agreement that we announced yesterday with Tandem to codevelop an integrated system because we know this is an important segment also connecting to pumps. And we're now at a phase where we feel we can start to kind of roll that out as we've thought about our partnership strategy. So I think momentum here on Libre is exceptional. It is very strong. As we go into Q4, I think we've got a lot of stuff going right, firing all cylinders, whether it's commercial, whether it's operation, whether it's our R&D program. So I'm very confident on the sustainability of Libre and Libre going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : So 2 for me, 1 on capital allocation, 1 on MitraClip. Let me start, Miles, with capital allocation. Now that you have more financial flexibility, how are you thinking about capital allocation and the importance of reloading the pipeline? I think on the Q2 call, you seem to deprioritize buybacks. But yesterday, you announced a $3 billion share repurchase authorization. So has your view changed? And I just have one follow-up on MitraClip. Miles White : Well, I'd say -- look, we've come through a period where we've paid down a lot of debt, and I think we find ourselves in a good capital balance. I think we're -- we've gotten to the place where our net debt to EBITDA ratio is well ahead of what we targeted probably a year earlier than we expected and that's with an aggressive pay down strategy, et cetera. Our business is performing strong. Our cash flows are strong. Can we still continue to pay down debt? We can. Can we refinance debt? We can. Can we do things that are prudent, good balance sheet management? Yes. And we're also generating cash. We are generating sufficient cash, more than sufficient cash, to invest in a lot of manufacturing expansion for all the new products we've talked about. Robert just mentioned one of the biggest, and that's fully funded and obviously coming online and good. So you say, all right, well, then how about the dividend? Well, we raised the dividend 14% last December. And we have a targeted range where we like to keep that dividend as a percent of our EPS, et cetera. So as we go across all the things you can do with your cash, returning cash to shareholders is also a positive thing to do if the conditions are right and if the return is good, et cetera. And we want to be prepared to have that flexibility on the table as well. We have not done significant share repurchase, as you know, for several years while we focused on the pay down of debt. But now we wanted to add back the flexibility to do that as well. So I'd say, in general, we find ourselves in a strong cash position, strong performance position, good strong balance sheet position. We can continue to pay down some debt, but we've got the flexibility to do just about whatever makes sense for us on a return basis or return to shareholder basis. We don't have any active M&A on the radar screen to the extent that we track or follow anything. I'd say it's your typical bolt-ons and tuck-ins and so forth that are additions to already strong businesses. We're pretty happy with our pipeline. We're pretty happy with our R&D pipeline. So our standards are pretty high right now about what's attractive and what may not be. But I'm not forecasting anything significant at all in the M&A area. So obviously, we want to keep our options open here with how we manage cash for our shareholder. Larry Biegelsen : Very helpful. And then on MitraClip, you have -- U.S. reimbursement goes up in October. You hopefully will have coverage for the functional MR indication next spring. So you're thinking about 2020 as an inflection year for MitraClip. And in Europe, it looks like sales improved, growth improved this quarter. How are you feeling about MitraClip outside the U.S.? Miles White : Larry, I'm going to toss that one to Rob Ford. Robert Ford : Larry, thanks for the question. So we filed our MitraClip NCD. It was kind of opened in August. That time line there is -- usually takes about 9 months. I mean that's the statutory maximum, as we'll say. When we did FMR in MitraClip, that took about 7 months. So I think we'll be in the December-January time frame kind of get exactly what quarter that's going to land in. But in the meantime, you see kind of our growth rate. The reimbursement is going to be important, but Structural Heart was up mid-teens and the big driver of that was MitraClip, up 30%, up 50% in the U.S. So reimbursement is going to be important. There will definitely be an inflection point when we get it. But as I said in the previous call, that is a component. It's a building block here that we're focusing on. So opening new centers is another kind of key building block. We have about 400 today, and I do want to get to about 550 over time. And we've been supporting that with investments, investments in our sales force, our clinical specialists, our therapy development specialists, so that we can not only train the centers, train the implanters to keep up with that demand that we see, but also to support the demand generation through the development of this patient referral network. So that investment is ongoing, on target, on plan in terms of how we're ramping up the field team. And as Miles said in his opening comments, we continue to invest also in the innovation side, on the product development side. So in July, we obtained approval for our fourth-generation MitraClip, which has independent graspers, more sizes, et cetera, that basically give more options to the position. And so I think that MitraClip here is in its really early innings, although I think this is a multiyear, multibillion-dollar growth opportunity that we've got. And it is going to continue to ramp over time, and we're making the investments to make sure we're going to lead in that. So as I look into 2020, I think we've got the right momentum. And once we have NCD coverage, yes, I think there'll be an inflection to growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Just 2 quick product related questions. First, a follow-up on the Libre 2 commentary. Just to kind of set expectations, just curious, has there been any new data request from the agency? And is approval of Libre 2 in the U.S. you think possible in the next couple months? Or could it take a little longer? Miles White : Listen, we've -- what I'll say is that, probably, we've obviously misjudged that. So I'm not going to sit here and try and pinpoint the exact time line of the approval. As I said also, we've actively been working through a handful of open items with the agency. And that's where we're at. Robert Hopkins : Okay. Fair enough. And then I'd also want to ask on Pediatric Nutritionals in China. And it's -- just curious if you could elaborate a little bit more on the slowdown there. And then just wondering if you could comment on China more broadly and your confidence in growth continuing in China. So just comment on Pediatric Nutritionals in China, please. Robert Ford : Sure. Let me start off then with the nutritional question here then. So you saw our Nutrition business was just under 4%. We had really good growth in the U.S. in pediatrics up 4%, double-digit growth in international adult for the second quarter in a row. So our challenge here really was the international pediatric performance. This was really driven by Greater China. And I would say there were some challenging market dynamics here. As Miles mentioned, we're seeing the consumer trade up into the premium brand segment, but the volume has been declining partly because of this low birth rate. So this has led to, what I would say, a much more competitive environment, competitive in terms of pricing, competitive in terms of promotional activities. And this has now got our full attention, full attention from the management team here. And our key thing is really focusing. And the market dynamics are the market dynamics, but we've got to really focus on improving our competitive fitness, our competitive position here in the pediatric segment. We're launching a series of new strategies here in the coming weeks regarding our media campaigns, strengthening our consumer relationship platforms. We've got some plans to launch some new products over the next several quarters. So I'd say that the key focus of us right now in nutrition really has been, at this point here, to focus on improving our competitive fitness in China. Miles White : And I'll follow up on the rest of the other businesses in China. I'll give you a little bit of context. I think I'll speak as a CEO. We, the multinational CEOs of the world, or we -- if we do business in China, are we nervous about trade? Are we nervous about China? Are we nervous about all this? I think you can't help but be nervous about it. But I'll tell you what's interesting. While it's affecting some segments of the U.S. economy and U.S. businesses pretty directly, it doesn't seem to be affecting us or our business. The nutrition challenge we have is completely separate from any kind of trade or economic or economy issues other than birth rates. And the performance in our Device businesses, our Diagnostics businesses and so forth are double digits and strong. There's all kinds of ways that people can hypothesize that maybe the Chinese government would intervene and make things more difficult and so forth for U.S. multinationals. But in our business, we actually don't see that. And the product approvals are coming in a timely manner. The China FDA is doing everything that they're supposed to do and -- for our products. We haven't seen any of that kind of friction at all. And the demand for our products and the performance of our businesses in China has been strong. Other than the challenge we've got with Pediatric Nutrition, all other businesses are doing well, show no signs of any kinds of issues. So while I know that there are industries and segments that are tied to whether it's automobiles, oil, big industries, et cetera, that may have challenges, particularly agriculture, we're not seeing that. And our China business is good. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Two for me. Maybe Miles, starting off with that last question on the macro of China. I know there are number of moving parts, China, 4X7 on the drug side. Some questions around maybe CapEx slowdown, Diagnostics slowdown. Just to be clear, what is your exposure either on the drug or diagnostics side to China? And maybe broadly comment on emerging markets in general. It looks like some of those markets are slowing down. And how is Abbott positioned to handle some of the macro slowdown, if you will? Miles White : Well, we're just going to try to figure out who answers what part of that question. I'd say this. Underlying growth in emerging markets is still good. Has it slowed some? Yes, it has slowed some, but it's still good. It's a relative thing. So the underlying growth we see in India, Latin America, China, et cetera, it's all good. You can say there's the occasional Argentina. Okay, that's not good. Argentina is its own thing. But there are -- the advancement of health care systems, the advancement in demand for health products, pharmaceuticals, et cetera, strong. China, in particular, for us for our pharmaceutical business, strong. We're doing well. I don't think we have a lot of exposure. I'll let Robert expand on that in a minute. But overall, I think the conditions for us on those markets remain strong. As we've said many, many times, single most difficult thing we deal with is the volatile currency, if it's volatile. And sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. And right now, currency isn't exactly working on our favor in those markets. So while we grow at a pretty healthy rate on an underlying basis and typically faster than the market, currency erases some of that. Robert? Robert Ford : Yes. I'll just -- Vijay, on the generic pharma in China, I think you're referring to the 4+7 tendering process there. We haven't seen an impact, and we don't anticipate a significant impact going forward. We have a fairly kind of concentrated portfolio here of products, just about 15 products here. Most of these products are more specialized kind of segments and areas where there's it's kind of difficult to manufacture. So on the generic side of the pharma business, we're less susceptible to this. Obviously, we're going to monitor. We're part of this process. We understand how the tendering process is going to work. But if I think about kind of bigger impact, we have less of an impact here given the portfolio of products we have in China. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, guys. And just one quick one on guidance maybe for Brian. Brian, looks like the Q4 guidance is implying really strong margin expansion, 200 basis points plus. Just given some of the comments on FX, maybe clarify the FX hit to Q4 on the margin side. And in general, when you look at 2020, what kind of headwinds are we looking at from an FX perspective? Brian Yoor : Yes. From a top line next year, I'm not prepared to talk about next year. But I think there would be naturally some flow through on the top line next year, Vijay. Perhaps Scott can get back to you on that, but let me circle back. If you look at Q3, you saw we had gross margins of 59.2%. You were absolutely correct. Foreign exchange had an impact on us of about 50 basis points. Otherwise, it would be at 59.7%. So I feel good about where we're guiding Q4. Q4 tends to be that quarter where we get a little bit more natural leverage as well. And you'll see that play out through the bottom line. Pretty consistent with how we thought about this at the beginning of the year. As you know, I mean, gross margin improvement is just part of our DNA. It's part of what we do and how we think about in addition to cash flow and is something we're going to continue to improve upon across all of our businesses. And I think you could expect that to continue in the next year. That's how we get to double-digit growth that we usually start with and continue to invest back into our SG&A and R&D for our growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Miles, I was hoping you could touch on the Diagnostics business. This is one you've called out for many quarters now as a durable, multiyear growth driver for the company. We saw fantastic growth in Core Lab this quarter, even without really benefit from Alinity hitting U.S. Maybe you could just update us on the status of where you are in Europe in terms of the rollout, what you're seeing in terms of competition because we're seeing some negative results from competitors and then the latest and thoughts on the U.S. launch and how we think that uptake there. Miles White : Okay. Thanks, Robbie. I'm going to have Robert do that. Robert Ford : So Robbie, we've talked about how this is a multiyear opportunity, and we've been executing on this. Very, very focused here. If you think about the Core Lab and the rollout of Alinity program, it's doing very well. And you can see that in our top line. The rollout has been particularly strong in Europe. We're winning over 50% of the businesses where we targeted an entrenched competitor. And if you think about kind of the renewal process, we're retaining nearly all of our current business that comes up for contract. So we placed over 3,000 -- over 3,700 instruments. And when we gave out that number, we're talking about instruments that are actually placed in the market, placed in the account, running tests and generating revenue. So that's gone very well. In the quarter, you saw that we also got an approval in the U.S. for the Alinity blood and plasma screening. So this fourth quarter here, the team is already kind of rolling out that commercial launch. We had a lot of success in rolling out the blood plasma systems in Europe and in Asia last year. So it's great to see that a little bit ahead of schedule here in the U.S. And the team has jumped on, on the opportunity. As relates to the immunoassay side, a lot of our focus here is really kind of ramping up on the R&D side, ramping up the menu and the assay menu. I'd say that assay completion rate of what we need to be kind of fully competitive in Europe is getting close to that 100% mark that we need. And in the U.S., it's a little bit behind, but a lot of our focus here is to get those systems, those assays approved and in place. And we'll start to see that kind of play affecting our growth rate in the U.S. as we move into next year. So I think, internationally, we're doing really well. U.S., we've got the opportunity here as the assays come onboard to be able to accelerate our growth rates. So I'm really pleased with the momentum that the team has done here. Of course, we could -- we feel that we can always do better, and that's what we're going to keep on pushing to. Robert Marcus : Great. And maybe just one quick follow-up in Neuromodulation. Numbers came in a little softer than The Street was looking for. I'm assuming a big chunk of that was in the spinal cord stim market. Maybe you could just update us as to what exactly you're seeing on the ground with Abbott and what you think is driving the deceleration in the market here in the U.S.? Miles White : Yes, sure. So obviously, still work in progress here. It's a little bit longer than we had initially hoped. When we've talked about it over the last couple of quarters, we've talked about the sales force hiring, the sales force productivity. And it's a very specific selling process here in devices. And if you're a new rep, it takes some time to kind of understand it. So that's been going -- that's been progressing well. We've had some stabilization in the sales force. And some of the monthly KPIs that we track them on, they're improving. But we've also seen, as you pointed out, a little bit of a market decline, especially in the first half of this year. And it follows a couple of years of double-digit growth, right? So a lot of our focus here has got to be on sales force execution and productivity. The approval of Proclaim XR this quarter, I think, really provides a nice addition to the portfolio. It provides the sales force with a new technology to promote. And early signs of the launch, it's only been a couple of weeks, but early signs are positive. We tend to look at our trials -- on our trials across the U.S. in spinal as our leading indicator. And I'd say, early signs are positive, but there's more monitoring there for us to be aware of. On the market side, there's real no third-party data source here like we have in stents or pacemakers, et cetera. So it's a little bit difficult to peg the growth rate here. We usually have to wait until everybody reports and can kind of look at and add it up and kind of see where it's at. So I would anticipate here Q3 to be similar in terms of market growth rate as to the first half of this year, which is in that low to mid-single-digit decline here. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Frederick Wise : Miles, I'm always embarrassed to ask questions about the EPD business because I always feel like I don't really understand it. But I understand enough to see that you actually, x currency, had another solid quarter in many of the emerging markets that you're targeting. Maybe just help us understand some of your high-level thoughts there or the outlook. Is it going as you would have expected? Growth has slowed a little bit relative to the last few years. But again, seems like on track and sustainably on track. Is that the right way to think about it? Miles White : Yes. Rick, I'd say I'm never quite as satisfied as I'd like to be. That's for sure. What -- we've learned a couple of things. I think of the 7 or 8 years we've now been fundamentally focused on emerging markets and their growing economies and so forth, I'd say, if anything was underestimated, it was the degree of volatility of currency, which is also heavily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar. And while we can't predict those things, since this business is 100% in emerging markets, that's always a bit of a challenge. Now that said, the underlying growth in those markets has been steadily strong. And it's interesting. One indicator of the attractiveness for those markets is, let's just say, the multiples and prices and so forth that anybody who owns a pharmaceutical business in those markets thinks that the company is worth. And as we track those for a long time, they're probably some of the highest multiples in the world than any business -- the businesses that make money. They're attractive. The markets are attractive. The attractive parts of branded, generic pharmaceutical worldwide, they're the most profitable. They're very profitable markets for good branded products as compared to Europe or the U.S. or something like that if you're in that business. So we targeted this business for a reason. There's underlying real growth. Brands matter. Quality matters. Breadth matters. And it's kind of all the fundamentals that we think are stable, durable, attractive, et cetera. And frankly, all those economies have progressed as we would like, maybe not as stably and maybe not as strongly, in some cases, but the growth there is still strong. Our own challenge is the R&D investments, to continue to expand product lines and product depth into the markets. We keep our R&D somewhat decentralized by region. India has its own, Latin America has its own, et cetera. We're always looking for greater and greater productivity and greater and greater launch activity out of our teams. Every now and then, we're going to run into an Argentina, a Venezuela or a tax issue in a country, like we did in India a couple of years ago, et cetera that are going to put a dent in the growth rate for a given year, and we've seen that. But the underlying fundamentals are quite strong, quite good. And we keep plugging away at all the fundamentals that we know how to manage. And as you can tell, this last year, we've had steady sequential improvement in our performance, excluding exchange. And they're up at 8%. I think that's pretty good. That means that we know how to take the corrective actions to get stronger, to get better, to drive the business better. And I think the fact that the managers of pharmaceutical business are up to an 8% growth rate and looking forward to even improvement in that -- I think that's pretty strong. So yes, we like the business. Frederick Wise : Great. And if I could follow up just on 2 quick things. At TCT, we saw some very solid Portico data. I assume we're still on track for mid-2020 U.S. launch. Any updates there would be great on Portico. And last, just -- the U.S. Vascular business still seems pressured, not really improving. What are the issues? What are you doing? I know you're so focused on execution. Is it competition? Is it -- how do you turn that portion of the business around? Robert Ford : Rick, this is Robert here. So on your Portico question, yes, we submitted end of Q3, so we expect a kind of midyear approval here and launch. And we're getting ready for that. On your question on Vascular, as we've previously mentioned, there are a couple, what I would call, noncommercial items that impacted growth rate here. These are third-party royalties, third-party manufacturing agreements that we put in place as part of the St. Jude divestiture, some of the assets. So those -- as those ramp down, as those manufacturing agreements ramp down, those royalties ramp down, they obviously impact the growth rate. And we've allocated those agreements into the U.S. line, even though they're global agreements. So if you remove those items that are naturally going down as we transition the manufacturing over to the new owners of those businesses and as the royalties ramp down, you remove that out, our Vascular business was flat. And the dynamic there was really a little bit of pricing that we've seen on the stent side. We've continued to grow share in the U.S. actually and maintain our leadership position in the international markets. And that price pressure was then offset by double-digit growth in our Endo and peripheral business and in our imaging and diagnostic business. And that's part of our strategy, which is we know that there will be some pricing pressure on the DES side, and we know we need to make our investments to maintain our competitive position there. But we also know that we're over investing in our Endo and our imaging strategy, so that those businesses can get large enough and that those double digits then can really return Vascular to a healthy growth rate. Operator : And our last question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Matthew Taylor : I was hoping that you might just expound a little bit on the Libre dynamics given the continued strength that you've seen outside the U.S. Could you comment on anything like installed base, mix of type 1 versus type 2? Are payers getting involved? Do they see value there? Anything like that, that could help us understand the sustainability of the growth, especially outside the U.S. where you continue to have a larger and larger base? Robert Ford : Yes. So let's talk about that base. I mean, the one way to describe it here that it's pretty large and it's growing. We focus a lot on the sales side. But if you look at the user base where you're at the 1.5 million, close to 1.6 million users at the end of this quarter, as we talked a little bit, there's a little bit of constraint on that user base given our manufacturing capacity. So as we've now unleashed it, I think we've got the potential here to kind of grow that user base even faster. One of the things that is important here that we've seen as payers and contract start to look at this is that they're very convinced on the outcomes of using sensor-based technology. There's a lot of clinical data that proves that. We actually have RCT trials that show that Libre reduces hypo, reduces time out of range, reduces the time that patients are in hypoglycemia. And we backed it up with some fairly large real world evidence trials showing that. And competitors also have that, too. So the value proposition here is how do you get that outcome at a cost that makes sense for the payer where they can actually expand the use of the product and the technology into a much larger user base versus kind of niching it to kind of very small segments. And that's been the value proposition that we've adopted. And as I said in the beginning of the call, that value proposition is not only very intact, but it is growing. And we see that in the negotiations we've had with Canadian reimbursement authorities. We see that expansion of the technology beyond just type 1 or insulin users in other markets. We start seeing it expand into type 2. So we think the value proposition here is very strong, and it's a real opportunity to provide the benefits of the outcomes that are proven at a cost profile that makes sense for the payers. So -- and it's ultimately about having the impact on outcomes for patients. And we're seeing that through our trials and through our real world evidence. If you think about the composition of the patients, we're looking at 50-50. We're getting a lot of type 1s and insulin users, but we're also getting a lot of type 2s, type 2s that are on single injections or type 2s that are on oral medication. There are different utilization rates, but we're getting all those patients. Matthew Taylor : One quick follow-up. Are you now completely unconstrained on manufacturing? Robert Ford : Yes. Miles White : Okay. I'm going to wrap up where we started. We had a strong quarter, exceptionally strong quarter. Our momentum continues. We've got some great growth drivers in Libre, MitraClip, the Alinity platforms, other businesses. They're all growing, many of them double digits and across the board. So the balance of that performance across all businesses and across all geographies is heartening. It is sustainable. We -- our top line growth rate was 7.6% this quarter. We think it will be close to 8% in the fourth quarter. And as we look into 2020, I see no reason to change any expectations about the strength of our top line sales growth rate, which is, I think, all of you know, for a fairly large company, unusual to find. The other people that are able to do this are tech companies. And so we've got some great strengths here owing to the strength of our pipeline, our new product launches, the improvements to access and/or reimbursements and further capabilities of those products. So we've got a good sustainable road ahead of us. Obviously, there are surprises or things that don't meet our expectations from time to time or the speed with which we want to accomplish things. But overall, I think this is good evidence to you all, a good performance, super performance, really, and sustainably so. We look at 2020 with great optimism and great expectations, in spite of a lot of the uncertainties in the world and in the economies around the world. We're feeling pretty strong and pretty bullish about where we sit. So with that, we'll see you in 90 days. Scott Leinenweber : Well, thank, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks. Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2020. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles White : Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. 2019 was another highly successful year for Abbott. Our focused execution resulted in strong financial performance, including ongoing earnings per share of $3.24, reflecting 12.5% growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of currency. All 4 of our businesses performed well, contributing to full year organic sales growth of more than 7.5%, which is above the guidance range we set at the beginning of last year. The successful year was capped off by a strong fourth quarter with organic sales growth of 8.5%, including double-digit sales growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Core Laboratory Diagnostics, along with ongoing EPS growth of more than 17%. Our consistent strong performance demonstrates that our business model is working exactly as intended. We've built the company very deliberately through a multiyear process to deliver superior results for years to come. We've shaped our businesses to align with important trends to make sure we're in the right places with the right products. And we've targeted businesses that are focused on some of the world's greatest health care concerns. For example, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are 2 of the most significant health care challenges of our lifetime. They are chronic, long-lasting and dramatically increasing in prevalence around the world. Nearly every health care decision begins with a diagnostic test. And this testing not only occurs in the traditional hospital setting but also increasingly at alternate sites such as physicians' offices, pharmacies and even at home. Proper nutrition is a foundational element of good health across every stage of life, whether you're a newborn baby, a child striving to grow or an aging adult working to overcome a health condition. And access to health care continues to expand rapidly in emerging markets where 85% of the world's population resides. We've shaped our company to achieve scale and leadership positions in all of these areas. The investments we've made and our focus on execution are working. Our product pipelines are strong. Our operating culture is strong, and we're well positioned to achieve sustainable strong growth for years to come. For 2020, we're forecasting another year of top-tier financial performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.55 to $3.65, reflecting double-digit growth. I'll now provide a brief overview of our 2019 results and 2020 outlook for each business. And I'll start with Diagnostics where sales grew 6.5% in the fourth quarter, led by double-digit growth in Core Laboratory Testing. The rollout of Alinity continues to go well in Europe where we're winning new business at a high rate and successfully renewing existing contracts that come up for bid. We continue to expand our rollout of Alinity systems across multiple key markets, including the U.S. where last year we obtained FDA approval of Alinity for blood and plasma screening and have made significant progress obtaining regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our immunoassay and clinical chemistry test menu. I'll turn now to Nutrition where sales increased 6% in the quarter, led by strong growth across several countries and segments of our business, including Southeast Asia and Latin America, across both Pediatric and Adult Nutrition as well as above-market growth in the U.S. In Pediatric Nutrition, growth was driven by PediaSure, our nutrition solution to help kids grow and thrive; and Pedialyte, our oral rehydration product, which continues to see unprecedented uptake with both children and adults. In Adult Nutrition, global growth of 10% in the fourth quarter was led by Ensure, our leading complete and balanced nutrition brand; and Glucerna, our leading brand for people with diabetes. Moving now to Medical Devices where sales increased nearly 11.5% in the fourth quarter led by double-digit growth in Structural Heart, Diabetes Care, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure. In Structural Heart, sales increased 17% in the fourth quarter. Over the last couple of years, our portfolio and long-term growth opportunities in this area have strengthened considerably. We've been building our position organically in this area for quite some time when in 2017, the combination with St. Jude created what I'd now consider a best-in-class Structural Heart portfolio. MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation or leaky heart valve, is the cornerstone of our portfolio with annual sales this past year of nearly $700 million, growing 30%. Last year, we obtained an important new indication in the U.S. that significantly expands the number of people that can be treated with MitraClip. And just last week, we announced that we're initiating a clinical trial that offers the potential to expand the treatable patient population even further. Beyond MitraClip, several exciting technologies are expected to emerge from our Structural Heart pipeline in 2020, including CE Mark approvals for TriClip, a first-of-its-kind technology to repair leaky tricuspid heart valves; and for Tendyne, which targets replacement of the mitral valve as well as U.S. approval of Portico for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Turning now to Diabetes Care where sales increased nearly 35% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre, our revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system. Several years back, we saw an opportunity to approach continuous glucose monitoring or CGM in a fundamentally different manner compared to others in the space. We challenged ourselves to rethink existing paradigms as we sought to develop a solution that would truly benefit the mass population of people living with diabetes around the world. That aspiration influenced every aspect of Libre : highly accurate, simple to use, particularly affordable and easy for patients to access. The results of our unique approach have been remarkable by any measure. Libre has quickly become the global market-leading wearable CGM. Its user base has roughly doubled each year to its current level of approximately 2 million users globally, including the highest user base among CGMs in the U.S. Reimbursement coverage has ramped up quickly around the world as payers increasingly recognize its highly differentiated value proposition. And it's the only CGM that's widely available through the pharmacy channel, which is a significant benefit for patients as it simplifies the process of acquiring the product. In 2019, Libre achieved full year sales approaching $2 billion, an increase of 70% versus the prior year. And importantly, as we plan for the substantial growth opportunity to come, we significantly expanded our manufacturing capacity to keep up with anticipated demand for this life-changing technology. Now I'll wrap up with Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD where sales increased 10% in the quarter, led by growth across several geographies in Latin America and Asia. For the full year, sales increased 7% for the second year in a row as this business continues to execute its unique branded generic strategy in emerging markets. These markets are growing rapidly, their populations are aging, their middle classes are expanding, and health care spending is increasing due to improving access to health care. Our strategy to build significant presence and scale in these markets is unique and continues to result in strong growth. So in summary, this was another highly successful year with strong performance across our businesses. We continue to strengthen our leadership positions in some of the largest and fastest-growing areas in health care, and we're entering 2020 with great momentum across our businesses and targeting another year of strong organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2019 results and 2020 outlook in more detail. Brian? Brian Yoor : Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 8.5%. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on fourth quarter sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.7% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 28.3% of sales. The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 12.8%, lower than our previous full year guidance of around 14.5% due to continued implementation of and adaptation to the U.S. tax reform regulations. Our fourth quarter tax rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to achieve our full year revised effective tax rate of 14%. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2020. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.55 to $3.65. For the full year, we forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 0.5% on our full year reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses, offset by the impacts of investments to support the rapid market adoption of our Alinity diagnostic systems, investments in Libre and MitraClip manufacturing capacity expansions and the impact of currency mix. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. We forecast net interest expense of around $515 million and nonoperating income of around $200 million. Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of 13.5% to 14% for the full year 2020. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.69 to $0.71, which reflects double-digit growth. We forecast organic sales growth of around 7% and, at current rates, would expect exchange to have a negative impact of a little more than 1% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 58.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 32% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $130 million in the first quarter. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid- to high single-digit growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In Nutrition, we forecast growth of around 4% for the full year and growth of 3% to 4% for the first quarter. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid- to high single-digit growth for both the first quarter and full year. And in Medical Devices, we forecast double-digit growth, similar to last year, for both the first quarter and full year. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Oh, great. So I guess first, Miles, congratulations on such an incredible run of 20-plus years of value creation. Obviously, an incredibly impressive track record. And in light of that, now the first question, I'd love to ask both you and Robert to comment on a topic that I know is on the minds of most investors from a big-picture perspective. And that is the durability of the incredible 7% revenue growth outlook that you guys have expressed for 2020 and beyond. And the main reason I want to ask that question is that when you take a step back, there is no other company in med tech modeling anything close to that kind of growth off of that large of a base especially for multiple years. So Miles, for you, I guess just if you wouldn't mind providing some big-picture thoughts on that durability topic. And then for Robert, maybe getting a little bit more specific on the product areas that give you the confidence long term and whether or not M&A or divestitures could play a slightly bigger role going forward to help you maintain that level of growth. Miles White : Bob, this is Miles. The temptation to sort of say something that sticks my successor with just unbelievable goals for the future, et cetera, is overwhelming, so I'm going to speak first. Seriously, we have been building what we've got here for an extended period of time. It didn't just happen. It's not based on a single driving product or driving business. It's actually quite broad-based across all of our businesses. And while a lot of people have commented to me or us that, \"Gee, you've got the law of big numbers and hard for a big company to grow, et cetera,\" we don't actually feel like that big a company. And we don't necessarily feel, even though we've got leading positions in so many of our businesses, we don't actually feel like the law of big numbers is working against us. We feel like the opportunity for growth, if you've got an innovative pipeline and you're in markets where there's a natural tailwind of growth demographically or from an innovation standpoint and so on, I don't really think that this whole notion of, gee, our size or big numbers applies. If we were a tech company, you wouldn't be asking us that because we'd be too small. So I think if we look at the size of the opportunities, where we've placed the company and its businesses and the portfolio of products and geographies and so forth, I think there's enormous market opportunity that's untapped. And I think there's enormous penetration to be tapped. And I think there's some obvious examples out there. And fortunately, in all of our businesses, I think every one of them is innovating and creating new products and innovating to replace older products in a way that's really never been true before. And it's across the board. And so as we look forward at that and model it, we think our growth rates are sustainable. How far out are they sustainable? I don't know, but years anyway. And are we going to have speed bumps? We're going to have speed bumps of our own making. We're going to have speed bumps from trade. We're going to have speed bumps from exchange. We're going to have speed bumps in any number of ways as all companies have and do. And yet we -- and we have them now, and we're still growing at a very healthy, strong rate. And I credit the innovation pipeline, some smart acquisitions at the right time with the right businesses, the right strategies, the right fits. I credit the execution of our organization and the culture of execution that is here. I have super confidence in my successor, no qualms. The minute you retire, everybody thinks you ought to diversify your holdings because you're too concentrated in one thing. I only wish I had more. And I'll remind him every day that I'm a shareholder, but -- which he knows. But I have nothing but confidence in the pipeline, the management, the products, the strategies and the new leader who's going to take over from me. I have tremendous confidence in Robert, and he's got all the abilities, all the skills, et cetera. So we can keep talking about the law of big numbers, and gee, how do you grow on this base? We don't feel slowed or anything by that. We feel like we've got tremendous opportunity to sustain our growth rates. Robert Ford : Yes. Bob, this is Robert here. As you're aware, under Miles' leadership the last 20-plus years, Abbott's been reshaped several times. I was close to him and to the Board when we went with this last reshaping of the company to really position and align our businesses to kind of high-growth markets, geographies, et cetera. And as Miles said, it wasn't just the acquisition piece of it, which was important, but it was also how we looked at our internal R&D, our internal innovation and how we thought about it. So obviously, with the transition here as CEO, there's the natural question of the incoming, do they think differently? Is there a change in strategy? Is it a different way of thinking? And I can tell you, I'm very much aligned with Miles. We see things very similar as it relates to our strategy, how we operate, the philosophy of the company, the vision we have for Abbott. And in the last 18 months, for me in particular, to be kind of close to Miles during this transition period, being closer to him with his mentorship and learning how he has been able to kind of create value, as you referenced in the beginning there, that leaves me with my #1 priority to do that is to really execute, as Miles said, on these organic growth opportunities we have. And we have multiple growth drivers, as you know, Bob, that, in my opinion, they're in their very early stages. Whether it's Libre, the Alinity rollouts, our rejuvenated cardiovascular portfolio, I think we've got a great opportunity in our adult international nutrition business; our branded generic pharmaceutical business in the emerging markets, which is a very unique strategy. So I look at all of that, and your question of how sustainable is this? I think all these opportunities are in the early stages here. And it's really going to be up to me and the team here to make sure that we maximize on all of these opportunities. So we've got a portfolio that's aligned to the biggest areas of medical need, attractive geographies. As Miles said about the pipeline, it's a very rich pipeline. We talk about how this pipeline has evolved and how we haven't seen as rich as a pipeline at Abbott in a long time. And it's a nice cadence also. It's not just a kind of one and done. We've got multiple kind of rollouts here. Our -- the way we operate is very strong. Miles talked about our culture. We set high aspirations for ourselves, and we do have a culture of accountability of execution. And then you layer that in with 100,000 of colleagues around the world that are passionate. They care about what they're doing. They believe in what we're doing. They believe in our strategy. I think we've got all the elements here to be able to sustain this kind of growth rate going forward. Robert Hopkins : Great. That's super helpful. Just one super short follow-up on diabetes. Robert, if you wouldn't mind, just give us a quick update on Libre 2 time lines and your thoughts there. And then if you're willing to give us a sense for, in your 2020 guidance, what sort of growth assumption are you making for Libre in 2020? Robert Ford : Sure. So on Libre 2, specifically last October, I mentioned that we were working through a handful of issues. Quite frankly, we encountered these handful of issues in other parts of our businesses too. So it's nothing that for us is terribly surprising. It's normal. I'm not going to go into any of the real specifics here. But what I will say, Bob, is that since that time in October, I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made. And I continue to be very confident in Libre 2 and its performance and the product itself and in its iCGM label. So regarding the guidance on Libre 2, what I can tell you is that we've got a lot of growth. We -- our guidance contemplates a lot of Libre growth. So we're not necessarily differentiating here between 1 and 2. But if you look at our Q4, we had a great Q4 with Libre, and that's without Libre 2 in the U.S. It was a great way to exit and to enter 2020. As Miles said, we're the market leader in CGM in revenue and in the amount of patients, and we're growing at twice the rate. Our strategy here has always been -- Miles talked about challenging some of the paradigms. It has always been, from the moment we launched, to look at this as a more kind of consumer retail, kind of Web shop online play here. So when you look at our Q4, you don't see that kind of big Q4 spike and then drop in Q1, which you usually see from kind of medical benefit DME products. Our growth is very kind of consistent and sequential. The U.S. has done very well in the year. Obviously, we want to do better, but we exited the year with well over 0.5 million patients in the U.S. We set up some goals for 2019 as it relates to distribution, payer coverage in the U.S., formulary positions. And we exited 2019 exactly where we wanted to be with all of those goals all favorable to Libre. So our focus in the U.S. in 2020 here is really to take advantage of what we've established in terms of the infrastructure and drive demand. So you'll see more TV advertising. You'll see more sales force expansion. You'll see more partnerships and execution of those partnerships. You'll see more sampling. And I think that, that same momentum that you see in the U.S. is also there in our international markets, which is obviously a much larger base for us, and we saw great momentum in Q4. So our 2020 here is really focusing on international markets is expanding Libre into geographies that we haven't yet launched. We were capacity constrained in 2019, so there are several markets that we haven't launched. And we've put in place now plans to roll Libre into those new geographies and roll out Libre 2 into some of those Libre 1 markets. One thing I think is important to kind of put front and center here is the clinical aspect of Libre. It is the most studied CGM right now. And if you look at the data, whether it's our data, whether it's real-world evidence data, whether it's third-party government-sponsored trials, they all say the same thing, which is people that use Libre have better outcomes. They live better. Their A1c drops. Their hypo drops. Their rate of hospitalization goes down. So the value proposition that we've always envisioned for Libre, not only is it intact, but we actually see it growing. It's an easy-to-use, intuitive, consumer-friendly product that delivers the outcomes that are real and measurable, and it's priced for mass adoption. It's affordable. We always saw the therapy benefit not only for type 1s and for pumpers. We saw this therapy benefit for people that were on one-shot-a-day insulin, oral med patients. So we always looked at this market to be 80 million to 100 million people. Now is it going to penetrate all 100 million people? That might be a little bit too aspirational. But what I would say is that is it more than 2 million, 3 million, 5 million, 10 million people? Absolutely. And that's how we're building our strategy : investing in the product, investing in awareness and investing in the scalability so we can capitalize on this opportunity. Operator : And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : I'll echo Bob's sentiment. Miles, sorry to see you go, but we're very happy to have someone so confident as Robert step in. Maybe if we could turn to Structural Heart. I was wondering if you could give an update on where we are with reimbursement and MitraClip. And then also, a bit more broadly, Miles, you talked about some of the new product launches we're going to see in 2020. Maybe you could just walk us through those and the expectations throughout the year. Robert Ford : So Robbie, I'll take that. On MitraClip, listen, we had a great quarter, had a great year. And as Miles said in his comments, about $700 million product growing at 30%. And the interesting thing here is that the penetration of the therapy is only at about 5%, right? So we see a long opportunity. I talked about MitraClip being a multiyear, multibillion-dollar opportunity here, and there's several elements to that. CMS reimbursement is an important building block. We expect that sometime in Q2. But I've always said that it was more than just the CMS reimbursement for the indication expansion we got. We know that we need to be able to penetrate the therapy. We need to open new centers, make it more available to do that. We need to hire more reps, invest in field clinical teams to be able to get that penetration. And we've also invested in a lot of clinical evidence and building clinical evidence here. We just recently announced our study to investigate MitraClip in moderate-risk surgical patients. So again, we've been investing to build this market. And obviously, MitraClip gets a lot of attention in the Structural Heart portfolio. But if I take a step back here, I think it's important that we look at -- we've always seen valvular heart disease as a big opportunity for Abbott, whether it's the demographics, whether it's the medical need. And we saw this unique opportunity with the St. Jude acquisition to put together our MitraClip capabilities with the portfolio of St. Jude and really create a stand-alone business unit that was best-in-class for Structural Heart, and we did that. And it's been about 2 years that we've done that. And I think we're seeing really the impact of the effect of a dedicated team, R&D, clinical. And we've got a nice cadence of products coming out this year as a result of that work. We've got 2 new CE approvals that we expect this year. Miles mentioned them. TriClip, this is a modified version of our MitraClip to treat the leaky heart valve. We believe it's a big opportunity because therapy -- if mitral therapy is low, tricuspid leaky valve treatment or repair is even lower. So we know that -- we know how to build this. We did it with mitral, and we're going to go about doing it the same way, building the capabilities, the clinical evidence. Another big opportunity we have is with Tendyne. This will be the first minimally invasive mitral replacement valve. So if you think about our team right now, we've built a lot of competency on mitral repair. And now we're going to put in the hands of this team not only the opportunity to offer repair but also a replacement solution that's minimally invasive. And I think there's a great opportunity for us in that space, too. Both those products are enrolling here in the U.S., so we do plan to bring those to the U.S. On the aortic side, we've made investments on Portico. We knew that we needed to make some clinical and some R&D investments here to increase the competitiveness of the system. And we like the data. We think there's going to be a segment of the population, segment of the market that we will be able to compete effectively. It's under FDA review, and we expect approval shortly. And then finally, on our structural interventions, this is a part of the portfolio that doesn't get a lot of attention here, but it's about 1/4 of our Structural Heart business. It's growing double digit. We've got great products there. We've seen a great ramp-up with our stroke prevention technology with PFO, our congenital business; and Amulet, which is right now under clinical evaluation in the U.S. for treatment of LAA. So I take a step back here, I said, yes, MitraClip is a big growth driver. We've got a lot of things going right there. We're making the right investments from a clinical, from a commercial perspective. But I look at the portfolio that's been built here, and I'm very excited. It's very complete. It's very differentiated, and there's a nice cadence, Robbie, to the launches. Robert Marcus : Great. Appreciate that. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Alinity still hasn't really started to launch in the U.S., yet you put up 13% growth in core lab in the fourth quarter. How should we be thinking about the impact in 2020 from Alinity both in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? Robert Ford : Yes. I think that we're going to continue to see this kind of rollout of the Alinity platform. The challenge we had a little bit in the U.S., and Miles talked about the progress we made, is that when we launched it in Europe, we had a more complete kind of assay menu. And that allowed us to more -- with more intentionality go after the market, the existing accounts, new accounts. And in the U.S., we've now achieved, let's say, a critical mass of assay menu, test panel, et cetera, that allows us to have that same kind of intentionality we had in Europe, have that same intentionality move into the U.S. Q4, we did have some capital sales, so that brings up the growth rate a little bit. But I think you're going to see the same kind of growth rate in the U.S., the same kind of ramp-up that we saw in Europe. Operator : And our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : I don't want to sound like a broken record, but I'll reiterate, Miles, there's some fairly significant and unique value creation over these last 20 years, so congratulations again on behalf of shareholders. Robert and Miles, just starting off with a couple of businesses that has lagged in 2019 that are actually showing some improvement here in the back half of '19, which were neuromodulation and CRM, some pretty decent improvement specifically in the fourth quarter. Wondering, Robert, if you can just talk through what specific changes have been made in those 2 businesses and how you're thinking about the outlook or sustainability of those franchises into 2020. And then I had a quick follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. So let's start a little bit with neuro then. I mean I think we had a tough year, full year in neuro. When we came into the year, we talked about some of the challenges we were up against, and there are really 2 we had. Obviously, the sales force expansion and some of the disruption that, that created, but we felt it was important to do to make that sales force expansion. And then some of the market declines that we saw. We've kind of seen double-digit growth in the beginning of the year, kind of saw that go to flat and even negative growth rates. So I think the sales force expansion piece, we kind of got past that in the middle of the year. It's a unique selling model. About 30% to 35% of our sales team in the U.S. was new. It was under a year, so we spent a lot of time getting them up to speed not only with their territories but how to go about the selling process, et cetera. And I think that's largely behind us. Now obviously, if you look at the sales reps, the ones that have 7 to 10 years of experience, they're much more productive than the ones that have got 12 months. But we're seeing a nice, steady ramp-up in terms of the productivity of those new sales reps. And the other thing we talked about was how innovation and new product launches could kind of fuel the market growth. And I think you saw that in Q4, not only with us but even with some of the other players in the market come out with new product launches, at least what I've seen now from some of the pre-announcements, having kind of an impact there. And so we came out with our product launch, Proclaim XR, early in Q4. And I think you saw the impact of that in Q4. I think it's a modest -- it was a modest improvement. We expect more. And a lot of our focus here in 2020 is going to be to ensure that this new sales team has got innovation to sell. So we're expanding our MRI portfolio. We know we need to do. We're launching a new radiofrequency ablation generator. This is an important part of our customers' practices, and we felt that we weren't as competitive with our offering there. So we've developed a new system that will be rolling out this year. And we also believe that programming and connectivity, connectivity to devices, consumer devices is an important aspect of patient adoption of the therapy. So we'll continue to work on how we integrate the implanted device into those more consumer products. And so we've got a nice cadence of rollouts there. And on the CRM side, we talked about this in the beginning of last year, we had -- we encountered some challenges. And we felt that one of the things that we needed to do for the CRM side was -- is to make sure it got more focus and more attention, not only from me obviously but from the management team. So we made an organizational structure change Q1 of last year, which got finalized in Q2, where we separated the CRM business from the EP business. And we didn't do it just from a field sales perspective. We did it really across all functions. So we have a dedicated CRM business unit with a dedicated leader, R&D, et cetera. And I think you've seen some of the output of that focus in the second half of the year. I would like to see a couple more quarters strung together. So that's what we're aspiring here to. But I think one of the biggest impacts of that focus, obviously the field has an impact, but I'm more excited about the focus on the R&D side. I think we had kind of slowed down our R&D innovation over here. And that focus, that dedicated business unit focus, I think you'll see the output of that not only in 2020, we have a couple of product launches in the U.S., a new ICD, and in Europe also, but we've got plans for a nice cadence of innovation in '21 and '22. So I'm excited about kind of what we've done there. Obviously, it's early innings in terms of this business unit to be creating, but I like what I see. David Lewis : Okay. And just 2 quick follow-ups for me. Just, Robert, on MitraClip, is there a specific embedded assumption in the guidance for MitraClip? And how acutely do you think we see that recovery in the back half? And then your margin guidance, about 50 basis points is a little lower than 2019, consistent with our numbers. But if you could just highlight 2 or 3 of the examples of significant reinvestment for growth in 2020, that would be super helpful. Robert Ford : So I just -- on your question about MitraClip, recovering growth, and I think we've been pretty strong in our growth rate. The U.S. has done very well. And what we saw in the international market, if that's what you're referring to, we did see that kind of impact of the -- some of the studies that came out in Europe impact us in the first quarter. But every quarter sequential to that, we've seen improvement, and I think we've passed that on. Regarding the guidance, I mean we've got a lot of growth, as I said, with Libre. We've got a lot of growth here. We've contemplated, as I said, CMS approval. But I have been fairly consistent with this : CMS approval is going to be an important aspect here, but it's not just that, right? It's the -- we've been showing really strong growth in the U.S. even without the reimbursement. And that's a result of the investments that we've been making both from a field and clinical perspective. And I'm sorry, what was the other question? Brian Yoor : It is on margin expansion. I'll start off by saying just margin improvement is an ongoing focus for us, David, has been and will continue to be, whether that's gross margin, whether that's the leverage we continue to get in SG&A. And yes, notably, we did see that this year. You may be off just a little bit from our model in the foreign currency mix. We have a little bit of a headwind next year. But we have a gross margin expansion plan underlying. But keep in mind, as Robert said, with these investments that we're doing for growth, whether that's continued Libre expansion, whether it's the most recent MitraClip expansion we announced as well as the unprecedented uptake of Alinity, that's presenting a little bit of a headwind. But that's a good news item in the short term. And longer term, you'll continue to see those gross margins expand as we look out over the years. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on a really nice print here. One, maybe on Nutrition, the adult side is coming really strong. I know China has been a bit of a bother with some regulatory changes a couple of years ago. Could you comment on what you're seeing in China? Is Adult Nutrition back? Has something changed in China for you guys? Robert Ford : Well, listen, we achieved a pretty strong growth rate in Q4. And that's despite some of the softness that we did see in China. We talked a little bit about it in Q3, Vijay. We've seen some improvement, but some of those dynamics are still there, whether it's the birth rate or some of the kind of competitive intensity. We have obviously developed a plan here as we were going into Q4 and going into 2020 here. A big part of that strategy to address some of those competitive dynamics there is innovation and product launches. And we've put a plan together here. We've got a nice steady steam -- stream of cadence of launches in China. But I do think that it does point out to the strength of our Nutrition business, that we're able to post this kind of growth rate despite still some continued softness in China. And I think that speaks to the strength of the business. Miles talked about we had some very strong growth in Southeast Asia and Latin America on both sides of the business, Pediatric and Adult. And I don't think that -- I think it shows this -- China is an important market for us for sure. It has our intentions -- our attention, but we're not overly reliant on it. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Robert. And one on Diagnostics. I know flu has been the topic du jour. I'm just curious on what it means for Diagnostics. On the core lab side, with Alinity, really strong trends. You spoke about continued share gains in Europe. I'm just curious where we are in -- on the U.S. side. Have you -- is the win rate on the U.S. side comparable to Europe? Or is that something that we should be expecting for the back half heading into 2021? Robert Ford : Yes. As I said in Europe, I think we've had kind of good success in Europe. We've talked about winning new businesses at that 50% rate, the renewals of our existing business or retailing nearly all of that business. And I think in the U.S. right now, it might be a little bit too early just because you don't -- we really didn't have the intentionality of the launch that we had in Europe. Now that we've got a more complete menu, I think our ability to compete and our competitive fitness, let's call it that way, in the U.S. increases to the same level that we've had in Europe. Operator : And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Congrats on another really strong quarter, and Miles, I'll echo what the other -- the other comment and add that I'll miss interacting with you on these calls. Always insightful and fun. Just 2 quick questions. One, maybe for Robert, on capital allocation. I know I've asked this on a few calls before, but you guys have paid down a lot of debt recently. Are you, Robert, maybe thinking about M&A a little bit differently? Should we expect more tuck-ins in 2020? And I just had one quick follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. I think what you'll see is the same philosophy, the same framework that we've had for all these years, which is a very kind of balanced approach. As you've said, a lot of our focus the last couple of years has been to pay down debt. We paid down close to $10 billion over the last 2 years. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is around 1.5 now. And we've got kind of payments that are due in the next few years, and that's all kind of contemplated in our capital plan. The other thing we're always going to have a mindful eye here, Larry, is ensuring that a portion of that capital goes back to our shareholders. Our dividend is a big part of our identity. We've increased our dividend for 47 consecutive years. This year, we just announced a 13% increase. So -- and we announced also at the end of last year a share repurchase of about $3 billion. We do that from time to time mainly to kind of offset dilution. We'll also look at our growth opportunities, and we've talked a lot about them, whether it's the rollout of Alinity, whether it's the manufacturing expansion of Libre. We just announced in Q4 a new manufacturing site, a second manufacturing site for MitraClip. Those are all great returns for our shareholders in terms of the return of that capital. And then on the M&A side, we're not looking to do any deals right now. I think the framework that Miles has always worked, it's true to me, which is it needs to meet our threshold of it being strategic or -- and at the same time, opportunistic. And we've been looking at it a lot. We're always studying. We're always looking. And I haven't seen anything crossing the radar here that kind of falls into those 2 buckets. But we're always going to keep looking as we've always done. Larry Biegelsen : Perfect. And then just one housekeeping. For Brian, and Brian, congratulations on your retirement, and I'll miss you as well. Just FX on EPS impact in 2020. Brian Yoor : The impact of what? Robert Ford : EPS FX. Brian Yoor : Oh, FX. It's around $0.05, Larry. Operator : And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Frederick Wise : Maybe I'll start off with EPD. EPD, Robert, is always a little bit of a black box to us medical device analysts or I'll just say to me. I won't drag everybody else into it. Currently doing exceptionally well, strong fourth quarter, and you're saying mid- to high single digits for 2020. But maybe just give us a little update on some of the key drivers. What could get you to the upper end of your range? And maybe some of the challenges, just give us some perspective about what you're thinking about for 2020. Robert Ford : Sure. I've heard this comment a couple of times now about kind of EPD or pharma business kind of being a black box or not as transparent and as -- not as understanding. I mean I will say here the biggest focus of this business is taking opportunity of the geographic dynamics, right? You can either have a proprietary pharmaceutical business, a little bit more higher cost versus a pure generic business, which is obviously very, very cheap. Our branded generic business kind of sits between those 2 bookends. I come from an emerging market, so I can tell you that when we buy medications, it's not reimbursed. So you pay for it out of pocket. And you're willing to pay a little bit of a premium to ensure that what you're getting is high-quality product. And I think that that's what this business has been built on, is taking advantage of that dynamic of this population in these markets, growing with their disposable income and allocating some of that to their health care costs on brands that they trust. And that's what we've been building over these years. A key driver of this strategy here is you need to be -- you need to have the breadth and the depth in your therapy classes. So we have comprehensive portfolios in the geographies that we're competing. They're deep in each therapy class. You need to be omnichannel. You need to be present in the doctor's office. You need to be present in the pharmacy. You need to be able to kind of communicate directly with the consumer. And you need to be local. You need to have a local R&D engine, organization and manufacturing to be able to move fast with the opportunities that you see. And I think that's at the core of our strategy. One of the challenges in this business, as Miles has always said, is the FX piece of it. But the performance growth, we expect it to be in this kind of high single-digit growth. And a big driver of that is being in the right markets with the right infrastructure with the right products with the depth and the focus on execution. Frederick Wise : Great. And turning to 2 other areas. Heart Failure business has done a great job. How sustainable is the robust growth we've seen? And maybe talk a little bit about the implications of the less invasive surgical approach for HeartMate 3, what that might mean. And just last, maybe touch a little bit on Alere. It's been a little bit of a disappointment. What are the next steps? Help us understand what's going on and where we go from here with Alere. Robert Ford : Sure. On Heart Failure, I mean we had a very successful 2019. We achieved the destination therapy indication for HeartMate 3 at the end of '18, so that rolled into '19. So you saw the growth rate of about 20% here, Rick. That growth is predominantly driven by share gains and specifically here in the U.S. So we exited 2019, our estimation right now is, through our internal data, north of 80%. So as we go into 2020, we expect that to not be at that 20% rate now and to mirror more of what the market is growing, which is we expect to be in that mid-single-digit range. But I do believe that we've got a lot of opportunity. I talked about cadence of innovation in our products, and one product that's come pretty quiet, but we've done a really good job there is CardioMEMS. CardioMEMS is now close to $100 million. It's growing 30%. We continue to enroll in our GUIDE-HF trial that's going to be used to open an NCD. But the outcomes there are also extremely meaningful in terms of hospitalization reductions, et cetera. So I think that'll be kind of our next driver of growth in Heart Failure, and I'm very pleased with what the team has been able to build in that business. Going to your question on Alere, it's been a little bit of a -- we'll call it like a mixed bag here. We've had some businesses that we brought into Abbott, and I think we've done very well with them. We've accelerated their performance. If I look at the infectious disease portfolio in our developed markets, that's done very well. Yes, of course, there's some opportunity there with the flu season. But I think the team has done a really good job here expanding the portfolio and looking at those -- that installed base beyond just a flu test. And our cardiometabolics business has done very well too, growing in the high single digits, low double digits. So I think those 2 businesses, we've done a really good job with. And I think the team has done a good job on the cost side with the synergies, too. But you have pointed out that there are some parts in the business here where we're not pleased with, we're not satisfied. Our emerging markets infectious disease segment had a tough 2019. Part of that is kind of NGO purchasing cycles and dynamics in certain markets. But we've got to do better than that. And we've implemented a strategy here to really look at other emerging markets outside of the African continent here and build the value proposition of those tests in other emerging markets. In our toxicology business too, I don't think we've been able to kind of fully maximize the value there. And that one there has got a lot of attention, too. So we had a good Q4, a lot of focus here, a lot of good growth in the U.S. I think part of that was a little bit of the flu. But if we can get these 2 business here, our emerging markets and our toxicology business, to execute on the plans that we've put in place for them, I think you'll see that as kind of a mid-growth -- mid-single-digit kind of growth business for us. But I look at the trend and the dynamics of these products, the opportunities we have, the strategy to get into these businesses is still very much intact also. Miles talked about more and more testing move into alternative channels. We continue to see that. And we're targeting steady improvement here. But I think the long-term growth opportunity because of that trend is very positive. Frederick Wise : Congratulations. Operator : And our final question comes from Kristen Stewart from Barclays. Kristen Stewart : Congratulations, Miles, on your retirement, and Brian, I hope your next chapter is a positive one as well. Just I guess a couple of cleanup questions. In terms of the, I guess, PHP product, I was just wondering if you can maybe update us on just the time lines there for expected launch. And then also for Amulet as well, just kind of expectations for launch, just to get some time lines. And then also, I think you, Robert, had also mentioned just some products within the CRM business launching there. Could you just maybe update us on expectations for that franchise? I think you mentioned a new ICD platform and some other milestones you expect within the CRM portfolio. Robert Ford : So sure. On PHP and Amulet, I mean those are still, let's say, a couple of years away. So we're still in kind of clinical evaluation of that. We'll then kind of put the information together, submit to the FDA. So I'd say your kind of normal time lines over there. So you can look at it about a couple of years away. On the CRM side, like I said, I think the biggest opportunity we had when we changed the structure was to kind of get the innovation going. So we've got 2 product launches. We've got a new version of -- a new update to our implantable cardiac monitor planned for this year. We've got a new ICD planned again for both U.S. and Europe. And our growth expectations here are to be -- to do better than what we've been doing, steady sequential improvement. We've had some challenges. And I think that these products here will allow us to continue that sequential improvement here. So I'll... Kristen Stewart : And then I'm sorry, go ahead. Robert Ford : Go ahead. Kristen Stewart : I was just going to say, and do you see any opportunities -- I think Bob had mentioned this, but any opportunities just in terms of divestitures within Medical Devices or elsewhere within the portfolio or some smaller tuck-in? I know you said -- didn't sound like you were going to do any larger-scale M&A, but just more product lines to bring into the portfolio from a more of a tuck-in acquisition from technology, earlier stage. Robert Ford : Yes. Listen, if I take that and just talk about our model, we have a diversified model. I fundamentally believe in our diversified model. I think you've seen sequential improvement in all 4 areas over the last couple of years from a big-picture perspective. Now when you go into each one of them, can you find some areas that we can do better and we should do better? Yes, we can, and we've talked about some of those today. But that doesn't mean that we don't think there are great opportunities. That just means that we need to focus on doing better and executing better on that. So as I look at these 4 businesses, I like the businesses we have. Miles White : Okay. This is Miles again. I'll wrap up and close for us. So first of all, thank you all very much for your very kind comments. And on behalf of both Brian and I, well, I'll speak and tell you that it's been a great honor and a great pleasure for us to lead our company. It's been a tremendous experience. I feel like I've had 2 or 3 careers here in the last 21 years and probably have. Brian was estimating this morning, this was our 85th or 86th earnings call. And therefore, I can't tell you that I know yet whether I'm going to miss them, but I sure have a lot of them. And they're always challenging. They're always interesting opportunities to converse with you about the prospects of the company and so forth. I feel like I'll leave the company in perhaps its best position ever in terms of products and growth, future opportunities, et cetera. As I said at the beginning, I'm very pleased with the succession and the management team that's here. It's not just the CEO that's changing. The CFO is changing, and Bob Funck, who's a longtime Abbott employee and he's been our controller for a number of years and been in some of the most challenging jobs at Abbott and so forth, will be an absolutely superb successor to Brian. You know that a lot of our management team has changed over the last couple of years as we move to a next generation of leaders and managers in the company. And I think it's a great mix of people that are homegrown and also have come to us either through St. Jude or other outside places. And we're just really happy with the team we've got, the pipelines we've got, the positions we've got. We think our success is sustainable. And I think the track record that we've laid down over the last years has been recognized that way, and we're appreciative of the recognition that all of you have given it. As I commented tongue-in-cheek, as a significant shareholder of the company, I'll obviously be watching closely and especially in the immediate future as the Chairman. So with that, we'll close the call. Thank you all very much, and thanks for all your support. Scott Leinenweber : Very good. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.  Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2020. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations, results and financial results. This may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that financial information provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.  On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As everyone here knows, we haven't seen a quarter or any time quite like this before. This global environment is unprecedented in our lifetimes. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to take a moment to thank our employees, our customers and our suppliers, all of whom are making extraordinary efforts to keep systems working and to maintain supply of our critically important products for the people who need them.  This moment has strongly underscored 2 fundamental things to me. The first is the biggest and most important, and that's the essential nature of health and health care. Times like these make very clear what truly matters the most. The second, to bring it closer to home, has to do with the nature of Abbott. We've been in the business of improving people's health through medical innovation for more than 130 years, and it's in moments like these that the importance of our mission becomes even more critical : delivering for the people that depend on us.  I've been extremely impressed, though, not at all surprised, by the way my colleagues around the world have stepped up to this moment. As you know, we've quickly developed and launched 3 diagnostic tests for COVID-19: 2 for the laboratory setting and 1 for rapid point-of-care testing. At the same time, our teams in every business and around the world have been making extraordinary efforts to keep our operations running and our supply chains moving and to undertake the thousands of processes to make our vital products and get them to the people who need them. And we're also donating both funding and products to support frontline health care workers, families and communities to meet the challenges of this pandemic. I think this speaks to a well-known attribute of Abbott' s culture : We're execution-oriented, and we could be relied on to deliver when it matters the most because we know how important our work is, that lives depend on us, and we take that very seriously.  Our diversified business model is a true strength in times like these. It's a model that has served our shareholders and the company very well. Under normal circumstances, it provides more opportunities for growth. And in situations like this, it helps to dampen the impact by ensuring we're not overly reliant on a given business, product or geography. Overall, our sales grew nearly 4.5% on an organic basis in the first quarter.  Looking across our portfolio. Some parts of the business faced challenges, others have been relatively stable, and still others are performing at high levels to meet new demands. Beginning in February, as China implemented quarantine restrictions and nonemergency health care activities were postponed, we saw sharp declines in both cardiovascular device procedures and routine core laboratory diagnostic testing volumes in that country. Encouragingly, over the course of March and the first 2 weeks of April, we've seen a steady improvement in procedures and testing volumes in China from the lows we saw in February. As the virus spread geographically, the impact initially expanded to pockets of Asia and Europe beginning in late February, and more broadly across Europe and the U.S. during the last few weeks of March. As the health care industry shifted its focus to fighting the virus, we saw similar impacts to our business as those we had seen in China. Based on our most recent data points, while we haven't seen a rebound, we're starting to see some signs of stabilization. Importantly, while we're navigating the demands of the current environment, we've continued to advance our pipeline and strengthen our long-term growth platforms. Over the last few months, we've announced CE Mark approvals of new products in important cardiovascular device areas, including TriClip, the world's first minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve; Tendyne, a first-of-its-kind device for mitral heart valve replacement; and Gallant, our next-generation implantable cardiac defibrillator.  In EPD and Nutrition, underlying market growth and share dynamics remain in line with historical trends during the quarter, with the exception of increased demand during late March in advance of shelter-in-place restrictions in certain markets, most notably in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition. In Diabetes Care, Freestyle Libre continued to add new users at a strong and steady rate throughout the quarter as reflected by sales growth of more than 60%. We also continue to expand reimbursement coverage for Libre around the world, including recently becoming the only continuous glucose monitoring system to obtain reimbursement in Japan for people with Type 2 diabetes. And just last week, we announced the availability of Freestyle Libre for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The Libre system allows frontline health care workers and hospitals to remotely monitor glucose levels in patients with diabetes in order to minimize exposure to COVID-19 and preserve the use of personal protective equipment. In partnership with the American Diabetes Association, Abbott has donated 25,000 Freestyle Libre sensors to U.S. hospitals and medical centers in outbreak hotspots to help accelerate access to the technology.  Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our ongoing efforts in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Abbott has long been a global leader in infectious disease testing, so leading in this area is a role we can and should play. In late March, we launched 2 molecular diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19: one for our ID NOW rapid point-of-care platform; and one for our m2000 laboratory platform. Over the past few weeks, we've been actively working with government authorities and health systems to deploy these tests to places of greatest need. And just yesterday, we announced the launch of a lab-based serology test for the detection of the antibody IgG. While molecular testing detects whether someone currently has the virus, antibody tests determine if someone was previously infected. We already began shipping these antibody tests and intend to ship 4 million tests in April and ramping up capacity to 20 million tests per month in June and beyond.  But our efforts don't stop there. We're moving as fast as we can to develop additional tests, including a lab-based serology test to detect another important antibody, IgM, which we expect to launch in the near future. I'd like to thank our outstanding scientists as well as our manufacturing, supply chain and business teams. They've really stepped up to the challenge and are doing extraordinary work to increase availability of diagnostic testing as we fight this pandemic. So in summary, this unprecedented situation underscores our purpose and the strength of our diversified business model. The underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong, and our manufacturing and supply chain have been highly resilient. We've long planned for how to maintain business continuity in the face of a global crisis, and our employees and suppliers have risen to the challenge. And lastly, Abbott is contributing in a significant and meaningful way by providing new test solutions across our diagnostic platforms to help screen as many people as possible.  I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.  Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 4.3%. Our adjusted gross margin ratio was 58% of sales. R&D investment was 7.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.2% of sales. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.8% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen versus most currencies, which resulted in a larger unfavorable impact on sales compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in January. Based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have a negative impact of a little more than 3% on our full year sales. As we announced this morning in our earnings news release, given the uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we're suspending our previously issued annual guidance for sales and earnings per share. We're actively monitoring the situation closely, and we'll provide updates as appropriate.  Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to briefly discuss Abbott's overall financial condition. As this situation has reminded all of us, unforeseen events can rapidly change the environment we operate in. And our philosophy of maintaining strong financial flexibility is in place for just these types of moments. Overall, I'd say our financial health is strong. We ended the first quarter with approximately $3.7 billion of cash and short-term investments, and we have existing agreements in place that will provide additional access to $5 billion, if needed. As you know, over the last couple of years, we have put a heavy emphasis on strong cash flow generation and rapid debt paydown following a period of strategic shaping. This focused effort has positioned us with healthy leverage ratios and only a modest amount of debt coming due over the next few years. It has also resulted in strong investment-grade credit ratings. That said, we are prudently planning to ensure we can withstand a variety of potential scenarios that may emerge over the coming months.  As Robert mentioned earlier, our diversified business model is a true strength in times like these. I would also add that our disciplined and thoughtful approach to financial decisions and capital allocation priorities are also strengths and that Abbott is well positioned to navigate this challenge.  With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : And congrats on a good quarter, all things considered. Maybe I can start with the 2 positives in the portfolio here. I'll ask them separately. First, on diagnostics. Abbott's leading the way. You have 3 different tests : the ID NOW molecular tests, the m2000 SARS-COVID-19 test and then the antibody test, which was just announced. I know a lot of people are interested in the potential of all 3 of these tests here. So I was wondering if you could give us an overview of where you are with the testing, the potential revenue implications and volumes that you'll have. And any other tests that we should be on the lookout for on the horizon here? Robert Ford : Sure, Robbie. So yes, it was definitely an intense first quarter here for our Diagnostic business, even though it doesn't look like that in the sales number, right? We've got a core lab business that had some declines and it -- given the similar dynamics that we saw in our cardiovascular procedures as the hospitalization and procedures kind of came down. And then on the other side of the business, we have our rapid and molecular business where we did see positive growth in the quarter. And we actually didn't have a lot of COVID test sales for those businesses in the quarter. As you know, we got our approvals towards the end of the quarter, last week or so in March. So the potential here for the COVID tests are more significant for us in the second quarter here. But our biggest motivation on the testing aspect here, the key driver here is we want to help people. We want to help people get tested. We want to help society move forward. We want to help workers get back to work, people get back to schools, et cetera. So when you look at the diagnostic platform, the suite of platforms and products that we have built over the last 20 years here, they've really been aimed at being able to do just that. So in mid-February, when we saw that the virus was not going to mimic what we had seen in maybe previous viruses, like a SARS or a MERS, for example, and we saw that this was going to be something much more significant, much more widespread, we assembled 4 different and independent R&D teams to go about it in individual groups. I mean there was obviously some collaboration between them, but we wanted them stand-alone going after 4 different types of tests : a molecular lab test, a molecular point-of-care test, a lab-based serology test, and a lateral flow serology test. And we did that not because we thought that we needed 4 shots on goal here to try and get 1 or 2 of them to get it. We understood, given our experience here, that all 4 of these tests, all 4 of these different types of testing would be needed. All 4 of them had a different value proposition. So if you look at the lab-based systems, they're more high throughput, get a lot of tests done. There's a little bit of a turnaround time there, 1, 2, 3 days, et cetera, but we knew we needed that kind of testing volume. We also knew that we needed fast, immediate -- more faster, immediate results, maybe with the notion of having some portability where you'd be able to take the test straight to testing people, not having to restrict them to having to go to a lab or a hospital. And we also knew that there was going to be a need for mass volume screening. So when we look at the assembly of these 4 different tests that we've been working on, that's the -- that was the goal : to understand that there's a viral progression that occurs where in the beginning, in the early stages, you need molecular testing to be able to diagnose if somebody has the virus. And as the degrees (sic) [ disease ] progresses and people start to build antibodies for that, you're going to need a different type of test and in different formats of the test. So I would say every single one of our programs here either met or beat their target dates. And there's probably 2 reasons for that : One of them is, I'd say, just a very passionate and committed scientific and manufacturing team here that really went 24/7. I mean 1 of our teams split in 2 so they could go 24 hours a day, 10 days a week to be able to continue the work and doing the work. So that's one key driver.  And I'd say the other one here, and we've talked a bit about this, is a very collaborative, science-based approach of our work with the FDA. Throughout every step of our development process, we worked real time with the FDA, sharing with them our technology, sharing how are we going to do the clinical, sharing with them the results, taking input and feedback from them on a real-time basis. And I think the combination of those 2 factors really allowed us to do this, at least these 3 tests here in record time.  And I think what you're seeing, at least what we see a lot is the reward of that. It's very rewarding to see the vision that we had about these different types of tests and different types of platforms being deployed to the way that we had thought and envision them to be and then to get feedback back. I mean the amount of stories that I've received from CEOs, from mayors, from governors about our rapid test and how we envisioned that test rollout to start off with frontline workers, whether it's an ICU nurse, an ER doctor so that they could be tested if they had -- thought that they had symptoms, they're going to have to be self-quarantined for 4 or 5 days until their lab test would come back. And now with a rapid test in 15 minutes, they would know whether they would need to get appropriate care or whether they could return to the front line. And that's been exactly how we envisioned that product to work, at least in our initial rollout.  We also -- we're shipping a lot of m2000. I mean we have a lot of m2000s in the country, but we also began shipping them to some pretty difficult areas where the turnaround time that we had heard from mayors and governors was over 2 weeks. So now we can ship these boxes -- these lab boxes, and they can do close to 500 tests, 470 tests a day and get results in 24 hours. So the way we've developed these tests, the way we've put them out to the market, the way we've launched them, the way we've worked with the labs and the hospitals is exactly how we had envisioned this.  Obviously, there's a lot of stories that I've, at least, been seeing recently about the difficulty to find the tests, et cetera. And what I would say there is we've done everything that we said we were going to do. We've delivered everything that we said we were going to deliver. Obviously, that is not enough. We still need to do more, and there's a need here to manufacture more tests. Scaling is important and we have -- to get these tests out, we use high-precision, high-automated manufacturing process. And some of those, we've been able to kind of utilize existing assets that we have to manufacture it. In other cases, it's not enough, and we need to buy more. We need to set up more. And that obviously takes some time here, but you have a committed, dedicated team here that's really doing 24/7 type of work.  But on the ID NOW side, I mean, we made comment -- we made commitments to manufacture -- start manufacturing 50,000 tests per day starting April 1, and we're halfway through the month here already, and we've delivered exactly that. And every day, I get to see the manufacturing and the shipment output, and we haven't fallen behind that. And several days, we've beaten that number and able to get more tests out.  And we've worked collaboratively with federal government, with state government, with governors, with mayors. We provide everybody daily reports on what we've made and where we've shipped the product. It's a collaborative process to be able to allocate the tests to the areas that -- or need it the most. As I said on ID NOW, our first phase was to roll this out to ensure that the frontline health care workers were tested and were protected. And as we start to ramp up manufacturing for ID NOW, as we'll start to implement those actions in the month of May, into June, we'll start to roll this out into a second phase where we'll start to be able to test more of the general population. And we started to work on some pilots here with CVS and other retailers here to say, okay, how can we get this system out of the hospital into more decentralized testing so we can test the general population, whether it's in urgent care clinics, nursing homes, retail settings, et cetera. So that's on target, on plan also. On the m2000, we made a commitment when we got approval to ship out 1 million tests during the month of March, and we did exactly that. On the IgG, we just announced yesterday. We talked about shipping 4 million tests, put a stake in the ground there. I got an update from my team. Yesterday, they already have orders for about 1/4 of that as of yesterday. So we're moving fast here. And we know that we need to play our role here in manufacturing and getting as most tests out as possible to this platform that we've developed.  We've also been very clear about how we're selling the product. We sell the product from our warehouse right into our customers. We try to limit as much as we can the use of wholesalers and distributors. So that's worked very well. We're making weekly shipments so there's no hoarding, and we can get to as many people, as many customers as we can. And we're selling all of these tests at the same selling price that we were previously selling all of our other assays for these instruments. So the ID NOW COVID tests, we're selling at the same price that we sell our ID NOW flu test and the same for all of our other -- for our other assays and the other boxes. So we're working on our last platform here, which is our lateral flow serology test. This will allow us to scale up to numbers much more significant than some of these that I've talked about. This falls into our ability to kind of look at mass testing for the general population. They're on time right now, and we're almost there.  So I would say we've got a promising Q2 ahead of us as it relates to testing. I'm not going to try here and forecast exactly how this is going to look like in Q2 right now. But it's clear that the demand for testing is big. It's not going to go away. And I think that the team here has aligned a portfolio of testing solutions that have a wide variety of different uses and will play a key role in ramping up testing. Robert Marcus : Appreciate the response. Very helpful. And maybe just one other bright spot in the portfolio is Libre. This is a nonprocedure-based recurring revenue product. You had great international numbers. The U.S. number looked a little lighter this quarter, kind of flat quarter-over-quarter. Maybe just help us understand the trends in that business and how sustainable that is as people are away from their endocrinologists? Robert Ford : Sure. As I said, if you look at our script data, if you want to look at the U.S. data, we had a very good quarter as it relates to kind of script. And beginning of the year, I talked about how we were deploying a lot of demand-generation strategies here, whether it was sales force expansions, direct-to-consumer advertising, et cetera. And you can see that those that follow the weekly Rx data, you can see that inflection point starting in the first couple of weeks of January here versus where we exited.  So our scripts between Q1 of 2020 and Q4 of '19, the scripts actually grew 35% sequentially, obviously, over 100% if you look at it over year-over-year. So the sequential growth rate there that maybe you're referring to is really focused here on just kind of timing of sales and sales shipments in the quarter. I expect to see that shipment, selling mimic what we've been seeing in our Rx generation in the U.S. that you saw in the first quarter. And I think that speaks a lot to the value proposition of FreeStyle Libre. It is not only is it accessible, affordable, but it's easy to use, it's easy to start patients on the product. So I think that we've seen that play out here even within the situation that we saw with COVID in the U.S.  And you're right in international business has done very, very well, growing at very high rates, and that's off a very, very large base. So I'm very pleased with the international business. I think there's more work to be done there for sure. We're starting to roll out the Libre 2 product in Europe and in the international markets a little bit more intentionally with that expansion. I think we showed some of our accuracy data on Libre 2 in the European conference beginning of this month, and I think that's going to help fuel a lot of our growth also in the international markets, too. Operator : Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Robert, just a couple of quick questions for me. I guess the first thing, just sort of thinking about recovery. You gave some comments on China. But I wonder where is China right now as a kind of a percent of prior normal. In the U.S., have you seen week over week, the business get softer. Has the U.S. sort of reached some stabilization at a trough? And then just more broadly, how are you thinking about sort of recovery kind of across the quarters this year? Any qualitative commentary would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. So just on your question on China, I mean, it's an important market for us, but we're not overly reliant on China. But let me put the -- let me put your general demand question here, I think, a little bit into context, and I'll kind of walk through what we saw in the quarter geographically and across the businesses and then talk a little bit about how we see the rest of the year going. But if you look at our business and break them out into 2 groups, I would say, more hospital-based demand generation businesses and then the second part, more consumer-based demand businesses, they're about 50-50 -- roughly 50-50 in size. And we don't tend to look at our businesses that way, David. But I think as we looked at coronavirus and started to look at our models, we started to look at this approach here by looking at hospital and consumer base.  On the consumer-based side businesses, so you look at our EPD business, our Nutrition business, our Diabetes Care business, all of them performed in the quarter very, very well. They all performed in line with our trends, with our targets, with our aspirations, with the execution of our growth strategies. Obviously, the exception to that was some parts of our Nutrition business, where we did see pantry loading as a result of some of -- towards the end of March there, where we saw a lot of consumers try to stock up and get ready. But excluding that, all of them kind of performed well and on target. And obviously, there was increased demand for some of these products, and our supply chain was resilient, was able to fulfill them. So I see those businesses kind of going forward, performing at the same kind of trend, at the same rate that we have been seeing. Obviously, we might see a little bit of Nutrition in the second quarter, adjust a little bit. But overall, I see these businesses performing at the same kind of trend.  If we look at the hospital-based businesses, so think about that as kind of the more core lab testing, our Cardiovascular portfolio, even to some extent, our Neuromodulation business, even though it's not hospitals, it's more ASC, we definitely saw a decrease in those procedures, in those elective procedures and in that routine testing. And even within those, you see some differentiation. So we didn't see our Heart Failure business get impacted that much because those are life-saving devices versus an EP ablation procedure that was more elective and could be pushed out. So -- but in general, I would say, testing and procedures, we saw that drop. We collect daily device implant data and we collect daily hospital diagnostic testing data. And we collect it on a global basis. So I think we've got a pretty robust set of information that we can look at here as we start to observe kind of the trends that we saw in the quarter. And as we shared, we're starting to see an improving trend here in China. It's not to the level that we saw in our normal levels, pre-COVID, say, December, January kind of rates. But they're definitely not as low as where they were in February. And we're starting to kind of see them every week, get better and better and getting closer to those levels that we saw pre-COVID.  We've seen other markets around the world, whether that's Asia or some of the other European smaller markets there, where we've seen the beginning of the same kind of recovery trend that we saw in China. So starting to see some of the beginning of that recovery. And then in other markets, we're seeing kind of just this flattening and a stabilization here that's suggesting here that the speed of the virus is a little bit more controlled. So if I look at this data, and we've looked at it various different ways. We've run a lot of different forecast models and sensitivities here. There's a couple of things that I can see ahead of us here, right? The first one is Q2 will likely be our toughest quarter in the year, especially, I would say, for our core lab business and our cardio and neuro businesses. This will probably be our toughest quarter for those. And I think our consumer businesses will continue to perform at the trends and dynamics that I just explained. The second thing that we can see here based on our modeling, based on the data that we're seeing from -- that we're collecting on a daily basis is that we can see a recovery into Q3 and into Q4 especially for these more elective procedures. There are some that, yes, you can push out, but they are important. They are life-saving. They are solving some significant problems, whether it's a stent, a pacemaker, repairing a mitral valve. We will see those start to come back the same way that we started to see in some of the earlier markets that have kind of -- that they are further along in the recovery. I don't believe that they're going to come back at the same speed that they came down. But like I said, these are important procedures, and I do see them coming back. I've -- talking to a lot of health systems, a lot of CEOs from health systems, and they are -- they're already talking about how they are planning to start to work with some of those elective procedures. It will be a V-shape. I don't think it will be -- I think the right-hand side of that V-shape will be definitely a little less steeper than the left-hand side of that V-shape. But I think we're going to see that recovery in Q3 and Q4, at least that's what our data is suggesting. Clearly, it's quite possible that other industries might take longer to recover. But I think for health care, the data our modeling here suggests the kind of recovery that I've just described.  And the third thing we can see here clearly is that testing is going to play a major role here at getting back to work, getting back to school, getting people back to factories, back to distribution centers, et cetera. And we know that this is a 24/7 type of work that our teams need to do to be able to kind of scale up. And I think that the sales ramp and potential, et cetera, is really going to be guided by our manufacturing ramp up and our ability to kind of deliver on that manufacturing ramp up. And I think that we've been batting at a very high average here based on the commitments that we've made.  So when you look at all of that and you put all of this into context here, we have decided here to suspend our guidance. We're usually right here to the penny every quarter, and it's going to be -- right now, it's going to be very difficult to be able to get that right to the penny going forward. But I believe that we'll be in a position to give, I'd say, some more qualitative update sometime in the quarter. And depending on how that goes, we might be able to -- be able to give guidance in the second half here. So I've looked at the consensus that's been put out there. I mean we beat the revised consensus across our business. I'll leave the consensus where it is right now, given that it is a pretty fluid situation. But I think we could do better. But there's just too much it depends on right now for us. So we're going to keep on focusing on what we're doing, and sometime throughout the quarter here, if we feel that we're in a better position to be able to give some more qualitative assessment and guidance, we'll do that. David Lewis : Okay. That's actually very specific, probably more than I hoped for. And then in terms of the second question, just you've probably been less active on growth-oriented M&A these last couple of years than some of your peers, but you're going to emerge from this pandemic crisis with probably the strongest balance sheet in large-cap device. So how are we thinking about your interest in -- buybacks, I imagine, are less of your focus, but your interest in opportunistic M&A here coming out of this crisis? Robert Ford : Sure. Listen, I'd say right now, we've done a lot of work on our balance sheet over the last couple of years. We've talked a lot about the work we've done to improve our leverage ratios, the work that the organization has done to improve our cash conversion cycle. So yes, our financial strength here is very strong.  As Bob talked about, we've got a strong cash position here towards the end of the quarter, close to $4 billion. We have access to credit facilities. And we've got businesses that are strong cash flow generators, and that's going to be important as we go forward. We don't have a lot of debt maturing or coming due here in the next couple of years.  So I don't foresee our capital allocation strategy here to kind of really change at this point. Where -- we have a strong dividend, we pay a strong dividend, and we're going to continue to do that. That's an important part of our identity. We haven't done a lot of share repurchases historically. Most of the time when we do that, it's really just to try and offset some of the dilution. I think Bob and the finance team, I would say, is definitely looking at our CapEx and our CapEx spending. I don't -- we'll probably see some slowdown a little bit in that. And the team -- I know Bob is kind of working on that. We'll see how that's going to look like but that will just be a factor of getting the work done. And right now, there are some of our projects that require people to be building sites, et cetera. So we'll continue to focus on that. We'll continue to build our capacity expansions that we've talked about in the past. But we'll probably see some phasing a little bit over there.  And on your question on M&A, I mean, I'm not really looking at anything. As we talked about it, there's an opportunistic side to it and then there's a strategic side to it. And on the strategic side, I just don't see anything right now that fits what we want to do and where we want to go. And quite frankly, our execution here -- again, going back and maybe this sounds a little bit broken record here, but we've just got so many opportunities in our existing portfolio to keep on focusing on, and now you layer on top of that the opportunity we have on our testing platforms. So our big focus here is on internal execution. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Just a couple of quick questions. First, I wanted to kind of circle back to testing, specifically regarding the 2 COVID-19 tests that are being run, on ID NOW and m2000. I just wanted to be super clear on where you are today in terms of shipping capacity. Is it that 5 million per month that you talked about? And also, can you give us a sense as we look forward, given the critical importance of these tests, kind of where you'll be, say, maybe midyear in terms of testing and shipping capacity? Robert Ford : Sure. On the testing side, I mean, we talked about achieving a manufacturing ramp up here as we come out of the gates with the ID NOW platform at about 1.5 million tests, and we're on target to do that definitely throughout the middle of this month here. And we're making improvements in the manufacturing process and adding more shifts, et cetera, to be able to expand that to get to 2 million tests by June. And that's what we've talked about. And right now, we're on plan, on target to be able to kind of deliver on that expansion. Obviously, we need more than 2 million of the ID NOW tests, so we're looking at how we can ramp up. As I explained in the beginning, on the first question, these manufacturing processes are highly precise, highly automated, so that we can get the performance and reliability of the product. So these involve making -- setting up manufacturing lines and you don't do those in a week or 2 weeks. So there's a lot of work going on there, but we know we need to -- we know that there's a need for more ID NOW tests.  And on the m2000, we made the commitment here to ship 1 million tests in the month of March, which we did. We talked about shipping 4 million tests in the month of April, and we're on target to do that, to manufacture 4 million tests, and we're on target to do that. We've moved the team along to find ways that we can expand that, and the teams are working on that also. So I'd say right now, that 5 million tests mark on those 2 tests is where we're at. And as we make progress with our manufacturing ramp-ups, we will be clear about what the market can expect from. Robert Hopkins : Great. And then one follow-up on the same sort of topic. Congratulations on the new serology test that you just announced. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about sensitivity and specificity data relating to that test. And whether you think the high levels that have been quoted are kind of sustainable when you think about general population testing? Robert Ford : Yes, to answer your question on the accuracy. Right now, the label we have is, if you do the test 14 days post symptoms, the sensitivity of the test is 100% and the specificity of that test is 99.5%, and that's over 1,000 samples. So I think we've got a very, very accurate, reliable test here to be able to work on. Obviously, if you try and do this test 5 days after you've been exposed to the virus, your body hasn't produced enough antibodies to be able to be detected at a reliable, accurate level. So that's why when I talked about how we've set up our tests, the forms, the different form factors, that the use of the antibody test is more to look towards a couple of weeks after somebody has been exposed. Have they built enough antibodies that they've defeated the virus? So that's the data. Operator : And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Congratulations, guys. Two questions for me. So one, maybe on the near term. I guess when you think about the serology test and applicability to opening up the economy, there are some issues around prevalence rates and false positives and is this now paving the way for a second wave of infection. So maybe address that? I mean how these tests could be deployed perhaps in helping us open up the economy? And one other -- when you think about your employees getting back to work, what signs are you looking for to completely open up workforce and let employees back? Robert Ford : Sure. I mean as I said, we have to look at the suite of tests as not -- one test is not the panacea. You need to look at the comprehensive suite of testing and deploy them in the right ways over here. As I said, I think the serology test here is very reliable as we roll this out for the antibodies. We're working on an IgG -- on an IgM antibody test also.  Obviously, as companies are thinking about coming back to work, the way we're looking at this a little bit is, okay, we know that there's going to be a little bit different -- work a little bit differently the way we've historically been working. So maybe not a lot of big kind of meetings. 20 people, 30 people in the meeting rooms will probably be a little bit different than that. I think we'll see people wearing masks. I think we'll see more cleaning of door knobs and elevator buttons and all of that. And I think that's ongoing right now. I think there are a lot of companies that are doing this right now, and that seems to be working. So if you now add on to all of those protocols kind of the lateral flow test here that's got a very strong sensitivity, reliability, et cetera, and you add that on and you can test at companies using an occupational health team, et cetera, that will be an additional layer of security, of testing that will be on top of like thermometers and everything I just described also.  So I think it's going to be an important tool. And I think that we've talked about this a lot in terms of microclimates. We try to think about everybody coming back at once, and then you use all this data that you just referenced, prevalence and sensitivity and specificity, and you try and look at that at very large populations. We need to think about it more in terms of like a factory, an office building, a school. And then running these tests will allow you to -- on top of what you are doing, provide another tool to be able to assist companies and schools, et cetera, get people back to work. So I think that's how, at least, we're looking at it, and I think how I've heard other companies looking at how to reopen, how to get back. Vijay Kumar : Yes, that's helpful. And then maybe one -- so a bigger picture question or maybe this is more -- help us understand on how we should be thinking about the future. Because when I look at 2021, and obviously, I'm not asking for guidance. We know '20 was impacted. But what is the right base to be looking at procedure volumes, right? When you look at the underlying rate of incidence and prevalence pool for disease states, those really haven't changed. So if we don't have a, knock wood, a second wave of infection coming in or next year being impacted, should we be looking at procedure volumes in '19 as the base, the right base to build off? Or should we be -- there are some issues on hospital capacity constraints. And should we be looking at the depressed 2020 procedure numbers as the right base to looking at how those numbers could track -- trend next year? Robert Ford : Well, I can appreciate you trying to figure out 2021 already, Vijay, but listen, I think it's pretty tough right now for us to figure out how exactly Q2 is going to look like, let alone next year. But I think you raised some of the unknowns here that really make it difficult to predict how fast the economy recovers, how fast hospitals return to normalcy, how does our testing platform and how's the testing environment evolved.  Listen, we're all hoping for a fast recovery here, but if it takes longer, we'll have strong demand for testing. And that will continue to help buffer the impact. I do think there's a lot of pent-up demand here on cardiovascular devices and diagnostics. And I think hospitals are figuring out how they're going to get back to work. I think there's a lot of patients that are in need of care. And I think that -- I can't -- I don't know if we can predict exactly when it's going to come back. But I do think that when it does come back, I think you'll see these device procedures, which are extremely important -- as truly important in the care continuum, et cetera, that we will see them come back.  So that's probably my best answer for you is I believe that we'll see a recovery towards the second half of this year in these elective procedures. And you can kind of try and model out what kind of V-shape is it. Is it -- does it look more like an L? Does it look more like a V? Is it something in between, et cetera? But I think that's how, at least, we're looking at the rest of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Matthew Taylor : So first question, I just wanted to follow-up on the testing since it's so important and certainly commend the team for their efforts in getting those out so quickly. So it's 2 part. One is, you mentioned in the earlier remarks that there's been a lot of commentary about difficulty in the testing market. It's not only due to kits, but folks have mentioned swabs and reagents and other things like that. I was just wondering from your perspective -- I'm sure you're getting a lot of feedback on this. What do you think is the biggest challenge out there in terms of getting access to testing now? And how do you see that improving over the next weeks and months? And then on -- yes, go ahead, sorry. Robert Ford : No. So on the question there of testing and testing supplies and shortages there, I mean I think when you look at kind of what we've done, I mean, we've made sure, obviously, that when we ship out our test, they have everything they need to test, whether it's controls, calibrators, whether it's swabs and ID NOW, those come together here. So from Abbott's perspective, we're trying to make sure that they have everything that they need.  I do think that some of the challenges you have is potentially workflow. At least for us, we've got our m2000s. They're in regional hospitals, regional labs, which is a good thing because you can now have not only your big central labs doing a lot of centralization, but then you can use the regional network to be able to get to test. And I just think it's a workflow process here, how to get the samples. I think a lot of hospitals might not want to be doing a lot of mass testing into the hospital. So how do you collect the samples? And then how you bring them into the hospital? And then how do you get them out? So I think that's probably one of the bigger challenges. And I think that the team, whether it's on the federal government side and also with a lot of governors, are figuring this out. And they're sharing how they're doing it and sharing best practices. And at least on our side, we're starting to see a ramp-up here on the m2000. But there's obviously more that they can do. Matthew Taylor : Okay. And then one follow-up on that. I think on Bob's question, you commented on the accuracy of the serology test, which is high. Could you comment on the accuracy of the other tests, your confidence in them with smaller samples that you had to get out quickly and the relative importance of the 2 serology tests in determining who's had the virus and who has immunity? Robert Ford : Yes, sure. So on the molecular test, listen, molecular test is the gold standard for accuracy. RNA testing, testing viral load, et cetera, is the gold standard. And if you look at how we did the test, obviously, it's -- it was worked in conjunction with the FDA, using a testing model that was provided by the FDA. The tests are performed at 100% of the expected outcomes in the samples for both negative and positive results. So I think the ID NOW system is very reliable. The other, m2000, we use levels of detection. And I mean, you can go through levels of detection labels, and you could see the accuracy and reliability of the m2000 versus the other systems that have been approved also. So -- and as I said, the use of the antibody test is just going to be an important tool in conjunction with kind of molecular testing to be able to screen, test and manage the population. So we'll see how that's going to kind of roll out, and it will follow kind of the vision that we've kind of thought of, having both a lab-based system and a lateral flow-based system. Operator : And our final question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Robert, let me just ask one multipart device question. On 2 milestones we're waiting for, the MitraClip FMR, NCD, any update there? And of course, Libre 2, any update on the status there? Just lastly, any other time lines in devices that could be impacted by coronavirus would be helpful. Robert Ford : Sure, Larry. I was waiting for the Libre question. Let me answer your CMS question over here on secondary MR. As you as you'd expect under these circumstances here, CMS has delayed the issuance of the proposed NCD. We were previously expecting that to be mid-February. But given the current circumstances, the delay here isn't really having an impact on our business. I'm confident in the process. I'm confident that we've been working with them and the different societies over here. And this will move forward on the appropriate time.  On Libre 2, I guess I sound like a broken record here, Larry, but what I'll say is, I'm very confident in the product the same way that I've been saying. I'm confident. I mean I think some of you might have seen the accuracy data that we published at the European conference beginning of February. So I'm very encouraged about resolving these -- some of these kind of open items here in the near future with the FDA. We're just working through some finishing items. So -- but like I said, that's not holding back Libre or Libre's growth here. So more to come. Larry Biegelsen : Yes. Anything else though that we should be aware of that could be impacted on the device side from a time line standpoint? Robert Ford : Yes, there's been some discussion on clinical trial and clinical trial regulatory time lines here. Our near-term forecast here wasn't really overly reliant on kind of any patient enrollment end points. There's obviously been some delays in some of the enrollment, and as we've seen a kind of mandate here to pause some of these procedures here. So -- but I think once this is over, for the ongoing trials that have kind of longer time lines here, we'll look at opportunities that we'll have to accelerate enrollment and make up for some time here.  So let me just say here then, closing here. I think we had a pretty unusual quarter here for us. I think you saw the strength of our diversified business model come through here in true strength. Some parts of the business, we did have some challenges, as I've described. Other parts of the business have been pretty stable, and I think they'll continue to be pretty stable. And then there are others that are performing at very high levels. And I think we'll start to see on the testing side, how fast we can ramp up. The team here has done an amazing job around the world, not only to develop the test, but also the manufacturing, the supply chain teams across the world, across our network have done an incredible job.  I think our -- I said our financial strength here is pretty strong. I think we had that question here, and we'll continue to look at ways to improve on that. And as I said, we believe that there is a recovery, and we'll start to see that, I believe, in the Q3, Q4 time frame. I think health care is a little bit different than you might expect from maybe other industries. So once we get better -- a better sense of how that's going to look like towards the second half of the year, we'll definitely be updating and providing some more qualitative updates on that. So okay. Scott Leinenweber : Good. All right. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call.

Please note that financial information provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe during these challenging times.  Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.57, which is significantly above analysts' expectations. Based on our performance and momentum for the first 6 months, along with our expectations for the remainder of the year, we now forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $3.25 for the full year 2020. As I stated on our last earnings call, we anticipated this past quarter would be our most challenging of the year. At the start of the quarter, many areas of the world were under shelter-in-place restrictions, which led to the postponement of elective medical procedures and sharp declines in routine diagnostic testing.  Encouragingly, as we progressed through the quarter, we saw steady improvements in both testing and procedure volumes across our hospital-based businesses. At the same time, our more consumer-facing businesses, which include diabetes care, nutrition and established pharmaceuticals, continued to be resilient in this environment, collectively growing more than 9% in the first half of the year.  Throughout this time, our supply chain has remained resilient. Our financial health has remained strong, and we've continued to advance our pipeline and strengthen our long-term growth platforms with several recent regulatory approvals, including U.S. approval of Libre 2 as an ICGM, which sets a new standard for accuracy and performance and includes a new pediatric use indication; CE Mark approval of TriClip, the world's first minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve. This is a new market opportunity for our structural heart business that has the potential to be a significant area of growth over the next several years. And U.S. approval of Gallant, our next-generation heart rhythm devices that feature Bluetooth connectivity for continuous remote monitoring, which is a capability we've been integrating across our device portfolio over the past several years, including FreeStyle Libre, our continuous glucose monitor; Confirm, our implantable cardiac monitoring device; CardioMEMS, our leading heart failure monitoring system; and several other cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices across our portfolio. These connected care capabilities allow for better ongoing engagement between patients and their health care providers. And this benefit has never been more evident than in today's pandemic, where virtual care has become necessary to safeguard against exposure between physicians and patients, while continuing to manage and implement medical interventions when they're needed. I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition where sales increased 3% in the quarter. Strong U.S. and international growth of Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, led to global adult nutrition growth of around 7.5%. In pediatric nutrition, sales were led by global growth of PediaSure and Pedialyte, our market-leading oral rehydration brand, which was offset by challenging conditions in Greater China.  Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, sales were relatively flat, following strong growth in the first quarter when we saw increased demand in late March during the early phase of the pandemic. Over the last couple of months, we've seen the virus spread and impact market demand in certain emerging countries such as Russia, Brazil and Colombia. Through the first half of the year, EPD achieved mid-single-digit sales growth, and we anticipate a similar growth profile for the second half of the year. Turning now to Medical Devices. As I mentioned earlier, over the course of the second quarter, we saw steady improvements in procedure volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation portfolio. For example, at the end of June, our procedure volumes had rebounded to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels on average in the U.S., which represents a significant recovery compared to procedure activity at the beginning of the second quarter.  In Diabetes Care, sales grew nearly 30% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre growth of 40%. As I mentioned earlier, we obtained U.S. FDA approval for Libre 2 during the quarter. Now approved for both kids and adults, Libre 2 sets a new standard for accuracy, including when glucose levels are in the lowest range, which is critically important in order to avoid going into hypoglycemia. This leading accuracy profile results in superior alarm performance with fewer false alarms than other systems, which can be frustrating, but more importantly, significantly fewer missed alarms, which can be critical to avoiding dangerous glucose levels.  Libre 2 maintains all the market-leading features that Libre brand is known for. It's smaller, easier to use and longer-lasting than other glucose monitors, and its value proposition is unparalleled with a cost profile that is not a burden to health care systems. We'll launch FreeStyle Libre 2 in the next few weeks at the same price as the current available FreeStyle Libre 14-day system, continuing our commitment to make Libre affordable and accessible to as many people as possible.  I'll wrap up with our Diagnostic business, where sales grew 7% in the quarter. Similar to what we saw in medical device procedures, testing volumes in our underlying diagnostic business, which excludes COVID-19 tests, rebounded to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels by the end of the second quarter. Over the first half of the year, we've developed and launched several COVID-19 tests across our testing platform for both laboratory and rapid point-of-care settings. To date, we've sold about 40 million tests across all our platforms in countries around the globe. As we think about the continuum of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 going forward, we see the environment unfolding across a few phases. To date, we've largely experienced the pandemic phase where testing has been prioritized for essential professionals such as health care workers as well as symptomatic patients. Molecular testing, which detects if someone currently has the virus, has been in high demand during this period.  With the phased easing of shelter-in-place restrictions, we're entering a new phase where continued testing of symptomatic patients will start to overlap with broader surveillance testing of asymptomatic patients in order to better track, understand and contain the spread of the virus until we have broad vaccine availability. So in addition to molecular testing during this period, we would anticipate increased demand for other types of tests, including both antigen and antibody. As vaccines become available, we would anticipate continued surveillance testing to monitor and assess for both natural and vaccine-related immune response, which would be followed by a steady state of ongoing monitoring and tracking of vaccine protection.  So looking across the spectrum, it's clear that the need for testing is large and it isn't going away. I'm incredibly proud of the work of our scientists as well of our manufacturing, supply chain and business teams are doing to lead in this area as we fight this pandemic.  So in summary, while as we had expected this quarter was a challenging one from a growth perspective, we significantly exceeded expectations and more importantly, exited the quarter in a much stronger position than we entered it. We continued to advance our pipeline and achieved several important new product approvals during the quarter. And we've continued to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID-19, which is significant and expected to carry forward beyond this year.  I'll now turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.  Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter declined 5.4%. Our adjusted gross margin ratio was 56% of sales. R&D investment was 7.3% of sales. And adjusted SG&A expense was 30.7% of sales.  Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.8% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar weaken versus several major currencies, which resulted in a favorable impact on sales compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in April. Based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 2% on our full year sales.  Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.7% reflects the aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for the first half of 2020 with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15.6%. This is higher than the estimated range we provided in January due to a shift in our geographic and business income mix caused by COVID-19. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to briefly discuss a couple of items related to our capital allocation strategy. We ended the second quarter with approximately $5 billion of cash and short-term investments, which represents an increase of more than $1 billion compared to the end of the first quarter. The increase includes the impact of a bond offering we executed in June. We intend to use the proceeds from that offering to pay off debt that matures in September. Following that, we have no other debt payments due until mid-2022, which only further enhances our financial flexibility. In June, we also announced our 386th consecutive quarterly dividend payment, an impressive track record that dates back to 1924. This year also marks the 48th straight year that Abbott has increased its dividend payment, making Abbott a long-tenured member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have increased dividends annually for at least 25 consecutive years. Our consistency and commitment to paying a dividend is a hallmark of Abbott's identity, and our strong financial position allows us to continue that track record even during challenging economic times.  With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Congrats on a much better-than-expected quarter. Maybe we could start at the top. With 2Q coming in better but still a decent amount of uncertainty about the balance of the year and the recovery trajectory, what gives you the confidence in providing an EPS floor here of at least $3.25? Robert Ford : Sure, Robbie. Thanks. Well, I'd say it's not one single factor. It's really more of a collection of factors here. And I think it -- that speaks to really the power of our diversified model, the diverse strength of all of our different businesses.  So without a doubt, the Q2 EPS beat, which was pretty significant, factors into that. I think some of that really was driven by -- there's some impact there of the challenges of forecasting that I think we all had in April. But a good portion of that beat really comes from strong performance across the businesses. I mean if you look at our 4 businesses, 3 out of -- 3 of them, 3 out of 4 of them are actually posting mid-single-digit growth for the first 6 months of the year.  But as you look at the base business and think about base business as ultimately Abbott without COVID testing, I think we saw a nice recovery in the second quarter. Yes, there's probably still some uncertainty, but I think we saw a real nice recovery across our base business. If you look at the diagnostic and the device businesses that were probably more impacted, we -- as I described, we exited June with about 90% pre-COVID -- at pre-COVID levels. So -- and that was on average. I can tell you, there were some markets or some segments of our portfolio that we actually saw growth in the month of June. So -- and that happened I'd say, both in the U.S. and internationally. And that's important because obviously, there's maybe some concerns of resurgence here in the U.S., but a large portion of our sales of these businesses are concentrated internationally, too. And we're not seeing those same concerns in those markets. And nutrition was interesting too, I would say, as I look at that base kind of recovery or that base trend in Q2. I mean we thought that there could be some impact of pantry stocking in Q1 that drove nutrition performance. We actually did better than that, and I think part of that was some stocking. But what we've now seen through some of the share charts, Rob, is that we picked up share in both pediatric and adult nutrition.  So again, nice recovery, nice performance of the base business in Q2, and I see that momentum carrying forward to the second half. I mean we've got a lot of product launches, label and reimbursement expansions. I can go through some of them. We'll probably talk about them. But if you think about Libre 2, I've got high expectations about that launch in the U.S. TriClip and Tendyne, and these are product launches that we've started to roll out in Europe. We've gotten great feedback in the first months of launch, and we expect kind of good momentum for those products in that geography.  The NCD certainty, I think, now in terms of lease time lines for MitraClip is a real big plus for us. And the Alinity expansion that we continue to roll out, I'd say, a nice launch now of Alinity m in the U.S. and we're using COVID here to jump-start that launch. So I'd say the combination of nice recovery in Q2 and that momentum being powered through all these launches and all these products that we've historically been talking about is a big factor there. And then I'd say finally, COVID testing, in my prepared remarks, I talked a little bit about kind of the phases we're going to be going. But ultimately, the demand here and the need will be with us for the foreseeable future. So we've got a comprehensive portfolio, whether it's point of care, whether it's core lab, whether it's lateral flow, different types of tests, whether it's molecular PCR, antibody. So I think we really have a competitive portfolio. And as we look at going into the second half of the year, the competitive position combined with the demand that's going to be there, we're going to be adding in the second half. We'll be adding in terms of new tests, new formats. And also important, we'll be adding in terms of manufacturing capacity, whether it's our molecular platforms, whether it's our lateral flow platform. So we've been working at manufacturer expansion during this quarter. So the notion here that we're -- somehow our competitive position is threatened. I think that we -- we'll be adding competitive position. We'll be adding to it. And I see the demand being there.  So you factor all this in, Robbie, you look at our beat, our base business recovery in Q2 fueled by a lot of these kind of product launches carrying that momentum forward, look at the acceleration of our COVID testing across all of our platforms. You can then do some risk adjustments to some of the points that you've made there about maybe some resurgence in some states. But I felt that once you factored all that in, I felt confident about reinstating our guidance, and I thought that a number of $3.25 was a good starting point as we go into the second half. Robert Marcus : Great. That's a lot of wonderful color. Maybe if we could turn the second question to testing. And the 2 things I wanted to focus on was the durability of the testing, not just for the second half of this year, but as you think out beyond into 2021-plus, how durable is the serology testing? And then second, if you could just give us an update on where you stand in some of these other tests like the lateral flow test and then anything else time line or product-wise you could comment on. Robert Ford : Sure. We spent some time looking at kind of what that demand curve will look like. And obviously, our understanding now is much better informed than what it was in March. I'd kind of highlight a little bit the different phases that we'll see. And I think we're now moving into, I guess, what I would call this more recovery phase here as some of these shelter-in-place restrictions are being eased not just in the U.S. but globally also. And that's ultimately the part of the demand curve that I actually see where most of the testing is going to occur, where you're really here trying to do broad surveillance beyond just symptomatic or essential workers. And I can see that phase lasting quite a bit actually, at least until there is a proven kind of vaccine and vaccine availability.  And I think once that happens, we'll probably be getting into what I would call like a vaccine phase here, where I still think you're going to be needing to do surveillance testing of the virus. And that's probably where I'll also think that we'll see an increase in serology and antibody testing. And I see that, that's going to be an opportunity for us and for other companies here that have the antibody test. I see that as being kind of a real kind of demand driver on the serology side.  But I'd say as we look at this recovery phase that we're in probably over the next kind of 12 months here, we're going to see broad testing. And I think that, as I said, the platforms that we've built is important because you're going to need to have different solutions for different environments, different countries, different trajectories that countries are on. So I like our position.  The other thing I would say is there's -- it's good to see a lot of science and a lot of approvals of new tests and that's really important. But as we all know, one thing is to ultimately solve the scientific question of detecting the virus and finding the antibody, but you got to be able to have the scale and the manufacturing footprint to be able to kind of scale up and build. And I think that's what we focused a lot on over -- definitely over the last 90 days is looking at the portfolio of tests that we have and adding our manufacturing capacity to them. And it's not just one single site or one single technology. We're really looking at bolstering manufacturing capacity across all of our testing platforms. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on a solid execution here. So Robert, I had a 2-part question or 2 questions, if you will, one on the product side, one on the guidance.  Maybe I'll start on with the product side. I think you made some bullish comments on Libre. There has been some confusion on the street on the labeling side, on the ICGM label, but lack of an AID compatibility, if you will. Maybe parse this out and explain how you see this Libre franchise in the back half heading into next year. And in your perspective, do you think this labeling is an issue or is this more of a sell-side issue? Robert Ford : Sure. Well, I mean, I think you saw -- let me just start off then with kind of the trajectory here. I mean you looked at our first quarter trajectory in terms of sales growth, new user additions as measured by prescription data here in the U.S. and other data sources outside internationally. And we were on a real strong kind of trend as we were going into Q1. And then obviously, COVID had a little bit of an impact on our new user acquisition growth rate.  I mean we were definitely growing new users through Q2, but I think you could see in the data that we all kind of felt a little bit of an impact in May. And that's probably just the impact of shelter in place where patients weren't going to their physicians either to get their prescription or just weren't going to the physician's office. But you see now, I mean, if you look at the data, you see the pickup in the month of June. And you look at the exit of June, we're probably very close to the rate that we were before we came into COVID. And as I said, that was a rate that was growing really nicely in terms of new users.  So I'm encouraged by that recovery there. I would say the biggest encouragement I have here for the second part of the year is not only that recovery, but obviously the approval of Libre 2 here in the U.S. I think it's a product that's been long-awaited from physicians, payers, consumers, the diabetes community. We had launched it in Europe about a year or so ago.  So I think I look at this, and it's not really a catch-up for me. It's really setting a new standard, as I said in my comments, regarding accuracy and performance. It's got the best accuracy across the board, whether -- and again, this is a 14-day sensor versus our closest competitor being a 10-day sensor. But even with that longer range of use, better accuracy overall, better accuracy in the low range and high range, better accuracy with kids and adults, so I think that's very important. And one thing that we wanted to make sure we got right here, Vijay, was kind of regarding alarms. We had heard a lot about from consumers, when we were developing Libre, the frustration with alarms. And so we really put that feedback, really put the consumer really at the core, at the heart of what we're doing to try and build the alarm. So not only does the accuracy have better alarm performance, whether it's fewer missed or fewer false, but we added a feature there, which is optional alarms. And it's the only CGM that will have that where you can actually toggle between deciding when you want alarms and don't want alarms. And I think that's an important mindset of how we brought that consumer into it.  So I look at the combination of all this, Vijay, and I look at the base core of the Libre brand, which I described. And I think the overall value proposition is really second to none here. It's simple, easy to use. It's connected, consumer-friendly device. It's been like that from day 1 once we started the design process back in 2011. And I think one of the things that gets lost a little bit in the feature battle sometimes that happens is the outcomes. Outcomes are really important for the payers and for the physician community. And we showed some really powerful outcomes data at the ADA this year regarding A1c improvements for Type 2 patients that aren't on insulin, so Type 2 patients on oral meds, and I think that's very important.  And we priced this for mass adoption. Our -- we don't measure success here, at least not for this product, which we've always talked about of being a mass market opportunity. We don't measure success of how high of a reimbursement we got. We measure success about broad access.  So that as a framework, to answer your question on the AID, it was interesting to see the reaction regarding that aspect of our approval. I think it provided a lot of insight to some of the mindset here, some of the people that follow this space. But listen, pumps are going to be important. They're going to be an important segment of the market. The fully automated pumps are pretty amazing technologies. They're great technologies. But for context, these types of pumps, they really just compromise about 1% of the insulin users here in the U.S. So listen, we're very confident that we'll be connected to the full assortment of all the pumps and pens, and we've got everything we need here. But our vision and our strategy was much bigger and has always been much bigger than that. We see this as a mass market opportunity that includes both Type 1s, Type 2s, whether you're an insulin, non-insulin. And when you look at the world like that, you're talking tens and tens of millions of people. So we're excited about Libre 2 approval in the U.S. I think it sets a new standard, and I got high expectations for it here in the U.S. Vijay Kumar : No, that's extremely helpful, Robert. And one quick one on the guidance. I think you mentioned the exit rate on procedures was at 90% of pre-COVID levels. If procedures remain at 90% in the back half, one, are you still expecting to hit the $3.25 EPS number? That's -- I'm assuming -- and if that scenario plays out, it's going to be a mix impact on margins just given devices have higher margins. So where is the upside coming from? I think you mentioned something about antigen testing. I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about that opportunity? And are you baking in some upside from Libre as well? Robert Ford : Listen, you've just basically rattled off all the different factors that we've been looking at as we've looked at the $3.25 kind of floor scenario for us over here. So all those things were factored in.  We've actually had some countries where we're actually seeing procedure growth. I mean in China, for example, which was probably the tip of the spear, we actually saw procedure growth in the month of June and healthy growth. So we factored all of that in there. We factored in the launch of Libre 2 and the expectations that we think that we can drive in terms of new user acquisitions and recovery there and we factor all this in.  And if you ask, where is the upside, well, listen, there could be upside on all these factors here. I would say if you look at how we built the forecast, a big portion of that is our manufacturing, our manufacturing expansion. All of those are on time, they're on sequence. We've allowed for a little bit of wiggle room there, I would say. But if they continue to be on target and on time -- again, it's not one single expansion. But if they continue to be on time, we could potentially see a potential for upside to that number. But all these factors that you've laid out here, we've sort of contemplated that in that $3.25 scenario. Vijay Kumar : Congrats again. Operator : Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Robert, just another follow-up here on guidance. I guess I appreciate the $3.25 and obviously, you have some incremental profitability coming from the mix of diagnostic testing. So is a good way of thinking about this year something around mid-single-digit revenue growth in that range? And I wonder, if you think about '21, and I know it's obviously pretty early, our math has you sort of comfortably above pre-COVID levels. But any kind of qualitative commentary you can give us on '21 would be, I think, helpful. I have a quick follow-up. Robert Ford : Yes, sure. On your question regarding this year, yes, I mean, I think the math would, at this level, would suggest that, but -- that kind of mid-single-digit growth range. But as I said in the previous question, depending on how some of this manufacturing ramp-up occurs and the scaling of it occurs on the COVID side, the rolling out of our new tests, we could be ahead of that. And that would then imply a different kind of -- a different type of growth rate for the full year. But even at the $3.25, we're definitely accelerating our growth rate versus where we were at pre-COVID levels. So I think that the combination of these factors here, I could -- we can see us potentially entering next year with a high top line growth rate because of the combination of a strong base business, a strong base Abbott with an additional layer here of COVID testing. David Lewis : Okay. And then just related to that, Robert, just in terms of the diagnostic outlook here, we assume you're expanding capacity. We have both the lateral flow tests coming. How should we think about the capacity expansion on sort of m2000 versus ID NOW? I think your business was sort of $600 million here this quarter. How can that scale up here after the coming quarters? We certainly see an outlook here that's probably $2 billion to $2.5 billion for this year. But just give us a sense of where you think the bigger opportunity lies between m2000 and ID NOW and what steps you're taking there to expand capacity. Robert Ford : Yes, I think that's a good range if you want to dollarize it. And -- but I'd say, listen, we're looking at capacity expansions across all the platforms. So you mentioned m2000. We actually did a really good job at doing -- at expanding capacity through the quarter. We're also looking at expanding capacity for our Alinity m system, which I think is going to get a really nice kind of jump-start here in terms of its launch with the COVID test. It's a very attractive system in terms of kind of its features and -- its competitive features, whether it's a throughput or ease of use, not only versus m2000, but also versus other systems there.  We're also investing in ID NOW capacity expansion. We talked a little bit about that when we came out with approval. We knew that 50,000 tests a day wouldn't necessarily be enough. It was a good start, but it wouldn't be enough, and we've been working very diligently to be able to do that.  And on the lateral flow side, we began rolling the tests outside and in some international markets. We'll start to bring that here in the U.S. And we think there's a use case for both an antibody and an antigen test also. And we're investing capacity there also. So it's really not just, I'd say, one kind of area, but really looking across the entire suite of solutions here. Operator : Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Barclays. Kristen Stewart : Thanks, Robert and the entire organization, for all that you're doing on the COVID side. Just wanted to get a little bit more specific on just timing for the U.S. for an antigen test, and if there's anything that you can provide, just kind of more specifics on just the manufacturing capacity or just kind of how big you think kind of the COVID testing opportunity could be? And just kind of correct me if I'm wrong, it just sounds like -- and kind of my thought is that this COVID testing opportunity could definitely be something that not only kind of sticks around into 2021, but obviously, it could just be something more durable provided that not everybody may be willing to sign up for a COVID vaccine if one is developed and hopefully, obviously, one is developed.  And then if I could just have a follow-up too, if you could explain a little bit more of the dynamics of what's going on in China with Nutrition. Robert Ford : Sure. Let me just talk about kind of overall demand there. I mean I agree with you, and that's how we see it. We see the -- that COVID testing will stick around. Even when you have a vaccine, I think that I can see patients going to a physician's office with a fever, and they want to know is it influenza, is it the flu, is it COVID? So yes, so we think that the capacity that we're building is not only for, I'd say, a high demand during the next 12, 18, 24 months here, but we do the -- a steady state, as I said, that it will continue to be there.  Regarding your question on antigen, I won't give kind of specifics in terms of timing. What I can say, and I talked about it in Q1, is that we've really looked across our entire agnostic platform and not only the instrumented side, but the non-instrumented side as it relates to lateral flow testing. As you know, a lot of this lateral flow test came with the acquisition we did of Alere, and we're intending to maximize that scale that came with the acquisition. So we feel good about the test that we developed for the antibody. We're rolling it out.  The antigen side, again, it's going to be -- we've been working very hard on this. And I think it will just fall into the same kind of bucket and value proposition here where we'll have a lot of scale to be able to use this, produce a reliable test that's easy to use, that's affordable. I think that's the critical aspect here. If you want to get some more mass screening, more mass volume, the tests need to be more affordable. And one of the ways you do that is you remove the restriction on the instrument, so -- or requiring an instrument. So we're working on that test, and we've been building capacity for it. So -- and that's factored it a little bit into our guidance. I think you had a question on Nutrition, right? Yes. So specifically, in China, yes, it's been a tough market, I'd say, for a lot of companies, I'd say, especially some of the multinational foreign companies. We've also seen a little bit of a decline there in birth rates, so that's kind of slowed the market growth down a little bit. So -- but it's -- we're not overly dependent on China Nutrition within Nutrition. And obviously, within Abbott, our Nutrition business has been pretty resilient in the quarter. We actually saw some pretty strong growth in pediatrics in some of other Asian markets, too.  So listen, it's an important market for us. It's about 7% of our Nutrition sales. The market conditions are shifting there a little bit. And we'll continue to be competitive as we can there with our new product launches and innovations that we're launching. And we'll see that dynamic, I think, still kind of play out a little bit here in the next quarter or so until we can get some of our new launches kind of rolled out. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : Just maybe changing gears a little bit, if you could talk a little about some of the pipeline products that -- recently approved and in the pipeline and time line, like the CE Mark for TriClip and Tendyne for tricuspid and mitral. Maybe how to think about those products adding to the growth in the back half and into early '21. And then for the pivotal for Amulet, the NCD for CardioMEMS, what's different this time on that product, which was kind of ahead of its time last time? Maybe just help us understand how to think about or model those. And then I have one follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, we've been investing strong and heavily in the structural heart business. And I think your -- you've just kind of mentioned a lot of a lot of the output of those investments as we're building the portfolio and the pipeline of our structural heart business. I would say, MitraClip is still in the early innings. And I think that we've been working hard to kind of expand that market.  And think about the NCD coverage here in the U.S., I mean in the U.S., we did close to 12,000 procedures last year, and the NCD is going to give us opportunity to target 250,000 procedures. So I think -- I still think there's a lot of opportunity in the mitral space, in the repair side.  Specifically, on TriClip, listen, I think this is a great opportunity for us. We got a lot of feedback from the physician community about wanting to see a repair system for the tricuspid area. They were trying to get there using the MitraClip, but it's a difficult area to get to. So we took a lot of the feedback here and redesigned the delivery catheter for the clip to be able to get to the tricuspid area. And we've got CE Mark. We've launched it. We've gotten great feedback in terms of its -- the biggest challenge was getting there in an easier way. And I think that the TriClip with the redesign has kind of helped that.  I think it's about a -- think about the market size here. It's probably about 1/3 of the size that I think of the mitral repair market. That's how we've looked at it. And it's going to take a little bit of time to develop. If you think about how we developed the mitral repair market, you need to build a steady base of experienced users here to build good data on its efficacy and then you start to kind of roll it out.  So I think this is really in the early stages here. We've got some growth baked in, in the second half of this year. But this is probably a multiyear kind of growth here for us, but it's an exciting one given our position that we have in mitral. On Tendyne, this was an important play that we made. We knew that we wanted to be a company that had a broad suite of solutions in the mitral area. And having a repair would be one part of it, but then having a replacement device would be another part of the value proposition. And right now, we're the only company now that -- be able to offer that solution to our customers to be able to repair, and if repair is not needed, to be able to have a transcatheter solution for replacement.  So we got CE Mark in January. We started to roll it out, again, gotten very good feedback. And we'll -- we don't have, I'd say, a lot of sales baked into the second half year. We really want to kind of develop the use, develop the data. Both these products, the TriClip and the Tendyne, they're currently under trial here in the U.S.. Our projected launch here for a Tendyne product in the U.S. is late in 2022, and the TriClip here in the U.S. sometime in 2023. So we've got a nice kind of cadence here of product launches.  You mentioned Amulet. This is another exciting area for us. It sometimes gets lost in the shuffle and the richness of the pipeline of this division here, but it's one that is not lost with me or with the management team here. We've completed our enrollment, and now we've got an 18-month kind of end point. So we'll expect to file by the end of this year and have a launch sometime in 2021. And that will be a nice kind of growth opportunity as we go into next year also. Matthew Miksic : Terrific. And then just one follow-up, if I could, on EPD and emerging markets. I know it's a little bit more of a narrow geography to think about, but maybe similar to the way that everyone was trying to sort of gauge the recovery or the way that COVID sort of paces through the developed markets in Q2. Any sense of how to think about the cadence of -- are we at a trough point? Or should we trough the impact in August here or in this quarter in EPD and in emerging markets? Robert Ford : Yes. So we saw a little bit of softness in Q2, as we discussed. I think it's partially due to some of the purchases that I think were pulled forward a little bit in late March as it relates to kind of the quarantine mandates in certain countries. If you look at our Q1 performance, it was over 9%. So I think what we've seen here is once we saw the data, the data comes here a little bit of a lag to us. We were able to kind of see what happened. And you kind of see this contraction, sharp contraction in the market kind of in the March, probably more April, May kind of time frame here. And early indication starts to show a little bit of a bounce back in June, but it's not going to be -- you can't make a definitive conclusion across all markets because they're all at different phases.  So I think right now, probably the ones that are being hit the most are probably kind of Russia and Brazil. But we actually saw, similar to devices, we saw a nice recovery in China in our EPD business also and saw the kind of growth rate that we had been seeing. So double-digit growth rate in the quarter in China.  So I guess what I'd say is the impact of quarantine and the virus, it kind of moved from China, started moving east. And I would say kind of the emerging markets were probably the most laggard part of that movement. And I'd expect to see them come back in a similar fashion in terms of some of the developed markets that we saw in devices and diagnostics also. So... Operator : Our next question comes Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : A very solid quarter. A couple of very quick questions. Can you give us an update on Libre 3 and when you're thinking of the timing of that? Can you also comment on how you're thinking about the run rate for MitraClip, particularly with COAPT data behind it and now CMS coverage in front of it? And then lastly, expense management. I got the impression from some of your comments that you're leaning in on some investments. And if there's anything that you can give us regarding big picture and/or the cadence on that, that would be great. Robert Ford : Sure. I guess I would take your first question on Libre 3. We've gone through a long journey here, so I think I want to prioritize a little bit on Libre 2. But what I will say is the following. We've always said that Libre was a platform product. We've always said that we would have different iterations.  Libre 3 has been in development for some time. But I'm not going to provide any details on product capabilities or time lines as it relates to this point. My focus here is going to be really to maximize kind of Libre 2 launch. But we do have a team that's been working on it, and we're excited about it. And when we have more details to kind of share, we will share.  Regarding MitraClip, yes, it was an interesting quarter for sure. We saw a pretty sharp decline in clip procedures in the month of April and probably about half of May. Then we started to see a nice kind of ramp up. And so we exited Q2 in June with about 85% of where we were in pre-COVID levels, and that continues to kind of trend up.  So I think you've -- you talked about kind of a key growth driver for us. The NCD is an important part. I'm glad to see the process moving forward. I think it represents a significant growth opportunity for us. I think it more than doubles the U.S. market opportunity, as I said. And it's nice to see that we could have an expected time line here that could potentially result in an NCD approval at the end of the quarter. So I'm -- as I said in the previous question about the structural portfolio, we've got a lot there, but MitraClip is still in its early innings, and this is a great opportunity here for us. Regarding your question on spending, we've been careful obviously about spending. And obviously I think you see a natural cadence of less spending, whether it's travel and stuff like that, that we saw. But -- and so that just naturally happens. But we've paid a lot of attention to R&D and R&D spend and ensuring that not only do we not slow down our programs, but are there other opportunities that we have to be able to accelerate them, and we have been looking at that.  I think some of the challenges and some of the R&D spend is that some of that spend is these clinical trials. So obviously, that -- with some of the follow-ups, enrollments slowing down, you'll see that. But we've tried to take some of that favorability and look at product development side to be able to continue to build our pipeline, build our sustainable kind of growth story. So yes, that's got a lot of attention and focus from me and the management team and ensuring we don't lose the opportunity on the R&D side.  And then the other investment we've been making, as has probably been pretty clear, is we're putting in a lot of manufacturing capacity. That includes not only capital, but also project expense. And we're managing those opportunities very, very closely also. Operator : And our last question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Matthew Taylor : So I really had just 2 follow-ups on 2 of the bigger themes here. So one is on the floor of $3.25. It seems like you've been very thoughtful about how you've layered together all these different moving parts for the second half of the year to get to that floor assumption. I guess my question is kind of taking the inverse of that. So what would have to happen, what would have to go wrong for you to not achieve that floor? Would things have to get significantly worse? Maybe you could just speak to that. Robert Ford : Yes. I mean, listen, we've looked at every -- a lot of different scenarios here, Matt. We've got a lot of great data that we -- that's pretty proprietary to us. I mean I think I mentioned this in the last quarter where a lot of the laboratory testing that happens on our systems in the hospitals, we get to see that data every day, every night and we've been aggregating it. And we look at not only the volume of tests that are being done, but we also look at the type of different tests that are being done.  And so I think we've got a pretty good insight in terms of what's actually happening in the hospitals beyond just the headlines. Those are important, but we haven't relied on headlines or models to do this. We've really looked at it at a very granular level using the assets that we have to be able to kind of put our own forecast together. On the device side, the way our compensation is struck with our sales reps, they've got to log their procedures. So we have a fairly accurate representation of the kind of procedures that are occurring at the hospital. So we've factored all this in and factored in the different components of our manufacturing of COVID. And that's why I feel confident, again, in reinstating and reinstating at $3.25.  So what you're trying to figure out is what needs to go wrong here. I think even if there is a shutdown, another shutdown, which I personally don't believe will be there, I think we know a lot more now. The hospitals know a lot more versus what happened in the first shutdown. And I think we're going to have a lot of manufacturing capacity to be able to deal with that from a testing perspective.  And then you also have to have that same granularity not just in the U.S., so looking at different states. But you also have to look at it around the globe. And around the globe, there are different countries on different situations, too. So... Matthew Taylor : And then maybe one other follow-up. So you talked about Libre 2 and all the exciting aspects of it. I was wondering if you could at least qualitatively talk about the kind of acceleration or pickup or additional opportunity that you see for that in the second half of the year. And are you going to immediately be able to blast that out? Or is there some kind of conversion time for you to get up to full speed on the manufacturing of the new product? Robert Ford : Well, on the manufacturing side, I'll just answer that quickly. I mean you know that we've been investing in manufacturing, manufacturing capacity and scale. We knew that was going to be an important aspect for our strategy when we look at it as a mass market. So from a manufacturing standpoint, we don't have that issue. We've got teams that are already kind of building product, putting them in boxes, ready to start shipping them to wholesalers and retailers here in the U.S. Regarding kind of qualitative assessment of the opportunity, I mean, I guess, I'll just go back to there's -- you can look at the penetration of CGM in the U.S. here. And again, it depends on the kind of lens you want to look at. If you want to look at it through the lens of AID systems and connected pumps, you're going to have a market. If you're going to look at it through the lens of at least how we're looking at it, which is mass market, Type 1s, Type 2s, whether you're on insulin or whether you're not on insulin, you're looking at a large -- you're looking at 15 million, 20 million people here in the U.S. And you can look at the amount of users we have. You can look at the amount of users that the other systems in the market have. And you can add that up and you can say, \"Okay, there's a lot of opportunity here for that kind of growth.\" The question is what is the product that best suits that kind of penetration, that more mass market penetration. And I'll make the case not because I've been with this product for a while. But I'll make the case based on what I've heard from payers, what I've heard from the system that ultimately have to pay for it, that Libre has got everything -- Libre 2 has got everything it needs to be able to kind of accelerate that penetration. And I'll point to the study that we published at the ADA with a Type 2 non-insulin user. I mean that is a significant A1c reduction for people on oral medication that you probably don't see in terms of other studies with other drugs. So I think Libre has shown that it is just as effective at providing outcomes for type 2 patients that are on oral medication versus those that are on pumps. So I'm very bullish about the opportunity that we have for Libre 2 in the U.S. as I am for Libre as a whole in -- around the globe. So let me just wrap up here then by just -- we knew that Q2 here was going to be our toughest quarter of the year, and we beat those expectations. I think part of it was probably some difficulty in forecasting. But a good portion of that was our performance, our strong performance across our businesses. We can see a base business that's -- if you exclude the COVID test, we've got product launches, we've got channel expansions, new reimbursement claims. So we continue to forecast a steady acceleration, a quarter of work-over improvement of our base business. You then have the COVID testing, which, as I said, I think will be here with us for the foreseeable future. Not only do we have a very complete portfolio, we're going to be adding to it, but we're also investing in manufacturing capacity and scale. And I think that's an important role here to play, an important role to play in meeting that demand.  So a floor of $3.25 I thought was a good place to start as we reinstate our guidance. But if you look at our product launches, both U.S. and internationally, our manufacturing expansions and depending how that goes, we could see a situation where we're heading in next year with a very high top line growth rate and really compromised here of a strong base Abbott business with now an added layer of growth from COVID testing. Scott Leinenweber : Okay. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2020. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and in Item 1A Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that financial information provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported organic sales growth of 10.5% and ongoing earnings per share of $0.98, which reflects high-teens growth versus the prior year. Based on our performance and momentum through the first 9 months, along with our expectations for the remainder of the year, we increased our earnings per share guidance to at least $3.55 for the full year. This speaks to the strength and resilience of our diversified business model as well as our ability to innovate and deliver in this challenging environment. While the pandemic has created many new business dynamics, we've continued to invest in our growth platforms. And our pipeline continues to be highly productive, resulting in several new product launches and approvals this past quarter, including U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization for our BinaxNOW rapid antigen test, which can detect COVID-19 infection in just 15 minutes with no instrument required; U.S. launch of FreeStyle Libre 2, which sets a new standard of accuracy and performance in the market; CE Mark of Libre 3, which automatically delivers real-time glucose readings every minute in the world's smallest and thinnest wearable sensor; CE Mark of Libre Sense Glucose Sport Biosensor, our initial step to expand use of the Libre platform beyond diabetes; and finally, CE Mark of MitraClip G4, the latest generation of our market-leading, minimally invasive mitral heart valve repair device. I'll now summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 4% in the quarter. Growth was led by Ensure, our market-leading Adult Nutrition brand, which contains several ingredients to support a healthy immune system. We're seeing strong demand in both U.S. and internationally, which led to global Adult Nutrition growth of 12.5% in the third quarter. In Pediatric Nutrition, sales growth in the U.S. was led by our market-leading Pedialyte rehydration brand, which was driven by market conditions and portfolio expansion. Internationally, growth in Southeast Asia was offset by continued challenging conditions in Greater China. Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales declined 3%. During the quarter, we saw challenging market conditions in several countries due to the COVID pandemic. Whereas the virus had its biggest impact in developed countries during the second quarter, we saw it hit emerging markets more significantly this past quarter, which lowered market demand. Encouragingly, as we exited the quarter, we started to see signs of market recovery in several of those countries, and we expect we'll see a continued recovery curve going forward. I'll turn now to Medical Devices, which grew 2.5% in the quarter. We continue to see steady improvements in demand and procedure trends across our portfolio, which resulted in 5 of our 7 businesses within Medical Devices achieving positive sales growth in the quarter, including Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care. Growth in the quarter was led by Diabetes Care, where sales grew 25%, including more than 35% growth of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. As I mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, we launched Libre 2 in the U.S., which sets a new standard in the market with best-in-class accuracy and alarm performance as well as 40% longer wear time compared to competitors. Although still early in the launch, customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We also obtained CE Mark to Libre 3, which integrates Libre's leading accuracy and performance into the world's smallest, thinnest disposable sensor, the size of just 2 stacked pennies at the same affordable price as currently available versions of Libre. And in Europe, we also launched Libre Sense Glucose Sport, which is our initial step in a very intentional approach to pursue mass-market biosensor opportunities beyond diabetes. Libre Sense allows athletes to monitor their glucose levels in order to learn how and when to best fuel with food and supplements to avoid fatigue and achieve peak performance. I'll wrap up with our Diagnostics business, where sales grew nearly 40% in the quarter. As I mentioned during our last earnings call, our teams have worked tirelessly since the beginning of the pandemic to bring to market multiple COVID-19 tests across our diagnostic testing platforms. During the third quarter, we launched a new rapid antigen test called BinaxNOW, which is a disposable test about the size of the credit card that can determine if someone is infected with the virus within 15 minutes without the use of an instrument.  Given the mass-market need for testing, we knew that developing and launching this test was only half the equation, which is why we simultaneously built 2 new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. to help meet the public health need of testing as many people as possible, as often as possible, to help reduce the risk in the environment and slow the spread of the virus. To date, we've sold more than 100 million COVID tests across our diagnostic platforms. And we continue to pursue opportunities to further increase our manufacturing capacity to help meet the significant demand for testing around the world. So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved double-digit organic sales growth and high teens EPS growth in the quarter. Our pipeline continues to be highly productive, resulting in several important new product launches and approvals during the quarter. We continue to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID-19, which has added a significant new layer of growth for our business and accelerated our distributed testing strategy. And we've increased our full year EPS guidance, which highlights the strength and resilience of our diversified business model. I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 10.6%, which was led by strong performance in Nutrition and Diabetes Care, sequential growth improvements in Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation devices, along with global COVID-testing-related sales of approximately $880 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on sales, which was somewhat favorable compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in July. Reported sales increased 9.6% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.4% of sales, R&D investment was 6.3% of sales and SG&A expense was 26.7% of sales. Now turning to our outlook for the full year. As Robert mentioned, we're increasing our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share to at least $3.55, which includes our expectation for strong double-digit sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 1.5% on our reported sales. We forecast full year net interest expense of around $500 million and continue to forecast a full year adjusted tax rate of 15.6%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Just a couple of related questions. Robert, I wanted to maybe think about next year a little bit given we're closing out this year. And obviously, investors are in the process of trying to figure out '21 estimates for a whole bunch of companies and whether they're achievable. In your case, at least for us, they clearly look beatable. But I wonder if on a high level you could share with us how you're thinking about growth, earnings and, frankly, the opportunities for reinvestment for Abbott in '21? And then I have a quick follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, I think it's -- we had a very strong quarter, which gave us confidence here to be able to raise the bottom end of our forecast this year. And obviously, that momentum -- that strong momentum is going to -- will carry into 2021. It's a little premature here, David, to kind of start talking specific about guidance. But I'd give some general comments here. I mean I expect a lot of companies will forecast double-digit growth rates going into next year. So as you think about -- a lot of you looking at 2021. But I think most of that is because they're -- a lot of them are going to be coming out of a hole, right? They're going to have a certain amount of easy comps, especially if you look at like Q2 and Q3 this year. So they're essentially kind of making up for a lost year and getting back to 2019. We're in a very, very different position than that. We're forecasting double-digit earnings growth this year. So when we look at the trajectory that we have going into 2021, which is a trajectory of strong double-digit top and bottom line growth rates, I think that's pretty differentiated and pretty unique here because we're not coming out of that hole. Clearly, COVID testing is going to be a driver. It's going to be a big boost for us, and I don't expect that testing to go away. But another key component of it is our core businesses continue to improve. They're trending in the right direction. And I think a key aspect of that trending in the right direction is our pipeline. Our pipeline has been highly productive. We've got over 100 new products in pipeline across all of our 4 businesses that we have planned to launch over the next couple of years. So are there opportunities to accelerate what is already going to be double-digit top and bottom line growth rates? Yes, there'll be opportunities to be able to invest in this pipeline and accelerate the growth there. So I think we're very well positioned to go from what is a very strong year for us in 2020 to an even stronger year in 2021. David Lewis : Okay. And just maybe following up on COVID testing here. I mean, obviously, your testing revenues are going to be up very sharply in the fourth quarter on the strength of Binax. It sounds like, just thinking about the earnings, could we be thinking about a COVID testing number this year that's certainly in excess of kind of $2.7 billion? Just want to get your commentary on that. And as you think about next year and you think about new test capacity, Panbio, how should be thinking or how are you thinking about sort of duration of testing relative to kind of a $2.7 billion base year in 2020? Robert Ford : Sure. So we had just under $900 million of COVID testing this quarter. I think it was just under $100 million favorable to some of the forecast there. A lot of that was driven by our manufacturing ramp-up, our scale-up and the new products we launched. So we actually exited the quarter at a higher run rate than that. That run rate into Q4 would be around $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion of sales at that run rate. But if I talk about COVID sustainability, I know this is a key topic here. I'd say when we talked about testing back in July earnings, I talked about the testing demand over 4 different phases : the pandemic phase, a recovery phase, a vaccine phase and a post-vaccine phase. And I shared that my view here was that a lot of the volume was still going to be in this kind of pandemic recovery phase. That even with the vaccine, you'd still get kind of more of a steady state. But a lot of the volume was going to be coming during this pandemic and recovery phase. I still think we're in this phase right now, David, depending on what country you are or state, you're in a pandemic, you're in a recovery. And I expect that to last definitely all next year. With the vaccine, you might see a trend of a little bit of a decrease on the PCR testing, I think, just -- and then maybe an increase in antibody testing. But I think the rapid testing is not going to go away like that. I think it's going to be around for a while just because it's easier to do, it's an easier sample, it's a faster result. So I think there's a lot of complexity here in trying to forecast whether COVID will ramp down and -- COVID testing will ramp down and when will it reach a steady state. So I've read some reports, it's 2 years, it's 3 years. I actually think if you're thinking long term -- strategically long term, that might not be the right question because I think it misses the point on what Abbott is actually doing right now. Yes, we've developed a lot of COVID tests. We've invested in manufacturing and selling them at affordable prices. That obviously helps the economy. It helps contain the virus. But what we're actually doing here, if you take a step back on a bigger picture, is we're actually executing on the vision that we had when we bought Alere, where we wanted to build a premier point-of-care business so that we could decentralize test, so that we could democratize test and so that we could digitize test. And if you look at what we've done with BinaxNOW, ID NOW, Panbio, I think those are perfect embodiments of that execution. So the COVID assay itself, when will it ramp down, 2 years, 3 years, okay, it will eventually ramp down to more of like a flu state kind of business. But the installed base that we built during this period, the consumer behavior that's been created, the new channels that we've opened up with rapid testing, whether it's airports, retail stores, more physicians' offices, the app ecosystem that we're building, all that is going to remain. And it will remain for all the other assays that we currently have and that we'll be rolling out. So I think that as we look at 2021 into 2022, it's going to be COVID testing, but it's more importantly to look, at least the way we're looking at it, is the execution of that Alere strategy, which is to build a whole new testing platform outside of the walls of a lab and a hospital. And the COVID has actually given us an opportunity to accelerate that strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on a solid [ performance ] here. So Robert, maybe back on the fiscal '21 question. I guess maybe if I approach it slightly differently. Street numbers are EPS at $4.25. Based on the updated guidance for '20 of $3.55, that's still close to a 20% earnings growth. And I think implicit in those assumptions would be med tech procedures normalize. And obviously, that has a drop-down on margins. So I'm just curious, how should we be thinking about device procedures into Q4. Because like you said, the comp is an easy for you guys, right? I mean you guys -- you will be doing high singles organic in fiscal '20 versus declines or flattish for other -- some of your peers. So maybe if you could just unpack that a little bit and put that in context will be helpful. Robert Ford : Sure. So yes. I mean, as I said, looking into 2021, the trajectory -- the growth trajectory is those high strong double-digit top and bottom line, Vijay. And again, I think that's going to be predicated on 2 factors, just like we spoke about it in July in the earnings call, it's going to be the continued recovery of our base business and then, obviously, our ability to ramp up COVID and COVID testing. If you look at the businesses that were most hit by COVID, devices and core lab, so laboratory testing outside -- out of COVID, those have shown a really, really nice recovery starting in June, into July and then into the third quarter. September was actually our highest month of absolute sales in the quarter for both Medical Devices, especially in the cardiovascular area, across all areas. We saw a little bit of a July kind of pent-up growth as the lockdown started to get reduced a little bit. We saw that growth rate in July. A lot of that was some pent-up demand. So if you look at the third quarter, I'd like to look at it -- the trajectory from August to September. And when you look at that in our cardiovascular devices, those growth rates in September were much better than the growth rates in August. And the growth rates in September were better than the third quarter overall. And then that's true for both U.S. and internationally for both devices -- for devices. In Core Lab, we actually saw a nice growth in the month of September in the U.S., in Europe and in China also. So I like the rate of recovery that we're seeing in our base business. If you look at Electrophysiology, that was an interesting one, where when you look at the sales, we were hurt a little bit by the capital cycle, which is why we're only at about 2% or 3%. But if you look at the consumable part of our business, so -- which probably reflect better the return of procedures. So looking at mapping catheters and therapeutic catheters, we saw a high single-digit growth rate there. So our plan here is to continue to see that recovery. And it's not just about recovery of COVID and easing, it's also the pipeline. And we've got a very rich pipeline in our Cardiovascular area, too. And in our Core Lab business, the continued rollout of Alinity, improving our menu, expanding our menu, that's all helping us become more competitive in this recovery process. Vijay Kumar : That's a helpful commentary, Robert. And maybe one big-picture question on balance sheet. You guys are really in an enviable position here. Considering that we're in a 0 interest rate environment, maybe thoughts on optimal balance sheet structure here. And what opportunities do you see, if perhaps, on the inorganic side? Robert Ford : Yes. Listen, our financial strong here is very healthy. We're generating nice cash and we're allocating to our needs. We don't see any changes, Vijay, to our allocation strategy. We focus on paying a strong and growing dividend. It's part of our identity. It's different from a lot of med tech peers that don't have that dividend. So we're going to continue to support that growth of the dividend. We haven't done a lot of share repurchasing, mostly to offset our dilution. A lot of our investment here has been to drive organic growth. So taking our balance sheet and applying that cash to invest in areas where we see opportunities for growth, that's where we've been focused on. And I think that's the best return we've got right now for our shareholders. If you look at what we've done with COVID and the investments we've made there, the speed at which we've been able to make those investments and execute it is because of that strategic flexibility that we have in the balance sheet. Talked about manufacturing expansions with Libre, which we're definitely going to need as we expand the portfolio and build the portfolio and other parts of our Medical Devices, too. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Congrats on a good quarter. Robert, maybe we -- if we could spend a minute on diabetes here. You've had a lot of approvals over the past few months with Libre 3 in Europe, Libre 2 for a while now in the U.S. and then also the Libre Sense starting to move into the consumer area outside of diabetes. I was hoping you could talk about your expectations just for Libre growth, both U.S. and outside the U.S. Maybe when we could see a Libre 3 in the U.S., which would really help close the gap versus DexCom, and your thoughts on the non-diabetes component. Robert Ford : Sure, Robbie. Listen, I think Libre continues to perform really well. And as you saw, our pipeline continues to be highly productive. We had a good growth rate this quarter, over 35%. I thought it was a real nice sequential improvement versus Q2. And I think in Q2 our sales were just under $600 million, and Q3 sales were just under $700 million. So I think we had a nice sequential Q2 to Q3 kind of growth rate. We continue to focus on our strategy of kind of mass-market opportunity, mass-market potential and not see this as a niche play. We now have over -- more than 2.5 million users. That's significantly more than our next competitor. Regarding Libre 2 in the U.S. We were able to get the product on shelf -- in the retail shelf in mid-August. So we had about a partial quarter over here. But the customer response has been really positive. We've heard -- just you talking about closing the gap here with Libre 3. Listen, Libre 2, in my view, has already done that, and that's what we're hearing from our customers here. It's by far the smallest, easiest sensor to use, got the best accuracy, low range, high range, mid-range, adults, children. The readings every minute, which is unique to Libre, allows us to get a better alarm performance. And we can continue to mass produce it and sell it at a fraction of the price so that you're not really overburdening the health care system. So I think that's worked very well. Libre sales in the U.S., they actually grew 20% sequentially Q3 versus Q2 and about 45% year-over-year, and that's with just about 40 days' worth of sales of Libre 2 in the quarter. So I've seen positive momentum in some of the prescriptions. We -- because our strategy is focused more in the retail environment, we get to see that prescription data every week. So we're seeing nice trend from high prescribers. We're also seeing a nice pickup here for the pediatric endocrinologists segment. So we see a nice pickup in prescriptions over there, too. So I think it's obviously fairly early in the launch, but I think we're off to a great start. And I like what I've seen in the first 45 days. Regarding Libre 3. Listen, we always said that Libre was going to be a platform, and we're going to be building on this platform. And are we funding R&D programs to continue to innovate? Yes, we are. We'll have a Libre 4. We'll have a Libre 5. But we get so -- I think we get so caught up on every version over here, we might miss the bigger picture. And the bigger picture here is that to be able to sustain an ability to penetrate the mass market, you do need to have a variety of different platforms and continuously innovate. About bringing -- about timing of Libre 3 in the U.S. here, Robbie, I'm not going to provide details to you on that timing here. Obviously, the U.S. team is having a good time launching Libre 2 right now. What I would say is it's a very different segment than the cardiovascular device segment as it relates to clinical trials in the sense that we haven't seen the impact of kind of coronavirus slow down our trials here for -- within this space. So listen, you'll hear about Libre 3 approval when we get it and we issue a press release, just like we did with Libre 3 in Europe. On Libre Sense, listen, we've always talked about we could expand beyond diabetes, and this is our first step over here. The goal with this product specifically is to help kind of athletes achieve kind of better performance by using data, so they can kind of better fuel themselves to avoid fatigue. It's a different business model, Robbie. It will be a different business model, different channels. There'll probably be a different usage pattern and frequency in this segment. But obviously, if you look at the athletic training and sports population, it's a significantly large population here. So we've actually built a team that's separated from the diabetes group that's just focused on developing this opportunity. We've done an initial collaboration here, which I think is going to provide us a great visibility on how this kind of very large mass segment needs to be addressed and the different strategies we'll be able to kind of deploy. Robert Marcus : Great. That was really helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Robert, you talked about how the testing business in Diagnostics is more than just COVID. It's the whole platform. Alinity is just getting going now in the U.S. How should we think about Abbott share gains over the past few months? You've obviously made huge strides in COVID testing. It's a leading platform. Has that driven share shifts over to Alinity and some of your other platforms during this time that sets you up better going forward? Robert Ford : Yes. I mean I think we already had a real strong momentum before COVID with the rollout of the Alinity system. We're having great share gains, both in immunoassay and then the clinic chem business also. So that -- obviously, with COVID in Q2, a lot of the hospitals and the labs weren't focused so much on migrating of systems. But before that, we were renewing our existing contracts in the 90% range. And new tenders that were coming up for bid, we were in that kind of 45% to 50% kind of win rate. So you put that together and you look at our sales growth, we were definitely taking share. That -- the placements of instruments took a little bit of a pause in Q2. And as I said in the opening comments, we started to see a little bit of a pickup in September in terms of positive growth for all these geographies. And that's coupled with, again, a new cycle here of reopening of the tenders. I think that it's also allowed us, Robbie, with our position in COVID testing to be viewed as a more holistic partner to a large -- to large systems, whether they're in the U.S. or internationally, and that's ultimately helped us. I think one of the things that's definitely helped us in our Diagnostic business has been our molecular platform with the Alinity m launch. That's obviously had kind of a little bit of catapult effect with that launch. And -- but in that platform, we have more than just COVID testing. So yes, I think it's a good opportunity for us overall for Diagnostics. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : A couple of product questions and then one big-picture question, Robert. Just on EPD, just the outlook there. It sounds like you started to see some recovery. And in Adult Nutrition, the strength there, can you talk about why you're seeing that strength and how sustainable that is? And I have one follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure, Larry. Yes, EPD, we definitely saw some more challenging market conditions in this quarter than what we had in Q1 and in Q2. If you look at how COVID kind of progressed a little bit, it hit the developed markets, I think, harder in Q2. And then the emerging markets, it hit us more in Q3, especially markets like India, Russia, some markets in Latin America also. But it -- when -- we look at a lot of the data, and we started to see a similar trend in September than what we saw in June in the developed markets, right? So you had that kind of drop, and then it starts to kind of recover. So I kind of look at the EPD as following the same trend that we saw in devices and core lab in Q2 but just a quarter later. So I think we'll see some of the recovery there. It's a good business. A lot of the portfolio is still very resilient. 50% of our portfolio is tied to chronic diseases. So that's the piece that, I think, kind of got impacted. The acute part of the portfolio has actually done pretty well. So we expect to see that recovery curve continue into Q4. On the Nutrition side, and your question was on adult, right? It was very strong growth in adult. And one of the things that the team did really well starting in Q2 is they started to look at our messaging regarding the immunity benefits of our Adult Nutrition. And they came out with a strong campaign, a strong messaging on the benefits on the immunity side, and that helped fuel the demand there. I think we saw probably at the end of Q1, there was a little bit of pantry loading, Larry. We saw that in the U.S., saw a little bit of that internationally, too. But what we did -- what we were able to do with that is we actually picked up new users and we picked up market share. So the combination of new users and market share and then the immunity messaging resonating with consumers and physicians has really kind of strengthened that portfolio. And I think it definitely sticks out a little bit in terms of our growth rate. But a lot of that, what we're seeing, is share gain and market expansion based on the data that we're seeing. Larry Biegelsen : That's helpful. And then just one big-picture question. It sounds like COVID testing should continue to be strong next year. But if you have a -- get at some point where COVID testing declines because we have a safe and effective vaccine, how are you thinking about reinvestment and managing, potentially smoothing out earnings? Is there any thoughts kind of if we did see a decline in COVID testing, at some point, how you would manage that? Robert Ford : Yes. I don't think we're going to see that kind of decline in COVID testing. I think even with a vaccine, you're going to see kind of more of a steady state. And we've talked about that, and we planned for that. The other part of your question regarding kind of reinvesting in the business. Well, we're going to be able to do that next year and still deliver a pretty differentiated, unique kind of earnings growth and earnings power. As I said, we've got over 100 new products in our pipeline that we're going to invest in. We can either accelerate their development and their coming to market. We've got opportunities to expand market development. The opportunities that we have in MitraClip to be able to invest in that, strengthening of that market, strengthening our competitiveness. So I think we've got a great opportunity here with COVID testing to deliver differentiated earnings power and growth, while at the same time investing in this pipeline that Abbott has built over these years to sustain that growth rate. I'll just go back to the notion here that the COVID assay might go down to steady state. But if you think about the installed base that we're building because of COVID, especially on the rapid side, I think that's going to be a strong growth driver for us going forward. I mean I'll give an example of that. When we started the year in the U.S., we had over 20,000 ID NOWs placed in the in the U.S., in the U.S. alone. In 4 months, we've already doubled that placement rate by more physician offices, retail channels and a variety of universities and different channels. So what we're building here with the COVID test is an installed base that will then be able to run different kind of assays and different tests. And if it's -- if they're digital, if they're affordable, then the consumer behavior that's now today in COVID test and we believe is going to be there for all the other assays that we're building on. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Congrats on all the good results this quarter. I just had 2 quick follow-ups. First, just on COVID testing. Does that $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion run rate that you highlighted include contribution from the OUS antigen test? Or is that more upside to come as that fully launches in the fourth quarter? Robert Ford : It's got some of it in there, Bob. Obviously, when you're doing this kind of ramp up the way we're doing it across continents, very different platforms there, we want to make sure that we can deliver. So in that number, you've got some of that international antigen there. But obviously, we're working that -- we could probably do a little bit better than that in that international antigen also. So... Robert Hopkins : Okay. And then just one follow-up on the device side ex diabetes. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about vascular in Q3 as that was down, I think, 10%, which is a little worse than some of the other businesses. And then more importantly, Robert, I'd love to get your view, just like based on everything you're seeing right now, what are your directional thoughts on the outlook for 2021 for Medical Devices ex diabetes? Is there -- should we be thinking about that as potentially close to normal in terms of the business? Or just how much uncertainty do you think there is as we think about devices for next year based on what you're seeing now? Robert Ford : Sure. On the outlook there of devices, I would say -- listen, I think that we had a really big impact in Q2 across the world, U.S. and internationally. Because I think a lot of -- this was a new thing -- this was a new virus and the shutdown was pretty dramatic, was pretty significant. As I think about our device portfolio, there are still cardiovascular needs. People still need to get a pacemaker. There's still a need for mitral repair. There's still a need for ablation for AFib. I mean those are all conditions that the reason we're in them is because there were medically scientific needs for us to be in them. So I see the market is still an opportunity for growth. And I think that the hospitals and hospital systems have learned now how to deal with that and how to deal with that pandemic. You've seen certain systems kind of focus on treating COVID and keeping other hospitals more focused for electives. So I think that's -- I believe the device portfolio that we've built is relevant, is important. And even in a COVID kind of world, those are medically necessary procedures. And we're working with hospitals to assist them in opening. And we'll see it continue to grow. We've seen a nice progression from Q2 to Q3. I expect that progression to continue into Q4. Yes, there could be some lumpiness here and there. But I think the progression is going to be positive. And my expectation is that we'll see kind of devices get back to that growth rate that we previously had in those high single digits next year. Robert Hopkins : And then on vascular? Sorry. Robert Ford : Oh, on the vascular question. Yes, we had -- it's interesting. If you look at the device portfolios that were a little bit -- didn't recover as fast, it really was vascular and CRM. I think some of those are affected by some of the pricing dynamics that still exist in that channel. Vascular, you've got an average price erosion there of 5% to 6%. So once you exclude that, it would probably be a little bit better. But there's a little bit of a slower kind of recovery. We did see vascular is right now at about 95% of their kind of pre-COVID levels. So there's been a rebound, but I think there's been a little bit of a price impact there also. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : Actually, there are 2 of them, and I'll put them up front. Can you give us an update on your Structural Heart platform and what we might be looking forward to in the next 12 to 18 months? And then my second question is, it sounds as if you are more leaning towards reinvesting some of the COVID-19 revenue versus sort of tuck-in M&A. Can you just give us an idea of how we should think about how much of the upside actually flows through to EPS versus how much of it gets invested? Robert Ford : Sure. I think on your Structural Heart question here, I think we've got a leading kind of portfolio of products here. We've launched a couple of novel products this year. TriClip for the tricuspid valve repair. And then Tendyne, which is the first product for mitral valve replacement. Those have actually gone very well. Especially when you're going to launch novel products like this, you want to kind of build evidence. You want to kind of build your way into it. So everything that we had planned for those 2 product launches really didn't get much impacted by COVID because we didn't have kind of significant sales attached to them, more about kind of developing the clinical evidence. So that's gone very well. If you -- your question in the next kind of 12 to 18 months, I think we've got a really rich pipeline here. Obviously, the biggest opportunity we have is to expand the mitral valve repair with the NCD for the secondary MR indication. That will be a big driver for us. We've seen already patient referral networks starting to be built around waiting for that indication -- that reimbursement approval. But we've got several of the products in the pipeline. I think Amulet, our left atrial appendage device, is going to be a great opportunity. It does very well from a share perspective internationally. The larger part of the market is here in the U.S. So we're looking forward to enter that market here in the U.S. We've got a next-gen TAVR device called Navitor that we've been working on. This will be our third iteration. We've launched our FlexNav product in Europe this year with an improved delivery catheter and gotten good feedback from implanters over there. And then I think that TriClip and Tendyne are multibillion-dollar opportunities here for us that are, as I described, very, very early in the innings. So I'm very excited about that Structural Heart portfolio in the next 12, 18 months. It's probably one of our richest portfolios in our device portfolio. Scott Leinenweber : There was a second question, Joanne. I -- we didn't grab it here. Can you repeat the question? Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : Of course. The second question was there's -- you're one of the few companies in med tech land that's going to have the benefit from COVID-19 diagnostic testing and the revenue associated with it. I'm trying to think about how, as we look forward, that revenue either is reinvested or flows through, or maybe you'll redirect it towards targeted M&A? Robert Ford : Yes. So again, we're trying to triangulate here as much as we can, but we're not going to put out a specific number. What I can reemphasize here is that COVID is definitely going to be a big boost for us, continue to be a big driver for us into 2021. We're in a unique position. We're not coming out of a hole. We're going to be delivering what I would say very high strong double-digit top and bottom line. And in doing that and in delivering those very high double-digit top and bottom line after double-digit earnings this year, we're still going to have plenty of opportunity to put investment into R&D and into sales and marketing to continue to drive not only the pipeline but all the opportunities that we've had that we've talked a little bit about here. Whether it's Libre, whether it's Structural Heart, whether it's in Nutrition, we've got plenty of opportunities. So I guess the -- I'll leave you there, Joanne, with we've got tremendous momentum, strong 2020. We're going to have a stronger 2021. And we realize that we've got a unique opportunity here with over 100 products in our pipeline to be able to kind of fund and drive on top of our double-digit earnings and top line growth next year. Operator : Our last question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Robert, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Medical Device franchise. And following up on Bob's question just on the outlook, but just thinking about how you're setting internal targets for your med device sales team or just internally how you're going to judge success. I think there's -- I'm confused about how we should be thinking about it, our team independently for the whole sector. But I mean are you thinking about sequential improvement as we get into Q4, Q1, Q2 next year as kind of a solid target to think about kind of a performance level? Are those the type of targets you're setting for your sales force? Or are you looking back at 2019 over the next 3 quarters and think about that being the base in terms of how you're incentivizing your sales force? Robert Ford : Yes. We're looking for steady improvement quarter-over-quarter, and that's how we've kind of set our targets. I mean I think the ultimate measure here of success and of winning is market share and market share gains for those products where we're competing more head-to-head. And then for other products where we're unique in the space, whether it's mitral or tricuspid, et cetera, then we're looking at market development and market expansion. But to your question here, it's all about kind of steady sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. Do I think we're going to be at 10% Med Device growth by the end of this quarter? No, I don't. But do I think Q4 is going to be better than Q3? Yes, I do. Joshua Jennings : That's helpful. And then just wanted to ask on COVID testing, just focusing on the serology segment. Can you give us the state of the affairs for the demand level for COVID-19 antibody testing in the U.S., internationally currently and then how you see that demand evolving? I think you've said maybe in the last earnings call that vaccine -- success with the vaccine programs could drive some incremental demand on the serology side. Robert Ford : Sure. Yes. I mean when it first happened, we were fast to take advantage of the installed base that we had with our Alinity and our architect systems here to develop a blood antibody test. And we also developed lateral flow rapid antibody test. And I would say we haven't seen the kind of demand that we thought we would see when we were putting those programs together. So in our numbers here, I think we've kind of excluded them. But do I think that there's an opportunity for antibody testing as the vaccine gets rolled out? Yes, I do. And I see the opportunity for lab-based and for rapid lateral flow testing also. We've seen some governments already mandate on every blood draw for other tests to check for antibodies. I think that's just going to get more intense when the vaccines get rolled out. So I think there's -- there'll be an opportunity there. And Abbott will be in a unique position there to be able to capitalize on that. So I'll just kind of wrap up here. We've had a nice growth step-up during the third quarter. We achieved double-digit top and bottom line growth. The businesses, we spent some time talking about the businesses that were hardest hit by COVID. We can see that they're all trending in the right direction and showing sequential steady improvement. Our pipeline continues to be highly productive. We've got a lot of ongoing launch activity across all the businesses in the markets here. And we've expanded our COVID testing platforms, adding more testing platforms, adding more capacity. I don't think that COVID testing is going to go away anytime soon. And I think it's big, and I think that Abbott's in a unique position with not only the platforms that we've developed but the manufacturing and supply chain that we've assembled. We've increased our full year guidance, which now reflects double-digit EPS growth. And I think that's pretty unique and differentiated in this environment, and I think it's a testament to our ability to execute and deliver across our diversified portfolio. And I think we're well positioned to go from what is a very good, strong year for us to an even better one in 2021. And again, I think we're pretty uniquely insulated here against kind of any kind of COVID reemergence scenarios. So with that, I thank you. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Finance Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2021. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations and financial results, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and in Item 1A Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that financial information provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another highly successful year for Abbott during what's been the single most disruptive health care event in our lifetimes. For the full year, we reported organic sales growth of nearly 10% and ongoing earnings per share of $3.65, which reflects double-digit growth and is at the upper end of our guidance range we set last January when we were expecting a normal economy. Performance like this after the pandemic struck is a real achievement and demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model. The normal times, it maximizes our growth opportunities, and during the pandemic, it's been tested by a global crisis and proven to be highly resilient. It should come as no surprise that our performance was led by our Diagnostics business. COVID-19 dominated the year for us and the world, and our primary response came in the form of diagnostic tests to identify the virus. In total, we delivered more than 400 million COVID tests since the start of the pandemic, including more than 300 million tests in the fourth quarter alone. But as we've discussed before, the year was not all Diagnostics and COVID. Our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutrition, Diabetes Care and Established Pharmaceuticals all contribute growth for the year, and we continue to launch an impressive stream of innovations across our businesses. And I'll touch on some of these new products in more detail in just a moment. We exited 2020 with tremendous momentum, including total sales growth of more than 28% and ongoing earnings per share growth of more than 50% in the fourth quarter. Turning to 2021. We're forecasting another year of top-tier performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $5 in 2021, reflecting growth of more than 35% compared to last year. And because we're building on top of our strong 2020 performance, our forecasted 2021 earnings per share is more than 50% higher than our pre-pandemic EPS in 2019, which is highly unique and differentiated in this environment. I'll now provide more details on our 2020 results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased around 4.5% for both the fourth quarter and full year. Strong growth of Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand, led to double-digit growth in Adult Nutrition for both the quarter and full year. In Pediatric Nutrition, U.S. sales growth of more than 5% last year was led by increased market share of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand. International Pediatric Nutrition sales continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in Greater China. During the past year, we continue to expand our Nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extensions, including the continued rollout of infant formula products across our Similac brand family that contain human oligosaccharide or HMO, which supports a healthy immune system. Global expansion of our PediaSure, Glucerna and Ensure brands, including the continued rollout of Ensure high-protein products; and the launch of 4 new Pedialyte rehydration products : Pedialyte Zero Sugar, Sport, Organic and Immune Support. For 2021, we're forecasting similar sales growth for our global Nutrition business and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. Turning to Medical Devices, where sales were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Strong double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was offset by lower sales in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses due to challenging conditions as COVID case rates surged in certain geographies towards the end of the quarter. As we saw throughout last summer and fall, we expect procedure volumes to improve in these businesses as COVID case rates subside. In Diabetes Care, sales grew nearly 30% for the fourth quarter and full year, led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. In the U.S., Libre sales grew 50% last year. And outside the U.S., Libre sales grew 40%, surpassing $2 billion of international sales for the full year 2020. This past year was possibly our most productive ever in terms of new product approvals and launches across our Medical Device portfolio. Let me touch on a handful. First, the approval of MitraClip Gen 4, the latest generation of our market-leading system to repair a leaky mitral heart valve. Just last week in the U.S., Medicare expanded reimbursement coverage for MitraClip, which significantly expands the eligible patient population that can benefit from this life-changing technology. CE Mark of Tendyne, a first-of-its-kind minimally invasive device to replace a faulty mitral valve; and the CE Mark of TriClip, our minimally invasive clip technology to repair a leaky tricuspid heart valve. Long considered the forgotten valve, TriClip brings an important new solution to patients that have previously had very few treatment options. Abbott now offers minimally invasive device therapies for 3 valves in the heart : the aortic, the mitral and the tricuspid valves. We also launched 2 cardiac rhythm defibrillation products under our Gallant brand that include Bluetooth capabilities to align with our strategy in remote monitoring and digitally connected care. Also saw the approval of EnSite X, our next-generation 3D cardiac mapping technology; and U.S. approval of FreeStyle Libre 2 and CE Mark for Libre 3, the latest generations of our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring systems; and CE Mark of Libre Sense Glucose Sport, the first product in our strategy to expand use of our wearable biosensor technology into mass-market opportunities beyond diabetes. As you can see, it was a highly productive year for our pipeline, and quite frankly, there's even more I could highlight. In 2021, we're forecasting continued strong double-digit growth in our Diabetes Care business, led by FreeStyle Libre, and steady improvements in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses, fueled by the continued business recovery, the society works its way through COVID-19 and on the strength of our recent and upcoming new product launches. Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 3.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. Despite COVID, EPD sales increased 2% overall in 2020, demonstrating the resilience of our business model even in this challenging environment. Growth this past year was led by sales in India, Russia, China and Brazil. During the year, EPD continued to strengthen its portfolio with more than 50 new product launches across our key emerging markets. As we've discussed before, new product introductions in EPD are more incremental in nature, and the steady cadence of portfolio expansion and refreshment we're achieving is an important element of our sustainable growth strategy. We forecast demand and growth rate improvements in EPD during 2021 as well as a continued steady cadence of new product introductions that will contribute to growth. And I'll wrap up with our Diagnostic business, where sales grew nearly 110% in the quarter, driven by $2.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales. We realized very early that a variety of different testing solutions would be required to tackle the pandemic. With that understanding, starting last March, we developed and launched an entire portfolio of tests to target the virus. The biggest contribution in the fourth quarter came from our rapid lateral flow test to detect the virus, which includes BinaxNOW in the U.S. and Panbio internationally. These are highly portable, reliable and affordable tests and in just 50 minutes can detect if someone is infectious without the use of an instrument, which means the test can be performed in virtually any setting, such as physician office, pharmacies, urgent care centers, workplace settings and even at home. As part of our pandemic response efforts, we also developed and launched a digital solution that pairs with these tests called NAVICA, which allows people to receive and display test results on their mobile devices. But our efforts didn't stop at developing these tests. We also ramped up manufacturing capacity on a massive scale and now producing more than 100 million of these 2 tests combined per month. While our COVID testing efforts have clearly received a lot of attention, we've also remained focused on the launch and rollout of Alinity, our suite of innovative diagnostic instruments. We continue to retain existing businesses and capture share at strong rates. And we continue to build on our test menus for these instruments. Last year, we initiated the U.S. launch of Alinity m for molecular testing. This launch included a COVID test, which helped jump-start demand for this innovative, highly automated and differentiated molecular testing platform. And earlier this month, we announced U.S. FDA clearance for the first rapid handheld blood test for concussions. This test measures certain biomarkers found in blood after a head trauma event and produce the result within 15 minutes after a plasma sample is inserted in our i-STAT Alinity handheld device. Building on this initial clearance, we're also working on a whole blood point-of-care test under FDA breakthrough designation. And our vision is to develop a 15-minute portable test that can be used in any settings where people might experience head injuries that require quick evaluation. So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved the upper end of the EPS range we set last January before anyone knew the extent of the COVID pandemic, demonstrating the strength, resilience of our diversified business model and our superior execution. Our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering groundbreaking innovations and a steady cadence of important new products, with more on the horizon. We continue to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID, which is helping to fight the virus, and accelerating our long-term decentralized testing strategy. And we're forecasting more than 35% adjusted EPS growth in 2021, which is truly unique in this environment. I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 28.4%, which was led by strong performance in Nutrition and Diabetes Care, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.4 billion in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 0.3% on sales, which was somewhat favorable compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. Reported sales increased 28.7% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.5% of sales. R&D investment was 6% of sales. And SG&A expense was 23.5% of sales. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 14.1% reflects the adjustment required to align our tax expense with our revised full year effective tax rate of 15%. This is somewhat lower than the estimate we provided in October due to a shift in the mix of our geographic and business income. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $5. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our reported sales, which includes an expected favorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast full year net interest expense of around $515 million, nonoperating income of around $230 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of 15%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Congrats on all the success and progress you guys are having. So Robert, so much that I could ask about here, but I'll go high level with my question and ask, if you wouldn't mind, putting that $5 earnings -- or at least $5 in earnings for 2021, a guidance number in perspective for us given that, that $5 is above even what The Street was modeling for 2022. And specifically, I guess the way I'd ask the question is, I'm sure investors would love some perspective on how COVID testing impacts that guidance, how you're thinking about the base business. And maybe most importantly, given how much higher $5 is compared to expectations, I'm sure investors would love to hear your early thoughts on whether or not Abbott can grow at its sort of traditional rates off of that $5 number next year. So sorry for the long-winded question, but would love any perspective. Robert Ford : Sure, Bob. You hit on all the points there. I guess we've been looking at 2021 for several months right now. I think one of the things as we're going into it is that we knew, I mean, a lot of companies were going to be forecasting double-digit growth going into 2021, a lot of that probably based on comps, where we saw a decrease in EPS. And that was -- that's not the case for Abbott. We're not coming out of a hole. And as I said in my remarks, the $5 -- the at least $5 target for 2021 is about 50% higher than where we were in 2019. And what I can say is that we are, Bob and myself, as we manage the business, especially over these last couple of months and going into this year, we've been looking at 2-year CAGRs across our businesses. And then -- I think that's the right way to look at it, is to kind of look at what happened in 2020. And it's easy for some of the businesses to come up and post double-digit kind of growth for us. So we're really looking on a 2-year CAGR basis. The points that you touched on are all the points that we've looked at, and we've been modeling several different scenarios. So I'll touch on those because they're all elements of how we built to our at least $5. First of all, obviously, COVID testing, it's been a big driver for us, and it will continue to be a big driver. I expect testing demand is still going to remain high even as the vaccines roll out. I don't think we've even seen testing demand peak yet. So we built a lot of capacity, and we've talked about that over the last year, the capacity that we built. But we didn't put it all in. We didn't put it all in into that $5. So -- but we don't all see it going away either. But there's enough capacity there, testing capacity, sufficient testing capacity for us to be able to meet this kind of growing demand right now. The other part of our forecast here, without a doubt, is looking at our base business and the recovery of our base business, specifically the ones that were hit probably more heavily by the COVID, which was some of our device businesses and our routine testing and routine lab testing. These are important procedures and life-saving procedures. They're important routine tests to do. So you can't just keep pushing them out indefinitely. And what we saw in Q3 of last year as those rates -- hospitalization rates start to come down, we started to see the pickup of our procedures and of our core testing. And we actually saw growth in several months in Q3 and going into Q4. And obviously, that got impacted probably around Thanksgiving. So we've seen that these can recover, and we do have that modeled in into that $5, which is a recovery of these businesses at a similar rate of what we saw in Q3 in summer and the fall. I'd say the third kind of key element in there is our consumer businesses that probably weren't as impacted and did pretty well during the pandemic. We expect those businesses to either continue their trajectory or get better. I mean I think Nutrition had a really great year last year. I expect them to have a very similar year this year with a lot of new product launches. EPD should get sequentially better. We saw that in Q4. Early indications in January show that recovery continuing. And quite frankly, Libre, I expect to do better with all the innovation and investment we're making there. So those businesses will do well. And then the fourth element that we've modeled a lot is spending and ability to reinvest in the businesses and areas that we thought that we could do with more investment, whether it's SG&A, and more specifically in R&D, and accelerate some of our programs. I think you saw some of that in our Q4 results, where we beat consensus while at the same time, investing more in R&D and SG&A. So we looked at these 4 elements here, Bob, and we modeled it variety of different ways and just feel really good that this was a good floor, a good starting point at $5. Quite frankly, if anything, we could have significant upside over here. And it's just really going to depend a little bit on how we think about COVID testing going forward. So I kind of saw the $5 here as, okay, it's a 37% increase versus 2020, which grew 13%. And we've got probable upside to that, while at the same time, an opportunity to invest in the business, invest in SG&A, more specifically in R&D. We've got a leading COVID test portfolio here with a variety of different tests and capacity that we haven't dialed all in. Quite frankly, if I had put all that capacity in, I think maybe you would have a little bit of time believing that, but it's there. And I think we've got an exciting base business like you'd mentioned here that is poised for recovery. I mean we've got great portfolios, real strong brands, rich pipelines, strong leadership position. So I think the $5 here was definitely a good starting point, factoring all those elements in here, and we'll be able to kind of build from there as the year progresses. Robert Hopkins : That's thorough overview. And then just the one follow-up would be, obviously, it's the beginning of 2021. But does that high level of earnings for this year, does that mean you might not be able to grow off of that in 2022 because there's so much testing in 2021? Or just give us some thoughts on Abbott's ability to continue on a double-digit growth trajectory off of that $5 number, if okay. Robert Ford : Sure. It's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. But we have -- but listen, when -- we didn't do 2021 in isolation. So yes, we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that I talked about. So I can probably give you some general comments over here. I mean I think we're forecasting a lot of growth this year, and we're going to be looking to build on it. Prior to the pandemic, The Street consensus for 2023 EPS was just under $5. So we're targeting that EPS, this level this year. So in essence, we've pulled forward at least 2 full years of EPS growth. And our mindset here, Bob, is going to be that we're going to maintain that pull-forward indefinitely. We always start our process with a double-digit target every year. That's been our identity. And I have no intention of changing that identity. Of course, there's a couple of factors here that we need to contemplate. But even looking at those factors, we feel good that we've got the different elements here to be able to deliver on that double digit. One of those is obviously COVID and COVID testing. And even if COVID testing starts to mature a little bit in 2022, we believe there's a significant portion that's still very sustainable. Can we predict it perfectly today? No, I can't, not to the level that you're accustomed to get from us. But I also think that the ability to do testing in a decentralized manner, people talk a lot about how the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in businesses, accelerated transformation in the business models. The pandemic has accelerated our decentralized testing strategy. And I think the -- I think I talked about this in the last call. I think a lot of the testing channels that we're building here that have emerged, I don't see them going away. On top of that, we -- as I said, we've got investment and investment spending into SG&A, but more specifically into R&D. We believe R&D is the more sustainable spend. It's the spend that allows us to sustain our top line growth rate. So I would expect that these investments that we've made in Q4 and definitely into 2021 that, that will have an impact on our base business growth rate. We've always talked about our base business being sustainable at [ 7 to 8 ], and I would expect these investments to be able to accelerate on that. And I guess the third part to that question of yours about confidence on delivering double digits in 2022 is we've got a great balance sheet, and we've got strong financial health and a lot of strategic flexibility there. So I lay all of these elements out here : sustained COVID testing, the investment in the business and the strong balance sheet, just gives me confidence that even with all these different models here that we'll be able to kind of continue to deliver that identity of double-digit growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Matthew Taylor : So maybe I'll just ask you to drill down a little bit on testing and the assumptions that you have for testing in the year. You came in really strong here in Q4 with a big step-up sequentially. What are you assuming in the $5 for testing throughout the year, if you could discuss some of the different product lines? And then maybe if you could provide some high-level thoughts on how much of a tail of testing we might see into '22 and beyond? Robert Ford : Sure. So let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here then, and then I'll spend time talking a little bit about sustainability of the testing. As I said, I don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. We achieved $2.4 billion in Q4. So if you annualize that, it'll go -- it will annualize for around $10 billion. So I can expect probably Q1 is going to be at that range of about $2.5 billion or so. And if you'd say, \"Okay. What does the full year range look like?\" I probably can't go beyond Q1 in terms of exactly how it's going to look like, but you can be in that $6.5 billion to $7 billion range, I would think. But we've got, as I said, plenty of capacity to go above that. So that's probably what's incorporated here, Matt, in the $5. But I think the big point here is the sustainability of this. And to your question there, I think a good portion is sustainable. I think a substantial portion is sustainable, which is why we were a first mover and a leader here. We started with our lab-based systems. Those were the probably the obvious part in the strategy. Since we knew we had a lot of capital equipment out in the labs, we started with that strategy to take advantage of the systems out there. And you saw that rollout happen. But we also knew that in a pandemic, you were going to need to add on top of that testing infrastructure. You're going to have to add faster testing, and testing that could be done at a much significant scale and that was more affordable, which is why we developed those 2 lateral flow tests. There's been a lot of visibility to BinaxNOW here in the U.S. We haven't talked a lot about Panbio. But Panbio uses the same technology, the same kind of antibodies. And we've got a whole supply chain that's been built outside of the United States that supplies all of the markets that we're supporting with Panbio. So both those products, they've been the bulk of our sales. We saw that in Q4. There's a lot of capacity that we've built around them, and that would continue to build around them. And the clinical utility of them is really strong. I mean they've been -- a lot of studies are showing their reliability here at finding people that are infectious. And I think that's a key distinction here, is your ability to use these tests in a way for being able to find those people that are infectious and not necessarily those that were infectious and that might have some remnants of DNA of the virus in their system. So I think it's sustainable. And I think you need to take 2 kind of views here on that, at least this is how we're looking at it. First of all, we need to think globally about this. Sometimes, we get very focused on the U.S. and what's going on in here in the U.S., but you've got 8 billion-plus people around the world. And you've got a variety of different countries that are experiencing different cycles in the disease, different cycles in their vaccination strategies. So once you really take a bigger view here, this is not going to be something that will just be done in the next couple of quarters here, if you take a real global perspective. And the second thing that I think is just reframing the testing. I think we think about the sustainability of testing when we think about Q2 and Q3 of last year. Long lines, not enough volume, long turnaround times, $150, $200 tests. That might be not sustainable -- not as sustainable. But if you position yourself into a 2021, 2022 world where you now have fast, easier, much more scalable test, digital tests that are priced for more accessibility and affordability, I think that's the sustained kind of business here that we see. So when you think about that maturing of the COVID testing market, we kind of see PCR kind of maturing first, and then we see the rapid part of the business being sustained. And listen, we've built a lot of capacity, as I said. It's probably $12 million, $13 million, $14 billion of capacity that we built in there. We haven't put it all in, but it's there. And then the other part that I talked about was just the sustainability of it past '22 and into 2023 as we've accelerated our point-of-care testing strategy. And everything we're doing in fighting the virus has not only a direct impact of helping reopen the economy, et cetera, but it's also seeding the market. And it's building these new testing channels. We've got testing going on at airports, hotels, urgent care, retail, universities, et cetera. So we believe that's pretty sustainable, too. Matthew Taylor : Great. Maybe I'll just ask a quick follow-up on Panbio. That's a big new piece of the story here. I think you rightly pointed out, may take longer in some countries for things to improve. So maybe testing lasts longer there. Could you talk specifically about Panbio and what you're able to do capacity-wise? Or any way to frame that opportunity? Robert Ford : Sure. So from a technology perspective, it's the -- it's using the same kind of lateral flow technology that Binax has. It's just in a different format, in a cassette format. We've got capacity to do over 50 million tests per month. And we've used our infectious disease emerging market organization. So the manufacturing, the regulatory, the R&D, and more importantly, the commercial infrastructure to be able to look across the world and support governments, workplaces, et cetera, on rolling out antigen testing internationally. So I think it's done very well. We've been able to kind of leverage some of the kind of joint development of Binax and Panbio. But the demand that we're seeing internationally, I would characterize also as probably just starting. It hasn't even peaked either. So I think we've got a lot of opportunity with Panbio internationally, too. And I think the teams have done a really good job there. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : I'll add my congratulations on the quarter. Maybe I'll ask both my questions as one upfront. This is a significant windfall of cash you're getting from the COVID testing in 2020 and 2021 and hopefully beyond. So maybe you could just talk about where you're going to put all that cash to use. I know you've mentioned in the past, some of it's going to fund new product launches. If you could just also, as part of the answer, highlight the key product launches in 2021 and beyond to look for. Robert Ford : Sure. I'll probably say the following. A lot of it's going towards R&D, Robbie. And as I said, I think that's the more sustainable spend. It's the one that allows us to build more sustainability in our top line and building R&D programs. Yes, there's opportunity to accelerate SG&A and put some of that cash to use in SG&A. And there are some businesses that could definitely benefit with more SG&A. And there's a pretty strong return as we put those in there, whether it's Libre or Nutrition. But a lot of the focus of this reinvestment here is going into R&D. And quite frankly, I think our pipeline has been highly productive and maybe a little bit underappreciated, I think. There's a lot of focus that goes into kind of key 3 products that you guys like to write about them as the big 3, and they get a lot of attention. And quite frankly, they should, whether it's Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. They're large multibillion-dollar segments that are underpenetrated. And we've been making clear and intentional investments in those businesses. I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through those, but you kind of know them, right? So Libre with Libre 3. We've got Libre 4 in development. We've been making investments in new applications for the Libre platform outside of diabetes. And MitraClip, obviously, we've got this opportunity with the CMS reimbursement. We have a fifth generation MitraClip that's also in development. And we're investing in a significant amount of clinical trials here to expand the market for us, and we'll continue to do that. Probably the one I'm more excited about here is the moderate risk for DMR that we've announced also. And then Alinity, you also know the story. I mean we've got 6 new systems where we're increasing the menu and expanding that geographically. So that has a lot of attention, continues to have a lot of attention, and we do resource those opportunities because they're that big. But I think it's misleading here to think that that's the sum of our innovation strategy. We're so much more than that. On the EPD and the Nutrition side, we're going to continue to invest in line extensions and portfolio refreshment. This is the model that we know drive the returns we need for these businesses. And I think the team has now hit their stride in terms of how to do this and how to effectively roll this out with local portfolios. EPDs rolled out over 50 products. I expect that to continue. Nutrition has done over 20, and I expect that to continue also. In Diagnostics, outside of Alinity, outside of COVID, we've been investing a lot in expanding our rapid testing portfolio. I've been talking about this, about the opportunity we have to take advantage of these new channels that we built and increase the penetration with different assays. So whether it's going beyond COVID or flu with RSV, strep, we've got a sexually transmitted disease platform for ID NOW, which we're excited about also, which I think has got a great opportunity. And then this rapid concussion test, Robbie, I think, is a great opportunity for us. Probably the biggest opportunity we have is if -- once we work through to have a whole blood test, I can envision here an opportunity across the 25,000 high schools in the U.S., the 5,000 colleges, all the sporting leagues, and that's going to take us another 1.5 years or a bit or so to get there, but I think it's a great opportunity. And then the device portfolio is going to continue to get a lot of investment the way we have. Obviously, Tendyne and Cephea, we want to be a leader in mitral. We've launched Tendyne in Europe. We're funding our Cephea program so that we can have a transfemoral/transseptal program for the replacement of the mitral valve. I'm very pleased with the progress we've seen on Tendyne. TriClip, I've talked about the opportunity with TriClip. It's not going to be as large as mitral, but it will be 30%, 35% the size of the mitral market. And we're still in the early innings here of development -- of clinical evidence development, and we're going to be leading there. We've made investments in increasing the competitiveness of our CRM portfolio. We've just started to roll out now more global basis, our new 2 -- our 2 new defibrillator products under the Gallant. And we've been working hard at our leadless program and making the investments in the leadless program so that not only can we come out with a single-chamber product and then be able to upgrade it to a dual-chamber product. I like the program. I like what we've done with it. I think we have a value proposition -- a differentiated value proposition versus the competition. CardioMEMS is another study that we've been funding, and there's probably going to be required some build-out of the commercial infrastructure to be able to support the rollout of that product. If you think about the opportunity we have with CardioMEMS, even at a 10% to 15% penetration on that population, you're looking at a $1 billion opportunity for us. So that is obviously getting a lot of attention. And then I'm very excited to come into the U.S. with the LAA and the TAVR product sometime this year. I think these are great opportunities. I like the product that we have, especially on the LAA side with Amulet. It does very well in Europe. And we'll be funding those programs, too. So it's more than the big 3. There's a lot here. And quite frankly, Bob and I are already going to the businesses and say, \"Okay. What was below the line that you didn't show us in the planning process?\" and \"Can we get going on those, too?\" So that's where a lot of the investment goes into R&D. Operator : Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Robert, just want to follow back up on investment. And I just -- I'm just sort of thinking about your balance sheet here relative to peers. You're already more than a turn better than all your large-cap peers. And frankly, I can see a scenario by 2024, this is a net cash business and a $200 billion market cap company. So you have kind of unprecedented levels of financial leverage on the balance sheet. In recent weeks, we've actually seen some of your competitors get more aggressive on growth-oriented M&A, and we haven't heard much of that conversation this morning. So what are your thoughts on kind of growth-oriented M&A this year to supplement that pipeline? And should investors be thinking about tuck-in, growth-oriented M&A? Because you certainly have the capacity to do something more transformative. Then I had a quick follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. On the M&A side, listen, we're always looking. As I've always said, we're always looking. We're always studying. So while we'll not be announcing or doing something, we're still studying, we're still looking. As I said in the previous question, though, David, I mean we've got a lot of organic opportunities to invest in. And I like those organic opportunities. So they obviously do get a lot of our attention right now. But if you think about M&A, yes, it's got to be a good fit strategically, and it's got to align with our growth orientation here. I mean I'm not going to look at something that's going to dilute our top line growth rate, and obviously, is able to generate a return for our shareholders. So there's a lot of activity. There's a lot of, I'd say, high valuations right now so. But to the extent that we do something this year, it would be more like tuck-in in nature to be able to kind of augment some of these portfolios. So that's probably the better way to put it to you. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful. And then what a difference a year makes. We're deep in the call. We haven't talked about Libre yet, but I'm kind of curious on 2 fronts on Libre one. What -- the full commercial rollout of Libre 3 in Europe, when can we think about -- the right quarter to think about sort of stepping on the gas with Libre 3? Is it this quarter? Is it next quarter? And then just more broadly, Robert, I mean, given the investment spending this year on direct-to-consumer and where that platform would go over time, just maybe help us understand what investors may not be appreciating about where that platform can go over a multiyear basis. So when is the push in Europe? And where can that platform go with investment? Robert Ford : Sure. Sure. So Libre gets pushed down to like fourth or fifth question. But it's still top of our priorities here because it's such a huge opportunity for us. We had a real strong quarter in Q4. We exited with a lot of momentum going into this year, especially in the U.S. I think global sales were $0.75 billion, up 35%. And I expect the absolute dollar amount to get bigger. And usually when that happens, we think, well, gee, law of big numbers, right, the percentages are going to go down. And I don't think so. I think that we're going to see continuing growth rate expansion on our Libre business here. So I kind of look at Libre as a 2021 growth that should start at 40% and go from there. A lot of focus on the U.S. on the rollout -- on Libre 2 rollout. We're seeing a lot of the trend shifts, whether it's revenue, whether it's new users. I think the superior accuracy messaging here is definitely coming through, and it's got all the other advantages of our value proposition. I think one of the good things about the pharmacy channel is that there's a lot of available data. There's a lot of available third-party audited data. And when I do the reviews with the team, we spend a lot of time looking at them. And it tells me you can't hide behind these -- you can't hide when we're in the pharmacy, like all this data is available. And I think it's done really well in the U.S. Obviously, I want it to do better, but I can't look at it and not be objective that there's obviously been a trend shift here, whether it's NBRxs, TRxs, refill rates, et cetera. One of them that I'm extremely happy to see is the Rx fulfillment rate. So when a consumer goes to the pharmacy with a prescription, swipes the card, do they get that prescription filled, right? And there's factors that drive somebody to not get it filled. It's usually a copay. And what we've seen with the Libre Rx fulfillment rate is that about 9 out of 10 get filled. And you compare that to our competitor at about 6 out of 10, I think the value proposition here is really strong, meaning that we can invest in DTC advertising. We can invest more in this platform. And we're seeing the value proposition come through as it relates to Rx fulfillment rates. So I'd say the focus on U.S. is., now to your question on L3, we're already here. We've been working through, say, the reimbursement contracting process. It probably got delayed a little bit in Q4 in terms of our expectations, given some of the focus of a lot of the international countries focusing on COVID. But we're all ready. Manufacturing is ready. In fact, between Libre 2 and Libre 3, we've got hundreds of millions of sensors here of capacity. And I think that ties a little bit to the expectation that we have for this segment, which is you've got close to 80 million people that could benefit from this target, which is why we took a very different approach in our strategy, a much mass-market approach that develop a product that's consumer-friendly, intuitive, make sure that it can provide measurable benefits and price it for mass adoption. And that's working out very well. So we should see a Libre 3 launch international in Q1. And then in the U.S., we'll issue a release when we get approval. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Congrats on a really nice year. So 2 for me. One, just on kind of how you see the recovery playing out in 2021 and one on the P&L. So Robert, how do you see the year playing out for devices, ex Libre and Diagnostics ex COVID testing in terms of the recovery? Q1 starts to be an easier comp because we started to see the COVID impact last year in the first quarter. And do you see the second half of this year as more normalized? Then I have one follow-up. Robert Ford : Yes, sure. So on the device side, as I said in the earlier comments here, Larry, I think we're going to -- we're looking at what we saw in Q3 and correlating those -- that drop in rates. Not an absolute drop, so not trying to mirror the absolute number of hospitalizations, but at least the rate of decline of hospitalizations and tying it into the increase in the procedures. A lot of these procedures are lifesaving. Some of them are electives, some of them are lifesaving. And we're hearing a lot of our accounts in the U.S. and international are really wanting to kind of push stronger and a sense here that with a vaccine, they feel more confident to be able to build it. So I think you'll see probably the biggest comp issue, I'd say, is probably Q2. I mean I think that's when we saw the big drop. Q1 was probably more towards the end of the quarter, the last 2 weeks of March. So I kind of see the more normalization growth rates. So that -- those kind of growth rates that you saw from our device business, excluding diabetes, to look more like that in -- starting in Q3. But we'll have a nice build, I think, to there as the year progresses. Larry Biegelsen : And then on the P&L, Bob, you gave some helpful color on some of the below-the-line items. But the testing revenue is it comes at a pretty high margin, I believe. How should we be thinking about gross margin and operating margin in '21 relative to 2020? Robert Funck : Yes. Certainly. So our gross margin on our testing business is pretty similar to kind of the base business, maybe a touch higher than that. We saw steady improvement in the fourth quarter on gross margin from the prior quarter. It was up about 100 basis points. And we saw that kind of steady improvement coming out of the second quarter, where we saw the impact of the decline in kind of the Medical Device area. And so third quarter, fourth quarter is getting improvement. And we would expect that to continue, to go steadily up as we see recovery in those base businesses. We see more normalization kind of coming through our manufacturing plants as well as that volume kind of normalizes. In the fourth quarter, you did also see the impact of some of the investments that we're making in that capacity that Robert talked about. And so that was a bit of an offset that you saw kind of come through in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : I want to focus on 2 things. EPD saw a really nice recovery in the fourth quarter, but not as strong as it's been the last couple of years. How do you think about that recovering over time? And then the second question is a bit of a big picture question. We're talking a lot with investors about sort of a whole new world in how health care is being delivered, and I would think you would be one of the closest to seeing how the pandemic has changed delivery. Robert Ford : Sure. So on EPD, yes, we did see a nice recovery. I mean when we looked at how the impact of COVID progressed geographically, we saw it, for some reason, kind of trail a little bit kind of the developed markets, whether it was Europe and the U.S. We really started to feel the impact on our EPD business, which is, as you know, mostly emerging markets, started to see it coming out of Q2 and then big in Q3 as a lot of those countries kind of shut down. And the way the model works is you still need a prescription and you need your physician or you need to go to your hospital to get that prescription. So when we looked at Q4, we're actually not surprised, but it was good to see that it came in a little bit higher than what we had expected because we were trying to model it very similar to what we saw in some of the other businesses. And it came back faster. At the same time, there's -- it's not a nice kind of linear forecast in these markets. And there's -- it does tend to bounce up around. I mean, we had a 9%, 10% growth in Q1. There was some stocking effect there in kind of February and March in some of the markets, so we'll have a comp over there. But what I -- what we look at is we're looking at the IMS demand market progression in all these markets that we're competing in. And we're seeing a nice recovery. So I expect that just to sequentially kind of get better, and I guess similar to the comment on devices, get back to that high single-digit growth rate towards second half. Oh, and then you also had a question on change of care. I mean I think a lot has happened, right? And we've tried to focus on the areas that we feel that we can contribute and benefit. One of them I've talked about is this decentralization of testing and how the pandemic has accelerated that decentralization for us. We believed in it. We believe that we could drive it and create a whole new testing channel when we did the Alere acquisition. And this has kind of brought it forward about -- probably about 2 years in terms of where we are today versus where we thought we're going to be. So that's an important part for us. Being able to have access to fast, affordable and digitally connected testing is something that I think is going to be here and here to stay. Whether it's a COVID test or other tests, I think that is a change a little bit in the delivery, at least on the diagnostic side. And then the other side that I'd say is one that we've been working on for quite some bit is the connectivity of our devices and the intersection of digital and health care and how those devices are being connected. You've seen what we've done across all of our portfolio on devices, and we'll continue to position our products in such a way where we can develop them and take advantage of that. For Neuromodulation, we've just announced here a very interesting platform, which I think is going to have a significant impact on how that business and business model works with a much more connected care platform, where patients get to report their outcomes and eventually get to remote programming, which is a huge change in that business model. So I'd say the COVID testing, accelerating decentralization of testing and connected care are probably the 2 pandemic-driven changes that we're focusing on taking advantage of. Operator : And our last question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Vijay Kumar : I'll try to ask both of mine in one question. I guess, Robert, your PCR plus antigen test, can they detect these new variants, especially the South African variant? Is there a difference one versus the other, PCR versus an antigen? And when you look at the total revenue contribution, my follow-up was the $6.5 billion to $7 billion-ish of COVID revenues in fiscal '21. What would be a reasonable baseline modeling assumptions when I look at fiscal '22? Is that a 50% drop-off, 75% drop-off? I'm curious how you guys are thinking about it. Robert Ford : Yes. I guess on the modeling thing, listen, you could say there could be a drop-off, but you could say there could be an increase or it could stay. So I think the modeling piece here is a little bit difficult. I think we're going to have a lot more understanding as we get towards the summer. But I think, at least for the first half, you've got -- we've got sufficient capacity here to kind of explore the demand that exists both in the U.S. and globally. So yes, I'm not sure right now that you can kind of easily kind of just put that model down like that, but it's just too soon. Regarding your question on mutations and the impact there, a lot of the mutations here -- I don't want to get too wonky here. But we've been looking at this, Vijay, since the beginning. We have a group of, we call them the virus hunters. They're constantly looking and studying and getting their hands on samples to be able to kind of, not only test our existing products but even to develop new ones. And I'd say, right now, the mutations are happening. The ones that you've referenced, the South African one and the U.K. one, those are happening on what we would call the spike protein or what we call the S protein. The rapid antigen test that we have are actually targeting the nucleocapsid protein, what we call the N protein. So in silico analysis says no impact. The U.K. NIH kind of did a study on Panbio and found the U.K. variant to not influence the sensitivity of the Panbio, but we're also collecting as many samples as we can from U.K., South Africa, Brazil, et cetera, and making sure that we're constantly studying that to ensure that there's no change to the sensitivity of the test that we've developed. On the molecular side, whether it's ID NOW -- ID NOW looks at a different gene, the RPDP genes. It's completely different thing, and similar thing also with the PCR. So I think those are, right now, from everything we know, wouldn't be impacted by the mutations. We're more focused on the antigen with the mutations on those protein sequences. So I feel good about that right now. But obviously, we're constantly vigilant here. So let me just close here. I'd say we had a real strong 2020, very strong performance, almost 10% top line growth, 13% EPS. We're forecasting 2021 here at least $5. And like I said, I think we've got opportunity to have upside to that. But still already at $5, it's already at a 37% increase. And in that $5, we're also making a lot of investments in R&D to be able to sustain our growth going forward. So we feel confident about maintaining our double digit in 2022. Significant portion of our COVID testing, we believe, is sustainable. We've made investments or have a plan here to lay out investments in our base business that I think will accelerate our growth rate. And in some of the questions here, we've got a strong balance sheet here. So you combine those 3 elements here, I think we've got not only a strong '21 forecast but a pretty good line of sight here in terms of delivering double digits for 2022. So thanks. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2021.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported the results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.32, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 33% on an organic basis in the quarter. At the start of the year, we issued full year guidance that reflected another year of strong performance, and through the first quarter, we're right on track with those expectations. Our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $5 remains unchanged and reflects over 35% growth compared to last year. Our strong first quarter were comprised of several factors, including global COVID testing-related sales of $2.2 billion, with rapid tests compromising roughly 85% of those sales; strong sales growth across all 4 of our major business areas, which resulted in base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, of nearly 6%; growth contributions and momentum from several recently launched products across all of our businesses; and the impact of significant investments we're making across our portfolio in R&D and commercial initiatives that will further strengthen our sustainable growth profile. I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased nearly 6.5% in the quarter. Performance was led by our Adult Nutrition business, with sales growth of more than 18% in the quarter. The pandemic has brought a lot of awareness to the value of good nutrition, including immune support, which is helping to bring new users into the category and more specifically to our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. Pediatric Nutrition sales declined 2.5% in the quarter. Recall, during the first quarter of last year, this business experienced significant pantry stocking ahead of the shelter-in-place restrictions in several countries at the start of the global pandemic. Our sales growth this quarter in Pediatric Nutrition reflects that difficult year-over-year comparison. In the U.S. and several international markets, we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands. In Diagnostics, sales increased 115%, which was led by significant demand for our portfolio of COVID-19 tests as well as improvement in the base business. As I mentioned earlier, strong COVID testing-related sales were led by our rapid point-of-care platforms, ID NOW, BinaxNOW and Panbio, as we continue to see demand shift towards rapid testing worldwide. During the quarter, BinaxNOW received U.S. Emergency Use Authorization for over-the-counter, nonprescription, self-use for people with or without symptoms. We began shipping test kits to major retailers yesterday. Just as importantly, our underlying base business continues to improve, driven by improving routine diagnostic testing levels and the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, our Core Lab and Molecular Diagnostic businesses both achieved double-digit sales growth in the quarter. Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew over 6% in the quarter, which is particularly strong given the comparison versus a strong first quarter last year. Performance in the quarter was led by double-digit sales growth in India, China and Brazil. And while we continue to see elevated COVID case levels across several emerging markets, the business is executing at a high level to ensure patients have access to our branded generic medicines. And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 9% in the quarter, led by strong growth in Structural Heart, Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology and Diabetes Care. Although procedure volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were impacted early in the year by elevated [ coast ] case rates in certain countries including the U.S., we saw growth improve throughout the quarter and exited with good momentum. On average in March, U.S. procedure levels were up mid-single digits compared to pre-COVID baselines across our cardiovascular business with some areas even higher. In Structural Heart, sales were up mid-teens overall with growth contributions coming from several products within our innovative portfolio, including MitraClip, TriClip, Portico and others. MitraClip sales grew more than 15% in the U.S., where we achieved our highest number of monthly procedures ever in the month of March. In January, CMS expanded reimbursement covered for MitraClip, which significantly increases the number of people who can benefit from this market-leading device. And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where growth was led by Freestyle Libre sales of nearly $830 million. The global user base for Libre has now surpassed 3 million users, driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world. So in summary, we're off to a very strong start and right on track with our expectations for the year. All 4 of our major businesses are achieving strong growth. We're particularly pleased with the growth contributions and momentum of several recently launched products. And we're well positioned to achieve more than 35% EPS growth, as we have forecasted at the beginning of the year. I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 32.9%, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with strong global COVID testing-related sales. Organic sales growth was balanced, with 34% growth in the U.S. and 32% growth internationally. COVID testing-related sales were also balanced geographically, with a little more than half of those sales coming from international markets. Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly less favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 4% on our second quarter reported sales and would now expect exchange to have a favorable impact of nearly 2% on our full year 2021 sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the first quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.1% of sales. As Robert mentioned, the strength of our business performance has created an opportunity to significantly increase our investments in R&D and SG&A to further strengthen our pipeline and growth initiatives. During the first quarter, our combined investments in these areas increased approximately $200 million compared to the same quarter last year and was at the highest level since our separation with AbbVie. For the first quarter, net interest expense was $124 million. Nonoperating income was $73 million. And our adjusted tax rate was 15%, which is consistent with our full year effective tax rate from last year. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Congratulations on the strong Q1 revenue and profit growth. I don't think I can recall the last time the company put up 100% earnings growth, so impressive there. I guess I'd love to hear your thoughts on 2 important topics, Robert, if you don't mind, and that the first topic is BinaxNOW OTC. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about capacity and your early thoughts on how you think demand will play out for that product. So that's the first topic. And then I'll just go ahead and list the second one in the interest of time. The second topic is a little bit longer-term oriented, because last quarter you expressed some confidence in Abbott's ability to drive double-digit earnings growth in 2022 off of that $5 number for this year. And the question I would have is, based on what you're seeing today, has anything changed with your views? And then I think investors would also love to hear, if you assume a more conservative testing scenario, how does that impact that goal of double-digit earnings growth next year? So I just wanted to list this all upfront there. Robert Ford : Okay, thanks. On your first question regarding kind of the U.S. Binax OTC launch, so yes, we're very excited about that. We see this is a as a significant opportunity, and quite frankly, a trend that's been happening overseas and is kind of now happening here in the U.S., which is this move, this accelerated move here from, say, more hospital lab-based testing to more rapid testing outside of that environment, where consumers and people can get the results at a much faster rate, and quite frankly, with a little bit less hassle, less process. So we see this as a significant opportunity. It's easy and it's affordable. And I think that's a key part here, Bob, as we think about surveillance testing and serial testing. It needs to contemplate those 2 areas, right? It needs to be affordable. It's difficult to do serial testing on PCR when you've got a cost of $100-plus and takes between 2 to 3 days to get that. So I think we're in a great opportunity here to be able to capitalize on that. I think this is something that people are going to want to buy and have in their homes and stock up in their homes. Think of it as maybe your new element in your medicine cabinet. But we've been seeing this shift happen towards the end of last year and definitely into this quarter here, this move towards rapid. Specifically in the U.S., we've got a great position as a lot of this OTC is going to require understanding of the retail and the retail environment, the retail channel. And those are capabilities that, as you know through our Nutrition business, through our Diabetes business, we know how to operate and operate pretty well in there. So we're excited, and I think this is going to eliminate a lot of the barriers that exist for frequent testing. A key aspect of that is obviously scale. We have to have scale to be able to meet the demand. And quite frankly, we're probably the leaders here in terms of production. We've got an established capacity this quarter now, that we can do about 150 million rapid tests per month across all of our different platforms. So we feel very good about that position. We feel good about this opportunity. To your second question on 2022, yes, we did -- you did mention our confidence back in January, and we commented it on our call. And to be honest, nothing's changed on that front. Nothing's changed over the last 90 days. We start our planning process every year. We target double-digit growth. And we talked about some of the key elements and laid out some of the key elements that allowed us to have that confidence to be able to drive that double digit in 2022, whether it's the pace of recovery of our base business, COVID testing, new product launches, investment spend, et cetera. None of that has changed. I mean if you look at the pace of our recovery on our base business, that's done very well. Cardio and neuro finished the quarter very strong. We grew double digits, as I said in my prepared remarks, in Core Lab and Molecular Diagnostics excluding COVID. Libre is growing rapidly. Nutrition and EPD are accelerating their growth rates with pipeline and a market that supports that sustained growth. We've got momentum with a lot of our product launches : MitraClip G4, TriClip, I'd say our mapping systems, our new CRM devices. And then we've got coming out of this year going into next year, 4 key product launches that we feel very good about. We're very excited about them, given our position, given the product offering and the value proposition of them. And you know those are LAA -- entering the LAA market here in the U.S., potential expansion of indication for CardioMEMS, entering the leadless pacemaker with single chamber and then follow that with a dual chamber, entering the U.S. TAVR market. I mean all 4 of those opportunities are multibillion-dollar segments. And we've been working hard on the last, call it, 18 months to get us ready and to be in a position in 2022 to be able to capitalize on that. So the underlying base business, the pipeline, all of that is kind of heading in the right direction and don't see any changes. If anything, there's acceleration to kind of what we talked about 90 days ago. And we continue to believe a good portion of the COVID testing is sustainable. There's, as I said, there's a clear trend here to move towards rapid formats. We're the dominant producer here of these rapid tests, making about 150 million a month. So wherever that market goes, we know that we'll be the share leader here for sure. So you look at all these different components here, Bob, we still feel very confident about our double digit. The one thing I'll say is that as you look at all these different businesses, probably one thing that we can try and model now but it will probably be different, January is just how the mix of those businesses are going to contribute to that double-digit growth. It always ends up differently in terms of how we plan. We did double digit in '20, and it was very different versus how we set it up in January of 2020. So if you look at our history, we're pretty consistent about delivering on that. If there's any caution here, I guess, for next year, it'd already be -- seem to be priced here into our P/E. So -- but that being said, I don't think anything has changed here from the last 90 days from our perspective. We still feel very good about our double digit. Robert Hopkins : That's great. And then just if it was a more conservative testing environment, how does that impact the way you think about things? Robert Ford : I mean that's -- I guess that's the model here where we start to model different ways, different parts of all these elements that I explained to you, and it's going to be difficult. I'm not going to put out an assumption there of what COVID testing level is required, but I do feel that a good portion of it is going to be sustainable. And we'll get a lot of the share of the COVID testing that's remained. So... Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Great. And I'll echo Bob's congratulations on a very nice quarter. Maybe just to follow up, Robert, I'd love to get a sense. One of the key investor topics, as you just touched on, is the double-digit target for EPS growth next year. And part of that, it looks like you're front-loading a lot of expenses into 2021 here. You grew OpEx about $300 million versus last year. So I'd love to see if I could just get a little more meat on the bones in terms of the road map to that double-digit EPS, more down the P&L versus the top line, which you just talked about? And does it imply sort of high 20s operating margins to get there? Robert Ford : On the high 20s operating margin, yes, that does appear to be the case. Regarding the areas of investment. I mean I talked a lot about these in terms of the investments we're making. I'd say from a bigger picture perspective, we want to make sure that we're spending and investing a good portion of these COVID testing profits into the R&D portion of the P&L. We believe that is a very sustainable investment. And if I look across all of the businesses, in devices, in diagnostics, in rapid diagnostics, in nutrition, all of these businesses have opportunities to invest in R&D. And we've got clear programs across all of them to build the R&D programs that will sustain our growth beyond '22, '23, '24. A lot of the products that I just mentioned, whether it's the ones we've just launched over the last kind of quarter, 2 or 3 quarters, plus the 4 key areas that we're looking at entering in 2022, those are going to drive a lot of our revenue growth. And those have already been funded, but I would say the investments here are really looking into next-generation products in Diagnostics, expansion in our portfolio and devices that will lead to new product launches in '23 and '24. On the SG&A side, we're making sure that we're supporting our big growth products. I'd say probably a lot of the SG&A is going towards Libre and driving Libre awareness and growth, both in the U.S. and international markets. And you'll start to see that ramp up even more as we go throughout the year, both in terms of spend and the return on the top line. We're making investments also in Nutrition to strengthen our brand and capitalize on the expansion, especially in the adult nutrition side of the market. And expanding footprint in several of our device businesses where we know that clinical specialists and sales force, et cetera, is important to be able to support not only the expansion of our current products, but the launch of new products. Robert Marcus : Great, really helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. We're all really interested to hear not just about how the devices business did in first quarter, but really the forward commentary on what you're seeing exiting March into April here. So if you have any early feedback on the exit rates and what you're expecting in terms of catch-up, that would be really helpful. Robert Ford : Yes. I mean I think as I said in my prepared comments and on the first question, too, I mean we saw a nice recovery. Obviously, there was obviously some -- a little bit of a slowdown in January. So we had a nice pickup, I'd say, in October, November where -- sorry, yes October, November, where we saw procedure growth rates return to growth. And I'd say December, January saw that decline as the cases increased, but saw real nice progression in the month of February and then very strong growth in March. And Rob, what we try to do also is we try to look at there's -- March is a tricky month because you've got those 2 weeks of last year where things kind of really kind of shut down. So we look at March not only versus last year, but also looking at it versus March of 2019, and quite frankly, the whole quarter versus 2019. And we actually see growth rates in this quarter that are higher than our pre-pandemic rates in 2019, in Q1 of 2019. So I think we saw a real nice growth. In Core Lab, that was very positive to see. We saw double-digit growth there, and that's a good indicator of routine testing coming back to hospitals, saw double digit there. Our Molecular Diagnostic business, excluding COVID and PCR COVID testing, was up 30%. So that's a real positive sign that our strategy of utilizing the Alinity M to launch into the market with COVID and then kind of build off the menu is also having a positive impact over there, too. So I'd say very good exit rate. And as we look at the first 2 weeks of April, and we look at it every week here, real nice progression. So I didn't see the bolus coming in and then the drop. I actually saw continued nice improvement in Structural Heart, in EP and even in CRM. So those are -- that's a nice trend as we're going into the second quarter, too. And we'll start to see a little bit of opening up here in Europe. I'd say the one area that was a little bit softer for us was Europe, given all the shutdowns there. But again, I'd say the first couple of weeks in Europe are looking pretty good. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Robert, one for me on capital allocation; and one on your favorite topic, I think, Libre. So a lot of questions around 2022. And my question is, how important is it to hit that double-digit EPS growth target in 2022? And your thoughts around capital allocation helping you achieve the $5.50 in EPS, is it a buyback or an accretive deal, something you would consider to get there? And I have one follow-up on Libre. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, we start every year, as I said, targeting double digit. If you look at where we are in 2021 versus 2019, we're up 53%. But we'll be targeting, as I said, double-digit in 2022. And again, there's multiple ways of how we can get there in terms of business mix, et cetera. We do have a strong balance sheet, and that provides us a lot of strategic flexibility. We try to have a balanced approach there, Larry, in terms of balancing between the short and long-term investing in the business and providing some of that return back to our shareholders. So whether it's in the form of dividend, we're committed to a strong growing dividend. It's an important part of our identity. On the share repurchasing, we've historically just really looked at share repurchasing to offset some of the dilution. We could be looking to do a little bit more than that going -- in this year, going into next year. And then from an M&A perspective, I'd say we're always actively monitoring. We're always actively looking. And you'll always hear me say that I'm not going to tip my hand and give up any kind of competitive advantage there. But if there's something that is attractive, something that has got growth, that won't dilute our top line growth profile, which I think is best in class, or that we can do better with, we're always going to be interested. But we're always going to be prudent about deploying our cash, Larry, always keeping our shareholders happy, balancing the long term, the short term, the internal and the external. And this is not a kind of a new CEO versus prior CEO philosophy. This has always been an Abbott philosophy. We're good stewards of that capital and good stewards of finding that right balance that I just described. Larry Biegelsen : That's very helpful. And then Libre, how should we think about the growth for the remainder of the year? The comps get a little easier. You talked about 40% as an aspirational goal on the last call. And just what's the latest on the Libre 3 launch in Europe? And if you'll give us any color on the U.S., it would be certainly appreciated, but I'm not sure we'll get it today. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, I did put out a goal of growing 40% in 2021. You mentioned comparison. Yes, there was a little bit of a -- you've got a little bit of a balance here between Q1 and Q2. So Q1 last year, we saw some stocking up in international and in the U.S. So I look at our 30% here and -- on top of a pretty strong quarter last year as really positive momentum. We'll have some effect on the reverse side of that in Q2. So then it becomes really a second half, can we kind of sustain this kind of mid-30s and accelerate it into the 40s in the second half? And the answer is we believe so. We've got a great portfolio. We've got great momentum and making the investments, whether it's field force, whether it's direct-to-consumer advertising, not just in the U.S., but around the world, significant investments to building awareness for the category. I mean we've achieved 3 million -- surpassed 3 million users around the world. That's 3 -- we could say, hey, that's 3x our next competitor, but the reality is the penetration for us and for the categories is still pretty significant. So there's plenty of room here for us to invest and grow, and we'll be doing that on the back of our -- not only our commercial investments, but also R&D. Your question on Libre 3, that's -- we launched that into Europe at the end of this quarter. We're right where we want to be. We start off usually small and focused here, Larry. We learn. We learn with the consumer. We learn with the HCP in terms of what resonates. We learn with our manufacturing. We've got a lot of capabilities in terms of how to manufacture at scale. But there's always a little bit of a learning curve here. It is a new platform. And we learn with insurance, and insurance switches over and all those things. And once we get all of that kind of lined up, then we accelerate and we go break it. But I've got -- we've got a lot of strategic flexibility here with Libre 2 and Libre 3. I think we're in a great position. Feedback has been really good. I mean we've launched this with about over 1,000 HCPs. We've got close to a couple of hundred patients that we've now kind of just tried to see what their reactions are with the products, and it's been extremely positive. There's a lot of social media there. I'm not very fluent in German, but I can tell a facial expression of awesomeness and coolness and amazement factor, and you can see those in the videos of these patients that are using it. So I think this is going to set a whole new standard for us on every dimension : size, ease of use, accuracy, alarm performance, wear experience, all that. It's all great. It's all good. So regarding your question on Libre time frame, I think you answered it. So that's good. I'm not going to provide any details here. But I'm just really excited about Libre 3 and the combination of the portfolio, having both 2 and 3. I just think it provides us a lot of strategic flexibility. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on the [ printing ]. Robert, I did want to ask you on fiscal '21. If I look at Q1, excluding contribution from COVID, right, the base business looks like it was up 10% organic versus pre-pandemic in the '19 levels. One, is that math correct? And if we're starting off at 10%, I guess, are we looking at perhaps teens kind of growth for fiscal '21 on the top line on the base business? Robert Funck : Vijay, this is Bob. Yes, your math is spot-on. Our first quarter was up over 2019 and by around 10%. So we had really good performance in the quarter in the base business, and you really saw that across kind of the portfolio of businesses. And then we would expect to continue to see strong growth during the course of the rest of the year, in particular as medical device procedures continue to improve. And we would expect to see kind of that base business growth in the mid-teens. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, guys. And then one on the antigen testing side, I saw the press release yesterday launching the asymptomatic consumer version of the product. What -- I guess how are revenues recognized? Is this recognized on shipment? And what are early -- what is early demand looking like from retailers, the CVS and Walgreens, Walmart? And is there expectation of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for fiscal '21? Is that unchanged? Robert Ford : Yes. So on the $6.5 billion to $7 billion, yes, that remains unchanged. It's difficult to forecast here in that tight range that you'd expect from Abbott. But yes, we continue to forecast sales at around that level. Regarding your question, I think it was regarding the Binax OTC in the U.S., correct? Is that what you're referring to? Vijay Kumar : Correct. Robert Ford : Yes. So yes, I mean we received approval for the product several weeks ago, and we immediately started our manufacturing process. It is a different presentation from the previous Binax test in which we provide 2 tests and the necessary consumables to run those tests. So we started manufacturing that and began shipping literally yesterday to retailers. And we'll start with CVS, Walgreens, Walmart. And you can expect all the other retailers, food merchants, et cetera, to roll into that as we expand and start manufacturing and accelerating our manufacturing. So yes, we ship the product and the revenue is booked when the asset is transferred over to the retailer. But I think this is going to be, as I said, a great opportunity. It's a channel we know very well. I think few diagnostic companies that have this product have the capacity, the manufacturing scale and the channel experience and domain here to kind of really compete. So we feel very good about our position. And we'll start -- we start off with initial stocking orders. And then from them, we'll roll out more distribution. And we expect, given the price point here, Vijay, that there's going to be a great opportunity for a lot of households in the U.S. to be able to have testing on hand, ready to go at their house. So we expect that there'll be a nice repeat purchase also. Vijay Kumar : Yes, I'm planning on stocking up, Robert. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : Just a quick question for me, if I could, is just on some of the pipeline opportunities around Amulet and CardioMEMS in Portugal, if you could provide us with maybe an update on those programs. And secondly, on just the progression of MitraClip, this has been a device and procedure that was a little bit more impacted by the slowdown over the winter. And just love to get a sense of what the trajectory looks like now heading into Q2. Robert Ford : So a couple there. So on the Amulet side, yes, listen, we've got experience in this category outside of the United States and the international markets, and the product does very well. We filed with the FDA late last year. We think this is a very attractive market. It's approaching about $1 billion today, and it's growing double digits. And as I said, I think Amulet is a very competitive product in its current form. We're obviously -- we'll obviously be investing as part of some of those R&D investments I mentioned in next generations there also. But even in its current format, performs very well, and we've got a great experience in Europe. We believe a lot in this market in this segment. And so we've also initiated our CATALYST trial. So we started a new trial late last year, and this is a trial comparing Amulet to NOAC drugs, which is currently the standard treatment option for people with AF that -- or at risk of a stroke. So we think that this will be a significant kind of growth driver after we launch also. Results there will take a little bit longer to divulge those, probably in the 2023 time frame. But it just shows our commitment to this segment because we believe we've got a great product, great product portfolio, a pipeline, and it's a great segment here. So I think you had another question on MitraClip. MitraClip did very well in the quarter. Obviously, it got impacted by COVID last year. It was on a great trajectory. It kind of got slowed down as obviously the ICU beds and hospitals moved towards treating COVID. But we had great growth in Q1. We're up in the mid-teens in the U.S. So that was good. As I said in my prepared comments, we had our highest number of procedures ever in the month of March. And that wasn't just catch-up because I've looked at the procedures in the first 2 weeks of April and they continue to move up. So that's very positive for us. And we're making our investments, not only on the pipeline side, new versions of MitraClip, but also more importantly in the market development, so really to expand the funnel of patients being treated, creating those patient referral networks with the cardiologists and our implanting centers. So that's done very well. And I think the NCD that got approved in January, opens up a significant opportunity for us with MitraClip. Remember, we're only about 5% to 6%, maybe 7% penetrated right now in the total available market here. And I think that we've got a lot of runway for growth in the mitral space. And I think you also had a question on CardioMEMS. We expect to file for a label expansion relatively soon. This would also significantly broaden the U.S. market opportunity. And we plan to pursue CMS reimbursement after we obtain that label expansion. This segment continues to grow. Our Q1 growth in CardioMEMS was north of 20%. And that market has started to recover also from the pandemic, and I like the position we have in them. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Matthew Taylor : So I wanted to go back to the idea of the double-digit growth and the investments that you're making this year. You called out R&D, and we've seen DTC has been stepping up. I think there's a lot of Libre commercials there now. I guess my question is, when you think about these investments and the sustainability, historically, we've thought about Abbott is driving 7% growth. That was your algorithm pre-COVID. Do you think that the investments could lead to more sustainable, higher post-COVID organic growth? And then how quickly can you toggle them up and down if the environment changes quickly to manage earnings? Robert Ford : Sure. So I'd say on the base business side, our identity, our target was really sustaining a 7% to 8% growth rate pre-COVID. And I'd say with these investments that we're making, excluding any kind of year-over-year comp, we'd probably be at the higher end of that 7% to 8% range, I mean, once you factor in maybe a Q1 comparison on the base business. Next year, you're probably growing a little bit higher than that, Matt. But at the high end of that 7% to 8% is what we're looking at, with all these investments and product development and portfolio development. As I said, a big portion of our COVID cash flows and profits, part of it goes to our shareholders, but part of it goes back into the business. And we've got a lot of flexibility here to toggle that investment up or down if we need to. I mean I'd probably say that each business has their list of go-to areas that we've all agreed to are kind of next steps. If we have more opportunity to invest in the business, we know exactly where to go. As it relates to toggling down, yes, I mean, I wouldn't be toggling down R&D. I think that's more of a sustainable kind of investment that sustains our growth rate. It's easier to toggle on SG&A, and we've got that capabilities also if we need to. Matthew Taylor : Great. And I just had a follow-up on Diagnostics. The underlying growth, as you called out in Core Lab and Molecular, was impressive. And I'm wondering if we're going to see you get increased momentum in the underlying business because of your success with COVID diagnostics. Do you think you can leverage that larger installed base and drive to higher growth in the core diagnostic business over time now? Robert Ford : Yes, I think the answer to that is yes. We've definitely been elevated to a kind of higher level of partnership here with a lot of hospitals and IDNs and institutions as it relates to their kind of COVID testing. There's been large set of accounts that we've historically been out of and now had the opportunity to place our instruments and show what we can do. So the answer to that is yes on the core lab for sure. You saw -- you're seeing a little bit of that strategy play out in the molecular side of the business, where we haven't seen these kind of growth rates in our molecular business, excluding COVID, in a very long time. And we were up close to 30%, excluding COVID testing. A lot of that has to do with the instruments that we're placing and getting the test pull-through on the other assays on the other tests. So on the rapid side, too, I wouldn't just look at it from a Core Lab perspective. The sustainability of COVID is one portion of it is the actual COVID test. The other portion of it is the installed base that we're placing as a result of that. I've talked a little bit about this building sustainability of a rapid testing channel beyond just COVID, and COVID is allowing us to do that. But if you think about, for example, our ID NOW instrument, where we basically ceded the market here for an opportunity to do much more in the world outside of COVID by placing these instruments, we had roughly about 19,000 boxes in the U.S. in 2019, and we're currently at 75,000 boxes. So we almost quadrupled our installed base there. And will they all be as productive from a COVID testing perspective at the highest level of the pandemic 1, 2 years out? No, probably not, but they'll be very productive with all of our other assays. And that installed base will continue to grow and will continue to produce for us. So to answer your question, yes, I do think this is a great opportunity here for us to continue to roll out our Alinity platform on the Core Lab, on the molecular side and continue to build our rapid testing channel in the rapids business. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : I'll just put them both upfront. Can you give us an idea of how you're thinking about revenue for the remainder of the year? Particularly I'm going to ask questions about COVID-19 diagnostic revenue in 2021. And then my second question has to do with the other areas of med tech that are starting to support or continue to support that high single-digit growth rate. Anything you can add color on a neuromod, vascular or CRM would be helpful. Robert Ford : Sure. So kind of growth rate in our diagnostic business, the way to think about it is, at least how we've modeled it, is we'll see our, let's call it, non-COVID diagnostic business continue to accelerate, continue to grow. Obviously, you'll have comps over there, Joanne, in Q2 and Q3. That will be producing some mid-teens kind of growth numbers in this business. But I think we always look at it, at least the way we're managing it here, is we're always looking at it on a 2-year CAGR. So if we can get back up to that kind of 10%, 11%, 12% growth rate that we were seeing in our Core Lab business that -- on a 2-year CAGR, that's basically our target to be able to get to those numbers. COVID testing, it's difficult to forecast right now. I can't give you an exact quarterly progression of that. I think the range that we've given last call, I'd continue to reiterate it. But it's going to be a little bit difficult here to get the exact calendarization, the exact mix, the exact geography right in terms of the COVID testing. What I will say though is that I do continue to believe that the shift from lab-based PCR will still play a role in COVID, but I think that the bigger role will be played by the rapid testing as it relates to surveillance. And as I said, I think we're well positioned there. I think you had -- your second question was regarding some of the other devices. I'd say, listen, I'm very pleased with CRM. I'm not saying that we've completely turned it around, but it's a great progression that we're seeing here. The launch of our ICDs and CRT-Ds with the Gallant brand with Bluetooth capability in Europe and U.S., all of the numbers show that we're picking up share, and that's the ultimate measure here. And I'm excited about the ability for us to enter the leadless segment in next year with our product and the capabilities that -- and the value proposition that, that product will bring versus competitive systems. So I think that's done very well. I'd say heart failure, one of the challenges there is probably -- that's probably the slowest part of the device portfolio to recover. A lot of those procedures require some ICU stays. So I think that one was one where we saw a little bit of impact to market. I'd say our share has started pretty high around the mid-80s, 85%. So that's mostly a market condition that we'll see come back. But I think that the CardioMEMS is another great opportunity for us where we saw growth in the quarter for 26%. So I don't know if I covered all the device areas that you wanted me to hit on. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : If you can hit on neuromod, that would be great. Robert Ford : Yes. So we did see a little bit of a slowdown in trials towards the end of the year and the beginning of the year, and we saw that start to pick up a little bit now. We think that we like our position. We recently launched our remote programming and monitoring system, the NeuroSphere. I think that's going to create a whole new opportunity for us in terms of business model, in terms of our ability to service the patients and the physicians better with that. So we started to roll it out in the U.S. I think it applies to both SCS and DBS, too. We've gotten great feedback on that. So I think that we'll see sequential improvement on our performance in neuro not only as we lap the comps, but also as the NeuroSphere gets widely used. And then we've got a nice pipeline of products to be launching towards the end of the year here. Operator : And our last question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to, Rob, just to ask about your commentary about the potential to pursue M&A to support, if need be, to support the double-digit earnings growth in 2022. And anything you can provide investors or analysts with in terms of the areas of focus? I mean should we be thinking that each business unit could receive some support with the acquisition? And then specifically on Medical Devices, just a follow-up to Joanne's question, should we be thinking about potential the bolstering heart failure, vascular, neuromod to some of the softer businesses here? I mean you have such a pipeline and had such success with internal development initiatives, is Medical Device an area where you can add? And then lastly, just on this Structural Heart business. I mean in the U.S., you're going to be adding Amulet and Portico in the near term. And just how are you thinking about that -- you mentioned a specialized sales force. Should we be thinking about individual sales teams for MitraClip, TAVR and left atrial appendage occlusion? And how could that all shape out? Robert Ford : Yes. So I think on the M&A side, you'll hear me say the same thing, which is I think it always starts off strategically. Does the business that we're looking at have a strategic fit to Abbott, both from a market position, from a financial standpoint? So we wouldn't be looking at anything that doesn't fit us strategically just to fill an EPS. We want businesses that we can grow, that we can obviously operate and can fit well into the company. So I think it always starts like that. It always starts with the strategic fit. And then if it's attractive, if the timing is right, then we'll look at it. I think all the areas that you mentioned are all areas that we look at. So we look at all those areas that you mentioned. We look at diagnostics. We look at all the areas we're always studying. And we're always paying attention to the new technologies, the new companies, et cetera. So I just won't tip my hand here and give anything away in terms of our competitive position here. So regarding your second question on sales forces, it always depends. But we tend to have a viewpoint here, Josh, where we believe that kind of focused and dedicated teams has always been best. That's kind of how we've run our businesses. It's how we've run our businesses for many, many decades. We don't try and bring things together that don't make sense just for the sake of synergies. If we believe we're in growth areas and growth businesses, then we'll fund them as growth business and growth areas. And quite frankly, all the businesses that you talked about in Structural Heart are areas of high potential growth. So we will treat them and resource them as such. So I'll just close here by saying we set guidance of at least $5, which is about 35% growth year-over-year. That's after a 13% growth in 2020. And we feel very good about our first quarter. We feel that our first quarter puts us on track to achieve those -- at least those $5. We have multiple ways to get there. The COVID market is going to move more and more towards rapid, and our position in this segment of COVID testing is unmatched with our capabilities, our scale, et cetera. And we believe a good portion of those tests, of that COVID testing market will remain at least into 2022. And I'm very pleased with the pace of recovery of our base business Abbott, or let's call it the non-COVID side of our business. And we're making investments in 2021, so we can accelerate our growth in 2022 and beyond, and we've talked about this also. So we feel very good about the position we're in today and the position we have this year and going into next year. Scott Leinenweber : Very good. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.  With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2021. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available at our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary for sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.17, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 35% on an organic basis in the quarter compared to last year. Given the significant negative impact COVID had on demand for elective medical procedures and routine diagnostic testing last year, comparing sales versus pre-pandemic levels of 2019 provides one of the more relevant measures of performance. On this comparison, excluding sales from our COVID testing business, organic sales grew nearly 11.5% in the second quarter, driven by strong sales growth across all 4 of our major businesses, including double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutrition and Medical Devices. I'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9.5% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by mid-teens growth in Adult Nutrition, including more than 20% growth internationally.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've seen 2 factors positively impact Adult Nutrition demand : new users are entering the category and existing customers have increased their usage. And as the global market leader, these dynamics are driving strong growth for our Ensure and Glucerna brands. In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew nearly 4.5% in the quarter, led by growth of nearly 9% in the U.S., where we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands. Sales of Pedialyte, our global rehydration brand, grew strong double digits, driven by recently launched new products and increased investments we're making in direct-to-consumer promotion. Turning to Diagnostics. Sales increased more than 55%, which includes $1.3 billion of COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying Diagnostics sales increased 37% compared to last year. Strong sales growth in our underlying Diagnostic business is being driven by improving routine diagnostic testing as health care systems continue to recover from the pandemic as well as the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, second quarter sales in Core Laboratory and Molecular Diagnostics grew mid-single digits compared to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2019. Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew nearly 15% in the quarter. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in India, China, Russia and Brazil, which led to overall sales growth of nearly 18.5% in our key emerging markets. While we continue to see COVID cases surge in several emerging markets, including the recent surge in India, our team is executing at a high level to meet market demand for our medicines.  And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 45% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 15.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Strong growth in the quarter was led by Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care, all of which grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2019. In Structural Heart, we achieved the highest number of MitraClip procedures ever in the second quarter, including a record number of procedures in the month of June. Now I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of more than $900 million. The global user base for Libre grew to approximately 3.5 million users, including approximately 1 million users in the U.S., driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world. So in summary, we're achieving strong growth across all 4 of our major businesses, particularly pleased with the strong momentum and growth contributions we're seeing from several recently launched products and investments we're making in our key growth platforms. And our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering a steady cadence of new products with more to come over the next several months. I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the full year in more detail. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 35% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 29% versus last year and nearly 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 4.5% on second quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 39.5% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.8% of sales. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.4%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.7%. The revised full year forecast is modestly lower than the estimate we provided in January due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged and  reflects strong double-digit growth compared to last year and approximately 35% growth at the midpoint compared to our pre-pandemic adjusted earnings per share in 2019. We continue to forecast $4 billion to $4.5 billion in COVID testing-related sales for the full year 2021. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 2% on our full year 2021 sales. Turning to the outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $0.90, which reflects continued strong growth and momentum in our core underlying business and a sequential step-down in COVID testing-related sales compared to the second quarter. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 1% on our third quarter reported sales. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : I'll keep my questions quick and high level. First, for Robert, I'm just curious on your view on the pace of the recovery in surgical procedures generally. Is it kind of continued throughout the quarter and into July? Or are you starting to see signs of the spread of variants could cause a little lumpiness in the pace of the recovery? Just wanted to get your views on how things are going. Robert Ford : Sure. Listen, we obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of recovery. I mean we had planned to see that recovery in the U.S. and in Europe and in certain Asian markets, and that recovery has largely played out the way we had anticipated. I'd say probably a little bit better even than what we thought. I don't think what we're seeing here with relating to like increase in COVID cases, I don't think that you'll see the same -- or at least we're not seeing the same kind of impact in terms of hospitals shutting procedures down, stopping testing, et cetera. I think it's a very different situation where we are this year versus where we are last year, even though if you look at the case, global case counts, they're pretty much in line to where we were in October last year. We've got therapeutics. We've got vaccines. We've got testing. So we're not seeing that. On the device side, listen, our business has done very well. Overall, as I said in my comments, we're up double digits, mid-teens versus the second quarter largely driven by EP, Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Diabetes, as I said. And actually, if you look at the cardiovascular-specific recovery, we exited the first quarter at about a 2% growth versus March of 2019. And then if you look at the second quarter, our June growth rate was around about 7% versus June of 2019. So we're seeing this kind of sequential recovery in the procedures as evidenced by our growth rates in our procedures. And we were looking at data yesterday, the first couple of weeks of July are showing that same trajectory, whether it's in the U.S. or whether it's outside the U.S., generally. Obviously, there are some markets that have different kind of trends and paces. But I'd say, overall, we're seeing that recovery. And that's how we're looking at the rest of the year, Bob, is that continued trajectory in terms of recovery in procedures and diagnostic testing. Robert Hopkins : Okay. That's really helpful. And then my second question for Bob. I'd love you to comment on 2 things, if okay. One, just you had a nice EPS beat relative to consensus and really relative to the way you guys just guiding the quarter. But you're leaving guidance the same. Just wanted to understand that dynamic. Why not boost the EPS a little bit? And then secondly, if you -- just curious if you think consensus estimates, as we look forward a little bit, are kind of reflecting the way you guys are viewing the world right now. And obviously, I'm specifically talking about next year. So any preliminary thoughts on whether consensus is sort of capturing the world as you see it? And wondering just about the EPS guidance for this year. Robert Funck : Yes. Bob, I'll take the first question on the guidance for this year. Clearly, about 1/3 of that beat was due to the little higher COVID sales than we have projected. Obviously, forecasting COVID is quite challenging. And so that was about 1/3 of beat. About 2/3 really was better performance in the base business versus how The Street had modeled that. And so the way we look at it, we gave a pretty wide range on earnings guidance back at the beginning of June. And that really kind of accounts for any kind of fluctuations or changes in the COVID testing in the back half of this year as well as kind of underlying base business performance. So we feel really comfortable about the range we have and feel that kind of captures different scenarios around COVID testing. Robert Ford : Bob, on the question of consensus for the rest of the year, I mean, I think this is how we're thinking about the second half of the year. Obviously, from a top line perspective, we're going to have to lap some of our COVID sales that we had in Q3 and Q4. Obviously, if you looked at last year, that was really the height of our ramp-up in COVID sales. But the underlying business, excluding COVID sales, will be getting sequentially better every quarter. So we're looking at our base underlying business growing low double digits for the rest of the year. From a gross margin perspective, we'll see expansion in gross margin versus where we were in Q2. There's obviously maybe some friction on some input costs, commodities, freight, et cetera, the team works hard to kind of offset those. So we'll see improvement also as the base business recovers and the margin profiles from that recovery expand. And we'll continue to make the ramp-up of investments that we talked about from an R&D and SG&A perspective. Some of those investments have a faster and more, I'd say, kind of more immediate return. So for example, direct-to-consumer advertising in Nutrition or Libre, for example, and some of those investments are a little bit more medium term, whether it's R&D programs or whether it's kind of getting ready for upcoming launches.  So the real, I'd say, kind of factor here becomes COVID testing. And we gave guidance about a month ago about $4 billion to $4.5 billion. After the 2 quarters, we're about $3 billion, $3.5 billion. So we've got between $0.5 billion and $1 billion to go in the next 6 months. And I think that's really the question here is how will testing play itself out in the next kind of second half year, whether it's variants, whether it's vaccination rates, et cetera. So that's just something that we're paying attention. And as Bob said, that's why our guidance range was pretty wide, which is really to account for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Great. Congrats on a good quarter. Bob, maybe to follow up on the last question. There's a lot of moving pieces down the P&L right now. You had a really good operating margin in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could update us on the latest on how you're thinking of reinvestment of COVID testing revenues, how that's flowing through the P&L. And if you have any preliminary thoughts on the impact or benefit it might add to next year as people think about their models now. Robert Funck : In terms of investment, Robbie, if you look at our SG&A and R&D combined, we're up around $700 million versus the prior year. And we expect to kind of sustain pretty strong investment in the base business. So we have, as you know, reinvested some of those COVID testing sale profits back into the base business to drive growth going forward. As you say, we had a really healthy operating margin profile in the second quarter. We're going to see some impact on that operating margin profile the rest of the year with the step-down in those COVID testing sales in the back half of this year. That's going to obviously have some impact on our operating margin profile while we sustain a lot of that investment, in particular, in the R&D and SG&A spaces to drive growth the rest of the year and into next year. Robert Marcus : Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up. We have some -- coming back to new product launches and clinical data sets. We have 2 interesting ones coming at ESC later in August with CardioMEMS and with Amulet. I was just hoping we could get the latest thoughts on approval timing, product launch potential and how we should think about near-term expectations for product launches, given the COVID environment is still impacting hospitals to a degree. Robert Ford : Sure. On Amulet, we talked about this, right, Robbie. We filed with the FDA late last year. We -- right now, we plan to present the data at ESC. So that's kind of in the late August time frame. We think it's, again, an attractive market, great opportunity for growth for us. The product is available in Europe and in those markets, albeit a smaller market than the U.S. We have a 50% market share. So we feel very good about our ability here to compete with the product we have. Regarding timing, it's one of those I can't give you an exact timing. It's definitely, we think, kind of in the second half. And then it's just going to depend in terms of impact this year versus next year. Obviously, the impact next year is larger. And that's just going to depend on when the approval hits this year. Obviously, if it's more towards the back end of the year, then we'll see less of an impact. If it's sooner, that will be an opportunity for us here to execute on that.  On CardioMEMS, I guess, similar. We think this is another great opportunity. I mean, both these products were products when we began the St. Jude integration, both of these products were trials that we really wanted to invest in and drive on the clinical evidence and driving the clinical evidence of these 2 products. So it's great to see we're in a position now to be able to kind of disclose and share the data from these trials that we put together. We filed our label expansion with the FDA on CardioMEMS this second quarter, more towards the end of the second quarter. And again, we think it's a great opportunity also. And probably in terms of an approval there, not really banking on that approval from a sales perspective this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on the strong print this morning. Robert, maybe one high-level question on the base business here. I think there are some confusion this morning. On the base ex COVID rate versus pre-pandemic 2019 levels, I think you did 11% in 2Q and that was maybe perhaps low double digits in Q1. So the question I think people are asking is, if we had sequential improvements, is 11% versus 10%, that seems a little light. But I think that kind of ignores the business mix. Maybe perhaps can you talk about what's happening to device business? What was the sequential acceleration? And what is baked in for the back half? Should we continue to see some benefit from backlog and further acceleration? Robert Ford : Sure. I mean I think the Med Device kind of grew again, Q2 versus 2021. That growth rate has been increasing and has been sequentially improving, as I said, in the first question. Obviously, the recovery is not uniform across all businesses. So if you look at our device portfolio, one of the parts of the portfolio that we've seen a little bit of a lagging recovery here has been in Neuromodulation, where I'd characterize that as a little bit even more elective than some of the other procedures. And we've seen, say, like a little bit of a slower recovery trend in that business versus, say, for example, a Structural Heart, an EP or a Diabetes business.  Similar to Diagnostics, our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, that's growing high single digits in the second quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, and that's an improvement versus where we were in Q1. One of the issues that we see in our Diagnostic businesses, we're seeing a slower recovery in kind of blood donations and that obviously impacts our transfusion business. So kind of similar to neuro on the diagnostic side, seen a little of a slower recovery. But I'd say those businesses that were more impacted by COVID in Q2 of last year, I'd say they've largely kind of recovered very well, very nicely, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. And then maybe one on the product side on CardioMEMS. We did some work. It looks like it's an interesting trial. It's a pretty large trial, I think, 3,600 patients enrolled, that's fairly large. I guess assuming some of these results, if they were to mimic CHAMPION or the original trial in terms of reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. I think mortality is an endpoint here. Should CardioMEMS be a multibillion-dollar product for Abbott? The reason I'm asking is historical adoption trends have been quite slow, but your investments in such a large trial suggests some optimism. So I'm curious how you guys are thinking about the longer-term opportunity. Robert Ford : Sure. I mean I think a lot of these device segments that we see kind of large opportunities. I think the key thing here is to make sure that you put the clinical evidence to be able to kind of create a strong kind of market development approach here. And when we looked at CardioMEMS at the time back in 2017, where there were some issues with reimbursement in CMS, ascertaining the max kind of worth reimbursing, et cetera. And you had positive CHAMPION's data.  I'm aware of some of the perceived shortcomings of that trial, but there is also plenty of real-world evidence showing similar benefits and similar results that you had observed in CHAMPION. So we looked at this and we believe that this was a significant opportunity in the cardiovascular space. We believe that monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure is a great indicator for prevention of acute heart failure and decided to make the investment in a larger trial to either address the perceived shortcomings of CHAMPION or -- and/or augment the data set. So I'm hesitant to put a number around here, Vijay. But I think the viewpoint here is that this is an opportunity as we're building our Heart Failure portfolio together with our LVAD portfolio and even with MitraClip, quite frankly, to really have a comprehensive suite of solutions for it. And I think this is going to be an opportunity that we will be intentional about investing, whether it's trial, whether it's clinical and field-based teams to drive it. We think the opportunity to expand the label to a Class II and Class IV presents a significant opportunity for us to expand the market and also the indication here to include CardioMEMS with elevated levels of BNP. So I think that this is a great opportunity. I guess your comment on mortality, I think that's important, but I also know, in talking to health systems, that hospitalization and reduction in hospitalization is still very important. Some can argue that maybe you're just kicking the can down the road. But I think that if you look at and have conversations with the health care systems, they'll see this as an important reduction. Any reduction of hospitalization for this patient population will be significantly important for them. So bottom line, yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us and we're being intentional about our investment and making the right clinical evidence to support the adoption so that we can get to numbers that you're referencing or even bigger. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Just 2 for me. I'll start with Libre, Robert. Just maybe at a high level, your thoughts on kind of the road map for Libre from here, given that you're closing in on $1 billion a quarter in sales. And more specifically, any update on the launch of Libre 3 in Europe and how delays at FDA might impact the timing of Libre 3 in the U.S. And I had one follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. Listen, we had a real strong quarter, as you saw, and as you mentioned, approaching that $1 billion mark on a quarterly perspective, sales above 40%. I think really important here, Larry, is the user base. And this is a different kind of device business. It's a -- we talked about it from a mass market opportunity versus other parts of our device portfolio that might be a little bit more, let's say, call it, nichey versus the size of Libre. But the user base is super important because when you've got this kind of retention level that we're seeing on the product, so between 80% and 90-plus percent globally, it really looks more like a subscription-like model. And when you're in that subscription-like model and you've got this recurring revenue, the user base is hugely important. And I think that's a lot of our focus right here, as we talked about this mass market, is building the user base. And I think we've done a really good job internationally and in the U.S. But as we've talked about, okay, we've got 3.5 million users. I've talked about numbers all the way up to 80 million users potential for this product once you aggregate insulin users and type 2s, et cetera. So I think this is a real strong growth opportunity for us, and we're still in the early innings, as I've said. From a road map perspective, we're not deviating from kind of how we thought about this, right, which is we will continue to provide superior technology, superior experience to the user, whether it's with the product, whether it's how they get the product and still a value proposition that makes sense for a mass adoption. So that's all gone very well, and that will continue to go very well. Libre 3, we launched it in, I'd say, in Germany at the beginning of the year here. A lot of our focus in that launch, Larry, was just more to understand kind of our marketing messaging, our positioning with our existing portfolio, reactions from physicians and even look at how other users from other CGMs kind of reacted to it. And it's basically surpassed my expectations as we went into that pilot launch. And so we'll be now transitioning to full launch mode of Libre 3, where we've got approval. Specifically in the U.S., obviously, it's understood that the backlog that exists in -- at the FDA regarding diabetes products. And I'm not going to comment on kind of timing here or expectations, but just that we're very excited kind of to be able to bring Libre 3 to the U.S. also and augment our portfolio with the product. Larry Biegelsen : That's helpful, Robert. And just lastly for me. I know I've asked about this on a few earnings calls, but I'm just curious how your thoughts on capital allocation are evolving, given your strong balance sheet. We know valuations are relatively high. Are there areas where you think valuations look more attractive? And historically, the sweet spot for Abbott's been acquisitions in the $5 billion to $10 billion range. Is that still the case? I mean, obviously, St. Jude was an exception to that, but just curious to see how your thoughts are evolving on M&A. Robert Ford : Well, specifically on M&A, there's no change in thoughts there. I mean I think rather than have a number tied to it, it's more about does it strategically fit? Do we think that we can execute and drive more value out of it? And that mindset hasn't changed independently of kind of dollar amount there. We're obviously actively looking. We constantly surveil and survey and pay attention and track. What I can say is that we've been probably actively moderating much more than where we were back in 2017. But there are some pretty elevated valuations right now, and I'm not going to do anything here that's going to either dilute our profiles, our growth rates, et cetera. And key driver here is, is it being strategic? I actually think a lot of opportunity we have from a capital allocation back to kind of how you started the question was we've got a lot of opportunity internally. A lot of great returns that we can have with our capital as we deploy them to support these opportunities that we have in our pipeline, specifically regarding kind of manufacturing, kind of ramp-up in capacity, whether it's Libre, whether it's MitraClip, seeing an opportunity here with Adult Nutrition as we've seen kind of several years here of strong kind of double-digit growth in Nutrition. So I think we've got a great opportunity to be able to provide a great return to our shareholders by looking at our internal opportunities also. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Matthew Taylor : So I did want to ask one about COVID testing. And we know your guidance for the year here implies lower sales in the last 2 quarters. I was wondering if you could just give us any insight into the trends that you're seeing in testing, especially outside of the U.S. where we have less visibility, so we can think about some of these different scenarios that you're baking into the guidance for the rest of the year. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, about a month ago, we talked a lot about COVID testing here. And I don't think, over the last 30 days, we've seen anything materially different. I would say we continue to see some of that kind of lowered kind of testing volumes in the U.S., whether it's PCR but probably a little bit more on the rapid side. We did a little bit better than what we had forecasted for the second quarter, and that was largely driven by international markets. Still about 80% of our sales are on the rapid side. But we did see higher international sales. And I'd say, yes, it's probably driven by delta variant. A lot of those international sales are more, let's say, kind of tender-driven. And we've got great visibility to where cases are rising and our positions in those markets.  As a company, our relationships, our understanding of how health authorities in those countries are thinking about their testing. And what I can say is we become -- we've definitely become a preferred supplier here because of our scale, our capacity, the quality of our products and our pricing. So the question here is going to be, even with surges, are you going to see testing increase? I think we will. I think we will see some of that. The question will be, geographically, where are we going to see it more? And I think geographically, we'll see more internationally than, at least what I think right now, than what we'll see in the United States from a back half perspective. Matthew Taylor : Got it. And maybe I could just ask one follow-up on recovery in Diagnostics versus med tech. So I know you called out this issue with blood donations. And I guess, excluding that, would you think about the recovery in your core diagnostics business, ex COVID, similar to med tech, should it go in lockstep? Or is there going to be a difference there for some reason? Could you flesh out the blood donation headwind? How much is that? Robert Ford : Yes. Like at a high level, I would say, yes, we're seeing kind of that same kind of recovery trend, again, within its own kind of segment. Our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, which represents about 80% of our core lab business, that actually was up high single digits in Q2 versus Q2 of 2019. So we are seeing that recovery on the core lab. There are some assays that haven't recovered as much. What we've seen here in the U.S. is that we're seeing post-surgery policies here from certain hospitals do less overnight stays. So when you're doing that, you're getting a little bit less of that. But I'd say that's offset with higher share gain and growth in new accounts with the rollout of Alinity. So we're seeing that kind of high single digit.  And as you mentioned, the issue is really kind of low donation, blood donations that are impacting our transfusion business, which we've got 65%, 60-plus percent market share. So we're hoping to see -- we've been working with different agencies here to kind of bring awareness to this fact here because, obviously, there's inventory of blood. But if this rate of donations continues, then it will be a challenge for the U.S. So hopefully, we'll start to see that recover here as we get towards the end of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : It's really 2 questions. The first one is a follow-up on what Bob was asking earlier on, is there anything that you can give us on 2022? I'm getting a lot of questions as it relates to margins, COVID, double-digit EPS. So anything on a framework basis that would be helpful. I'd appreciate it. Robert Ford : Sure. Listen, we've talked about this a couple of times on a couple of calls already, and I just think it's a little bit too early to kind of provide that forecast given there's so many different kind of moving parts. We're starting our process right now. But I don't think the framework changes versus what we've talked about, which is our underlying business, so excluding COVID testing, it will clearly be very well positioned for very strong growth, top line and bottom line just based on the trends that we're seeing, based on the pipeline, the new products that we have in the pipeline that we have in place. So our underlying base business will clearly be set up for very strong top and bottom line growth. We've obviously got to look at COVID testing, and that's a factor here. We talked about it last call. It'll be probably not very prudent here to assume a significant amount of COVID testing. Now if there's going to be demand of COVID testing, we've got plenty of capacity to meet it, and that's ultimately going to be kind of the factor here. As I said, we're going to start to kind of lap a little bit of this testing in Q3 and Q4 of this year. We've obviously had a real strong Q1 also. So that obviously has an impact. And then having to look at our spend and modulate our spend here, but in a way that doesn't detract from our kind of long-term sustainable kind of growth even past 2022, 2023. So we've got a lot of good momentum, a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity and I want to make sure that I capitalize on the positions and the opportunities that we've built upon. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : And then I've heard the word pipeline investment a couple of times there. Other than some of the names that we've -- or products that we've already focused on, such as Amulet, CardioMEMS and Libre 3, are there other products in the pipeline that you'd like to draw our attention to? Robert Ford : Yes, sure. Listen, if you look at Structural Heart, I think there's 2 kind of really good opportunities for us over here. TAVR with bringing the product to the U.S. and the launch of our second-generation product in Navitor in Europe. I mean these are 2 opportunities that we have. We know our position and we know the choices and the strategy that we'll take as we enter this market here in the U.S., and I think it's great. It will be a great opportunity for us. And then the second product on Structural Heart is our tricuspid repair system. It's a great opportunity. It's got a potential kind of billion-dollar market opportunity for it. We've done very well with it, actually. Right now, our sales have kind of annualized right now on a $100 million basis, and we launched this in the middle of pandemic last year. So I think that's a great near-term opportunity. And then on CRM, we've made the investment here to get our leadless program back on track here regarding a single chamber and then making the investment on a dual chamber. And I think that's another kind of big opportunity that we'll have to continue our kind of growth recovery in our CRM. So we're targeting to enter this market next year, again, with a single chamber and then build off there. So I think we've got great opportunity in the device space.  And then in the Diagnostics is the continuing of building the menu, the assays, the menu of assays. We're obviously making investments in our rapid business to capitalize on the  placements that we've made for ID NOW with COVID to be able to kind of not only drive flu, but other respiratory viruses that we think will be opportunity for us also. But I think those are probably more the near term, i.e., next kind of 12, 18 months and then a larger pipeline after that. Operator : And our last question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Robert, just wanted to ask a multipart question on just duopolies in the U.S. market. You're about to create one with the entrance at Amulet. And then down the line, you'll be in a different position as the first mover in the duopoly being created by a competitor coming into the edge-to-edge mitral repair market. And I was hoping if you could just give us your views on U.S. duopolies in terms of second player coming into the market, catalyzing market growth, how you think about that, the risk for competitive pricing to ensue and then the potential for that second mover to capture share and where those can lay out. Robert Ford : Sure. I mean generally speaking, competition will always kind of drive further innovation, further investment. So one can kind of make the analysis here that when you're -- when you have a competitor coming into your segment, you'll do more to invest in the business and that investment will then drive the category. So I think on one side, I do believe in that, and I think you can see how that's kind of had an impact. Definitely, when we came into the U.S. with Libre and kind of what happened to that market and what happened to the technology in terms of kind of making all the technologies better and et cetera. So the flip side of that is competition is -- you could potentially see, I guess, price as a lever to drive demand or to drive share capture. We've tried to focus every time we're entering markets with a value proposition that sustains our price and our pricing strategy and focus on the benefits that our solution will bring. And so I think you've got these 2 parts of kind of competition in markets. I'd say that's probably true for a 2-player market or a 3-player market. So -- but listen, we're excited to come into the LAA market here in the U.S. We're obviously a player internationally and we're making the investments. So for example, we've already begun our investment in market expansion in LAA with our CATALYST trial, which is comparing  our product to NOAC, which is the standard of care. And I know that competitors are making kind of similar clinical investment. I think that's good. I think that's positive. Okay. So that being said, I'd say here, if I just kind of sum up, our results clearly demonstrated here that we're showing real strong growth across all of our businesses, devices, Diagnostics, our Established Pharmaceutical business and our Nutrition. And as I said in the beginning of the call, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect that growth to continue in our underlying business. I think to Joanne's question, maybe to Bob's question also, optically, you're going to see a little bit of this, I'd say, artificial fog or lapping here or a comp versus for a few quarters as we kind of go through these sales that we've had from this big role that we played in COVID testing during the pandemic.  But I don't let that cloud kind of how we think about the business and how we think about the business long term. And I think our forecast here shows that we'll have a pretty differentiated underlying base business performance here. Our pipeline is highly productive, we've got a lot of ongoing launch activity and there's even more on the way here. So we're very excited about that, and we're investing across our key growth platforms. So we're feeling really good about our underlying base business and the momentum that we've got. So thanks for joining us today. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. That now concludes Abbott's conference call.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we reported results of another very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.40, reflecting nearly 45% growth compared to last year, and sales increased more than 22% on an organic basis. Excluded COVID testing-related sales, which totaled $1.9 billion in the quarter, organic sales increased 12% versus last year. As we've seen since the start of the pandemic, our diversified mix of health care businesses continues to prove highly resilient. Even as COVID case rates surged in the U.S. and other geographies during the third quarter, strong growth in our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutritionals, Established Pharmaceuticals and Diabetes Care, mitigated the modest impacts we saw from the surges in certain areas of our hospital-based businesses. This has been a consistent theme throughout the pandemic, as evidenced by an increase in total company sales, excluding COVID test of 11% on an organic basis through the first 9 months of this year compared to our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, which highlights that our growth is real and not simply a function of easy comps versus last year. As a result of our strong performance and outlook, today, we increased our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range now at $5 to $5.10, which reflects nearly 40% growth compared to last year. I'll now summarize our third quarter results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by U.S. Pediatric and international Adult Nutrition. In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew over 8.5% in the quarter, led by strong growth in the U.S. from continued share gains in our infant formula and toddler portfolio. Sales of Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand, once again grew strong double digits, driven by market uptake of several recently launched new products as well as investments we're making in direct consumer promotion. In Adult Nutrition, sales grew over 9% in the quarter, including mid-teens growth internationally as we continue to see strong demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands, including new users entering these categories and existing customers increasing their usage. Turning to Diagnostics. Sales increased more than 45% overall and 12.5%, excluding COVID testing-related sales. During the quarter, as the Delta variant spread and COVID cases surge particularly in the U.S., demand for testing increased significantly, most notably for rapid tests. In total, during the quarter, we sold more than 225 million COVID tests globally and have now shipped over 1 billion tests since the start of the pandemic. Over the last several months, we've learned that COVID vaccines, while a powerful tool, are not the lone solution needed in our global fight against this virus. Testing, particularly rapid testing, which is fast, affordable and easy to use is an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. Abbott has established a global leadership position in rapid testing, including a supply capacity of more than 100 million tests per month. Moving to established pharmaceuticals, where sales grew more than 15%, driven by strong execution and a steady cadence of new product introductions. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad based across several countries, including double-digit growth in China, Russia and India, which led to overall sales growth of 18% in our key emerging markets. And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 13% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 16% compared to pre-pandemic sales in the third quarter of 2019. Strong performance in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in Rhythm Management, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care. In Structural Heart, we continue to enhance our portfolio in large, fast-growing markets with the recent U.S. FDA approvals of Amulet, which closes the left atrial appendage in the heart to help reduce the risk of stroke and people with atrial fibrillation; and Portico for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. In Heart Failure, we announced results from the GUIDE-HF trial of our CardioMEMS system. As with many other recent and ongoing clinical trials across the health care industry, a portion of the CardioMEMS trial overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. After adjusting for this impact, CardioMEMS demonstrated a 28% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. And we filed with the U.S. FDA for label expansion based on the trial data in the middle of this year. During the quarter, we also added an attractive growth platform to our vascular device portfolio with the acquisition of Walk Vascular, a commercial stage company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system called JETi that removes peripheral blood clots. Peripheral thrombectomy is a large, high-growth area where we can leverage our existing commercial presence. And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of nearly $1 billion. During the quarter, we added over 200,000 new users, bringing the total global user base for Libre to well over 3.5 million users. So in summary, we continue to achieve strong, well-balanced growth across all of our major businesses, which is being fueled by strong execution and a steady cadence of new products. COVID testing -- particularly COVID testing remains an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics, and Abbott has established a strong leadership position in this area. And based on the strength of our performance and outlook, we're raising our EPS guidance for the year, which now reflects growth of nearly 40% compared to last year. I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 22.4% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $1.9 billion in the quarter. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 12.1% versus last year and 11.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1% on third quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 23.4% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 25% of sales. Our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 15.5%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15%. The revised full year forecast is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in July due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast $1 billion to $1.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales and forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, in the low double digits versus last year. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around 0.5% of 1% on our fourth quarter reported sales. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Great. And congrats on a really nice quarter. So maybe after such a good quarter led by COVID testing, I feel like you have a unique perspective looking at both sides of the coin from COVID testing, volumes and also device procedure volumes. So Robert, I'd love to get your sense of where you think we are here in fourth quarter and heading into 2022. And any early thoughts you could give us on sort of how to think about the progression of COVID testing sales and the recovery and durability of medtech volumes? Robert Ford : Sure. I think regarding COVID testing, we obviously -- since the start here of the pandemic, we've been learning a lot. And I think one of the things that as we developed our strategy for that, we always believe that the rapid test was going to be a kind of more sustainable part of the business. And I think we were pretty right there. I'd say the key thing that I -- and I made this in the comments, in the opening comments, the key thing that we learned over the last, let's say, couple of months here is that the vaccine is just an incredible tool for the value. It's had a huge impact on public health around the world. But alone, it's not enough. We know that dramatically reduces hospitalizations, dramatically reduces mortality. But I think we're all seeing here that even if you're vaccinated, you could still get and you could still transmit the virus. Obviously, you're not heading to a hospital, but I think we've all heard and seen stories of that. So I think that's the biggest kind of learning here for us as we go into Q4 and as we go into next year is that testing is going to remain an important companion here. And even with therapeutics, it's still going to remain an important part of fighting the virus. And I think we've also learned a lot about understanding kind of the difference between symptomatic testing and screening testing. And we started to pay much closer attention to understanding the channels and the platforms that are more aligned to symptomatic testing versus screening testing. And we can definitely see a correlation on the symptomatic testing with cases going up, cases going down. What we don't see that correlation is, is on screening. So even as cases have started to come down a little bit in the U.S., actually screening demand has increased quite a bit. So I think that is another kind of key learning as we think about going into Q4 and thinking about going into next year also. The other, I'd say, key distinction we've started to make is understanding kind of government purchasing a test versus kind of private. And I'd say in the beginning of the pandemic, most of our sales were focused to governments, whether international governments, federal government here in the U.S., state governments also. And that continues to be pretty strong. But what we've seen now grew pretty significantly. And I think it's aligned to the screening pieces, the private side of the market, whether it's OTC, cash pay, whether it's a lot of companies. We've seen a lot of companies in the last couple of months here, signed contracts with us to ensure that they've got rapid testing to be able to give to their employees. So while we're not seeing -- we only see some shelf and stocking issues at the retail and those will work their way through that in the next couple of weeks, we are seeing still a lot of companies buy test to give to their employees. So I think all of this is basically saying, listen, I don't know how much is going to be there next year, but it's clearly here that, that screening segment of the market is going to be an important part, even with therapeutics and vaccines. So I think that's going to be an important part. Our base business has done very well, continues to be on a recovery trajectory here, Robbie. Started in Q2, we saw that in devices. We saw that in Diagnostics. Yes, there was some there was some softness during Q3 as Delta and cases increased here in the U.S. That's probably more in August and throughout half of September, we started to see it kind of re-picked back up again towards the end of the quarter, first couple of weeks. We like what we're seeing here in terms of some pickup. But these were pockets. I wouldn't call it like a general softness and slowdown or pockets here in the U.S., some pockets in some countries. But generally speaking, that base business is doing very well. So when you think about 2022, I expect our base business -- our underlying base business to continue that momentum, very strong momentum across the board, especially with all of our new product launches. And the question here is going to be COVID. And I think it's going to be very difficult, as we go into next year, to be able to forecast a full number, a full year number of COVID next year. I think we're probably thinking about, okay, well, there's probably a COVID number that we're comfortable going into 2022. And then we'll have to update on a rolling quarterly basis here how COVID's going to play out throughout next year. So that's kind of how I see it. COVID is going to -- COVID testing will be there. We'll have to kind of do it more on a rolling basis as we go to next year. And our base business continues to accelerate. There was a little bit of softness in Q3, but I like what we're seeing in terms of recovery. And I like the portfolio that we built around our cardio business, our EPD business, our Nutrition business, our Diagnostic business. So that's all good. Robert Marcus : Great. Great. That was really helpful. And then maybe, Robert, to build on that, I know it's still very early in your planning process. But as you just said, there's a lot of variables, a lot of moving pieces. You've had a great year in devices so far, a bumper year in testing. Any early thoughts on how investors should be thinking about 2022 versus 2021 from a top and bottom line perspective? Robert Ford : Yes. I mean I think like I said, we're still in our process. We'll give our guidance in 2022 in January, like we always do, Robbie. And I want to see a little bit more in terms of how this pandemic is unfolding here, especially on the COVID side, but on the base business side. I think our base business, I would say is, we've been pretty good at forecasting our business both from a top line, from a margin on our base business. So I think what you can expect in 2022 is that base business getting even stronger with the rollout of all these product launches that we've announced over this year. And then the question here really is going to be kind of COVID testing. And like I said, we'll have a portion of it that, I think, we'll feel good about putting it in. And then we'll have to be updating on a rolling basis. And I think that's kind of how to think about it. The base business, which is probably the more sustainable piece, is building momentum. And it will go into 2022 with a lot of growth opportunity. And then we'll have to kind of look at COVID on a more rolling basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Robert Hopkins : Congrats on some solid execution. I just have 2 questions. And in the interest of time, I'll just mention them both upfront because the first one is pretty straightforward. The first question is just on Amulet, and I realize it's very early in the launch. But just would love your sort of top-down comments on how things are going. And maybe any metrics you can share in terms of perhaps like the percentage of your U.S. coronary accounts that are now active with Amulet. So we'd love some just color there. And then the second question is more of a broad-based question. I was just wondering if you could provide just a little bit more detail on what you're seeing on inflation and supply chain because the headlines are obviously -- they're just constant. But the message from Abbott and other companies we follow just seems to be that it's sort of generally manageable. So just wondering if you can kind of talk to that a little bit, if you can quantify the headwinds or just give us a better understanding of why it's manageable and just put some perspective around it for us. Robert Ford : Okay. Well, I'll take the Amulet and then I'll let Bob kind of talk to kind of the inflation supply chain. I mean I would just say it is manageable, but -- that we have a great team. So -- and I'll let Bob cover that. On Amulet, listen, we received approval in August. We already initiated the launch. I know there's a lot of anticipation, at least on the last 2 calls, about the data and when we're going to publish the data and why we're going to do it, the time that we were going to do it. And so we released that data really close to our approval. And I think that was a good strategy because it allowed our team to kind of prepare for that. I will say, regarding the data, I mean, you saw when we released the data, it's -- the product has got a lot of advantages versus the product that's on the market right now. We've got a pretty broad portfolio of sizes, and that helps as you're looking at different anatomies and having a better fit there. The steerable sheath that we've got has resulted in great precision in the placement, and that's super important, especially when you're looking at transcatheter therapies. And then you saw the data of superior kind of closure rates without the need for blood thinners, right -- falling right at the procedure. And ultimately, that's why the patient went to the hospital or part of the reason why they went there. So I think we've got a great product here. I think the team has done a good job getting the contracts ready. Right now I would say we have a goal of certain amount of contracts by the end of this year. And in the first month, we've already gotten 40% of them of that target. So I think that we're going to definitely hit what we need to hit in terms of getting our contracts, our accounts, the ones that we want to get on contract up and running so we could start to build the usage and familiarity with the system. We've got a really strong commercial presence here. And I think that's a key aspect in the rollout. The implants of these devices, the electrophysiologist or the interventional cardiologist, I mean we've got a lot of great products and a lot of great call point. So that's worked out very well, too. There's always a certain amount of coordination that's required there, and that coordination has been fantastic. I'm really pleased to see that. Initial feedback has been super positive. So very happy with the initial signs. Like you said, it's about a month, 1.5 months into it. All the signs that I'm seeing show that we'll have a great opportunity here to establish Amulet as another product in the category. And then on top of that, we're making the investments, like I said, to grow the category with all of our clinical trials. Catalyst is one of them that I think is important also. So I'd say 1.5 months, very, very pleased with what I'm seeing. Robert Funck : Okay. Thanks. I'll take the inflation comments. So I think inflation and supply chain are really linked together. The global supply chains have not been able to keep up with the strong demand out there. And so like others, we're seeing some increased input costs across areas of our business. We're experiencing some higher shipping costs, and in some cases, higher commodity costs. I'd say the commodity costs are really more kind of in the Nutrition area of the business. In some areas, we have flexibility to adjust pricing a bit, and we plan to do that. In other areas, that flexibility doesn't exist, and so we're working to mitigate the impacts we're seeing such as looking at other manufacturing costs. As Robert mentioned, we've got a very strong procurement organization and supply chain organizations, and they're doing a great job working with our suppliers. And our suppliers understand the critical nature of our products. And so it's been -- we've been successful in terms of ensuring that we're able to get what we need to support the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Congratulations on the strong 3Q results. Hopefully, Rob, hoping to just hear maybe some puts and takes or help us understand some of the puts and takes of the 2022 operating margin. Clearly, COVID testing is going to be a factor, but any other drivers of operating margin expansion that you would highlight as we move into 2022 and then any other levers that Abbott is able to pull to drive earnings next year, depending on how the COVID testing environment plays out. Robert Ford : Sure. I'd say -- like I said in the beginning, I mean, I think 2022, our base business, our underlying base business is going to grow very strong, both on the top and the bottom. So we'll see margin expansion in that business. And that's a combination. Like Bob said, we've got gross margin improvement teams across all of our business that are working at ways to mitigate other manufacturing costs. So that will be important to be able to drive margin expansion. And then just the nature of the mix as we continue to roll out our pipeline, which is predominantly focused, I'd say, on the med device side, we've got gross margin profiles there that are accretive to the company's gross margin. So I think a lot of it is really driven on the top line and driving our top line. And the execution of these new product launches allows us to get that kind of margin expansion into 2022. And like I said, we -- the COVID piece is really just one where we're going to have to go quarter-by-quarter and update and roll our forecast every quarter. We'll have a number that we'll feel comfortable with. But those -- I'd say those are the kind of key drivers here, our product launches, our ongoing base business, margin expansions by mix and gross margin improvement. I want to keep the same profiles that we've got right now in our base business in terms of spend, R&D and SG&A. So those profiles, we wouldn't want to maintain. Obviously, if you look at our profiles right now, it's a little bit distorted because of the COVID piece. But if you look historically where we've been in the low 7s in R&D and SG&A between 20% and 30%, that's where we're going to want to kind of land. Joshua Jennings : And then just a quick follow-up on Libre. We've had some consultants talk about the potential for Abbott to add other analytes onto the platform and particularly the addition of ketone monitoring as a potential competitive advantage. Any updates just in terms of how the 3.0 on tap here, but any updates in terms of the future development plans for Libre and how you continue to maintain your competitive edge here? Robert Ford : Sure. I mean I've always -- we've always said that Libre was a platform. We always -- I know every time you put out a number, it becomes like the next what is that and what's after that. And so we've launched Libre 2. It's doing very well in the U.S. We've launched Libre 3 in Europe, and we'll obviously be rolling Libre 3 out. Regarding your question on analytes, yes, I mean that is an area that we are intentionally looking at, which is using the platform of Libre, the manufacturing platform to be able to develop new analytes. You mentioned one that we've got particular experience in our blood glucose monitoring. We have a blood ketone system. So that, we believe, is an important aspect, especially for type 1 and pumpers. We think that, that's a real important kind of feature. If you look at going into the type 2 population, there's a lot of new drugs for type 2 where there are certain warnings regarding DKA. And we think that, that might also be an opportunity, too. But that's only one analyte, and we've got a pipeline here of analytes, a dedicated team that's only focused on looking at what are the business opportunities the market needs for that. And as we get closer to those launches, which will be coming up fairly soon, we'll be updating the market. But I'm really excited about using the Libre platform here to be able to kind of expand even beyond diabetes. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Robert, I wanted to focus on the device side and the pipeline. Just starting with Amulet, to ask Bob's earlier question in another way, the surveys seem to be coming back, suggesting Amulet can take about 1/3 of the U.S. market and maybe even 20% next year. It's not easy for a second to market to become a market leader, but Amulet has a nice profile. What's your reaction to some of these consensus estimates for share? Do you think you can do better? And I had a follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, I mean, Amulet is new to the U.S., but it's not new to the international markets. When you look at the international market, Amulet's got a 50% market share. I've seen some of the reports, not all of them, but I'm aware of some of these surveys that are done with different physicians. And what I read and what I see them is similar what I see here in the U.S. versus what we actually see in Europe, which is it's a great product. It's sized portfolio is an advantage. Its closure rate is also an advantage. And yes, we -- as I said, this is a multibillion-dollar market where we think that we can be a true competitor in also but, at the same time, invest to develop it. I think that's an important part here also, Larry. So as I mentioned, we're making investments in next-generation product. We're going to be making investments in the commercial infrastructure, which is not only to be there during the implant but also to develop the patient referral network. And we're going to be investing in clinical trials. I think the CATALYST trial is going to be comparing it to NOACs. I think that will be a great opportunity to expand the market also. So I think it's a combination of kind of market expansion. And yes, we're competitive with our offering. We're competitive with our team. And I think 50% international is a good aspiration to have here in the U.S. Larry Biegelsen : That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about Portico and CardioMEMS. So with Portico, you have Navitor outside the U.S. Do you think you need that in the U.S. to really drive share? And do you think you can compete in the -- without an intermediate low-risk indication, which I don't think you'll have until about 2024. And just lastly on CardioMEMS, how are you feeling about the label expansion and the commercial opportunity, given the COVID impact you mentioned on the GUIDE-HF trial? Robert Ford : Sure, Larry. Let me talk about Portico and TAVI here more broadly. This is a hugely important segment in Structural Heart. We want to be a structural heart leader. We had that vision when we put the businesses together with St. Jude. And we know that we need to be a true player here in the TAVI space. So I'm really looking at this for us as a long game. And what I mean by that is we're launching Portico in the U.S. Navitor, to your question, is a great second-generation device. We got it CE Marked and feedback is that it's a very, very competitive device. Its clinical profile in high risk is really strong. And yes, I want to bring it to the U.S. also, but not because I feel we need to because Portico is not competitive. Portico is very competitive. But in this context of building a strategy here to be a real player in the TAVI space, we know that we're going to have to bring a second generation here in the U.S. We'll have to also look about how do we develop further on Navitor. So I think that we've got about a 5% share in Europe. That's not my aspiration for the TAVI space. To your point, there's 2 pretty well entrenched competitors in the market. And -- but we have a higher aspiration than just kind of a 5% share, which is what we have in Europe. So I think the combination here of investment in the team, investment in the pipeline, in the clinical data, you're right, our kind of low-risk -- intermediate low-risk trial kind of reads out a little bit later on. But it's there. We're investing in it because we see this as a big opportunity for us to be a real player in this market. So I'm excited about it, and I know the team is to be able to kind of be a real -- a go-to full-service player in the field of structural heart. Regarding CardioMems, listen, I think we -- the data, I think, was pretty compelling. I mean this is the second -- and you know this, Larry, this is the second RCT trial that we've done. And I'm a big believer in RCT trials and the need for them to be able to generate the clinical evidence. We filed for the label expansion end of June. I think the data was very compelling. And part of it is expansion to Class II and Class IV and then also to be able to expand indication to patients with elevated BNP, which is, today, just for patients that have been previously hospitalized. So I think the combination here of the data, the fact that it is already the second RCT that we've done, a very large one also on top of CHAMPIONs -- the CHAMPIONs trial. I think there's a great opportunity here for us to develop this market. One of the things that we did in the quarter here also is we now have a more dedicated business unit for Heart Failure, where both the LVAD and CardioMEMS team are going to be combined under 1 GM, very similar to what we've done with our other businesses because we believe in the benefit of that focus and that attention to the business. So I think the combination of what we've submitted, our focus, this is a great opportunity for us in 2022 and beyond. I'm not going to comment on when -- all I can tell you is we filed it at the end of Q2. And I think the data is very strong, and we'll just leave it like that. And I'm highly hopeful that we'll be seeing that next year for sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong from Morgan Stanley. Cecilia Furlong : Great. I wanted to ask about just your neuromod business, SCS as well as other deferrable procedures. And can you walk through just sequential trends in the quarter if you started to see recovery in some of the -- in some of your more deferrable procedures trending ahead of others and also how you're thinking about the ability to recapture deferred procedures that the majority of procedure recapture can occur in 4Q or staffing shortages. Do some of this recovery in procedure recapture flow into 2022? Robert Ford : Sure. Well, I would say, this is probably out of our device businesses, the business that's had a little bit of a harder time in terms of recovering post COVID. It's probably more elective like you said, Cecilia. So it has been lagging a bit. It's been pretty flat, I would say, in terms of kind of its trajectory if we look at our trials and our implants. So -- but that's really something that we can't control in terms of kind of how that is going to bounce back. We have visibility to the pipeline of patients. We work closely with the surgery centers, and we've got visibility to that. We're not expecting a big bolus to come into Q4 and then we'll have to kind of see how Q1 and Q2 of next year looks like to be able to kind of give a better sense there. But what we can control, and that's what I focus -- we focus the team on is on our pipeline. And I think the team here has done a really good job. I'd highlight a couple of things here that we've done. NeuroSphere, which is this novel remote care platform, we've launched it. It's the first kind of system that was approved by the FDA. We did a full market release at the end of June. And I really like the numbers we're seeing. We've done over 5,000 remote programming sessions. And not only is it a remote program, but it also allows us to get visibility of the patients in the funnel. So using the adoption of that tool is great because I think it will have a real big change on the sales and service kind of business model that exists in this business. So that's going very well, and I think that will help get better visibility. Another key thing here is entrance into the rechargeable segment, which is about half of the market. We really don't have a competitive system in there, and the team has developed a rechargeable system that is best-in-class, significant advantages versus the market leaders in this segment. So we're looking forward to bringing that product to market next year. And then we've also made investments in trials. I think probably the most notable one is DISTINCT, which is an indication for nonsurgical lower back. We've completed enrollment in that study. So I think the combination of these factors here are important for us to be able to kind of take share. And then if we see the bolus of patients come back in Q1 and Q2, that will be an additional tailwind for us. Cecilia Furlong : Great. And I wanted to ask you as well about your recent acquisition of Walk Vascular and really at a high level, can you talk about your outlook just for the underlying market growth in the peripheral space over the next several years versus some of the other high-growth target end markets, including diabetes and EP? And are there other areas you look to build out around your vascular business? And beyond that, too, just what's your current outlook for pursuing a PE indication for the thrombectomy system? Robert Ford : Sure. So we've been looking at this area for quite a bit. As I always said, we're always looking. We're always studying. And this was an opportunity that we saw. We think it's an attractive segment. We see it about $700 million, growing double digits. And this kind of fell right into that sweet spot of kind of strategic -- make sense strategically for us. We've got a commercial footprint out there with an endovascular sales and service team. We know the customers. We have the call point. And we've got the capacity here to be able to leverage our manufacturing expertise here to be able to kind of scale up manufacturing. So this made perfect sense for us to be able to add it to the portfolio. And that integration is going pretty well. I don't expect any significant contributions in Q4. But as we go into next year, I think it will have an impact on our vascular business. And yes, I mean we're -- like I said, there are plenty of segments in the endo space, I would say, that we continue to study, we continue to look at, areas that we're interested in. And if we find the right moment for us to be able to add those opportunities, we will. Regarding your question on the PE indication, yes. Absolutely. We know that is very important in the peripheral space. So we're investing. That's one of the key aspects in the integration is to invest to be able to get that indication established. So yes, we are working on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Robert, my first one was -- going back to testing, I think your Q4 assumptions of $1 billion to $1.4 billion, that's a sequential step down versus 3Q. I'm curious, where are we on capacity right now? And what is the demand for these testing products right now? Are we seeing any sequential step down in demand right now? And I think you guys did win about $600 million-ish of DoD contracts. Is that baked into that Q4 number? Or is that a fiscal '22 contributor? Robert Ford : Okay. So regarding the Q4 forecast of $1 billion to $1.4 billion here, our capacity is we can do significantly more than that, Vijay, especially as we've -- Q3, we didn't have the full ramp-up, but now we're finishing this month. We'll be in full ramp-up mode. So we can do more than the $1.4 billion. I think the factor here that we're looking at is, as I said in the opening comments here in the first question, I continue to see the surveillance in the screening market to continue to increase. And that's with kind of Binax and ID NOW also. So we've got those businesses, everything we can make, we're rolling in here. I'd say the only question we've got here a little bit is on the symptomatic. And that's what you see maybe in this step-down here is assuming as cases decline in the U.S. that we're going to see a little bit of a decline in symptomatic testing. So that's a little -- that's one part of the factor. The other factor in the $1 billion to $1.4 billion is just pricing. We've got a market leadership position in rapid testing, especially in OTC. If you look at Nielsen data, you'll be able to see that we were at about 90% share. Before the month of September, we dropped to about 60 just because of supply. And now we're back up to 75% share, and we're seeing a little bit of price pressure. So in that number, I've baked in some price pressure to ensure that we maintain that market leadership position as we see more market entrants come in. But if we don't need that price, then that will obviously drive another beat to that number, too. But -- so that's -- those are the drivers and the thinking there, Vijay, a little bit of pricing pressure and what are we going to see on the symptomatic testing. Vijay Kumar : Sorry, the DoD contract, $600 million, is that assumed in Q4? Or is that a fiscal '22 contributor? Robert Ford : Well, we're going to have to -- yes, so the DoD contract is actually a -- I think you're quoting the maximum amount of the contract, which I know is kind of what got a lot of the news headlines. But the contract actually has a minimum amount, which is significantly lower than that, less than $100 million. So it's really going to depend here on the DoD and the federal government in terms of their purchasing. We factored in a little bit of that minimum piece in Q4. And as I talk about going into next year, that will be a portion of the part that we will feel comfortable with adding on. So -- but it's a pretty big range, Vijay, in terms of what the maximum is and what the minimum is. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And just one on your earlier comments, Robert, on the SG&A, looking back at historical trends of 29% to 30%, R&D at 7% of revenues. Was that comment referring to fiscal '22, what the OpEx as a percentage of revenue should look like for your base business? And then the variable over and beyond that should be COVID, is that the right way to think about the [indiscernible]. Robert Ford : The comment was more about ensuring that we don't -- you don't see that there is a drop in investment. When you look at our profile in Q3 in terms of R&D, it's down to 6%. Our SG&A is down to 25%. So that comment was more about there's a little bit of a distortion factor here because of COVID, and we're going to make sure that we continue to invest in the business. If you look at the investment we've made, Vijay, this year, we've added about $1 billion between R&D and SG&A to the business so that we can continue to drive the top line and, at the same time, drive the long-term sustainability of the business with the R&D investments. I talked about how we could pulsate that spend, not only this year, but as we go into next year, a portion of that spend is a little bit more discretionary on the SG&A side, and we'll be looking at that. But -- so the comment there was more about ensuring that there wasn't a distortion. We at least understood the distortion of COVID in terms of our profiles. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : Congrats on the strong results. So maybe just a follow-up on some of the things you were just talking about sort of this concept of reinvesting the proceeds of this very strong COVID business. So there's a perception out there, I think, because COVID testing is maybe not permanent and hard to predict that it's somehow less important or harder to value than the rest of your businesses. But the last few months, obviously, in this quarter, $1.5 billion of upside in Q3 is, by our estimates, more than $0.5 billion in operating cash. And that goes up against your $2 billion or $2.5 billion operating cash run rate. So the question is, in addition to kind of being part of the solution as you've talked about to the pandemic, maybe drill down a little bit into some of the things you were just describing, opportunities to invest behind, which ones of your growth programs do you see an opportunity to sort of dial things up? And how, if at all, does this change maybe the way you think about M&A and your activity on that front? Robert Ford : Sure. I think you've captured pretty well all the elements there of how we look at COVID. As I said in the beginning, when we started this, there's definitely an opportunity to accelerate the strategy of decentralized testing because of COVID, and that strategy has been in place, and that's an area that we are investing to ensure that we do have an ability to -- so we see more testing in pharmacy, more testing in urgent care centers and testing that goes beyond COVID that even goes beyond flu and RSV and respiratory viruses by developing assays that will be used on that rapid testing platform. So that's one investment, for sure. You can see the impact on the investment on some of the business. You see it in Nutrition. So we have been putting more disciplinary advertising and direct-to-consumer promotion in that business, and you could see the step-up in the growth rate there. We've obviously put investment into Libre, both on the SG&A side. You see -- we've rolled out a new TV commercial and funded that to a level that we feel is competitive, is leading in terms of messaging. Increased our sales force in the U.S. and other key markets for Libre so that we can call on more physicians, and you see the impact there on Libre. I mean we did almost $1 billion of sales of Libre this quarter. And in the U.S., it's about 65%. We're making great progress in penetrating the type 2 population, whether it's non-insulin users or non-intensive insulin users. We've got about a 90% market share of that segment at least. So that growth is also being supported. And we've got all these new product launches that I've been talking about on the cardiovascular side that require feet on the street, whether it's sales force, clinical specialists. And we're funding that also. So I think that, that's very clearly where we're putting our investments. We've talked about R&D investments and making sure that we've got pipeline beyond '22 and '23, and that's predominantly been in the Diagnostics and Device areas also. So it's been pretty broad based. That $1 billion increase has kind of gone well across all the businesses. And if I ask my general managers and my presidents of my businesses, do they have a next tranche of where they would go, they would have that list ready to go, too. So there's no shortage of opportunity. And then the other topic you talked about or touched on was the cash flow generation and -- as a result of the COVID business. And yes, it has generated a lot of cash. We have invested some of that cash in the organic opportunities we have, whether it's manufacturing sites here in the U.S. for COVID, for MitraClip, for Libre. So we've made those internal investments, but we've also looked at where we could provide the best return to our shareholders. And you saw that in the form of our dividend increase at the beginning of this year. We increased our dividend by 25%. You saw that we also -- probably saw that we bought back shares in Q2. And we've stepped that up even further in Q3, and we've got capacity to do more of that in Q4, if that makes sense for our shareholders. So we find a way to kind of deploy that capital. And on the M&A side, I mean, I've talked about this. If we think there's a strategic fit for us, one that is financially justified for us, that we can do better with it, that we can make it better and that there's value for our shareholders, we'll do that also. Right now, I'd say, I think the med tech and diagnostic valuations out there, especially the ones that we would be interested in, in high-quality, high-growth assets is a little bit frothy. So we're in the mode of studying and paying attention. I think the good news here is that we don't really need M&A to be able to support what I think is pretty top-tier performance here. So that's pretty comprehensive in terms of how we're looking at COVID. And it both funds our internal organic growth and allows us to either provide some more value to shareholders through buybacks, dividends. And if there's a growth vehicle out there that I think will make sense, we'll -- we won't be shy for that also. So I'll just close here a little bit and just say our results, we're achieving very strong growth across all of our businesses. I'm very excited and proud about the pipeline that all the businesses have been focused on. We've historically really focused on our organic pipelines, and that continues to be highly productive. We are entering to very new and attractive growth segments across our portfolio, and there's more products along the way there. So we're investing in our key platforms, as I've said. COVID testing is going to be an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. At what level, I can't say right now for next year. I've given a range on what I think it's going to look like in Q4, and there could be opportunities there for us to do better than that. But I think the rapid test here is really the value proposition that's going to make sense going into next year, and we're a leader in that segment. We've built scale. We've built manufacturing, and we know how to operate in this environment, whether it's retail pharmacies or direct consumers. So our focus right now is we're going to finish strong 2021, enter into 2022 with a lot of momentum. And I think we're well-placed strategically here as we go into next year. So with that, I'll thank you all for joining us today. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we will take your questions.  Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another strong quarter and highly successful year for Abbott. For the year, we reported organic sales growth of 23% and ongoing earnings per share of $5.21, which reflects more than 40% growth compared to the prior year and exceeded the original EPS guidance we set last January.  These last couple of years have truly been unique on many levels. The challenge throughout the pandemic has been the sheer breadth of its impacts. And for Abbott, it's reinforced the value of our diversified business model, which is uniquely balanced across multiple dimensions, including our business mix, customer and payer types, innovation cycles across our businesses and geographic footprint. We've always said that our business model allows us more opportunities to win during the good times and makes us more resilient during the tough times, and never has this been put to the test more so than over the past couple of years. It's been tested by a major global pandemic and has proven to be highly resilient, delivering strong growth and returns for our shareholders.  COVID testing has been a big part of this, of course. We delivered 1 billion tests last year and approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter alone and continue to play a significant role in the world's response to the pandemic. But just as importantly, we demonstrated Abbott's strength across our company, delivering strong growth across our businesses while continuing to expand our portfolio with innovations that will fuel our success for years to come regardless of the pandemic situation. Turning to our outlook for 2022. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $4.70, which reflects nearly 50% growth compared to our prepandemic baseline in 2019. We forecast organic sales growth for our base business, excluding COVID tests, in the high single digits, and our guidance includes an initial COVID testing sales forecast of $2.5 billion. We're seeing very strong demand for testing to start the year with the recent emergence of the Omicron variant. And as you know, forecasting COVID testing demand for more than a few months at a time has been challenging. Therefore, our initial forecast compromises sales that we expect to occur in the early part of the year. And we'll update this forecast 1 quarter at a time over the remainder of the year.  I'll now provide more details on our 2021 results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales grew nearly 6% in the fourth quarter and over 7.5% for the year. Adult Nutrition delivered 9% growth for the quarter and double-digit growth for the year, led once again by Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand; and Glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand. In Pediatric Nutrition, U.S. sales growth of more than 10% for the year was led by strong growth of Pedialyte, our oral rehydration brand; and market share gains for Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand. During the past year, we continued to expand our Nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extensions, including the launch of Similac 360 Total Care in the U.S. and continued global expansion of our PediaSure, Glucerna and Ensure brands with line extensions such as plant-based, lower-sugar and high-protein products.  Turning to Medical Devices, where continued recovery from the impacts of the pandemic and strong growth in Diabetes Care drove sales growth of 16% in the quarter and nearly 20% for the year. In Diabetes Care, sales growth of nearly 30% for both the fourth quarter and full year was led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. Rebased Libre sales grew over 35%, which translates to year-over-year growth of $1 billion to a total of $3.7 billion in 2021.  This past year, we continued to strengthen our Medical Device portfolio with several pipeline advancements and launches. In the U.S., expanded Medicare reimbursement coverage for MitraClip will make it possible for more people to benefit from this life-changing technology. We launched NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, a first-of-its-kind technology that lets patients communicate with physicians and receive new treatment settings remotely. We received U.S. FDA approval for our Amplatzer Amulet heart device, which treats people with atrial fibrillation who are at risk of ischemic stroke. And we received U.S. FDA approval of our Portico heart valve replacement system for people with severe aortic stenosis; and CE Mark for Navitor, our latest-generation transcatheter aortic valve replacement system.  Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased nearly 6% in the fourth quarter and over 10% for the full year. Strong performance was broad based across several countries, led by India, Russia and China. EPD has performed well throughout the pandemic, fueled by strong execution and a steady flow of new product introductions in our core therapeutic areas.  And I'll wrap up with Diagnostics, where COVID testing was a big part of the story but far from all of it. COVID testing sales were $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter with rapid testing platforms, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally and ID NOW globally, compromising approximately 90% of those sales. Demand for testing continues to remain strong, and we remain committed to help ensure broad access. Since the start of the pandemic, we've invested significantly to build both U.S. and international manufacturing supply chains, and we're working to expand our capacity further to meet global demand. Excluding COVID testing sales, worldwide Diagnostics sales grew over 8% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. We continue to roll out Alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments, and expand test menus across our platforms. During the year, we placed more than 3,000 Alinity instruments for immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing, with approximately 2/3 of those placements coming from share capture. And in Molecular Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing, sales grew double digits in both U.S. and internationally as we continue the rollout of our Alinity m instrument for molecular testing.  So in summary, 2021 was another highly successful year for Abbott. We continue to play a vital role in combating COVID-19 as a result of our massive scale we've built in rapid testing capacity. All 4 of our major businesses delivered strong performance this past year and are well positioned for continued success going forward. And we continue to strengthen our overall strategic position with a steady cadence of important new products from our pipeline in several attractive growth areas.  I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 7.7% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.3 billion in the quarter. Excluding COVID testing sales, organic sales growth was 10.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and 10.8% compared to our prepandemic baseline in the fourth quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.5% on fourth quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 7.2% in the quarter.  Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 26.2% of sales. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 16.9%, which reflects an adjustment to align our tax rate for the first 3 quarters of last year with our revised full year effective tax rate of 15.5%, which is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in October due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. Today, we issued guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $4.70. For the year, we forecast organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the high single digits. We forecast COVID testing-related sales of approximately $2.5 billion, with a significant portion of these sales expected to occur in the early part of the year. We'll update our COVID testing sales forecast 1 quarter at a time throughout the year. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our reported sales.  We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 58.5% of sales for the year, which reflects our forecasted business mix, underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses, along with the impact of inflation on certain manufacturing and distribution cost.  For the year, we forecast R&D investment of around $2.7 billion and SG&A expense of around $10.8 billion, which reflects investments to support several ongoing and upcoming new product launches and strategic growth initiatives. We forecast net interest expense of around $500 million, nonoperating income of around $375 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 14.5% for the year.  Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $1.50 and organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the high single digits. Lastly, at current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales.  With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Congratulations on a really strong finish to a strong year. Robert, can you talk about how you thought about the 2022 guidance? Why is $2.5 billion for COVID testing the right starting point? And how are you thinking about reinvesting the upside from COVID testing implied in the $4.70 EPS guidance? And I have one follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure, Larry. I'd say at the beginning of the year, you're coming into the year and you're trying to find the right balance, right? You're trying to find the right balance on your long-term growth opportunities that Abbott has, which I think are pretty unique, and balancing that with, I'd say, probably some uncertainty. And I'd say every year, there's a little bit of uncertainty at the beginning of the year, but I'd say this year is probably a little bit more than usual. So you're trying to find that balance, and I'm pretty sure we'll talk about some of the long-term growth opportunities. But if you think about some of the challenges in forecasting right now, there's a lot of dynamics that are existing from a macroeconomic standpoint that are out there that, quite frankly, aren't necessarily unique to Abbott. But they're out there, whether it's the pandemic and the duration of the current surge, potential new waves and how long they will last, staffing shortages that we've seen for the hospital base kind of part of our business; quite frankly, patients' willingness to go in, to do a procedure during the surges. So that's probably one kind of big bucket to look at.  Another area, obviously, on the macro side is supply chains and inflation challenges that every company is facing, and obviously, kind of currency headwinds. So I'd say those are all challenges that are facing a lot of medtech companies, companies in health care, and quite frankly, a lot of companies outside of our sector. Probably what's a little bit different for us, another fact to consider in our forecast is just COVID testing and how is that going to play out throughout the rest of the year given the magnitude of what the testing could look like between it completely going away or it staying or increasing at this level.  So factoring all those kind of elements over here, I think this was the right starting point for us, to start off like that. And I think this initial full year guidance is contemplating not only some of those challenges, but also contemplating on the flip side, a very strong underlying kind of Abbott base business, as I said in my comments, high single-digit growth. So there are definitely acceleration in a lot of our portfolio versus where we were prepandemic.  We've got investment in this guidance to be able to support not only all of our launches that we engaged in towards the end of last year. Beginning of this year, we've got launches and opportunities. And that's all been contemplated and fully funded.  And the initial COVID testing forecast of $2.5 billion, I don't expect COVID to simply go to 0 starting in the second quarter. But the challenge of forecasting, the magnitude, I felt, is the right way to -- and quite frankly, I talked about this in October, we will be updating it as we go along. We've got a -- we've built a lot of capacity. You've seen that over this last 1.5 years, especially in rapid testing. So we have that capacity, and we'll be updating it.  So if we had typically done our $0.10 range guide here, Larry, our consensus, we would have been right in the middle of where you guys are at. But I didn't want to cap the upside, which is why we're at the least $4.70.  So if I kind of sum it up, I look at our guidance now and I say, \"Okay. We've contemplated as much as we can of some of the challenges that a lot of companies are facing, whether it's supply chain, duration of pandemic, medical device procedures, et cetera.\" I've fully funded our growth platforms that we're very excited about. And there's potential for the upside of more COVID testing because I don't think it goes away, which would then fall through at a good click and provide that upside.  So I think that's probably the best way to summarize. It's derisked, fully funded for long-term growth opportunities, and we've got potential upside as we go into the remainder of the year. Larry Biegelsen : That's super helpful. Robert, just for my follow-up, Libre had another remarkable year. How are you thinking about Libre growth in 2022? And what are the drivers of that growth this year? Robert Ford : Sure. Well, yes, I mean, you saw it. It continues to grow at a very strong rate and a very large base. 35 -- over 35% this year, 4 million users now. We've initiated geographic expansion of Libre 3, and that will start in the next couple of weeks. Moving out of Germany into U.K. and France, those are probably kind of key markets that we're expanding over the next couple of weeks.  And if I think about 2022, Larry, I mean, I'm looking at here strong double-digit growth. We've been growing about $1 billion of incremental sales per year, and I expect that growth to be at least in that range. So that probably translates into a 25% growth.  I think the biggest driver for us is, quite frankly, not just this year but as we look forward, it's still very underpenetrated, right? I'm talking about being a leader in terms of patients with 4 million users where we've talked about numbers between 60 million, 70 million, 80 million people around the world that could be benefiting from continuous glucose monitoring and sensor-based monitoring.  So I'd say biggest opportunities we've got continue to be international. The CGM penetration internationally is still much lower than in the U.S. And then moving into -- more aggressively into patient segments that historically have been underpenetrated, you kind of look at the type 2s on single injection therapy. So we've got great opportunity there.  U.S., I would say, is another good opportunity for us. We had very good year this year, close to like 16% growth. I think that's the number. Now over 1 million users. We've made the investments that we need to make last year in terms of sales force and advertising, and that's paying dividends. In terms of new users, we continue to have a high share of new user growth.  So as you combine what we're doing internationally, expansion of Libre 3, continued growth in the U.S., expanding into a pretty underpenetrated population of type 2s, and I think we've still got -- like I've kind of said, still in the early innings of the Libre story here. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : I'll also add my congratulations on a nice quarter. Two for me. I'll ask them both upfront. First question, maybe you could spend a minute on cadence throughout the year. First quarter has a lot more COVID testing sales than we had thought but also implies somewhat of a different cadence than we have been thinking. So just top and bottom line, what are the impacts there? How is inflation, FX hitting throughout? And then second question is probably tied into it. If you could just touch on what you're seeing in current device and procedure trends as we sit here today and how you're thinking about the evolution of that over the course of '22. Robert Ford : Well, your first question has got multiple subquestions there, Robbie. So let me take the first one, and then I'll go back -- so I can take the second one, and then I'll go back to your first one because it does contemplate some of the challenges on inflation that might be worthwhile spending some time just talking a little bit about also.  But in terms of demand dynamics, especially in the more hospital-based business here, Robbie, we saw a real nice trajectory recovery in the beginning of Q4. We were -- and I always like to compare versus 2019, at least for 2021, to avoid some of the comp pieces. So we were improving our growth rates in our probably more cardio-like businesses, let's use that as a proxy. It would be in that kind of 3% to 4% range and improving as the quarters progressed. And Q4 was looking like, again, a continuation of that progression until probably December, where we saw a pretty big drop because of Omicron in most of the device -- of our device businesses. Probably the only 2 that we didn't see that drop was Heart Failure, that was probably up in the mid-20s in December versus 2019; and obviously, Libre, which was up probably like in the 70s percent versus 2019.  So we did have an impact in these parts of the business, again as -- predominantly driven by Omicron impact of not only staffing, I'd say, but also even just patients basically postponing a little bit and not wanting to go into a hospital. And I think that's continued a little bit here into January.  I'd say geographically, seeing a little bit more of that impact in the U.S. compared to other geographies, at least for us. Europe and Asia have held up a little bit better than the U.S. And then we've contemplated as best as we can what that recovery curve is going to look like. We'll see some pressure on that, I'd say, probably January, February going into March. We expect it to get better, and then Q2 will be better. And if you look at the second half of this year, we expect for these businesses to be more at their normal run rate. So I think -- I'd say that's what we're seeing, and that's kind of how we're forecasting the rest of the year.  Actually, I was pretty pleased that some of the new product launches that we had during the quarter -- we're always cautious about, okay, do we launch the product during -- in this environment? And they did pretty well, both in Europe and in the U.S., too. So I think that speaks well about still the need for the products and the technologies and the innovation.  So the consumer side -- the consumer-facing part of our business, I mentioned Libre, but you saw it in Nutrition and EPD. They've done pretty well, the pandemic. They did pretty well in Q4. So didn't necessarily see the impact of Omicron to those businesses like we didn't see it in Delta either. So we would expect those businesses to be pretty resilient. And the key driver there, as I talked a little bit about Libre, is just kind of innovation.  On your first question regarding cadence, I mean, part of it is this combination that I said, recovering device and core testing procedures that we see going into Q2 and into Q3 and Q4. And then as we have more, let's say, call it, confidence in precision regarding our COVID testing, we'll see that kind of flow through, and then we'll be able to update you. I think when we're here in April, we'll have a better sense of what Q2 is going to look like, not only for the U.S. but also internationally. And as I said, having that ability to then kind of update the forecast with that COVID number, we'll let it flow through.  So I think you also had a question about inflation. I mean that is another area that we're working on and focused on and probably ask Bob to give you some color on that. Robert Funck : Okay. Yes. And Robbie, you actually kind of asked about currency and inflation. I'll cover currency first. I mean we saw the U.S. dollar kind of strengthen since the middle of last year, in particular over the last few months. And so as I said in my opening remarks, at current rates, that's about a 2% headwind on the top line for the year. We're going to see that -- a greater impact in the first quarter, around 3% and kind of -- and in the second quarter. And it'll get -- the impact will be a little bit less severe as we go -- kind of go through the course of the year into the back half of the year.  In terms of inflation, inflation and supply chain challenges are really kind of linked together as supply chains have not been able to catch up to the strong demand that's out there. And so we're seeing some impacts here, certainly not unique to us or our industry. And we're seeing those impacts across transportation cost, manufacturing inputs, commodities, et cetera.  From a pricing standpoint, we have the flexibility to adjust price a bit in some areas of the business, and we're doing so. That's really more in the consumer-facing businesses like Nutrition. In other areas of the business, that flexibility doesn't exist. So I'd say in aggregate, kind of across those headwinds, we're seeing impacts on gross margin of roughly $0.5 billion, and that's contemplated in our guidance. And I think as supply chains start to normalize over time, we would expect to see improving cost in some areas. For example, in commodities for Nutrition, those costs have kind of moved up and down historically over time. But currently, our kind of outlook doesn't assume any significant changes kind of versus the current dynamics that we're seeing in the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : I have 2 questions. Maybe my first one was on the new product side. Robert, you made some comments on perhaps a consumer kind of product at CES at Lingo. I'm just curious, how do you see the opportunity here, right? It's slightly different perhaps from our perspective. But for Abbott, I mean, you guys have played in consumer markets. How big is this opportunity? Perhaps some sense for when U.S. launch timing could be. And should we expect more analytes, right? I think you guys had 4 analytes at CES, but I'm curious, is there -- are there other products expected to come down the pipeline? Robert Ford : Sure, Vijay. So we made a decision to put a stake in the ground here and start talking about what we've always believed to be another opportunity, a sizable opportunity for Abbott, and that was really using the Libre platform that we had developed to look into other analytes, other areas. I talked about this recently, and quite frankly, we've talked about it several years ago also. And you referenced some of the analytes that we have been working on : ketones, lactate, alcohol, glucose for people with known diabetes. And those are big opportunities.  As I've said, the model is a little bit different. It is probably a much larger TAM in terms of people, but the usage of the sensors is probably more intermittent than you would kind of get on a person, for example, with diabetes today, where we're very clear whether you're a type 1 on a pump or a type 1 injector or a type 2, like we know through the data we've covered here in terms of the usage patterns. So the usage pattern is a little bit different, but the sample size is significant.  If you think about like a keto sensor and the opportunity to be able to provide real-time feedback for somebody who's trying to manage their keto diet, I think there's a large amount of people, large consumer pool that whether it's more disciplined keto diets or kind of more on an on-off basis, there's a very large amount of people. And we'll have to just think about how to market it a little bit differently, and our go-to-market strategy will be a little bit differently.  But I'd say -- we've always seen this as a big opportunity. And we funded it, and we have a separate team that is obviously leveraging the platform, but they're managed differently. They have a completely different organizational structure, and they're just focused on developing not only the technical side of the analytes but obviously doing all the market development work. So we're really, really in the early inning stages here, but I think the numbers could be pretty significant and pretty large. And why not? Over a good period of time, maybe it's even bigger than diabetes once you line these up.  The first phase of analytes, we announced at CES that this is our intention, that we were designing these. Timing, we expect to launch our first products outside of the United States towards the second half of this year. In the United States, we'll obviously be having the conversations with the agency in terms of how that regulatory path is going to shape up, probably a little bit too early right now to talk about that. But we're very excited about this opportunity because we've seen this opportunity many, many years back and made the moves. On your question about other analytes, yes, I would say Part 1 -- or Phase 1, I would say, is what I would call these more consumer-facing, more consumer-driven opportunities. But we are looking at other analytes that we probably have, I would say, more of a medical clinical application, whether it's in the hospital or for discharges, et cetera. So there is opportunity there that we're also working on. So I think it's very large, and we're just in the beginning right now in terms of market creation. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Robert. And maybe my second question, in the balance sheet, I think you guys probably have over $40 billion of capacity right now conservatively. With valuations coming down, what kind of opportunities do you see? And one of the things that always frights me is Abbott is very large in diagnostics, #1, #2 in most of your end markets. If you look at diagnostics, liquid biopsy, cancer screening diagnostics is -- that's a massive opportunity, but I don't see Abbott having a stake in the ground in that area. Is that an area that would interest Abbott? Robert Ford : Well, answer that specifically, I'm not going to necessarily show all of my cards here. But I guess what I will say regarding the M&A question here is yes, there's -- there seems to be some dislocation now. And I think this could make sense. If there's anything out there that looks strategic for us and that makes financial sense, then yes, we'll be -- we've got plenty of capacity, as you said. We've generated a lot of strong cash flow, and quite frankly, it's been a meaningful step-up in that cash flow over the last kind of 1.5 years or so. So yes, strategically financial fits, as I've always said, we're in a great position now to be able to look at that.  Devices and diagnostics, I will say, are the areas that we're looking at more carefully. Scott's team is always looking at everything, but he's got more special lens here in devices and diagnostics. The areas that you referenced are areas that are in the list of things that we would be interested in looking at.  Tuck-in and medium-sized deals probably are more likely, if -- again, if those situations present themselves. But again, we're always looking at everything. So I would say yes, nothing has changed regarding what I've said about M&A, if it's strategic and it makes financial sense and we can deliver value for our shareholders. We are now in a great position as a result of all the efforts that we've had, quite frankly, on cash flow conversion. And now with kind of COVID cash, that also helps. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Rob, just first, wanted to ask a question on 2022 guidance. And understand you don't want to put the top end of the range there and cap the upside. Clearly, there's a potential upside with the increased COVID testing outside of that $2.5 billion revenue stream that you're expecting in the early part of the year. But just in a scenario where COVID testing does fall off in that guidance for the revenue from that franchise turns into reality, can you just refresh us on some of the other levers you have that you can pull to drive EPS growth? I think last year, in June when COVID testing fell off, your team talked about share repurchase, accretive M&A, some cost-cutting reductions. But just wanted to get a refresh there and see if you could help us think through those levers.  And then second question is just on the diabetes franchise. And clearly, Libre has a long runway. You're looking -- I believe you just talked about in one of your answers about the consumer opportunity. But how should we be thinking about the diabetes franchise and Abbott's desire to kind of leverage the positioning there with other products, either insulin delivery devices or other portfolio adds as we move into 2022 and beyond? Robert Ford : Sure. On your first one, I mean, like I said, we derisked, we fully funded, and we've got the potential upside for the COVID testing. If COVID testing in that scenario, which I think is highly unlikely, kind of falls off, then we'll have to obviously look at kind of the investments we're making and kind of make the adjustments that we have to make, especially as we start to move into 2023.  I don't think that is the case. I think that COVID testing is going to be still around. I think Omicron has catalyzed a pretty significant shift in global rapid testing and screening. And the question here is just going to be how does it evolve over the next kind of 9 months, 12 months here.  So -- but that being said, to your question on that scenario, you'd have to make adjustments. As I've said, we would. But right now, I'm managing -- we're managing the enterprise as a whole, and we obviously got profits that are coming from COVID that we're reinvesting into the business. If that turns out to not be the case this year then, like I said, we're fully funded on our growth platforms. And then we'd have to kind of make adjustments or look at that investment level as we go into 2023.  Buybacks is another opportunity that we've got. We've got a lot of flexibility here also. Last year, we bought -- I think it was about $2 billion in 2021. And I'd anticipate being active in the market again this year since we do have that capacity.  So -- and your second question, I think, was on diabetes, right, and growth opportunities. Is that -- could you just... Joshua Jennings : Sorry. Absolutely. Just thinking about anything you can share just in terms of internal development programs outside of advancing Libre in diabetes and on the consumer channel on the sensing side. Any other products within the diabetes device realm that you could add to the portfolio? Or should we be thinking about the diabetes franchise just sticking with the playbook that you have that's been so successful over the last number of years and has a long runway? Robert Ford : Got it. Got it. So listen, yes, we're in the beginning here. There's still a lot of opportunities, still a lot of underpenetration, whether it's internationally or type 2s. As I've said, key aspect here is to ensure your pipeline is relevant and is advancing. We've launched Libre 3 in Europe, and we'll be expanding that launch now globally.  I expect to be able to bring Libre 3 here into the U.S. I won't necessarily get into the specifics, but I figured you guys would eventually ask this. We have filed Libre 3 here in the U.S. as an iCGM to the FDA last year. I won't get into specifics about timing there, but it's the -- review process happens in the same agency that reviews diagnostic tests. So as you would imagine, there's a lot of busy work going on with that area of the agency.  So we've obviously seen our data that we've submitted to the agency. We've obviously seen now data from a competitive system. And I'd say we're feeling pretty good about where we stand. So I think that's -- a key component there is to expand the portfolio.  I've talked about Libre 4, not necessarily what exactly is that, but we do have that as an active program. Connecting to insulin delivery systems is also part of that strategy. And we've got active programs with all pump suppliers and pen delivery systems also to be able to connect Libre onto that.  So I think we'll stay focused on making the best sensor, sticking to our strategy of consumer-friendly, showing outcomes, price for access and affordability and continue to innovate with our sensor platform and then look at opportunities to use those sensors to not only expand into other platforms, but also to connect to other devices. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : I have a big picture one and a specific one. Big picture, one of the themes of your keynote address at CES was the marriage of tech and medtech. And I'm curious if you could highlight how you sort of take that lens in terms of your product pipeline.  And then my specific question has to do with your Structural Heart franchise. Portico is out in the market, Amulet is out in the market, and I would love just a little bit of an update on how those products are doing. Robert Ford : Sure. So yes, I've talked about this convergence. And quite frankly, we've seen this convergence occurring probably when we are doing the St. Jude acquisition and integration. And we started to set a lot of our portfolios to be able to connect to whether it's consumer electronics or cloud or other elements like that to ultimately be able to empower the consumer and just provide better solutions to ultimately improve outcomes.  So I think you saw the device portfolio has been going down that path for quite some time now as very pleasantly -- very pleasant to see that start to look not only in the Cardiovascular side, also in the Neuromodulation side. As I said in my opening comments on our virtual clinic, I think that's got an opportunity to change the business model of that business, and at the same time, provide better outcomes for not only DBS but also spinal cord stimulation, too. So you've seen that in devices. We then started to see Diagnostics, and you saw over that thinking. As we developed Binax, we wanted to make sure that we were kind of integrating not just our expertise in developing an accurate test to be able to detect COVID, but also integrate it into an app where you can kind of have your pass and your phone, et cetera, and working with partners to be able to kind of do that. So I think you're seeing it across all of the portfolio.  In our pharma business, we're using digital tools to be able to ensure that patients are taking their medications. So that's pretty -- I'd say, a strategic element going across all of our businesses and how we're thinking about it. So it's not -- I wouldn't say it's just one part of the portfolio, but I think it's a convergence that is happening, and we want to be leaders in that convergence across all of our portfolio.  Regarding your question on Structural Heart. So I think you mentioned Portico and Amulet. Listen, Amulet, we received approval in Q3 last year, moved quickly to launch. I'd say initial feedback has been very strong, especially in the areas of superior closure rates, the need to be able to leave the hospital without blood thinners. And also, we've heard a lot of broader sizes to better fit more anatomies and give them more of that flexibility. So that's done very well.  As part of the launch, we wanted to make sure that we had good proctoring -- good peer-to-peer proctoring. So obviously, that became a little bit of a challenge in November and December after Thanksgiving and into December. But I think despite all of that, I think we've done pretty well. I think we did about 500 procedures last year, mostly happening -- mostly in Q4. And if you look at what we did in December, that would put us at about a 10% market share, which is -- which I think is pretty good. Obviously, we're not satisfied with that, given what we know we can do and what we've done in Europe. But I think it's very much aligned to where we wanted to be regarding the end of the year and as we enter into 2022. So I think that's going very well.  Portico, we're -- as I've said, this is an important area for Structural Heart. We know that there are 2 entrenched competitors in there. We think we've got a great technology also, and we're going about it very systematically, very methodically to build our position.  We launched our generation 2 product in Europe, our Navitor product. And again, that's received great feedback also, and there's a pretty competitive clinical profile here for high-risk surgery patients. So we're making the investments that we know we need to make to be able to expand our position here. So I feel good about our Structural Heart portfolio. I've talked about how this is a big opportunity for us. We've made the investments, and I think we're in a great position as we go into 2022. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Matthew Taylor : So I just had 2 margin questions I wanted to ask. The first one, I guess I'll frame it as, if we take the 1 50 from Q1, that implies about $1.06 to $1.07 for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. So is that how we should view your base business earnings power? Or are you still spending more through the year from some of the COVID testing profits or being conservative? Would love just any additional color on the base business earnings power ex testing. Robert Funck : Yes. Matt, I'll take that. This is Bob. So we don't really think about earnings or at the bottom line base versus COVID. We manage the whole company. Obviously, the first quarter is benefiting from the majority of the COVID sales that we've got forecasted at this point in time, kind of our starting point. But we funded our growth throughout the rest of the quarter. So what you have is COVID testing, initial COVID testing sales in that first quarter, but our investments throughout the entire year. And so as we update our COVID testing each quarter, kind of as Robert talked about, that will fall through, certainly at a higher level than our overall margin profile. Robert Ford : I'd just add on to that, Matt, we absolutely expect there to be COVID testing after the first quarter. The question is at what level. And as I said in the beginning, to be able to kind of forecast a full year out like that, given the magnitude of how this can shift, it's just prudent to do it a quarter at a time. So when we're here in April, we'll have a better sense of what Q2 is going to look like in terms of COVID testing, and we'll be able to kind of update you there, okay? Matthew Taylor : Got you. Can I just have one follow-up on -- so on gross margin, you mentioned that there was about $500 million headwind from inflation and supply chain. And so I guess if we add that back in, you're getting to gross margins closer to 60%. Ex that, I was just wondering if you could talk about expectations for gross margins going forward longer term if things normalize. And if you could kind of see those levels in 2023, if things improve or just pluses and minuses on gross margins longer term? Robert Funck : Well, I think the add back gets you a little bit below that. But the way we think about gross margin every year is looking for ways to expand that. Every one of our businesses has dedicated teams focused on gross margin initiatives. And you're seeing some of that benefit actually in our 2022 forecast helping to offset the impact of the inflation that we're seeing. We continue those programs. They are not a 1-year program. We do them every year, and we'll continue to do those into next year.  The other thing we're seeing is a benefit of kind of the business mix. So as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing recovers, that benefits our overall gross margin for the business. Obviously, Robert talked about a lot of the opportunity. Some of the opportunities is even more that we have to drive growth in our Medical Device business as well as in Diagnostics. And as we grow those businesses, that will have a positive impact overall on our gross margin profile. Robert Ford : Okay. Let me wrap up here then. Thanks, Bob. Listen, I'll finish by saying a little bit how I started. I acknowledge that there's a lot of uncertainties in the macro environment right now and the challenges that, that creates in terms of forecasting for investors, at least in the short term : pandemic, how long will it last, phases, transition to endemic, recovery curves of procedures. I get some of the challenges of that forecast. But if I look at the market here at the start of the year and look at health care sector, specifically medtech and diagnostics, definitely been disproportionately hit by some of those uncertainties.  And I think if you take a step back, I think it's important to remind ourselves the -- that health care still remains a very, very important need and a great long-term growth area because I think none of the long-term market fundamentals have changed in the pandemic. If anything, some of them have gotten even better and accelerated. So I think the demographic trends are still very favorable.  And procedures and routine testing, they're going to come back, whether it's a month, 2 months, et cetera. It's just difficult to predict with that perfect degree of precision, but they'll come back. And if you look at the innovation pipelines across the entire industry, they have never been stronger. And within that context, I think Abbott's pretty uniquely positioned here. We're in great markets, leading positions in several large, fast- growing segments : diabetes; devices; diagnostics, including COVID testing; nutrition; emerging market, pharma. We have strong positions, brands, franchises across all of these.  So -- and to one of the questions, I think we're leading in the digital transformation that's going to be more patient-centric care, whether it's with biowearables, whether it's connected devices, remote monitoring, et cetera. And then you layer that diversification that I talked about in my opening comments, which I think is very unique, it maximizes our growth opportunities, and it does provide a natural hedge to some of these macro environment impacts that we're going to see from time to time. And that diversity is not just on the business mix, but customers, payer types, obviously, geographic footprint and a very strong and resilient supply chain.  So you translate all that into real strong, sustainable, strategic financial health, whether it's growing revenues, cash flows, dividends. We've got a rock-solid balance sheet. I talked about the opportunities that we have with it. So I think we're in a really good position strategically, financially, and I'm excited about all the growth opportunities that lie ahead of us. So with that, I'll wrap it up and I'll thank everybody for joining us today. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbot's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we will take your questions.  Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis, because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter. Earnings per share were $1.73, reflecting more than 30% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 17.5% on an organic basis in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals as well as Diagnostics, both with and without COVID testing-related sales. In addition to these strong results during the quarter, we continue to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth opportunities with regulatory approvals of new products and expanded indications of use along with continued market uptake of several recently launched products in attractive growth areas. I'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 13.5% in the quarter. EPD has now achieved double-digit organic sales growth in 3 of the last 4 quarters. Strong performance this quarter was led by double-digit growth across several countries and core therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, respiratory and CNS pain management. Turning to Nutrition, where our performance was mixed. Our Adult Nutrition business continues to perform at a high level with global organic sales growth of 11.5%, led by our Ensure and Glucerna brands. And we also achieved double-digit growth globally in our combined toddler nutrition products, which includes our market-leading PediaSure and Pedialyte brands. As you know, however, we initiated a voluntary recall in February of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our U.S. facilities. It's important to highlight as part of our quality system, we retain in-house samples of products that we ship to customers. Testing of retained samples related to this recall action by both Abbott and the FDA have all come back negative for the presence of the bacteria that cause the reported illnesses. Importantly, the FDA and CDC found that there is no genetic match between the strains of the bacteria identified in nonproduct contact areas of our facility and available samples obtained from customer complaints, suggesting a different source of contamination. And lastly, no salmonella was found in our factory or product and, therefore, the FDA ruled out any link to our facility. We hope these findings get parents, caregivers and other stakeholders renewed confidence in our products. We know the situation has further exacerbated industry-wide infant formula supply shortages. That's why we're doing everything possible to mitigate supply constraints by bringing in product from our FDA registered facility in Europe and ramping up production at our other U.S. plants. And of course, we're working very closely with the FDA on proactive actions and enhancements so that we can restart operations at the facility. Moving to Diagnostics, where sales grew 35%. COVID test sales were $3.3 billion in the quarter, more than 90% of which came from our rapid test, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally and ID NOW globally. Excluding COVID-related -- COVID testing-related sales, our Global Diagnostics sales grew 12% in the quarter, driven by the continued rollout of Alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expanding menus across our testing platforms. And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 11.5% in the quarter. This strong performance was led by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Electrophysiology. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter and the user base has now reached approximately 4 million users globally. In Cardiovascular Devices, while procedure volumes were negatively impacted by elevated COVID case rates early in the year, we saw a steady improvement in procedure trends as the case rates came down in the second half of the quarter, which has continued into April. In addition to improving market trends and our strong results, this was also another highly productive quarter for our pipeline. In the U.S., we received FDA approval for Aveir, our leadless pacemaker to treat patients with slow heart rhythms. In Japan, expanded reimbursement for Libre will now cover all people with diabetes who use insulin at least once a day. CardioMEMS received an expanded indication in the U.S. to treat more patients suffering from earlier stages of heart failure. And we received U.S. FDA clearance for the latest generation of our EnSite X system, which provides a 360-degree view of the heart for improved cardiac mapping. So in summary, we're achieving strong growth overall and across several areas of our business. As the first quarter progressed and COVID levels decreased, we saw a steady improvement in the hospital-based procedure trends, which has continued into April. And we continue to advance our pipeline with new products, indications and reimbursement coverage in several attractive growth areas. I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 17.5% on an organic basis, which was led by double-digit growth in Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceuticals along with global COVID testing-related sales of $3.3 billion in the quarter. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 7.7% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.1% of sales, which reflects higher than normal fall-through on COVID testing sales as a result of significant production volumes during the first quarter, partially offset by the impacts of the nutrition recall and somewhat higher-than-expected inflation on certain manufacturing and distribution costs in the quarter. Adjusted research and development investment was 5.6% of sales and adjusted SG&A investment was 23.1% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.5%. Before discussing our outlook for the full year, I want to provide an update on our strategic capital deployment initiatives completed in the first quarter, which included approximately $2.3 billion of share repurchases, $800 million of dividends, scheduled debt repayment of $750 million and $300 million of capital expenditures, which support future organic growth opportunities. We continue to generate strong cash flow, which provides the flexibility required to execute a well-balanced capital allocation strategy. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $4.70 remains unchanged. We now forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the mid- to high single digits, which is somewhat lower than our prior forecast of high single digits due to the recent recall event in Nutrition. It is important to note, excluding sales impacted by the recall, we continue to forecast total organic sales growth in the high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, excluding the impact of testing-related sales and areas of nutrition, not impacted by the recall. We forecast COVID testing-related sales of approximately $4.5 billion with a significant portion of these sales expected to occur in the first half of the year. We continue to -- we'll continue to update our COVID testing-related sales forecast 1 quarter at a time throughout the year as appropriate. Lastly, based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 3% on our full year reported sales. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe to start for Robert or Bob, you guys put up a good first quarter being on COVID testing sales had double-digit growth in most of the businesses. I was hoping maybe you can reconcile the strong 1Q and the reiterated guidance and walk us through some of the puts and takes and how to think about bridging the difference? Robert Ford : Sure, Robbie. I think you've been on these calls for a while. We rarely raised in Q1, I would say. And despite that, I mean, we've had a great start to the year as pointed out. And there's a lot of good things going on at the company. We talked a little bit about procedure recovery in the comments. We've seen good recovery in our device portfolio, especially in cardiovascular, seen routine diagnostic testing improving albeit a little bit slower than what we've seen in devices, but definitely the trend of recovery is there. .  EPD execution is going very well, like I said in the comments, 3 out of 4 quarters, double digit, strong COVID sales, both in the U.S. and internationally. I think that's an important aspect here is our international presence, too. Talked a little bit about the pipeline and the approvals, not just the recent approvals, but the performance of some of the recently launched products. Bob talked about our cash flow generation and the deployment of that cash flow. We're able to kind of share part of that cash flow with our shareholders, but also to continue to invest in the business. So there's a lot of good things going on here in the business, and -- but there are a couple of challenges that we're managing, and that's probably the piece there where the reconciliation that you're looking for is actually happening. First of all, obviously managing through the recall on the nutrition side, we're working with the FDA. And we've contemplated in that reiterated guidance, various scenarios here in terms of kind of restart dates and share recovery curves, et cetera. So it's simple to give an exact date right now as to when that restart starts. We're working closely with the FDA, but I see this more as a shorter-term challenge in the sense that once we align with restarting with the FDA then we'll begin to execute our strategy here in terms of coming back to market, resupplying the market and regaining the share. Probably the second other part here, which is I think is a little bit not unique to Abbott. And I think you'll probably see this across a lot of companies is just the macro environment right now is -- has definitely changed versus where we were in January. And it's gotten a little bit more challenging. So -- and we expect some of that macro environment, whether it's supply chain, et cetera, to kind of be a little bit more persistent throughout this year. So that being said, I wanted to see how these -- probably these 2 points here play out over the next couple of months, and we'll be in a better position to be able to assess that and on our guidance going forward after Q2. But like I said, there's a lot of great momentum in the business. Devices performing very well. Diagnostics performing very well. The parts of nutrition that weren't impacted by the recall continue to do very well.  I'm not a big fan of the -- exclude this, but for that statement, but I think in the context of how the business is performing, I mean if you exclude the COVID piece, which was pretty significant for us and then just look at the business without the base business, without the impacted nutrition products, our growth rate was about 11%. And I think that reflects the strength of the portfolio, the investments that we've made and the execution. So in that guidance, that reiteration of $470 million, we've absorbed, as Bob said, more FX headwinds, absorbed some challenges in supply chain, absorbed portions of the nutrition recall. So I think it's the right EPS guide right now in terms of where we are after Q1. Robert Marcus : Great. And maybe as a follow-up, I think a lot of investors are focused on the go forward, realizing that January and February weren't the strongest months due to some of the elevated Omicron levels. So we heard Johnson & Johnson yesterday talk about reaching pre-COVID volume levels in April. It sounds like you exited and continue to see strong growth coming out of the quarter and into second quarter. I was hoping maybe you could give us a little more color on just the volume trends you're seeing, particularly in devices and diabetes, which was one that missed the street a little bit in the quarter? And how you're seeing the geographic spread and any differences there? Robert Ford : Sure. I mean I think the storyline here was very similar, as I said in my comments. I mean it started off a little bit slower than we had anticipated in January, obviously, given Omicron and the surges there and the pressure that, that put on staff at hospitals. But definitely sequential improvement from a dollar perspective every month as we moved along the quarter, March was very strong. I've always talked about how we compare our businesses versus pre-pandemic levels to kind of avoid some of the comp issues that ultimately do exist. If you look at our Q1 '22 growth rate versus 2019, we were up about 7.3%. So well ahead of where we were in 2019. And that was pretty broad-based. Geographically, the U.S. was up 6%, again versus 2019. And international was up over 8% versus 2019, too. So I think our device business has performed very well, and we've seen that improvement as we went through the quarter. The cardiovascular side has done very well as I've kind of given those numbers, and March was really strong, too. I think it's -- part of it is recovery, Robbie, that we're seeing. But also -- I would also put in those numbers, I made these comments about recently launched products that we started launching last year. It's always a challenge to launch these new technologies in that COVID environment, but it was the right decision to make, and we're seeing good momentum on whether it's Amulet, Navitor in Europe, CardioMEMS, the rollout of EnSite X that began in Q4 of last year, our TriClip product. So I think all of that, it's the combination, I would say, of both recovery as the COVID cases subside, but also the new product launches and the pipeline that we put, which is driving this performance where, I'd say, we're ahead of where we were in 2019, having good growth rate in our cardio portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Robert, maybe back on the guidance question, right. The testing guidance was raised by $2 billion, right? That's perhaps $0.40 of upside and reiteration of the EPS, like what is offsetting the incremental tailwind from COVID rate? Like how much of this is FX, was this macro Russia versus the recall or inflationary pressures, I think, a little bit more granularity will be helpful. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, I mean I think you hit on the key points there. I mean inflation -- additional inflation pressures is impacting some of that. We've got a couple of hundred million dollars that we've contemplated throughout the rest of the year in terms of friction on supply chain costs, input costs, freight and distribution. The recall -- well, let me take a step back, the FX is probably about another about $0.05 of friction that we're having as we've seen the dollar strengthen and the rest of it is really coming from nutrition, but it's very difficult right now to be able to kind of pinpoint exactly. We've got a couple of different scenarios, as I said in the first question in terms of the restart and the curve. So we are seeing more COVID tests and more COVID sales. And that, like I said, is absorbing some of these challenges. Vijay Kumar : And then one on Libre. Sequentially, your revenue has declined. And I guess my question is you've been adding, I think, a couple of hundred thousand new patients starts. Is that new patient starts changing at all? How should we think about the incremental reimbursement in Japan? And was the seasonality or what drove the sequential Libre revenue trends? Robert Ford : Yes. I mean I think we see some of that from time to time here, especially as you go from Q4 to Q1, Vijay. We've seen that a couple of times. I'd say internationally, the biggest driver of that is actually FX that created that. We've seen good growth internationally from Libre getting close to 20% on a very large base. And in the U.S., you're going to see some timing patterns there in terms of wholesaler ordering. I like to look at scripts, both new-to-brand scripts and total Rx scripts here in the U.S. and the sequential Q1 to Q4, there's definitely growth there. So I think we've done a really good job in the U.S. We've grown our business in this quarter by 50%. Users now well over 1 million users. We've made the investments in the U.S., whether it's Salesforce, DTC advertising. I think the team is beginning to hit its stride over there. They know that I'm not satisfied. We always want to see more and believe that we can do more. But I think the U.S. is starting to kind of really hit its stride with those investments as the sales force gets deployed and establishes the relationships with what is new physicians that are getting introduced to CGM. So I think that's worked out very well. If I take a step back, though, and move away a little bit from the RXs and the sequential, I think one of the key things here to really take a look at is the evolution of the CGM market. And I'm starting to really see now what we had always envisioned this market to start to be, which is a market that is shifting from what traditionally was more of a type 1, more of a pumper -- insulin pump kind of connectivity play, which is an important segment, but really start to move and expand beyond that. And we're starting to see signs of that. And I think Libre is a big driver. The value proposition of Libre is a big driver, whether it's physicians and payers, quite frankly, starting to see the value of the sensing technology across a much broader set of patients. If you look at a U.S. base of patients, and we get to see this because we get to see the Rx data in terms of what medications the patients are using. And over 40% of our user base, which is pretty large in the U.S., is already type 2 non-intensive. And that, as I said, is really kind of an opportunity to expand this market and become a really strong growth driver. The Japan reimbursement that you just referenced, again, this goes back to a comment I made about. We see this as a mass market opportunity. So counter to maybe how we think about reimbursement in different segments of devices where you're thinking about price of reimbursement versus patient TAM, we're looking at patient TAM much more than we are on the pricing side. We've got great reimbursement in Japan, but to be able to have access to all insulin users in Japan with our product is a great opportunity for us. And then you're seeing the value proposition, again, really strong. There was a study that was published by U.K. NICE. And I think that, for me, is the ultimate validation of our strategy and the value proposition we offer where it was clearly shown to be extremely cost effective, whether you look at ICERs or Qualys in the U.K. by NICE and their view here of how this can benefit a lot of patients. So that for me is the real exciting part of Libre is we're really starting to see that evolution from the CGM market to become much more than kind of a niche play and much more mass market play. And I think we're starting to see evidence of that, whether it's new studies or reimbursement access or even seeing physicians primary care docs start to really embrace the prescription of CGM for type 2s. So... Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Congratulations on a strong start to the year. Rob and Bob, I just wanted to start with just a question on gross margins. The 1Q performance was the highest since 20 -- quarters in 2019. Just wanted to better understand the sustainability of this profile? 59.1% despite all the challenges in place in 1Q, and then -- and should investors be thinking that return to 2019 gross margin levels in that 59% range plus is achievable in the out years? And follow-up is on MitraClip. I just wanted to hear -- and Amulet, what have you learned in the early days, the Amulet launched as the #2 player in the U.S. left atrial appendage closure market that you can apply to your defense strategy starting this year, maybe carrying into next year when you're defending your MitraClip turf as the #1 player, assuming the U.S. [ PASCAL ] launch occurs in 2023? Robert Funck : Okay. Josh, I'll take the kind of the gross margin question. In the first quarter, our gross margin certainly benefited from the very high COVID testing sales. As I mentioned in my remarks, that actually, the fall-through on that was higher than we've seen in the past because of the production volumes that we had going through our plant, we're basically running full out on that. So our first quarter definitely benefited from that.  As we look at the rest of the year, obviously, we're going to have the impact of the nutrition recall and the inflation, the increased inflation that Robert mentioned. Obviously, inflation is not unique to us. As we said back in January, we incorporated a sizable amount in our guidance at that point in time. And what we've seen, and I think a lot of other companies have seen as kind of an increase in some of those headwinds. And so we've captured that in our guidance for the rest of the year. When I think out beyond this year and where gross margin goes, I mean, gross margin is something we focus on in the company constantly. We've got dedicated teams within each business that are focused on driving gross margin improvements. I mean, a lot's going to depend, I think, as we think out in the future, the evolution of inflation and supply chain dynamics and how those evolve over time, that will be a key component. And then obviously, as we grow the top line in our medical device business, that's accretive to the overall profile of the company. And so that's kind of where we see gross margin right now and potentially in the future. Robert Ford : Yes. On your question on MitraClip and Amulet, so I'll talk a little bit about MitraClip. I'd say the progression of MitraClip in the quarter was very similar to my commentary on our cardiovascular procedure, right? So we obviously had high COVID case kind of impacted but started to really accelerate growth towards the end of February and into March. So as those cases came down, we saw the improving growth rate. But I'll tell you, I mean, while the growth rate has been strong and it's been strong for a while, Josh, I don't think we've really been able to benefit yet from the FMR indication, which we got kind of right in the middle of COVID. And as part of that, and I talked a little bit about this, to be able to benefit from this pretty significant kind of market expansion opportunity that we had with incredible robust data from COAPT, you have to really start to work those patient referrals and the referral networks. And we began doing that when COVID took its first break, and then that got put on hold again when Delta and Omicron served. So I'm really looking forward and the team is kind of already putting in place that strategy, again, to reengage the patient referral network so that we can really take advantage of this indication, which is unique to us and will be unique to us for a while. Relating to competitive movements into the market, we just got to stay ahead. We've got to keep on investing in the product. So we've done that with MitraClip, staying ahead and iterating and improving on the performance of the product. We're investing in new trials. I talked about our investment that we're making in moderate risk surgery patients. That will be a great opportunity for us. And we have a great team, and we have great relationships and a strong mitral position. So not discounting the fact that we'll have competition. We've had competition in Europe for a couple of years already. Germany is probably the second largest global market, and our position there remains at an 80% market share. So I acknowledge that we will have competition, but we do -- we have established this mitral leadership position, and we intend to defend it because of all the investments that we've made to create this market. So that's what I would talk about MitraClip. I still think the best is still to come because I don't think we've been able to tap into the opportunity of the FMR indication. Regarding Amulet, listen, I think the team has done a really good job, again, reiterating the same kind of comments, a little bit challenged in the beginning of the quarter. And that was predominantly driven by the fact that we wanted to start the initial cases with every case being proctored. So difficult to move proctors throughout the U.S. and travel international, et cetera. So that slowed us down a little bit in the beginning of the year. But I'll tell you, the team has done -- we spent a lot of time and attention and focus with them in February and March. And the team has definitely had a really strong exit to Q1, caught up in terms of all the contract closes that we had established as part of our plan in Q1. So I think the commercial execution is doing really well, and that's supported really by the performance of the product. And once physicians have had an opportunity to get a couple of these implants done, it's a little bit of a different technique, but they feel comfortable with it and then they get the benefits of what the data shows is superior closure. And that's really because of our unique dual ceiling mechanism. So there was some data that came out -- late-breaking data that came out of the AACC, which talked about the importance of leaks and leaks matter, whether they're big leaks or whether they're small leaks, they do matter. And even the small leaks were associated with an increase in thromboembolic events. So I think we're in a good position now with Amulet. I'm pleased with the commercial team and what they're doing in the clinical team, and we've got opportunities here to grow. I think momentum is building with Amulet. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : So Robert, 2 high-level questions for me. One, I'll push my luck a little bit and see if we can get any preliminary thoughts on 2023. You're getting a meaningful testing benefit this year, which may not materialize next year. So how do you feel about your ability to grow margins and earnings next year as testing demand drops? And I have one follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, we had a really strong quarter regarding testing, Larry. And I think to answer your question, I think you have to kind of look at what's going on a little bit right now in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., we saw cases decline pretty significantly in February. But I think we all agree that some of those cases that are being reported aren't covering all cases because of the use of the at-home testing systems, right, that are currently available. So I think that's part of the process that we're seeing as testing -- as we're moving more into this kind of endemic state. And as we move to this endemic state, listen, vaccines have been incredibly powerful to be able to prevent serious illness to be able to protect the hospitals and the hospital system, but it's really testing that really allows us to kind of move to this endemic state and kind of live our day-to-day and it's more about surveillance and screening and checking. So -- and I think our product has done really well here. It's maintained a kind of preferred status here in the U.S., even with a pretty significant increase in product coming into the country, whether it's ease of use, its shelf life, the reliability it has, its studies, et cetera. So I think that, that's an important aspect as we go into 2023 is do we have confidence that even in an endemic state does testing continue? And I would say, yes, it does continue. One portion that doesn't get a lot of attention is our international testing business. 50% of our sales in March of COVID tests came from the international markets. And I'd say, similar sense there of governments investing in testing and coming to Abbott as one of the preferred suppliers. So I think that to answer your question, obviously, there's a certain amount that you can't overcome, right? But I do think that as we go into next year, we'll have a portion of our testing business that will look more like a flu kind of respiratory kind of endemic state. And I think that's going to be important as we continue to grow earnings. And then on top of that, like I said, the focus of our medical device business, the investments we've made in our diagnostic systems and increasing the test menus over there. So I expect our base business to continue to grow very strongly. Yes, it's a little bit early regarding 2023, but we are planning. We are looking. We are looking at where we're going to be able to kind of grow and I'd say there will be some COVID business next year. I think we're in probably the strongest position to be able to kind of capitalize and lead in that market. And then our base business is going to do very strongly next year with all the investments we've made and new product pipeline that we've got. Larry Biegelsen : And Robert, you're in a unique position with your strong balance sheet. I saw you mentioned on the call, you bought back, I think, $2.5 billion in stock this quarter. What are your updated thoughts on M&A? And if you can't find attractive assets, are you going to continue to return cash to shareholders like we saw this past quarter? Robert Ford : Sure. On the M&A side, yes, I mean, I'll sound like a broken record here, Larry. I mean we're always looking. We're always studying. We're always looking at ways to be able to add to the company and add to our business, but it needs to be strategic. And from that perspective, I don't want to dilute our growth rate. I don't want to dilute our profiles. We need to make sure that we're looking at assets that will be additive to our growth into our profile. So at least the top line. So that's always there, and we're always looking. Regarding the approach, listen, it's always a balanced approach, Larry. We're generating strong cash flow. We got a lot of financial flexibility here. We'll return $3 billion when you -- in terms of dividend this year, Bob talked about what we've done regarding buybacks. And we're always going to look at this kind of balanced approach. We've made investments in our organic opportunities for growth because I believe that those are great returns for our shareholders, whether it's Libre, MitraClip, expansion of our medical devices, diagnostics, those are all opportunities that deliver great returns for our shareholders, and we'll take that balanced approach. And if there is an opportunity for more, we'll do more. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : I'd like to circle back a little bit to the nutritional business. A lot of the feedback that I get from investors is some level of concern regarding brand name, brand damage, if you will. And I'm curious your thoughts on what it would take to sort of revamp this business up? Robert Ford : Sorry, you're referring to Nutrition business? Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : Yes. Robert Ford : Okay. Listen, we've got a very robust manufacturing network and a robust quality system. Obviously, there's a shortage of product in the market. I highlighted some of the things that we're doing to be able to kind of resupply the market. A key aspect of that is going to be the restart, and we're in that process. We've got a strong brand with Similac. We've maintained a lot of contracts. We've been able to supply those contracts even with a little bit of this shortage. So I feel confident in our team's ability here to look at once we get restarted to be able to resupply the market and build back our share. We had just launched a new product last year -- end of last year with a blend of 5 HMOs and that's a significant advancement. And we were expecting that based on everything that we had studied and seen was going to be a big growth driver for us and kind of brand enhancers. So I think that's going to be important. And yes, we'll have to make some investments as we go back to the market. But I'd say historically, when some of these issues have happened in the past, whether it's Abbott or other manufacturers, share does recover. The question is just kind of the timing and the curve of that recovery, but share do come to recover and you can look at past situations with other competitors and even with us. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : And as a follow-up, forgive me for asking it this way. What's next? I mean, I don't think we're going to be talking about COVID testing in a year. I hope we're not going to be talking about it. But how do you see the sort of forward momentum of the company? Big picture? Robert Ford : Yes. Well, yes, I don't think we're going to be talking about COVID testing the way we're talking about it today or how we talked about it in the past year. But like I told Larry, I mean, I do think that there's going to be an opportunity for COVID testing to play a role in this kind of endemic state. And as I've said in the past also, what COVID has allowed us to do is to further accelerate what we believe was a key trend in diagnostics and point-of-care diagnostics, which is the expansion and the decentralization of that testing outside of the lab into pharmacies, into people's homes and it being connected. So I think that -- COVID has accelerated that, I guess, I would say. And we're obviously building menus where we'll be able to add to the ID NOW instrument, more panels, more different tests. Remember, when we started the pandemic, we had about 20,000 kind of instruments that's now fivefold in terms of the opportunity that we have to be able to expand menu into basically an asset that's been capitalized and deployed into the market. So that's what we've been working on from that perspective on the, I guess, I would say, on the rapid testing side on the decentralized testing side. I'd say going back to the device portfolio, I mean there's still a lot of what next in our pipeline of products that we've just launched that are still in the early innings here. One of them that we got approved this quarter, which I'm really excited about, is Aveir and our leadless pacemaker. I think this is going to be a great opportunity to kind of reignite growth back in our CRM business. I mean we've seen an improvement already with the existing portfolio and had a 4% growth this quarter. But I think Aveir is a real kind of game changer for our CRM portfolio. Obviously, the single chamber is a smaller part of the market. We know that it's about 15%. But I think when you're coming second to the market, you get to observe what needs to -- what could be addressed that maybe the first generation didn't do. And I think that our product whether it's retrievability, its ability to be retrieved, it's longer-lasting battery. Right now, it's about 2x product that's on the market. But I think what's really exciting about this is its ability to upgrade to a dual chamber device. So it's upgradability is what we're hearing extremely big interest from the physician community. So I think that's a great opportunity for us that I think is really going to start to show as we evolve our trial for dual chamber and begin to collect data there. I think that's going to be a great opportunity for our CRM portfolio. I look at CardioMEMS as another great opportunity that we have just really just started. The expanded indication is going to really open up the market. I've seen some of the implant trends that we've seen post-expansion indication, and that gives me a lot of excitement about what this product can be. We talked about Amulet. I think that the TAVR piece is one that, as I've said in the past, we're investing. I think Navitor is an extremely competitive product, and we're seeing that in Europe as we've launched it and been 6 months in the market now. So there's great opportunities over there. Libre 3 is an opportunity for us, not only in the U.S., but in Europe to continue to expand the market. I think Lingo, as I said in the last call, is another great opportunity that is really in the early stages. But look at using our biowearable sensors outside of diabetes and looking at opportunities there. So I think we have a lot of what next that are truly early in their early stages. And then on top of all the products that we've been talking about right now also. So I'm excited about the what next. Operator : Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Travis Steed : Curious on the inflation supply chain, sounds like it's gotten about $200 million worse than the $500 million you had built into the P&L, just to confirm that. I'm curious what you're seeing the biggest pain points? Is it wages, raw materials, shipping costs and expectations on when that could start to ease to some degree? Or how you're thinking for a potential offset with price? Robert Funck : Yes. Travis, I'll take the question. This is Bob. So as we said back in January, we did incorporate a sizable impact into our 2022 guidance, which was about $500 million on the gross margin line. And as Robert mentioned, we've now incorporated an additional $200 million in gross margin impact in our current guidance. The biggest impact we're seeing is really on logistics and commodities and some other manufacturing inputs. It's not so much on the labor front. Labor is a smaller portion of our total product cost. So it's really on the commodities. In terms of when this will ease and change, I mean, that's a very -- I think there's a lot of things that affect that and where the -- where inflation may go. We do know that historically, on commodities, we do see cycles. We do see commodity costs go up, but they also come down. And we would expect at some point, and it's very difficult to kind of call exactly when that will be, we will see some of the inflationary pressures subside. Travis Steed : And then given your presence in China, I would just kind of love to hear your thoughts on both China from a procedure standpoint and also a supply chain standpoint, just given how much of the business you have there? And any thoughts on the progress you're making with Libre 3 and the FDA would be great, too. Robert Ford : Sure. I think regarding China, I saw a little bit of an inverse in terms of what we saw in all the other geographies where started off pretty well in the quarter. And then as the lockdown started to occur, specifically in Shanghai towards the end of February and into March, started to kind of see the impact of that in our procedures. We look at our testing platforms as kind of an early indicator and a proxy. So we saw those go down also during the month of April -- during the month of March. And I'd say, over the last 2 weeks in April, started to see a recovery of those diagnostic testing. So I think what we saw was a lot of the testing that was being done in the major kind of cities was shifted over to kind of PCR testing, together with rapid testing and that obviously impacted some of the routine hospital testing. But we're starting to see that now probably 2 solid weeks of kind of positive trend back in the right direction. Still not at the level we were before the lockdowns, but definitely starting to move in the right direction there. So I would expect just based on patterns that we've seen in the past that we're starting to kind of move to sequential week-over-week improvements in the procedures. And not all procedures are the same. Some of them return faster. Some of them have a different kind of recovery curve. But I do expect kind of the impact that we saw in March and a little bit in the beginning of April and devices start to kind of improve. Sorry, you had a question on Libre 3? Travis Steed : Yes, Libre 3. Any update on how the progress is working with the FDA or what the label might look like? Just any additional color would be great. Robert Ford : Sure. Like I mentioned in the call, we filed as an ICGM. I don't have much to kind of update you there regarding that. I will say that we have moved Libre 3 in Europe into -- from kind of more of a limited rollout in Germany a while back to kind of more of an accelerated conversion from Libre 2 to Libre 3. And I think the process started really well in Germany. We got initial feedback from physicians, very positive feedback from the reimbursement system also. And that gave us the confidence here to kind of really begin to accelerate this market transition in Libre 3. We did that in Libre 2 also when we moved from Libre 1 to Libre 2 in Germany. That took us about a year. I think it's going to be faster than that with Libre 3. And we've got over 90% reimbursement coverage for Libre 3 in Germany. So that's now moved into high gear, not only in Germany, but for the rest of the year. So I'm focused a lot on what we can do with Libre in the countries that we do have it approved. And right now, everything that we're seeing is that it is a very, very compelling product. Scott Leinenweber : Okay. Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Matthew Miksic : Just in the context of some of these new products, I did want to maybe follow up with just a level set expectations, for example, the Avidity rollout and menu expansion, very strong growth in the quarter. Robert, if you could maybe talk about what's the duration of this rollout? I know it started into the pandemic. And what does that look like through this year and potentially through next year? And then I know you touched this a few times here about Amulet. Just love to get your updated thoughts on where you think share could go in the next year, 18 months? You've made some comments in Q4. I know the pace is picking up here in the U.S.? Any numbers you could put around your thoughts there would be super helpful. Robert Ford : Sure. I mean Alinity is a multiyear strategy and rollout here, Matt. We're doing it not only with immunoassay, we're doing with clinical chemistry, we're doing with hematology. We're doing it with transfusion. This has never been done at this kind of scale to be able to really recycle all of our systems. So I think that if you look at the way the market is set up, the contracts are lasting between 7 to 10 years. So on any given year, you've got 15% of the market that's coming up for an RFP. So regarding its legs like you're asking, I mean, I still think that we've got multiple, multiple years here. The COVID pandemic definitely slowed that down in terms of the renewal cycles, a lot of hospitals focusing on just dealing with the COVID. But I guess what I would say is there's plenty more to come. The key here is the balance between -- in that 15% that comes up for RFP, what's renewable to an existing customer and what's kind of share gain. And I think the team has done a really good job at being able to look at having a real strong balance about not just defending the base, and we've done that pretty well. So I'd say, 9 out of 10 accounts, we've been able to maintain. And then if you look at the business that's coming up for grabs, I'd say our win rate here is over 50%. So when you think about that math, retaining 90% and winning 50% of the new businesses, that's what ultimately drives our top line growth. And then once you put those instruments in, then the key aspect here is to be able to expand the menu use of those instruments while they're in an account, right? You've got the capital deployed, you've got the service cost that's kind of been deployed there. So everything we can do to be able to add new menus, new tests, et cetera, is accretive from both the top and the bottom line. So that's a big focus of the team on the R&D side is to be able to expand the menus concurrent to what I would say is kind of placement strategy that we have with the new systems. So Amulet -- on your question on Amulet, listen, I think we continue to capture share. We estimate that we're in double-digit share position here in the U.S. Longer term, I would say, our aspiration is to build a significant share position. The European market is much smaller than the U.S. market. In that market, we have a 50 share. So I think the key thing here is for us is to -- every time you're a new player coming into the market, you have different technology. We believe ours is superior, but it's different in terms of how it gets used, how it gets implanted. So you need to make sure that the physicians as you roll it out learn how to use our product, our implant, our system. And from there, you build off there. So I think we'll be looking at not only expansion into new accounts, but also utilization in existing accounts. And that's the piece that I'm actually getting very excited about it. As we've looked at the accounts that we started back in September and October, we're starting to see nice share movement over there. So that's very exciting for us. So let me just close here. I think we've had a very strong start to the year, like I said in my prepared comments. We've reaffirmed our guidance that we set back in January, absorbing, I would say, impact of the nutrition recall, which we're working hard on to restart. Other parts and attrition are doing very well, and I expect them to continue to do very well. We're absorbing, as Bob said, challenges with inflation in the supply chain that many companies I know are facing, and we're absorbing some headwinds on FX side. That being said, there's a lot of great things that are going on at Abbott in the company, a lot of positives. I talked about them in the beginning of the call. And I expect all of that positive to continue and to that momentum to continue to build on that business. Like I said, excluding COVID, excluding some of the recall products, our base business grew 11% in the quarter and the team is focused on building off that and building off that momentum. So thanks. Scott Leinenweber : Very good. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter. Earnings per share were $1.43, reflecting more than 20% growth compared to last year. Sales increased nearly 14.5% on an organic basis in the quarter led by growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics and Medical Devices. Based on our performance for the first 6 months, we increased our earnings per share guidance to at least $4.90 for the full year. This speaks to the strength and resilience of our diversified health care model as well as strong execution in this challenging macro environment. We continue to advance our R&D pipeline and strengthen our long-term growth platforms with several new product approvals. Our supply chain has remained resilient, and our financial health remains strong. I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob, and I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased more than 9% in the quarter. Strong performance this quarter was led by double-digit growth across several countries, including China, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Vietnam. EPD continues to execute and perform at a very high level in a dynamic environment, achieving double-digit organic sales growth over the past 1.5 years, including more than 11% organic growth for the first half of this year. Moving to Diagnostics, where sales grew over 35% in the quarter. COVID test sales were $2.3 billion in the quarter, more than 95% of which came from rapid tests, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally and ID NOW globally. As we had predicted some time ago, rapid testing has become widely accepted and has proven to be a very important tool in combating the virus due to its affordability and accessibility, including at-home testing. And while vaccines have been shown to play an important role in reducing severity of outcomes, with the emergence of new variants that escape immunity, rapid tests have become the best tool we have to help people quickly and easily identify new cases and quarantine to help slow and prevent transmission. As you know, forecasting COVID testing demand beyond the near term has been challenging. As such, our forecast for the next few months contemplates a modest approaching endemic-like amount of testing sales. We are in regular discussions with governments around the world, including the U.S., for surveillance testing needs and to ensure capacity is available and ready, if we see another surge this winter. If that were to happen, we have a lot of manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and internationally to help meet testing needs. I'll now turn to Nutrition, where, as you know, we initiated a voluntary recall in February of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our U.S. facilities. Earlier this month, we resumed partial production at that facility, starting with our specialty formula EleCare and metabolic formulas. We are in the final phases of testing to restart Similac production. As a reminder, once we begin production, it takes several weeks for product to reach store shelves. That said, we will do everything possible to accelerate delivery of product to retailers, so families can have access to the formula they need as soon as possible. We've already started to see some share recovery at retail over the past couple of months, as we leveraged our global manufacturing network to increase supply to the U.S., including importing product from our FDA registered plant in Ireland. We also began importing product from Spain after receiving informed discretion from the FDA that expanded the allowance for imports. As I said in April, it's important to note that the results of the investigation from the FDA, CDC and Abbott concluded no evidence linked our formulas to any infant illnesses or deaths, and there is no new information to suggest otherwise. We take this matter very seriously, and we're making a number of enhancements to our operations at the impacted manufacturing plant. We're also taking steps across our manufacturing network to expand capacity and redundancy. We're committed to set the standard in industry on quality and safety and to reearn the trust of the families that depend on us. Across our broader Nutrition business, global sales in Adult Nutrition increased 5% in the quarter, including more than 7.5% growth internationally led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. And lastly, I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. In cardiovascular devices, sales growth was led by Structural Heart and Heart Failure. While cardiovascular procedure trends continued to improve, growth in the quarter was somewhat more modest than what we had anticipated back in April due to several factors, most notably health care staffing challenges, COVID surges and lockdowns in China that were implemented as part of their efforts to control the spread of the virus. We expect these dynamics to improve in the second half of the year. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, and our user base now exceeds 4 million users globally. During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our Medical Device portfolio with innovative new products, most notably U.S. FDA clearance of our FreeStyle Libre 3 continuous glucose monitoring system, which is the world's smallest and thinnest wearable glucose sensor that provides results with the highest level of accuracy in the industry. And U.S. approval of Aveir, our leadless pacemaker for the management of slow heart rhythms, Aveir was specifically designed to be retrievable if the device ever needs to be removed and expandable to a dual-chamber device, which is currently under development if the therapy needs to evolve over time. So in summary, our diversified health care model continues to prove highly resilient in a dynamic macro environment. We're achieving strong growth across several areas of the portfolio and making good progress restarting our nutrition manufacturing facility. And as a result of our strong performance through the first 6 months, we're raising our EPS guidance for the year. I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 14.3% on an organic basis, which was led by strong growth in Diagnostics, Established Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.3 billion in the quarter. During the second quarter, sales were negatively impacted by a voluntary recall and manufacturing shutdown in February of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our U.S. plants. Excluding COVID testing-related sales and the U.S. sales associated with the recalled products, Abbott sales increased 6.2% on an organic basis in the second quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 4.2% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.7% of sales, which reflects the impacts of the recent nutrition recall and incremental inflation we saw in certain manufacturing and distribution costs in the quarter. Adjusted R&D investment was 5.8% of sales, and adjusted SG&A investment was 24.4% of sales in the second quarter. Lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.5%.  Turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. We forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the mid- to high single digits. It is important to note, excluding products impacted by the nutrition recall, we forecast total organic sales growth in the high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing-related sales and areas of nutrition not impacted by the recall. We forecast COVID testing-related sales of $6.1 billion, which includes year-to-date sales through June of $5.6 billion and projected sales of approximately $500 million over the next few months. We will continue to update our COVID testing-related sales forecast 1 quarter at a time as appropriate. Lastly, based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 5% on our full year reported sales. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Congrats on a good quarter. Robert, maybe to start -- maybe I'll get a little greedy here since we're only sitting in July, and half of '22 is done. But I think the focus for investors is quickly shifting to next year, and there's a lot of moving pieces going on in 2022, a lot of assumptions we have to make in the go forward of 2023. Where is COVID testing? How fast does Nutrition come back? And how steady can the Device business be going forward? So there's a lot of uncertainty out there of where numbers should sit and how to start thinking about the business for next year. Any thoughts you have at this point would be really helpful. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, I think there's a lot of uncertainty for everybody regarding 2023. I think you've kind of highlighted some of the aspects as it relates to our business here. But the macro environment still is pretty challenging, and I don't think it's unique to us. Obviously, there's significant inflation, and seems like there's a pretty significant, call it, a commodity super cycle for us. There's health care staffing challenges, you hear about that. And then, obviously, a strong U.S. dollar. So all those kind of combinations are the challenges that a lot of companies are going to face. And if you look at a lot of the financial and consumer indicators, retail, housing, auto, et cetera, those tend to point towards an increased risk here of recession. So what I would say is, historically, in that macro environment, health care has proven to be pretty resilient. And whether it's the durability of these essential procedures and products, I mean, you can only defer them somewhat. A large portion of the health care spend is government-funded, and we've got a diversified model that's proved itself to be very resilient in this kind of environment. So at a macro level, I think those are the headwinds that we're all facing and we'll all be facing. You mentioned COVID as a factor here. It's interesting. Last year at this time, we were talking about how COVID would -- COVID testing would move away, but we've actually shipped just as an amount of tests in the first 6 months of this year compared to all of last year. So I think that we're going to need to see how the cases evolve, Robbie, especially during the winter and fall months over here. And obviously, I don't think it's prudent to forecast a winter surge. But like I said, we've got capacity to be able to deal with that. So those are some of the key factors here that we're looking at. Nutrition that you mentioned, we're recovering pretty nicely, I would say, versus where we originally thought we were going to be back in April. A lot of focus on restarting the manufacturing site. We've recovered already a good portion of the share that we lost. And obviously, we continue to see that moving forward positively. So on the flip side, though, what I would say is that we're not going to just sit still over the next couple of months and wait for these macro kind of factors here to play out, right? We're taking a very proactive approach on the elements that we can control and that we can impact. We're taking price where we can, and we've seen that in our consumer base businesses. These are businesses, because of the strength of our brands, that we've been able to do that and pass it on. We're also looking at other areas that we can -- or that historically, we haven't necessarily looked at in terms of price. We're looking at our cost structure. I talked about this in previous calls, too, and we've got a program in place now where we're looking at our cost structure. The hurdles in terms of investment have obviously increased given this macro environment. We're not going to put any risk to our long-term growth platforms, but we're definitely looking at our cost structure and see where we can improve. And the inventory is important, as we move into this inflationary period here. So we're ensuring that we've got the right amount of inventory. So I put all that together, Robbie. We've got macro headwinds that everybody else has. Regarding Nutrition, I think our performance is well aligned to where we planned and where I see us ending up end of the year is ultimately where our forecast -- the forecast that we laid out. COVID testing is one that, to simply assume, that there won't be any COVID testing next year. We've never believed that. The question is just your ability to forecast beyond 3 to 6 months, that's the challenge. So fundamentally, I think our business remains very strong. We've got leading positions in attractive long-term growth markets, strong pipeline, and I'm sure we'll talk about some of that today also. We've got a lot of ongoing, upcoming launch activity and a strong balance sheet that provides us a lot of strategic and financial flexibility. So it's difficult to pin a number on it right now, Robbie. But at a high level, those are the elements that we're working with and, ultimately, like to see some of these elements play out over the next couple of months here. Robert Marcus : Great. Maybe just as a follow-up to that, Robert. You were talking about the cost structure at Abbott, and this is something we're hearing from basically everyone, that inflation, supply chain, et cetera. You're in this enviable position where you've probably grown operating margins more than anyone else in medtech since the start of COVID. A lot of that has been from the benefit of COVID testing sales, which are at healthy margins and still healthy reinvestment against that. So as we think about your operating margins going forward and you reevaluating your cost base here, I just -- it's a difficult question and it's been a while for medtech investors to see anything but just margins going straight up. So how do you want investors to start thinking about where your base operating margin is maybe potentially of COVID testing sales slowdown in the future? Robert Ford : Yes. I always appreciate you like to get at the next year's number in a couple of different ways, Robbie. I guess, I would say on the cost structure piece, I don't necessarily fully agree with you, the way you characterized it in terms of COVID being the ultimate driver here. I think we made a lot of progress on our gross margins historically, whether it was in Devices and in Nutrition. So as the Device business continues to grow, that profile of that business is accretive, and you've seen our growth rates in that business over these last couple of years. So that helps the margin. Our biggest challenge, I would say, from a gross margin perspective is really on the inflation side. Yes, we're seeing input cost go up probably more on the commodity side, so impacting EPD, impacting Nutrition, less so, I would say, in Devices and Diagnostics. Yes, there's some noise that happens here with one supplier -- another supplier, and we deal with it. But the real challenge we've had, I would say, over the last kind of 6 months here has been on the Nutrition side. And part of that is -- some of it is commodities. So we're going to have to see how those look like over the next kind of couple of months, seeing some slowing down of some commodities, but that's the biggest kind of driver there. But the other part of the Nutrition is, I would say, cost that I don't anticipate to be there next year. So for example, we're paying WIC rebates for competitive products since April -- actually, since March when we initiated the recall. And as we restart production in the facility, I don't assume that, that will continue. I made statements in my opening comments about bringing product in from overseas. We brought a lot of formula from overseas, and that's all airfreight. And you know the story on freight and distribution. So once that facility starts up and running, I don't anticipate to see those same kind of freight expenses from overseas shipments. And we put some money towards brand recovery. And I think that, that was an investment that's necessary to get our share back in position that we need as we go into next year. So that being said, as I said, we're going to look at our cost structure. We're going to look at areas that have a higher hurdle now for passing an investment hypothesis or thesis, and we're going to -- we'll take action where we need to take action. So that's how I'd characterize our margin. Operator : And our next question comes from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : I was hoping to start with a follow-up on the raise of the 2022 EPS guidance floor and just better understand the puts and takes. I think there are some questions around the $0.30 beat in 2Q and the $0.20 increase, again, realizing that it is a floor. But it seems like a lot of that kind of guess $0.10 delta is driven by the move in the U.S. dollar in July. But just wanted to better understand the puts and takes and how you guys arrived at the increase that you did. I have one follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. Yes. I think you'll see -- I mean, we've seen a lot of companies kind of beat their Q2 and either maintain their guidance for the full year or actually reduce it. And we looked at our numbers very carefully, and we basically looked at the strength of our base business. So if you exclude AN, our nutrition -- the parts of the Nutrition business that was recalled, we're growing high single digits, and we continue to see that kind of growth rate going forward. So between the strength of the base business and the COVID sales, we then felt that we had enough power here to navigate and push through some of these macro headwinds that are pretty significant, right? Inflation is a big element there. We had some costs. When we gave initial guidance in January, we increased that in our April call. And we've assumed another couple of hundred million dollars of inflation since that number that we provided in April. So that's one element that we're absorbing, I guess. The, what I would call, health care staffing challenges, COVID cancellations, the lockdown issues that we saw in Q2, especially, I'd say, on our Core Lab business and EP in China, for example, those are being absorbed also. And then currency, as you referenced, pretty dramatic strengthening here of the U.S. dollar. So we've assumed all of that. And as I said also to Robbie, we've had to factor in some additional costs on the nutrition side, whether it's the WIC rebate, the freight and distribution, some of the investments we're making to support share recovery. So you put those 2 together -- those 2 elements together on the macro on nutrition side and then you offset that with our base business and COVID sales, and those -- that's really the element there, Josh. And as you said, since the beginning of the pandemic, we've gotten to at least floor-like guidance here, and that's what $4.90 is. It's a floor right now. Could that be better? Yes, it could. There could be elements that could make that number be better. But on top of absorbing all these incremental headwinds here, inflation, currency, making some of the investments we need on nutrition, we're still able to raise our full year guidance. Joshua Jennings : And just one follow-up on the Medical Devices business, and it's encouraging to hear you talk about kind of quick improvement in the back half, and you did have that tough comp in 2Q. But are you able to share any high-level color just on elective procedure trends throughout the quarter in 2Q, just a month-over-month improvement did you see? And then anything you can share on color in July? And just wondering, you caught a couple of the headwinds that you saw in 2Q for hospitals and the challenges that they're facing to accelerate elective procedure volumes in the second half. But what do you think the biggest challenge is? And do you think the hospitals are well equipped to overcome those? Robert Ford : Yes, sure. I think you mentioned there, I mean, Q2 last year was a pretty significant revenue for a lot in medtech, so there is that comp aspect there. But second quarter procedures and volumes, if I look at Abbott's procedure volumes and sales, they're actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. And there was sequential growth from Q2 to Q1, over 7% in the U.S. and a little bit lower internationally. So the aspect here is that we are seeing growth and -- but it was a little bit more modest than what we had anticipated back in April, right? And then I think there's really 3 factors there. One of them, as I said, in the U.S., specifically, I think the staffing challenges were a factor there. And as people tested positive, while they didn't have to go to the hospital and they could just stay at home, that had an impact in some of the procedures that there's a little bit more planning towards. So the good news is we know what those procedures are, we know where they are, and we've got an opportunity to follow up on them like we did last year and following up on all the procedures that got pushed out. So internationally, I think you saw some similar headwinds there, but I think the biggest headwind for us was China and the lockdowns that occurred there. And then the third factor for us was we had some back order and that was really due to the timing of input material availability. So in terms of when you receive the materials to build the product, now we are building inventory, and I don't anticipate that to be the case going forward in the second half. So those are really our fact -- those are really the facts that had our Device business a little bit more modest than what we predicted in April. I think those get better. One, we've got launch activity. So -- and I'm sure we'll talk about some of those also, products that we've launched that will gain in momentum in the second half. In talking to a lot of the U.S. systems, they've just got to figure out better how to staff and to do more planning, and that might involve maybe looking at having more procedures booked because you know that there's a certain amount of cancellations that will happen. So I think that will get better also as the hospitals understand these dynamics. So I'm excited about the device portfolio in terms of the second half, not only because of some of these issues, which I think will get better, but also because of our pipeline and the products we're launching and the execution. Operator : And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Robert, can you hear me okay? Robert Ford : Yes, I can, Larry. Larry Biegelsen : You'd cut out a little bit. So 2 for me, I wanted to start with Libre. Robert, just a multipart question here on Libre. Another nice quarter. Any -- how should we think about the Libre 3 launch in the U.S.? Should we expect it to be kind of a gradual rollout like we saw with Libre 2? And how are you feeling about resolving the vitamin C interaction issue? It sounds like you guys have made some good progress there. And just lastly, international was a little softer than we expected. Is this just kind of a law of large numbers? Or is this just a timing issue in terms of the full rollout of Libre 3? And I did have one follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. I think Libre 3, we're very excited. We've had very good success in Germany in terms of upgrading the base and then with the benefits of Libre 3 actually seeing some conversions from competitive systems. So the U.S. launch is going to be exciting for the U.S. team. It will be the only CGM with a sub-8% MARD. And that launch process is underway, but it is a little bit more gradual. So we're going to work to get on to pharmacy contracts, PBM contracts, managed care contracts, et cetera. So we're building inventory. We're familiarizing the physicians with the product. But given what I've seen in Europe, I think this is a great opportunity for our U.S. business, which, by the way, did really well this quarter, right, even without Libre 3. We grew 53% in the second quarter, and I actually think that we can maintain that 30% to 40% growth rate in the U.S. even without Libre 3. So I think that's going to be an important growth driver for us towards the end of the year and as we go into 2023. I do think, Larry, that CGM is a little different. I mean, we have it in devices, but the model, at least in the U.S., is very pharma-like and -- where patient out-of-pocket, coinsurance, co-pays, contracts, et cetera, they play a big role in understanding those, and the interdependencies of those are very important. I think in an environment where employers and consumers are going to be looking more closely at managing their expenses, I think the value proposition of Libre is going to be even stronger. Regarding your question on vitamin C, fixed, yes. We have done the work to be able to address that. We've made very good progress. I'm going to provide further updates over time. But obviously, this relates only to the U.S. We're actually going to be launching an AID system in Europe with our partners in Europe in Q4 with Libre 2. So -- but you'll get more updates on that. I think that the exciting piece on the pump connectivity, though, is what we announced in June at the ADA with a dual sensor, a glucose-ketone sensor that's under development, that's received breakthrough designation from the FDA. The scientific advisers that I've spoken to, both in the U.S. and international, believe that this is going to become the go-to sensor for pump connectivity and -- just because of the ability to bring in the ketone measurement and perfect even more of those algorithms. So I think this is going to be an ideal sensor for existing pump companies and even for new pump manufacturers. Regarding your question on international, there's a little bit of timing there, I would say. Well, it's 2 parts, a little bit of timing from -- in Germany as we convert to Libre 3 and the mechanism is in place there. And then there was some FX headwind that impacted a lot of our international businesses. So did that cover all for you, Larry? Larry Biegelsen : That was very comprehensive. Really appreciate it. Just for my follow-up, Robert, I know I've asked this a lot on recent calls, but you're sitting on a lot of cash. And we have seen a recent re-rating of valuations. So are you starting to see more opportunities? Any color on deal size that you're looking at? And I think some investors are saying, when COVID testing comes down, you might have a gap in terms of earnings that you need to fill. So how important is it to find an accretive deal to offset potential decline in COVID testing? Robert Ford : Well, on the COVID testing side, I mean, I guess, we'll have to kind of see how things play out right now. I mean, I guess, that was the same comment last year. And as I said, we're selling more. We're probably selling more what we sold more in the first 6 months here versus last year. So regarding your comment, though, on the M&A side, yes, I don't think anything has really changed there. I mean, obviously, valuations have obviously come down somewhat. And we've got the capacity, as you said, in our balance sheet and that flexibility. But the macro environment is -- just because the valuation has come down, I mean, it's challenging and dynamic for all the companies, even the ones that have seen these valuations come significantly down. So I think we -- while we do have cash, I still think we need to be strategically and financially disciplined here to be mindful of when we're assessing these potential targets and have they gotten to the right point given some of these macro environments that are going to be playing out. So I think the market needs to stabilize for a period of time here, Larry, before I think a lot of management teams and their Board to become a little more comfortable with the reset of their valuations and their financial outlook. That being said, yes, I'd say the level of study, the level of review, the level of analysis on potential targets has definitely increased over the past 4, 5 months here. And I've been clear about the areas that we're looking at and the kind of types of transactions we would be interested of, but it always goes back to does it make sense strategically and does it make sense financially. So nothing has changed yet. Operator : And our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : I'm going to put them all upfront. Some questions regarding your Structural Heart franchise. Could you give us sort of a state of the union or update on where you are on some key products, MitraClip, Portico and Amulet? And then just as a follow-up to the previous question, could you remind us where you are on share repurchases and your view towards if you're not using the cash for M&A, what you will be using the cash for? Robert Ford : Sure. On the Structural Heart side, I talked about how this is such an important division for us and the focus that we've had there. So I'd say on Amulet, we've had a very good quarter in Amulet aligned to the trends that we were hoping for. We've got an expansion of the amount of accounts that are using the product and also an expansion on the amount of implanters that are completing and performing this procedure. One of the challenges we had in the beginning was just really to get the implanters trained. We needed proctors. And as you remember, in November, December, January and February, there was a lot of challenge with travel. So that's actually looking really nice in terms of the ramp there. What I'm very encouraged about is the traction we're seeing from the early adopters. So some of those that began the training and implanting in Q4 of last year, their utilization is more than double that of the average user. So we're seeing both things in terms of driving the sales there, the increase of new accounts and then the increase in productivity and utilization of the existing implanters. On the Portico side or on the TAVR side, sales have been strong, especially in Europe where we've introduced Navitor, which is our next-generation TAVR system. It's a competitive device from a clinical profile in high-risk patients. I estimate right now -- we estimate right now that we're about a high single digit. But when we look at the centers that are using Navitor, and Navitor is probably in about 40%, 45% of the centers in Europe, shares in the mid-teens. And that's very encouraging also because Navitor being our second product has really been an improvement for Portico. And as you know, we filed that in the U.S. in October of last year at the PMA. I expect that to be the case. I expect to see an approval and an opportunity for us to launch into the TAVR market here in the U.S. And on MitraClip, this was a tough comp for us this quarter. Last quarter -- last year, it was the highest quarter we've ever had in terms of procedures, in terms of sales. So there's no doubt that this one here is probably a little bit more impacted by COVID and some of the health care staffing challenges and the rescheduling of the procedures. So I expect these dynamics to steadily improve over time. And as I said previously, I don't think we fully benefited yet from the indication expansion that we received for the functional MR. So the market still remains pretty underpenetrated, and there's a lot of opportunity for growth there. So a lot of activity in our Structural Heart business, a lot of good performance. And I just expect that to get better over the next couple of quarters. And then what was your other question? Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : It had to do on share repurchases, use of cash if you're not using it for M&A. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, listen, we've always kind of had a balanced approach for deploying our cash. We're mindful of our cash on hand. We're investing in the dividend, and we've been growing that dividend, and that's an important part of it. We're investing in the capacity expansions in several of our areas, Libre, Electrophysiology, MitraClip, Nutrition. And we bought back shares in the first half of the year and something that we'll continue to assess as we go through the second half year. So the approach towards our capital allocation is pretty balanced, and we're committed to the dividend. Done some share buybacks in the first half. We'll continue to assess in the second half. And there's great opportunities for us to continue to invest organically to be able to drive the organic part of the business. Operator : Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on a strong 2Q here. One on this guidance here, when you look at the base floor for fiscal '22, $4.90, you guys did close to $3.15 of earnings in first half, so the implied earnings for back half was -- the floor is $1.74. That's annualizing to about $3.50-ish. Is there -- I guess, that $1.74-ish for back half, that's below the back half of 2019. So I'm wondering, between FX, inflation, is there something else that's going on here where -- we still have COVID revenues flowing through in the back half? It seems a little light on the EPS guidance. Robert Funck : Vijay, this is Bob, I'll take that call -- question. I think it's -- I think using an implied kind of fourth quarter exit rate as an indicator kind of how we're thinking about '23 probably wouldn't be prudent at this point. There's obviously a lot going on in the macro environment that warrants further monitoring and assessment. And on top of that, there are a couple of swing factors that are specific to us. Strength of our COVID testing business, that's provided us an awful lot of flexibility to reinvest back into our P&L over the last couple of years. And so as part of our -- and as Robert kind of talked about, we'll see kind of how COVID testing plays out. We continue to see very strong demand. And so there's some element of that, that we fully expect to stick around. And it's just difficult to pinpoint what that level is at this point in the year. But as part of our budgeting process for next year, we'll take a close look at the overall cost structure, which Robert touched on, and our investment priorities. And as you know, we're also working through the nutrition recall and making good progress, incrementally investing, and Robert talked about the fact that some of those investments will modulate over time or even go away. And so that, combined with recapturing share, we'll see the earnings power of that business ramp up over time. So -- and then finally, our pipeline has been highly productive and especially in devices. And as we drive that growth, that's accretive growth overall to the corporation. So those are big moving parts. And as we start to think about 2023, we'll incorporate all those elements and especially in devices. And as we drive that growth, that's accretive growth overall to the corporation. So those are big moving parts. And as we start to think about 2023, we'll incorporate all those elements in our forecast next year. Robert Ford : I guess, I'll just add to that, Vijay, also, I mean, we talk about the strength of the U.S. dollar and the impact that we're having on a full year basis. It's pretty significant, and a big portion of that impact is actually forecasted to happen in the second half of this year. So that also plays a role together with the inflation aspects that we're facing. So that's really the challenge. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. And maybe one last one. With the second half base business guidance mid-single digit to high single digits, if I look at 2Q ex China and ex Nutrition, the base business did north of 7%, which is in line with the high single sort of trajectory that investors have baked in. The back half of mid-single to high single... Robert Ford : So like I said, I think we've got an opportunity here on the back half also. We've set a floor. And again, I'll just reiterate that this is where contemplating all these puts and takes that we've been discussing, we feel confident in that floor number. And we believe that there's opportunities here for upside to that. Scott Leinenweber : Vijay, I would just say, as Bob said in his prepared remarks, excluding Nutrition, we expect high single digits for the kind of remainder of the businesses to your point. So the math you're doing there is right. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Scott. So the guide is assuming some impact here in the back half. That's helpful. Operator : And our next question will come from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Travis Steed : Can you hear me okay? Robert Ford : Yes. Travis Steed : Great. Just wanted to ask a couple more on the margin puts and takes, and I know these are related to Robbie's question. You mentioned a lot of like onetime costs in Nutrition with contracts on top of inflation and FX. So just wanted to think about the commitment and ability to grow operating margin off this year's base margins. If the macro environment just remains stable, I assume most of those Nutrition and onetime investments go away later this year as Nutrition ramps back up.  But I don't know if there's any other levers that you can pull on the margin line. And also not sure about this year's FX headwinds, how much of those naturally carry over into next year? That's something that J&J kind of flagged for people. Robert Ford : Yes. Listen, the commitment to grow the operating margin is always there. We've -- we always shoot for that growth. You had a big if there, and that's the big if, right, if the conditions remain the same. So I don't know what currency is going to look like next year. Bob can talk about that a little bit. But there are some of these costs that I mentioned that I don't anticipate having to fly in the amount formula that we flew in from overseas. I don't anticipate having to kind of pay those WIC rebates on competitive product. We have, what I would call, a steady investment profile on our Nutrition business that, I would say, we're a little bit out of profile in the next quarter or so because we want to make sure that as products coming back that we can work to regain our share. And we've seen some of that share regain the last couple of months. I mean, from the start of the recall, we lost about half of our IMF share. And of that half that we lost in the last couple of months, we've regained half of that back. So some of these costs, like I said, are more onetime in nature. On the FX side, I don't know, Bob, do you have a comment on there? Robert Funck : Well, I guess, I'd say history has taught us that rates rarely if ever hold for a long period of time. So trying to pinpoint kind of an accurate projection for next year at this point is pretty challenging. There's an awful lot of moving parts. As you know, different central banks taking different rate actions, different strengths of economies, et cetera. That said, at a high level, based upon kind of where we're at today, a decent portion of the impact we're seeing this year will carry into next year. Obviously, there's a long way to go, so we need to see how things play out. And as part of our planning process, we always look for opportunities to mitigate currency impacts as best we can. Travis Steed : That's helpful. I do want to make sure I heard you right. It sounds like you're going to launch an AID insulin system in Europe with Libre 2 by Q4. And I don't know if you'd be willing to say like who that partner is or what that product might look like in any form or fashion. Robert Ford : Yes. I think we made an announcement about the partnership several -- about 1 month, 1.5 months ago. So yes, that's with Ypsomed, a local European manufacturer, and another partner. So yes, our target is to be able to launch that by the end of the year in Europe. . Scott Leinenweber : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : And our last question will come from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Just a couple. First, on the infant nutrition and the manufacturing ramp here, is there any way to frame where you are today and when you feel like you'll be back to full production levels? And obviously, I'm just thinking in the context of where you were last year and potential profit recapture in this segment. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, as I said, we restarted in July 1, and we began production of the specialty formulas. The production of the Similac, which we call our more base formula, I mean, we're very close to that, Jayson, is what I would say. I don't want to necessarily kind of put an exact date here, but we're not talking months, we're not talking weeks. So we're very close there, and we obviously have a team that's ready to go and to ramp up. We know that we're going to have to work hard to shorten the time between manufacturer and on-shelf availability. So there's a team that's specifically dedicated to working on accelerated that time frame also. So I like where we're at. And we'll continue to use our global network to be able to augment those efforts of share recapture. Jayson Bedford : So Robert, when we look at '23 for USP, is it -- the debate just around market share, and I'm assuming from a manufacturing standpoint, you should be clean in '23. Robert Ford : Yes. That's our expectation. I think the debate on '23 is predominantly market share and then there might be a little bit of market also in terms of understanding how much of the growth in today's market is inventory build. We have seen an increase in birth rates, so that's another opportunity also for -- to maybe to offset that. So -- but yes, I think it's mostly about market share, market share recovery. And like I said, I think in the previous question, I think we've done pretty well about using our network to be able to regain the market share that we had lost in those first couple of months. So yes, it's really about looking at our share and share recovery, which is why, as I said, we've made some investments during -- over the next 3, 4, 5 months here to be able to put us in, in that right position in 2023. So I'll just close the call here. Obviously, a lot of your questions, so that there is, I guess, some uncertainty in the environment. It's pretty dynamic, and I think that's going to be the same for a lot of companies. For Abbott specifically, our new product launches are performing very well. Our R&D pipeline is strong. And as I said, our financial health is also strong. We're making progress in Nutrition to drive share recovery, and our Adult business and international growth opportunities still remain very strong. The Cardiovascular portfolio, Device portfolio, there is growth. It continues to recover, albeit not at the same level that we had forecasted back in April, but I do expect that same recovery trend. It's not as leaner as we would like or as what we've historically had. But ultimately, I do believe that the segment will continue to grow and recover. EPD and Libre continue to perform very well. And in Diagnostics, I get that COVID testing is a big portion of the equation here. But I just remind ourselves to where we were last year and what we thought was going to happen last year. And right now, all the data shows that testing is still here. Cases are up. Our test sales are actually up, and our tests have done very well from a brand and become somewhat of a preferred format over here. So as I look to the second half of the year, I anticipate some of the macro challenges to continue, in some cases, to be tough. And in other cases, hopefully, we'll see some easing on there. But our diversification is very unique, and that's what's held up very well. We're navigating the macro headwinds. We're investing in our growth platforms. And we've raised our guidance for the full year. And I think that's a rarity in this environment, and I think it speaks to the strength of the portfolio and the execution and our ability to manage and leverage the portfolio. So with that, we'll wrap up, and thank you for joining us today. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K the year ended December 31, 2021. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter, including ongoing earnings per share of $1.15. Based on our performance through the first 9 months of the year, we increased our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.17 to $5.23, which is more than 10% higher than the initial guidance flow we provided back in January. As you know, the macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. Inflation continues to be a stubborn force globally, but we've started to see some moderating impacts in certain areas of our businesses compared to earlier in the year. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, including throughout the most recent quarter. COVID remains as unpredictable as ever with intermittent surges continuing throughout the world. And lastly, global supply chain dynamics, staffing shortages continued to impact our health care markets, though we're seeing steady signs of improvements. Over the last few months, we've made progress in several important areas following the temporary shutdown of our infant formula manufacturing plant in Sturgis, Michigan earlier this year. We restarted production at Sturgis in July with a focus on our EleCare and other specialty infant formulas. And in September, we began production of several Similac products, which we expect will begin to reach retail store shelves over the coming weeks. We also boosted production in our global network to increase infant formula supply to the U.S. In fact, we delivered roughly the same volume of formula to our U.S. customers this past quarter as we did during the 3 months prior to the recall. Our #1 supply priority was to the WIC, Women, Infant and Children, federal food assistance program to ensure that underserved participants would have access to infant formula. During the quarter, we also made leadership changes, both at our Sturgis site and in our prior organization, and we concluded a month-long investigation into the accusations that were made by a former employee. The investigation, which included extensive document reviews and interviews, concluded that the allegations about quality were unfounded. And during the quarter, the same former employee dropped the federal OSHA complaint. And lastly, we conducted an analysis of the U.S. infant formula market and concluded that this country would benefit from more manufacturing capacity and redundancy. As such, we're moving forward with plans for a $0.5 billion investment in a new U.S. nutrition facility for specialty and metabolic infant formulas. We're currently in the final stages of determining the site location and will work with regulators and other experts to ensure this facility is state-of-the-art and sets a new standard for infant formula production. We recognize there's more to do, but feel confident in the progress we're making, and I want to thank all the Abbott employees that have been working around the clock on this matter. I'll now summarize our third quarter results for our remaining businesses in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased more than 12% in the quarter. Strong performance was led by double-digit growth across several countries, including India, China, Brazil and Vietnam, along with broad-based strength across several therapeutic areas. EPD has now achieved double-digit organic sales growth since the beginning of last year, fueled by a steady cadence of new product launches and strong commercial execution. And EPD has also expanded its profitability profile over the same time period, which is quite unique given the current macroeconomic headwinds. Moving to Diagnostics, where COVID test sales of $1.7 billion were significantly higher than expectations but lower compared to last year, which resulted in a modest decline in sales growth overall. The decline in COVID test sales compared to last year was driven by lower demand for laboratory-based tests. Whereas demand for our rapid tests, which include BinaxNOW, Panbio and ID NOW continues to be strong, with sales this past quarter at a similar amount to the third quarter of last year. Rapid tests have proven to be very important and highly practical tools. They provide a quick and affordable way to test COVID almost anywhere and at any time, whether you're experiencing symptoms or just want to know your status before attending events or gatherings. Excluding COVID testing revenues, sales of routine diagnostic tests grew 6% in the quarter overall and even faster internationally, fueled by the continued global rollout of our Alinity instrument for immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testing. Lastly, I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 6.5% in the quarter globally. In the U.S., sales growth of approximately 11.5% was led by strong double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. During the quarter in the U.S., cardiovascular procedure volumes were somewhat soft in July before strengthening in August and September. Internationally, in addition to similar procedure volume trends, sales were negatively impacted by intermittent COVID lockdowns in China as well as supply constraints in certain areas, most notably in Electrophysiology. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre exceeded $1 billion in the quarter, and our user base expanded to approximately 4.5 million users globally. In the U.S., where sales grew more than 40%, we initiated the full launch of Libre 3, which automatically delivers up to the minute glucose readings with unsurpassed accuracy in the world's smallest and thinnest wearable sensor. Internationally, organic sales growth was impacted by a couple of transitory items, including supply constraints on Libre 1 in certain emerging markets, which we expect to improve over the next couple of months. And secondly, a strategic choice we made in Germany to rapidly transition our large existing user base to our latest generation Libre 3 system, which temporarily reduced our focus on new user additions during the quarter in that country. We already transitioned well over half of our users with the vast majority of the remaining users expected to move to Libre 3 by year-end. This move strategically fortifies our leadership position in the second largest continuous glucose monitoring market in the world and further enhances our already strong strategic position as we work to bring the benefits of Libre to more and more people, including those with type 2 diabetes that are not reliant on insulin to manage their disease. So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved another strong quarter that significantly surpassed expectations which reflects the strength of our diversified business model and execution. And based on our strong performance for the first 9 months of the year, we're once again raising our EPS guidance for the year. I'll now turn the call to Bob. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Turning to our results. Sales increased 1.3% on an organic basis in the quarter. COVID testing-related sales were $1.7 billion, which while stronger than anticipated, reflect a year-over-year decline versus sales in the third quarter of last year. Additionally, organic sales growth was negatively impacted by a temporary shutdown of manufacturing at our nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan earlier this year. Excluding COVID testing-related sales and the U.S. sales impacted by the temporary manufacturing shutdown, total Abbott sales increased 6% on an organic basis in the third quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 6% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in July. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, which reflects the impacts of the nutrition manufacturing disruption and inflation we've experienced on certain manufacturing and distribution costs across our businesses. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A investment was 25.9% of sales in the third quarter. Lastly, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 18.1%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15.5%. The revised full year forecast is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in July due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. Turning to our 2022 outlook. For the full year, we now forecast ongoing earnings per share of $5.17 to $5.23, which is comprised of our year-to-date results through September, plus ongoing earnings per share guidance of $0.86 to $0.92 for the fourth quarter. We forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. Excluding U.S. sales impacted by the temporary manufacturing disruption, we forecast fourth quarter organic sales growth to be in the mid-to-high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing-related sales, and areas of nutrition, not impacted by the disruption. We forecast COVID testing-related sales of approximately $500 million, which does not assume a COVID testing surge in the fourth quarter. And lastly, based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 7% on our fourth quarter reported sales. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Great. Congrats on the quarter. Robert, maybe we could start, we're already towards the end of 2022. And I think people's attention are really shifting to next year. Just with so many moving pieces, both in revenues and down the P&L with currency and inflation and COVID testing assumptions and so on. So I was hoping sometimes at this point in the year, you might give us some early thoughts on next year. Anything you can provide to help us narrow the range of outcomes would be great. Robert Ford : Sure. I mean, with all those topics, we could spend the whole call on it, right? So I'll provide as broad framework that I can give you here. Obviously, the macro conditions are going to remain challenging, right, Robbie. I don't think that anybody right now as we're planning going into next year, is forecasting that this is just going to ease up, right? So specifically, I would say probably inflation, I don't expect to get better. And I'd say the currency headwinds are very much kind of in play here for next year, right? Those are probably 2 of the big kind of macro kind of impacts for us. But I still see a lot of opportunity for growth as I have been talking about our business and our portfolio. There's a clear path in my mind here for top line growth of high single digits. And you can get there with a variety of looking at across our businesses. So in Medical Devices, we've got a lot of upcoming launches and products that we have launched. So Libre 3, Amulet, Aveir, CardioMEMS, Navitor, we expect to be launching next year here in the U.S. EnSite X, our mapping system, launching a new ablation catheter into the market globally next year also. I'm probably sure there's more that I could kind of rattle off here in terms of devices. So I think the device portfolio looks very strong as we go into next year. I expect the same kind of growth rate that we're seeing in EPD. I expect to see continued share capture that we're seeing in core diagnostics and then obviously, a strong recovery in U.S. infant nutrition. So like I said, you see that high single-digit growth in the clear path just based looking at how those businesses will perform and how they're performing and the launches that we got upcoming. Then you mentioned COVID, right? And that's the other piece of the business. So high single-digit growth, excluding COVID. COVID is an interesting one, Robbie, where I think over the last couple of years, we've been talking about the sustainability of COVID. Many of you writing that COVID testing will probably go away. And here we are in the third quarter, in the summer months, with a $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion number here in the third quarter. So I think that as we look -- I want to see how the next few months look like. I think Bob made a comment in terms of our forecast for Q4. We haven't really planned for a big win to surge. It's more of an endemic-like forecast for Q4. And I think that's the kind of endemic forecast that we'll see going into 2023. But I think it's -- right now, it's looking like COVID test sales are stickier than most have assumed. So those are the components on the top line. Down the P&L, as I've said, we're going to be taking a close look at our cost structure. We have been. We've increased that over the last couple of years, made the investments. We talked about those investments. And I'm looking to be able to get a lot of leverage out of those investments that we've made historically. And at the top line, the way it's kind of laid out comes through and the leverage falls through, you're going to see that sales growth falling through at, I'd say, pretty healthy margins. Rob is going to invest in the areas that we know we've got good growth and high growth. Those get the investment dollars. I think in the past, a lot of you have written about the big 3 of Abbott, where there was Libre, Alinity and MitraClip and those are still a big contributor to drive a growth. But we've got a new class of products, I guess, I would call them the Fab 5, looking at TriClip, Aveir, Navitor, CardioMEMS and LAA. These products combined are an annual run rate of about $0.5 billion, growing 50% and those will also receive the kind of investments to be able to kind of drive their growth since I think they're, again, in the early innings of growth for us. So we'll look at managing the P&L and our investments in our structures and choosing the areas where we're going to continue to invest. And then other areas, we'll see some of the leverage from the investments that we've made in the past. So as we go into 2023, to say that everything is -- fundamentally nothing has changed. I'd say, true, our markets are still very attractive. We've got leading positions in these very large, high-growth markets. I like the pipeline, and we've got a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity. So that, I'd say, hasn't really changed. We're going to have to be mindful, obviously, of the cost structure of some of the inflation pressures and FX challenges we have. And then on top of that, we have a strong balance sheet. And we've talked about that and that provides us a lot of strategic and financial flexibility as we go into next year. So that's probably my best characterization here in the condensed version of 2023. Robert Marcus : That's really helpful. And maybe one for Bob. The fourth quarter implied EPS guide came in a little bit lower than the Street. We also saw a much bigger FX headwind. So how should we be thinking about the impact to the bottom line in third quarter? What's implied in fourth quarter? And if we start thinking about our models for next year, Robert gave us the top line considerations. How do we think about FX at current rates heading into next year? Robert Funck : Yes, certainly. So we've seen the dollar significantly strengthened this year, including throughout the third quarter. And the biggest moves have been really in developed market currencies, the euro, the pound, the yen. So this is something that most, if not all, multinationals are dealing with and certainly not unique to us. And I think, Robbie, maybe these headwinds are a little bit underappreciated in terms of the impact here. We always are looking to mitigate as best we can, but there's certainly going to be a limit here in terms of what can be done. We try to match our cost, hedging program and take price where appropriate. This year at current rates, our full year headwind is a little bit more than $0.15 in terms of earnings. But about $0.10 of that is happening just in the fourth quarter alone. And so while there are certainly other moving parts, that fourth quarter impact should give you a pretty good feel for the magnitude of headwind that's flowing into next year, particularly in the first 2 to 3 quarters of the year. We'll provide our earnings guidance in January as we always do, and we'll contemplate currency rates at that time. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Two product-related questions for me. First, I wanted to start with Libre. A lot going on there, Robert. Obviously, the exciting news this quarter was the type 2 basal LCD from CMS. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on that opportunity. Our back of the envelope math suggests that could be a $1 billion opportunity for Abbott in 5 years. I'd love to hear if you agree. And just lastly, on the vitamin C timing of that resolution and any color -- any additional color you want to provide on Libre. And I did catch in your prepared remarks, you talked about non-insulin patients that was interesting. And I did have one follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. That's the catch-all Libre question. Let me take the CMS one. So it is very exciting. And if I think about your model, you're probably more aligned maybe to my team, but I think my team is cutting it short in terms of what we could actually do with this indication, and I'll tell you why in a second. But it is pretty significant. I mean, you got 4 million basal patients in the U.S., about 1/3 of them are covered by CMS. So this is probably going to be in terms of the timing of public comments and amount of time it's going to take for CMS to make the decision and then the implementation date, et cetera. So this is probably more of a second half 2023 item, I would say, but it's pretty significant. It's going to expand CGM coverage by about 1.5 million patients on CMS. And as you probably know, Larry, one CMS makes that determination then there's a natural flow that will then move into the private commercial market. So I'm looking at the opportunity of ultimately 4 million patients that will have potential to get some sort of coverage and benefit from the technology. Listen, I think that we've -- it's not surprising from the perspective of this coming up because we've been leading in the generation of data and evidence to support this proposal. I think if you do a lit search on all the studies that have been done on CGM and then segment them between pump studies and basal studies and type 2 studies and type 2 with non-insulin studies, you're going to see that Libre's at the head of all of those type 2 study. So I think this is part of the investments that we've been making clinically to be able to show the evidence and how this benefits a broader population. And then with the value proposition that Libre has, it provides us I think I know what your model is saying. I just think that we'll have a disproportionate share of that. This is a market where, whether it's in the U.S. or in Europe, it predominantly drives around primary care, primary care call point, primary care scale, specifically in the U.S., DMEs. And this is a segment where we do very well. If you do an audit of prescriptions by physician class, Libre has taken about 80% market share of the primary care Rx. So the team has been working on that. So I think it's a great opportunity. And I think this kind of fuels into this notion of this is a much larger market than has historically been contemplated as part of CGM, and that's what our strategy from the moment we enter the market has been thinking about it, right? We're not looking at sprinting quarter-to-quarter, we're looking at this over the long term and making the investments to be able to sustain this kind of growth rate. We announced manufacturing capacity expansions also in the quarter for Diabetes Care because we believe this is a $10 billion franchise by 2028. We believe that we've got pathway between 15 million and 20 million users on this product. So we're resourcing our manufacturing, our scale, our commercial infrastructure, our service, our clinical investments to be able to support what I believe is a significant growth opportunity, and we intend to lead that. I think your other question was on vitamin C. Yes, we have completed the clinical work on the vitamin C. I'll provide updates at the appropriate time. I do recognize that this is an important, I would call short-term, medium-term kind of growth driver for us. If you think about our franchise, it's going to be about basal, type 2 and pump integration. So think of that in the next kind of 2, 3 years of key core growth drivers. And then I'd say, more longer term to get to those numbers, I made an announcement beginning of this year regarding looking at this outside of diabetes on our Lingo franchise, and that will then sustain our growth going forward. So we've made the study. We feel good about the results, and I'll be updating once we have something to update there. We are working on pump integrations outside the United States and we'll have a pump integration launch by end of this year, beginning of next year into Europe with 1 of our pump partners. And I think they're going to benefit a lot from our user base that we have in those countries. Larry Biegelsen : Robert, that was super helpful. Just for my follow-up, I'd love to get your reaction to the PASCAL data at TCT and the launch in the U.S. specifically, your thoughts on the greater durability effect they showed with PASCAL. I know we  haven't seen that in the MitraClip registries. And just any update on the locking issue we heard about this quarter. Robert Ford : Yes. So it wasn't unexpected. Every time at TCT, there's always an expectation of a landmark study or an approval. So that wasn't unexpected. They got approval for DMR. That's one of the smaller indications, about 1/3 of the market. We've competed with PASCAL internationally already for a couple of years. I expect to see some trialing in the U.S. And the question is going to be how much it is going to stick. Internationally, MitraClip has done very well, and we've held on to a good portion of our share. I think in Europe, we're kind of at that 80-20 split. So I think -- I expect some of those dynamics to play out here in the U.S. And I think MitraClip is going to do very well. Regarding the data set, yes, I mean it was -- I think it was 117 or 120 patients. I think it was maybe versus 63 of MitraClip. I mean we've done over 150,000 implants, Larry. And we've got great data on our products. We do have over 1,000 patients in the registry. I think the data set is pretty small right now. So we're working on our side. We're doing our investments in our clinical trials, investments in product advancements, in MitraClip. I think right now, I think the biggest opportunity is market expansion, and we're going to be driving a lot of that with the FMR indication. I think I said this in the last call, I think that one of the biggest impacts we have, for me, as I looked at our portfolio was regarding COVID was not being able to benefit the FMR indication and the NCD. So I think that's the biggest opportunity we have is market expansion and working to get those referrals network set up and driving that demand for further expansion. So I think it' a locking mechanism -- yes, I think we had -- we took a field action and I think that's so far going okay. I haven't had any kind of issues, supplies back to normal. Operator : And our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : I'd like to jump off a little bit from the MitraClip conversation and try and peel apart the double-digit growth in Structural Heart this quarter a little bit stronger than we were looking for. How much of that is MitraClip versus demand for Portico versus maybe something else? And how do you think about developing that segment a little bit further? Robert Ford : Sure. Well, I mean, I think we've talked about how important the Structural Heart portfolio was for us even when we go all the way back to the acquisition of St. Jude and really building this franchise. So we've been intentional about doing that. MitraClip had a good quarter. We had a growth of about 6%. That was impacted a little bit in the U.S. but we had double digit -- almost double-digit growth internationally. So if you kind of then back into that, you could see that some of the other parts of the portfolio are now starting to kind of -- as they're gaining in scale, Joanne, they're starting to have a stronger impact on the portfolio. So Amulet and Navitor internationally, I know you mentioned Portico, but I'd say it's probably more Navitor in Europe that did very well for us, and it continues to do pretty well. We've -- as I say, we acknowledge that we're behind 2 market leaders here, but we're making the investments and it's done pretty well. In Europe, I'd say we've got about an 8%, 9% market share in Europe and the accounts that we actually have Navitor in we're close to kind of mid-teens. So that product is very competitive, and we're looking forward to bringing that here to the U.S. We filed it with the FDA and we expect to bring this to the market here in the first half of next year. Scott, maybe you can talk about kind of Amulet and what we're seeing there also. Scott Leinenweber : Yes. I'd say, Joanne, as Robert mentioned, it is kind of the remaining basket of that Structural Heart business that's driving a lot of the growth there, Amulet, being a component of that. Launched in the U.S. continues to go very well, nice traction. In particular, I would say, in the early adopter accounts as it started late last year. Our share in those accounts is around 40% now at this point. It just shows you kind of once you get in there and get experience and have an opportunity to drive some deeper penetration that you can really achieve a strong share position, and we're doing that in those early adopter accounts. So as we've added accounts over the first portion of this year, we'll look to do the same thing with them as we go forward. So a great opportunity to build, seeing nice growth there. And like I said, like Robert said, kind of a handful of the other items along with TriClip, Navitor and Amulet here that are driving growth in addition to what you're seeing and now is the long-term opportunity for MitraClip. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : As my follow-up question, in Nutrition, one of the things we talk with investors about is, how do you think about the recovery in that segment once your supply is back up? Do you see yourself just returning to growth of the market rate or taking a good percentage of the share back? Or any guidance you could give us remodel forward would be helpful. Robert Ford : Sure. I would say we've gone -- we've had a situation like this back in 2010, and we've seen other competitors have situations like this, Joanne, in terms of the share recovery process. I'd say there's a couple of key things in terms of consideration. And when you think about doing those modeling, it's looking at your share of the WIC program, your ability to continue to call on pediatricians and your share in the hospitals. And I would say we've disproportionately focused in this quarter with our global supply network to focus on those channels. And one of the challenges with that the WIC channel is a lower priced channel than I would've call the non-WIC channel. So that's probably where we made a decision to take our -- take the volume that we had. And like I said in my opening comments, we actually supplied to the market this quarter, what we supplied in the 3 months prior to the recall. It's just the mix of that supply was overly gated towards the WIC states and the WIC contracts that we had. We made a commitment to those states that they would not have backward supply shortages. So we focused on that. And I think by focusing on that, we not only live to our commitments and the contracts that we put in place but that's going to obviously be a base for us as we go into this quarter and into next quarter. So if you look at the Nielsen data, you do see share recovery, I'd say, we probably lost about 20 share points from the recall. And I think the last read that I saw in September was we got half of it back. And that is a mix -- this will go to the mix piece where on the WIC side, we've recovered all of our share. And now we're going to take our capacity and start moving it into the non-WIC channel with the non-WIC configuration. So like I said, we've intentionally made these decisions in terms of how we're supplying the market. And I think by doing that, just naturally with the work that our teams are doing, we'll start to see the share recovery build month-over-month. So that's probably how to think about it. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Robert, I wanted to ask about the COVID testing franchise and just the strength in 2022 and thinking about the comp for 2023. Is there anything you can share in terms of contracts that are in place for 2023 and what that base could look like where weather contracts in 2022 could roll over into 2023? I know it's impossible to forecast utilization or uptake of COVID testing next year, but if there's any base commentary you can provide, that would be helpful. And I just have 1 follow-up. Robert Ford : Yes, I think that's -- looking at the market between government contracts and nongovernment contracts is something that we spent a lot of time this year doing because obviously, those government contracts, they're high-volume and they ultimately skew a little bit of kind of the run rate as we're trying to kind of run rate this. So if you look at our Q4 number, our Q4 number that we're forecasting is really what I would call an endemic state, right? So about $0.5 billion across the world, across all of our platforms, in a winter season without necessarily forecasting the kind of surge that we saw last year. In that number, we do not have any significant government contracts. Now what governments have realized is that they do need to make some investments and they do need to hold some level of testing inventory in their countries. So we have active conversations with a lot of governments and they recognize and realize an Abbott's ability to scale up and scale up pretty fast. So we've got plenty of capacity, and they know that, they know the value of our product. They work very well with the -- in terms of determining COVID and the new variants, et cetera. So we don't have any significant number in 2020 -- in Q4 of this year, we think that that's the kind of right -- kind of run rate from an endemic standpoint. And if there is a surge and if governments realize that they do need to procure more testing, we've got the product, we've got the reliability of the product and we've got the reliability of supply, and they know that. So we're in a good position there. Joshua Jennings : Excellent. Just one follow-up on Libre. You mentioned just the path to achieving full iCGM status and understand there's a segment of the CGM that will open up for Libre, but I was wondering if you could just share your thoughts on the potential impact to clinician sentiment towards accuracy of the platform, payer sentiment in terms of whether there could be any formulary prioritization decisions considering the pricing? And then on the other side of that, how are you -- any new thoughts on pricing for Libre 3 particularly in this inflationary environment. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, listen, this is an important segment, right? Obviously, the vast majority of CGM users and the vast majority of future potential users are people that are either injecting insulin with pens or syringes or not even using insulin, right? But we recognize that this is an important segment. So we're doing -- like I said, we completed the work on Libre 2 regarding the vitamin C. We'll be updating --we will be updating the market and our partners as we go through that process with the agency. But we also believe that -- we also believe that there is potential to innovate even further in that pump integration, right? And we talked about this in last call. We announced this at the ADA in June which is the creation of a dual analyze sensor, a glucose ketone sensor. Everybody -- all the [ capabilities ] that I've spoken to that you're -- I guess you're referring to believe that this would be the go-to sensor for pump integration because the ketone functionality provides the added safety feature that would be required, right? So if there's some sort of interruption in insulin delivery from the pump, what is understood clinically is that the ketone levels will rise earlier than the glucose levels and to be able to have that ketone level, that continuous ketone level measurement is an added safety feature for that pump environment. And I think it does provide, I guess, a step ahead in terms of innovation, in terms of pump integration. Regarding the accuracy, I mean, I think it's commonly understood and the data is very clear in terms of Freestyle Libre 3 -- I mean even FreeStyle Libre 2, but FreeStyle Libre 3 being a definitive best-in-class accurate sensor. It's the only CGM sub-8 MARD. So I don't think we have that issue. So it's an important segment, and we're going to be investing in it, and we're going to -- our goal is to actually provide something that's even more advanced and more beneficial. Sorry, did you have another question on --oh, it' pricing. Yes, Libre 3 pricing, Libre 2 pricing, Libre 1 pricing, it's practically all the same, Josh. And the more volume we can get on to Libre 3, the more we can kind of lower those COGS. But we have a parity pricing right now. And we think that, that pricing strategy as I said last year, as the international markets or even in the U.S., people have challenges either with co-pays in the U.S. or with formularies and reimbursement decisions internationally. I think that our value proposition is very strong, and it's going to prove itself out very clearly as single-payer systems start to look at how to fine-tune their budgets and get more done either with less or with the same amount. So I think that our value proposition, consumer-friendly product with best-in-class accuracy, feature set that no real gaps and our pricing strategy, I think it's a complete value prop. Operator : And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Robert, maybe my first one for you. The headline organic ExCo within 3Q was 3%-ish low singles. When you back out some of these the supply chain impact, I think you mentioned Germany and Nutrition, what was the underlying organic growth? And when can we get back to an environment where there is no mismatch in the headline organic and underlying rate? It's a clean number. So maybe just talk about that cadence to normality. Robert Ford : It was high single -- it's mid- to high single once you do all those exclusions. I don't like doing that. I mean I get that it's important to be able to isolate what the challenges are and what the issues are and are they more transitory or are they more kind of sustained issues in the business. I would say the issues that we've had, the challenges we've had in this quarter regarding supply chain, they're fairly, I'd say, from a Med Device perspective, they're pretty significant, and they kind of had the impact that we saw in our Med Device business. I think if you had look at the kind of back orders that we had, whether it was Libre 1 and some of the back orders that we had in EP, we would be high single digits. But if you back out these issues mid to high overall for the company. Yes, your question of when do we get into kind of normal organic? I think part of the challenge here is COVID -- COVID to play. And as that base becomes smaller than what it is this year, I mean, this year, we'll probably do very much close to the same amount of COVID test sales that we did kind of last year. But as we move into next year, and that becomes smaller than this year, we'll see a little bit of an impact on that overall growth rate. But as I said, I think in Robbie's question, I see high single-digit growth once you back out of COVID. And so COVID will be just the determining factor there, but base non-COVID, high single digits next year. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful. And then maybe one on the financial side. I think when gross margins were down Q-on-Q. I'm wondering what was the FX incremental inflationary impact. I think Robert Funck mentioned $0.10 of FX impact in Q4. Should we annualize that to $0.40 of FX impact for next year? I'm not sure how to think about FX and inflationary impact for next year. And we didn't talk about Lingo. Shouldn't that be an incremental driver here and not '23? Robert Funck : Let me -- Vijay, I'll take the exchange first. I mean, I wouldn't necessarily take that $0.10 impact in the fourth quarter and extrapolate that for the full year of next year. But certainly, through the first 3 quarters, you would expect to see that. But then in the fourth quarter, you're going to kind of be at those rates that we currently are at. So but again, it is going to be a significant headwind for us next year. On inflation, definitely, we're seeing the impacts there. Like others, the biggest impacts we've seen is really around commodities, other manufacturing input cost and logistics. We've incorporated about another $100 million impact to gross margin in our current guidance. So that's about $1 billion for the year, so call it, maybe 240 -- probably a little more than 240 basis points on the gross margin. As we -- as Robert said, we've seen a little bit of moderation in the rate of increase in the third quarter compared to where we were earlier in the year, and we're trying to take some price to offset that really more in our consumer-facing businesses. Kind of given the way that inflation has hit us over the course of this year, the inventory that we purchased and manufacture this year at these higher costs will definitely negatively impact us next year when that inventory is sold even if inflationary pressures start to come down kind of as we get into next year. Robert Ford : On your question on Lingo, Vijay, we have factored in a launch into next year. We have not factored that launch here in the U.S. So it is an international launch. It's a different business model, as I talked about it, more of a direct-to-consumer wellness subscription model. And we're on target here to come out of the gates to that in Q1. We are going to be launching into what I would call a little bit of a challenging environment. So we've taken that into consideration here. But I think that the long-term growth opportunity of building this kind of business, a wellness subscription-like model with the platform that we've built and the scale that we have, I think, is a great growth opportunity for us. We do have it factored in into next year probably launching in the beginning of the year and then building from there. But we'll be launching, like I said, in a challenging environment, but I still think it's the right thing to do from a long-term perspective. Scott Leinenweber : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Travis Steed : I did want to ask on China, how do you see the recovery shaping up there. There's going to be another headwind next year and any new VBPs that you see coming up in China? Robert Ford : Yes. It is going to be a little bit of a headwind. You can think about it as either currency and VBP. We've gone through this in some other parts of our business. So we do expect this value-based procurement or pricing here to play out. I think the next area that we're looking at. We've gone through it with stents last year or 1.5 years ago, and the next area that we're looking at is probably on the electrophysiology side. That's probably the next category that's up. It's interesting, as we've been looking at this, there's definitely interesting impacts in terms of ranges of these pricing. We've actually gone through some of it in pharmaceuticals also. It will range from 30% to 80% in terms of pricing. And really, the magnitude here depends on whether it's a national or regional process. Some of the categories have been more regional. And they tend to be a little bit lower. And it also depends on the number of participants that exist in that category. So as I look at -- on the EP side, we've also seen that when there are more -- like a system-based approach, Travis. So think capital, think about the technical support and the infrastructure associated support that, those tend to be a little bit on the lower end of that range versus to be on the higher end of that range. So that's probably what we've got contemplated for VBP next year is more on the EP side. Travis Steed : No. That's helpful. And I did want to ask about the M&A environment, too, since it hasn't come up yet on this call. And also kind of how it relates to your thinking of the device growth longer term, if you're still able to grow at the high end of med tech. And if the Fab 5, as you called, is enough to do that? Or if you need to augment device growth with M&A over time? Robert Ford : No, I don't feel that I need to do M&A to be able to sustain that high single-digit growth that we've been posting pretty consistently on devices. I did say in the last call that we're interested and we're being prudent about that interest. The interest has increased and we actively assess all the opportunities here. But as I've said, just because we have a strong balance sheet, and we've got a lot of flexibility, we're still going to make sure that we're going about this from a strategic perspective and we're going about it from a financial perspective. So obviously, valuations come down somewhat. And that helps on the financial modeling and attractiveness side from it. But I would say they probably need to stabilize a little bit of these valuations so that you can engage what I would call just meaningful discussions here. And I think as those stabilize, I think you'll see the environment pick up here in terms of M&A. So we're in a good position. Don't need to do M&A, but there's a lot of opportunities out there for us, and we're going to apply that consistent framework of strategic and financially disciplined in terms of how we look at that. So I'll just sum up here. Q3 was probably a very challenging quarter for us, probably our most challenging. Obviously, the impact of inflation and supply chain and some of the back orders that we encountered was a headwind. Some of the FX as we go forward also will be a headwind. But you saw the portfolio strength and the execution here coming through that, all those challenges and delivery, not only in the quarter but also for the full year, as evidence of our full year raise here also. So it's also provided us an opportunity to make some strategic choices, to strengthen our business and to strengthen our position and build our momentum, I guess, to Robbie's comment in the beginning about how everybody shifting to 2023 and so are we. And we made some choices and decisions here to be able to prepare us and build our momentum and strengthen our position as we go into 2023. I saw a nice recovery in the institutional businesses. And our pipeline here that we talked a little bit about is going to sustain that growth acceleration. There's a lot of organic growth opportunities that we've got in 2023. And I highlighted here how I see a clear path for high single-digit revenue growth. And then on top of that, we've got a strong balance sheet, and that's going to allow for a very balanced capital deployment to our shareholders and also allow us to fuel future growth. So with that, I'm going to wrap that up. Thanks. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth excluding COVID testing sales on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our 2022 results as well as our outlook for this year. For the full year 2022, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $5.34, which is well above the original EPS guidance we set at the beginning of the year. As you know, macro business conditions have been highly dynamic and challenging over the last few years, particularly for U.S.-based multinational companies. COVID-19 pandemic played a big role in this, of course. We saw the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly and inflation reached new heights last year. Supply chains continue to face challenges, and our health care customers have been navigating staffing challenges that are negatively impacting certain medical device procedure trends and routine diagnostic testing volumes. As we start the new year, however, while all these factors remain headwinds, I'm cautiously optimistic that we're starting to see them peak and, in some cases, ease a bit. Over the past few months, the impact of COVID-19 on society is lessened and economies around the world are increasingly reopening. In the U.S., the U.S. dollar weakened a bit and inflation has eased somewhat and hospital-based procedures and routine testing trends continue to steadily improve in many areas. As you know, COVID testing has been a big part of our story these past couple of years, and I'm proud of what our team has built a full suite of tests across several platforms and the intentionality and how we established a leading role in the world's response to the pandemic. In total, we've delivered nearly 3 billion COVID test globally since the start of the pandemic. Going forward, we expect COVID-19 to transition to more of an endemic seasonal type of respiratory virus. And with that, COVID testing, while still important, is expected to decline significantly. We expect variance will continue to emerge, and therefore, our tests will remain an important part of our leading respiratory testing portfolio, along with flu, RSV and Strep, which we offer across multiple testing platforms, including lab-based systems and hospitals, small desktop devices in urgent care centers and physician offices as well as at-home tests. As we reflect back on the impact of COVID testing efforts over the last few years, it's clear that our success in this area will have a positive, long-lasting impact for the company. It strengthened our strategic position in diagnostics through the expansion of our installed base of instruments, including ID NOW, our wrap point-of-care molecular testing platform and through the opening of new testing channels, such as physician offices and at-home testing. It enabled us to increase investments in priority growth areas across the company, including R&D and commercial initiatives in support of several recent and upcoming new product launches, while at the same time, increasing returns to our shareholders in the forms of dividend growth and share repurchase. And lastly, it further strengthened our overall financial health and balance sheet, which will provide significant strategic flexibility as we look to build and grow the company even further. I'm proud of the role we played in fighting COVID in the last few years. It reinforced our purpose, had a meaningful impact on society and enhanced our long-term strategic position going forward. Turning now to our outlook for 2023. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.50. We forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales in the high single digits, and we forecast around $2 billion of COVID testing sales for the full year 2023. I'll now provide more details on our results by business area before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales declined around 6% in both the fourth quarter and full year as a result of manufacturing disruptions at one of our U.S. infant formula facilities last year. Production at the facility is up and running. And as we've mentioned previously, our initial supply priority was to the WIC, women, infant and children federal food assistance program to ensure underserved participants have access to infant formula. As our manufacturing capacity has continued to recover, we've been able to increase production of our non-WIC brands with a focus on serving the broader infant formula market and building back inventory levels on retail shelves. Turning to Diagnostics, where as expected, sales growth in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by a year-over-year decline in COVID-19 test sales. COVID testing sales were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter with rapid testing platforms, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally, and ID NOW globally compromising approximately 95% of these sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, worldwide diagnostics grew over 11% in the fourth quarter. Growth in the quarter was led by rapid diagnostics where excluding COVID-19 tests, sales increased 30% compared to the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, during the pandemic, we significantly expanded the installed base of ID NOW and open new testing channels. This expanded footprint drove strong growth and supported testing needs when flu and other respiratory infection surged late last year. During this past year, we continued the rollout of Alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expand test menus across our platforms for immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testing. Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter and over 10% for the full year. EPD continues to perform at a high level, having carved out an attractive growth space in the global pharmaceutical market, specifically our geographic focus on fast-growing emerging markets with a broad portfolio targeting attractive therapeutic areas. Strong performance in the quarter was led by double-digit growth across several geographies, including India, China, Brazil and Mexico. And I'll wrap up with medical devices where sales grew 7.5% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Growth in both the quarter and full year was led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care in the U.S. Internationally, sales growth was negatively impacted by COVID surges in China during the fourth quarter as well as lingering supply challenges in a couple of areas. In Diabetes Care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system grew over 40% in the U.S. and global Libre sales reached $4.3 billion for the full year 2022. We continue to strengthen our medical device portfolio with numerous pipeline advancements and launches, including recent U.S. regulatory approvals of Aveir, our highly innovative leadless pacemaker used to treating people with slow heart rhythms, Eterna the smallest implantable, rechargeable spinal cord stimulation system currently available in the market for the treatment of chronic pain. FreeStyle Libre 3, which provides continuous glucose readings in the world's smallest and most accurate wearable sensor. Libre was recently named the best medical technology of the last 50 years by Galien Foundation. And finally, Navitor our latest generation transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement system. So in summary, 2022 was another highly successful year for Abbott. We're optimistic about the early signs we're seeing of an improving operating environment and excited about the growth opportunities that lie ahead for all of our businesses, and we continue to strengthen our overall strategic position with a steady cadence of innovative technologies that are either in the early stages of launching or expected to launch over the course of this year. I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Turning to our results. Sales decreased 6.1% on an organic basis in the quarter. COVID testing-related sales were $1.1 billion in the quarter, which, while stronger than the forecast provided back in October, reflect a year-over-year decline versus sales in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Excluding both COVID testing-related sales and U.S. infant formula sales that were impacted by manufacturing disruptions last year in our Nutrition business. Total Abbott sales increased 7.1% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter and 7.4% for the full year 2022. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 5.9% on fourth quarter sales, which resulted in a somewhat favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in October as we saw the dollar weaken a bit late last year. Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.6% of sales, which reflects the impact of the nutrition manufacturing disruptions and inflation we've experienced on certain manufacturing and distribution costs across our businesses. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 28% of sales in the fourth quarter. Turning to our outlook for the full year 2023. Today, we issued guidance for full year ongoing earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.50. For the year, we forecast organic sales growth excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales to be in the high single digits. We forecast COVID testing-related sales of around $2 billion with around $750 million forecasted in the first quarter. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 56% of sales. Also for the year, we forecast R&D investment of around $2.5 billion and SG&A investment of around $11 billion, which reflects investments to support several ongoing and upcoming new product launches and strategic growth initiatives. We forecast net interest expense of around $300 million, nonoperating income of around $450 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 14% for the year. As Robert mentioned, the strength and resiliency of our business, particularly since the start of the pandemic has allowed us to concurrently invest in our strategic priorities, provide strong return to our shareholders and further strengthen our financial health, which provides a strong base on which to grow the company going forward. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Robert, maybe to kick it off, I appreciate the guidance, but there's a lot of moving parts through the different business lines with macro involved with a lot of new product launches involved. Maybe you could just build up how we should be thinking about how you came up with the guidance range on both the top and bottom lines given all the moving parts? Robert Ford : Sure. I mean there's obviously a macro environment here that's been complex, and you've mentioned it. And as I said -- as I said in my remarks, and I think they've gotten significantly better versus where we were in October when -- on our last earnings call. So I think that we've factored some of that improvement and some of that stabilization in there. I mean, I don't necessarily think that we've got too many moving parts here. I mean obviously, we run a -- the company has got a lot of business and business segments. But I mean, if you look at really the 2 areas I would say, Robbie, that kind of have had this effect of maybe sometimes distorting the results a little bit is our COVID testing business and the impact of the recall products last year, right? So from a COVID perspective in 2022, we actually sold more tests than we sold in 2021, and then obviously, the impact of Recall products, that was a negative. Both of those flip next year. So if you take those out of the equation, you kind of go back to what we were growing pre-pandemic, right, which was top tier, high single digits, 7% to 8% growth. That's what we grew in 2022, again excluding COVID and the impact of the recall products. And then if you take that comp out on the recall product side this year as we return to market, and look at the base business, obviously, without the COVID testings, we're going to be growing high single digits, probably at a higher end of that pre-pandemic rate, probably 8-plus percent. So I think it starts with the top line. And that's probably the #1 part of our guidance is obviously making sure that we feel that our top line is taking advantage of all the good parts, all the good product launches, et cetera, that we have. And from that perspective, I think a lot of what we're doing kind of supports that ongoing -- that ongoing high single-digit growth rate. If you look at our device portfolio, we'll be looking at high single-digit growth rate, low double-digit growth rate, a combination of both kind of recovery, the steady recovery procedures that we're seeing combined with all these product launches that we've got lined up that will ultimately have a full year impact, whether it's Libre 3, Amulet, Aveir, Navitor, CardioMEMS, Eterna on the neuromodulation side, our mapping system in EP, we're going to launch a new ablation catheter. So the device portfolio is well set up to be able to drive those high single -- sorry, high single-digit, low double-digit growth rate. And I think we're going to continue to see strong performance in EPD. I think as the world continues to reopen, those emerging markets continue to be a great opportunity for us. We've strengthened our position in diagnostics throughout these years, and we'll see continued successful rollout of Alinity in our core molecular diagnostics and recovery and infant formula 2. So I think you put all that in place, our core business, Abbott that we knew pre-pandemic is actually stronger than we were pre-pandemic with the investments that we made. And I think that's the other part of, I guess, in the P&L, if you look at what we've been able to do this year is because of COVID and the investments that we made during COVID in these growth areas, we're able to drive this high single-digit growth across the company with a fairly flat investment line, whether it's R&D and SG&A. So really getting the leverage across the businesses. So I mean, I think it really starts with our top line and the confidence we have and the products we're launching, the pipeline, the position we have. And then COVID, we forecast about $2 billion next year, and I think that's the right number right now. Obviously, we see kind of society transitioning here. We've got a strong installed base. We've got manufacturing capacity. We haven't factored in any kind of real surge but if that happens, we do have the capacity to be able to do that. So I'd say those are some of the moving pieces there. But fundamentally, we're in a real strong position in terms of our long-term growth opportunities, leading positions in these attractive growth areas, strong pipeline, which I'm sure we'll get into some of them and a strong balance sheet. So that's how this has been constructed, and I think that we're in a good position here. Robert Marcus : Great. Really helpful. Maybe one for Bob. You gave us the full year guide and you gave some commentary down the P&L, which is really helpful. But how should we be thinking about some of the quarterly cadence here? How FX flows, what is FX on the bottom line? And how did that compare to '22? And any just things we should be thinking about first half versus second half on the P&L? Robert Funck : Yes. So if you think about the kind of the cadence of our business for 2023, it really starts with the top line and some of the things that Robert kind of talked about. First, we have a lot of the new product launch activity, especially in our medical device businesses. You got products that either launched last year, we'll be launching this year. I'm sure we'll talk about some of those on the call today. So you'll see the impact of those launches kind of grow over the course of the year, kind of feather into that top line. Secondly, we are seeing a steady improvement in procedure trends in the U.S. and Europe. We've been seeing that and we expect to continue to see kind of a steady improvement there on procedure trends over the course of the year. In our Nutrition business, we will see improvement as we continue to supply the market, in particular, the non-WIC segment of the infant formula market in the U.S. And so will recover share there. And so we'll have the impact of that over the course of the year. For China, Robbie, I'd say we've assumed a softer start in Q1 given some of the dynamics there at the start of this year, but we anticipate that will improve over the course of the year. And so all those changes -- all those impacts on the top line as that builds over the course of the year will flow through to earnings as Robert talked about we're going to get leverage in the middle here. And so for the first quarter, we're -- we think earnings will be approximately $1, and then we'll build from there. On your question on foreign exchange, rates have improved a bit recently, but exchange is still a headwind, particularly on earnings. At current rates, as I said in my opening remarks, exchange is approximately a 1% headwind on sales. EPS, it's a little bit more than $0.30 headwind for us in 2023. The fall-through impact move like we have seen over the last year is always complex. Translation is just a piece of the impact. And while that has improved from where we were a few months ago, it still remains a headwind. One of the biggest drivers that we're seeing is the impact from our hedging program. We realized pretty significant hedging gains last year that won't repeat this year. And you can really see the impact of those hedging gains on our 2022 results. Last year, there was a pretty significant exchange headwind on sales, a little over 5% or $2.1 billion, but a fairly modest impact on earnings, it was less than $0.10. And that was really the benefit we realized last year on those hedging gains that won't repeat in 2023. That's not a unique dynamic that we're seeing. We're seeing that from some other multinationals as well. Operator : And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Robert, I feel compelled to ask about Libre again, just given how important it is. So maybe I'd like to hear from you the outlook for 2023. How should we think about worldwide growth? Can it exceed 20% this year? And can you talk about international, where you've been negatively impacted by the supply issues and the transition to Libre 3 in Germany, when do you expect those issues to be resolved? And just the growth drivers like basal and the vitamin C, resolution, what are some of the growth drivers to look forward to this year for Libre? And I had one follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure, Larry. Well, I think Libre had another great year, full year growth of over 21% strong growth in the U.S. over 42% and international kind of grew in those mid-teens number. We were impacted a little bit by back orders, as you said, on the international side. And I'd say probably a little bit more on our early generation products so kind of Libre 1 was that. We had a significant improvement in that situation in Q4. I expect 1 or 2 more months of until we can completely resolve that, but a significant improvement over there on our international performance. I think one of the key things on the international side is it was a little bit of this supply chain on chips that we had, like that I said, is mostly behind us. The other part of it is the upgrade cycle, right? And when you go with an accelerated upgrade cycle versus with Libre 3 that we did from Libre 2 in some of our key markets, when we went from Libre 1 to Libre 2, we let that upgrade kind of somewhat happen naturally. And that takes about 1.5 years, 2 years to a complete. For Libre 3, we wanted to go more aggressively in some of these markets. So that takes our sales force away from new demand generation to making sure that we can get the scripts and do all the behind-the-scenes work for those upgrades. So that's -- I would say that's still ongoing, but I'd call it about 80% to 85% complete. So then that allows us starting now in 2023 on the international side to start kind of driving new additions here. So I'd say, I expect continued growth in the U.S. in terms of market expansion, basal opportunity, I think, is a great opportunity, and I think it will start in the U.S. But I think we're seeing that also internationally. And now that we've got the supply chain issue largely behind us, and the upgrade cycle, again, largely behind us, we can forecast our demand generation activities on new users. So I think that, that's one key driver of growth for us. Can we see a path for another 20% growth in 2023? Yes, I can. And I think there's a lot of opportunities of growth. I think one of them that you mentioned being the basal expansion is a significant opportunity. I think we've been leading the charge over here, Larry, in terms of generating the clinical data that's required to be able to support reimbursement. It will start, I think, in the U.S., but I don't think it will be a U.S.-only phenomenon. But in the U.S., we'll probably start first. You've got about 4 million type 2 basal patients, in the U.S., about 1/3 of them are Medicare. And even if you assume a reasonable market penetration, you also have to assume difference in annual utilization rates versus type 1 an MDI or a pumper. But even if you take all that into consideration, the opportunity starts with a $1 billion and it can range depending on the speed and the uptake of that. So I think this is a great growth opportunity. And like I said, I don't think it's a U.S.-only situation. I think this is going to start to expand across the world, given the clinical data that you see with Libre and the impact that it has. So I think this is another great opportunity for us. The vitamin C issue that you asked, we've submitted our response. We're working with the FDA on this, and I'm not going to try and forecast that approval. But what I would say is that as soon as that gets approved, then we'll start to see the product with a couple of quarters connect to ID pump systems. We have already launched a connected ID system, AID system in Europe, initial results of the receptivity of that product -- of that combined product in Europe has been very favorable. So I think that's another key growth driver for us in 2023. And then finally, I would say on the pipeline perspective, I don't think it's a 2023 milestone for sales, but I think it's an important development activity for us is going to be the running our trial for the combined glucose-ketone sensor with the FDA and generating the data to support a dual sensor because I think, again, as I've mentioned, it seems to be the go-to sensor for pumpers will be this ability to measure glucose and ketones and factoring that into the algorithms. So that's going to be -- that's obviously having a lot of focus of us in terms of running that trial. And then finally, I would say, outside of Libre, the lingo platform is another kind of key growth driver for us. I've talked about expanding Libre, the Libre platform outside of diabetes and using this more broadly for a much more broader target. We have a separate team that's been working on that development, Larry. We will be launching 2 Lingo products this year. In Europe, I'd say the first one will probably be in the first half of this year and the second one in the second half. So I've talked about Libre being a $10 billion product by 2028 that implies a 15% annual growth rate. We'll do better than that this year. And I think the opportunities we have to be able to drive to that kind of revenue for this product are very real. And I think we've been executing very strongly on all these areas. Larry Biegelsen : That's super helpful. Just one brief follow-up. You talked about being excited about the TriClip opportunity at JPMorgan. I think it was just a month. I know it's limited in what you can say because you're presenting the TRILUMINATE data at ACC. But how are you thinking about that opportunity relative to mitral? Do you still -- and do you still expect approval in the U.S. by year-end '23? Robert Ford : I think it's a great opportunity for us. And I think that we've shown that we're definitely here one of the leaders when it comes to clip-based heart valve repair market. And do I think it's -- do I think it's -- it could be bigger than mitral? I'm not sure I would go that far yet. But I would say that the uptake of the tricuspid repair market, I think, will be faster than the uptake for the mitral just because I think when Mitra was launched, it was the first repair system and now you have a large group of implanting physicians that are familiar with the clip technology are familiar with mapping that clip technology and the procedure. We did make some changes to the delivery device for the clip, it's a little different anatomy, a little bit more challenging to get there with the clip in the tricuspid area. But I think that it's a great opportunity. I mean, I think there's 3 million people today that suffer from tricuspid regurgitation. There's not a lot of really good options available for treatment which is why we invested in the trial here in the U.S. to bring products to the trial. Like you said, we're going to be presenting that in a couple of months. And I think it's a great opportunity for us. We've already seen real nice traction of that in Europe. We launched that in 2021. The team wanted to launch it right in COVID. And I must say at the beginning, I was somewhat against that but they proved me wrong and the product's done really well in Europe. So I think this is another great opportunity for us here in the U.S., too. So we're not ignoring MitraClip, it's part of our entire portfolio. And I think the combination of those 2 products in the implanting physician will be very powerful for Abbott. Operator : And our next question will come from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Robert, I was hoping just to follow up on Larry's question just on Libre, but just thinking more kind of in the out years and this $10 billion target that you've set. I think maybe just -- I think you outlined everything for 2023, probably holds true for over the next 5 years. But just if you could reiterate your confidence we're not in that $10 billion out-year target? And just you expect consolidation between pump and CGM companies. And maybe it would be just great to hear strategic rationale of whether a combined pump CGM offering under one roof would be advantageous for either Abbott or another company? And then the second question is just on Navitor and the launch here in the United States. What would represent a win for Abbott from a U.S. share gain perspective? And what segment is the low-hanging fruit considering the current label? Is it the elderly patients that don't have a long life expectancy that are high risk or even intermediate risk and how do you expect the Navitor launch to play out and add to the macro device growth in 2023? Robert Ford : Sure. Well, I mean, I guess on Libre, to your question on how to get to $10 billion by 2028, I mean, the math will say 15%, right. How do you get 15%. I mean there are real 3 key areas, and I talked a little bit about them. But I'd say, first of all, it's to continue to have a dominant share in the heavy insulin user segment. We have that today with the non-pumpers with the MDI both in the U.S. and globally, internationally. So the real focus there becomes, okay, how do we focus now on the pumper segment and the connectivity over there. And like I said, I think we'll do that with a little bit of catch-up with Libre 2 in terms of what is currently offered in the market. But then to leapfrog that, I think the combined sensor, glucose-ketone sensor is ultimately the way we'll play. And we'll see what pump company is going to want to line up to be first on that connectivity if and once we get that approval because again, I continue to hear from KOLs the importance of that product for the pumper segment. So the second part is the basal expansion. And like I said, you can look at the basal population globally, assume a certain rate globally, a certain utilization rate, and that adds a significant amount of growth to that number. And then the third piece of that is really expanding Libre beyond just diabetes and looking at the Lingo platform. So the adding up and the execution of those strategies are what ultimately gives us confidence that we can get there and we can sustain that 15% growth rate over the next kind of 5 years. Regarding your questions on pumps, listen, I think that it's an important segment. It's one that benefits quite significantly from a combined system. We're now -- we're focusing more aggressively on that. As it relates to an all in one, I think the market has spoken in terms of -- the pumpers want choice. They want to be able to choose what is the best sensor pump combination. And so I think right now, my view on that is the consumers have spoken, the market has spoken, the regulators spoken, they want that interchangeability. And I think that our focus will be on providing the best sensor for the pump systems that are out there. So that's -- I think I covered your Libre questions. I think you had a question on Navitor. Listen, we're excited about this. It's a large market. It's a large segment here in the U.S., it's about $3 billion. Our label is about 50% -- sorry, it's about 50% of the market because we're only approved right now for the high-risk patients. But it's got a strong clinical profile. I mean we'll be sharing data at CRP specifically to this, but I mean we've already released some data on it last year comparing it to other valve systems. So I think that we've been very intentional about wanting to enter this market and to do it in a way that is sustainable. Expectations, I mean, I've talked a little bit about this. There's obviously 2 pretty well entrenched players in the U.S. market. do I think that we can be a leader in 3, 4, 5 years, I think that might be difficult. But I think that we can come into this market and offer another choice, another opportunity that provides additional benefits or differentiated benefits versus other systems that allow us to pick up share. If I look at where we are in Europe, we launched this in Europe, and we have high single-digit share in Europe. And we're not in all centers, we're in about half of the market. In the centers that we are implanted and available, our shares in the mid-teens. So you put that together, we're high single, but where we're competing, we're in the mid-teens. So I think this will be a ramp. I think we've got the sales force in place. We want to roll this out in a way that allows us to be sustainable in that strategy of being able to be a double-digit share gain over the next couple of years. Operator : And our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : I have 2. The first one has to do with Nutrition. And if you could outline where the company is in terms of the recovery and when do you think it will return to growth? And then the second question has to do with the use of cash, what are your thoughts on it and where you are on share repurchases? Robert Ford : Sure. Well, on Nutrition, as I said in the opening statements, production at Sturgis is up and running. The team is working around-the-clock, nonstop, very hard. Number 1 focus here, as I said, was to serve the customers, get product back on shelves. We started with WIC. The inventory levels on our WIC contracts are very good as we entered into Q4, and we then started to focus on our non-WIC brands, and that's progressed very well in the fourth quarter. And as we go into this year, looking very good. So I would say, if you look at our growth rate, obviously, you've got this year-over-year comp. You're going to see the growth already in Q1, Joanne, right, because we were impacted last year in February. But I guess the right way to look at this is, okay, strip away the comp, strip away where this year-over-year effect of coming back on the market, et cetera, I expect our business -- our overall nutrition business to be growing at that pre-pandemic level between 4% and 6%. Our market shares in WIC have largely recovered, and we're seeing a nice cadence of recovery in the non-WIC share here in the U.S. So I think you'll start to see that growth rate already on the print in Q1, obviously, in Q2 and Q3. But the important thing here is we're looking at our share and the share recovery is very much in line with our forecast that we've set for the full year. I'd like to see our market share get back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. I'm sorry, what was your other question? Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : Use of cash and whether -- where would you stand on share repurchases? Robert Ford : Sure. While use of cash talked about this. We've taken this balanced approach. I'd say if I were to kind of rank it in terms of use of cash, we're committed to growing a dividend, a strong and growing dividend. So that's probably #1 use of cash. We announced that increase of about 9% in our dividend last year. So that's I'll say is priority number one. Number 2 is obviously ensuring that all of these new products that we've got launching are appropriately resourced in terms of manufacturing and a lot of our CapEx investments. On the buybacks, we did throughout the first 9 months of last year, we had about $3 billion of buybacks. And I'd say, we probably did a little bit of catch-up there, Joanne, in terms of catching up to some of the dilution as we were focusing on getting our leverage down post acquisition. So we do a little bit of catch-up there. And I'd say in terms of buybacks going forward, we'll be contemplating them and they'll be largely focused on offsetting any kind of dilution that we have this year. I'd say the other kind of key use here for us this year is going to be debt. We have some debt towers coming up, and we're not going to be renegotiating those just given interest rates. We want to move those off. So that's probably where you see the use of cash. On the M&A side, which I know is always a question, so I'll preempt anybody over there who's got that on their list. I talked about it where -- on several calls, we're interested. We're actively assessing the opportunities, whether it's tuck-in on up. Clearly, the valuations here have come down somewhat and I think they need to stabilize a little bit. But we have casted -- we casted a pretty wide net. Diagnostics devices are the areas where we have most interest. And again, if it financially makes sense for our shareholders, and it fits strategically, then we will -- we've got that strategic flexibility in our balance sheet to do that. And we're going to be looking at businesses where we can bring value, whether it's -- whether we can accelerate sales, whether we can enhance an R&D program or enhance its probably success, a growth area that we can build and have a path to building a position or even if it's just to augment our own existing pipeline. I think when we've taken that approach -- our track record shows that when we've taken that approach, it's largely been very successful for our shareholders. Operator : And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Robert. Maybe my first question on your organic growth assumptions here. I think I heard 8-plus is a reasonable number for '23. What is that assuming for any impact from China supply chain, any VBP impact? If you could just give us some assumptions around those macro factors that would be helpful. Robert Ford : Well, I'll let Bob talk a little bit about some of the potentially other macro factors. But the ones you've just mentioned here. I mean China, it's an important market for us, Vijay. It's an important growth market, and it's good that it's moved to a more kind of reopening play. I think that has not only a big impact for us in China, where we've got a strong position. I mean, we're not overly reliant, I'd say it's about less than 5% of our total sales. But nonetheless, it's an important kind of growth market for us. And I think that reopening in China is going to have a real positive spillover effect in other areas of the world. And I would say, predominantly in Asia, Southeast Asia, where we've got strong position in our EPD and in our Nutrition business and some device areas, too. So I think the overall opening of China is good. Like Bob said, there's going to be some choppiness in the first quarter because we're seeing a lot of cases, hospitalizations, et cetera. But I think as that moves -- starts to move down, I think we'll see a pretty strong rebound in our growth prospects over there.  So the VBP that you mentioned, yes, I mean, that does have an impact. It's more restricted for 2023 in our electrophysiology business. So we'll feel a little bit of an impact there, but I think that the market opens up for us because of the strategy we took on VBP side. So I think it's net-net, it's going to be positive for us in the long term here, medium, long term in terms of that being an opportunity for us. We've seen this, Vijay. I mean, this happened to us -- this happened in the market with stents in 2019, in our vascular business. That business is back to what I would call pre VBP levels this year. So there's an impact. In that case, we didn't necessarily win some of the contracts. In the case of VBP, we did win the contracts, so -- or a portion of the contract. So I'd say macro, yes, we've got some of these headwinds that we've talked about FX. I think Bob has already talked about it, inflation. But all those seem to be easing off a little bit and the recovery of the procedures and the pipeline and the product launch is a key growth driver for us. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then Bob, one for you on the gross margins you're at 56%. That's a step down year-on-year. When I look at pre-pandemic, you guys were at 59%. Is there a simple bridge Bob on how much of this has been inflation, you did spoke for hedging impact. Is that all hitting your gross margin line? And why shouldn't inflationary pressures improve? And when can we start seeing gross margins creep back up to pre-pandemic levels? Robert Funck : Yes. So the -- as I said in my opening remarks around 56% for the year. That's a modest step-up kind of from where we exited last year. As you would expect, Vijay, in this environment, there's a lot of different dynamics that multinationals are facing. We've got some headwinds. We've talked about those inflationary impact, how that flows through, including the inventory we built last year that will be sold this year. We talked about currency where we're going to -- we're not going to see a repeat of those hedging gains that we had in '22. So that's a -- that's a bit of a headwind there. On the positive side, I'd say the recovery we're forecasting in the U.S. infant nutrition business will contribute positively. And as that recovery occurs over the course of the year that will have a more positive impact. We also have gross margin improvement programs across all of our businesses that will help to offset some of those headwinds. And we're taking price where we can, I'd say, in our more consumer-facing businesses. And then finally, I'd say just the kind of from a mix standpoint, as we continue to see an acceleration in our medical device business with some of these new product launches. Those are higher gross margins than the overall company, and that will positively contribute to our gross margin. If you -- to your question about kind of where we pre pandemic in what we're guiding to this year kind of I'd say the biggest impact on a cumulative basis has really been inflation. And that's really the -- I'd say the big difference here in terms of where we're guiding right now, and where we were pre-pandemic. But as we continue to see an acceleration from a mix standpoint and continue to work at some of our costs, we'd expect over time to see that gross margin to continue to improve. Operator : And our next question will come from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Travis Steed : Just a follow-up to Vijay's question. On the inflation piece, is that still $1 billion baked into the $4.40 guidance? I just want to make sure I understand what's baked in on the gross margin line. And then anything to call out on the 2023 operating margin expansion some of the moving parts to get the op margin expansion there. It looks like 22% is kind of what's implied by the guide? Robert Funck : Yes. So yes, on the gross -- on the operating margin, yes, we're around 22% kind of where we were pre-pandemic. We're getting the high single-digit growth on the top line kind of in the -- excluding the COVID testing. We're getting leverage down the P&L, which Robert talked about, where we were able forward invest over the last couple of years. So we're going to get leverage in the expense area, and that gets you to around 22% op margin. In terms of inflation, we are going to see a carryover impact from last year, still pretty meaningful. But we've been able to mitigate a good portion of that through both our gross margin improvement programs that we have across our businesses as well as taking some price where we can. Travis Steed : Okay. That's helpful. And a couple of product questions on EP. I think you mentioned the new EP catheter mapping system. I know that was new, maybe I missed that in the past. I'm curious how you're thinking about pulsed-filed ablation and the impact on your EP business. And then the other product question was on Libre. The Vitamin C, is that on Libre 2 or Libre 3 just want to understand the pathway to get vitamin C on Libre 3 and the timing there? Robert Ford : Sure. On the Libre 3, Vit C, I mean it's going to start off with Libre 2. So we want to get that done first, and then we'll progress on to Libre 3. So focus right now is on Libre 2 and then we'll move to Libre 3. On your question on EP, yes, I mean, I think the new catheter that we've launched Japan and start to launch in Europe towards the end of last year as our TactiFlex, which is really using contact sports together with the flexible tip that we had in our flex catheter. So the feedback we've got in that is really, really positive. So I think the combination here of our enhanced new mapping system together with our market-leading mapping catheter in HD grid and now bringing TactiFlex. That combination is very powerful. Regarding PSA, it's definitely an area of interest. We've been investing in it. We actually had 2 internal programs, had a bake off and saw the one that we felt stronger about, taking some of the learnings that we're seeing from the current on-market products. And there's obviously some trialing that's ongoing right now, but I would say it's a growth opportunity. It's an interesting area. I think it's still too early to say in terms of will the market move completely over to this technology or not. I think it's important to have it and hence, why we're investing in our program and incorporating into our R&D program, all of a sudden of the deficiencies that we've heard from some of the market products are the ones that are being put in development right now. So important area -- important investment area for us in EP definitely benefited from kind of the investments that we made during COVID. And I think it's an important product to have. It's ability to convert, I think it will convert a portion of the market. My sense is cryo was probably the first one. But how much of cryo still up to see, but definitely an interesting area for investment. Robert Funck : We'll take one more question. Operator : And our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Matthew Miksic : I figure maybe just if we can wrap it up with an update on a couple of the pipeline products, the 5 products, Robert, that you've highlighted in the past, Amulet and CardioMEMS, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about where you are with these launches in terms of size, scale, momentum and maybe what kinds of catalysts we can look for or metrics we can see for these 2 products this year? Robert Ford : Sure. I mean I think those 5 products that I discussed on the last call, and we talked about them exiting at an annual run rate of [ 500 ]. They actually exited at a run rate of [ 550 ] and they grew around -- they grew around 100%. So I expect those 5 products to kind of have maybe not 100%, but pretty high growth rate in next -- in this year. Regarding Amulet, listen, I think it's -- like I said, it's a great space. We've been rolling out the product last year, building the sales force. Key focus here is obviously ensuring good implanting technique with the physicians. We're in about 225 accounts right now. I expect that in terms of growth catalysts, getting more share of those existing accounts as the physicians become more and more accustomed to using our product and see the benefits of using our product versus other systems I think that will be a growth catalyst and then expanding. We do want to start to expand more. As our sales force has increased, the competency of our sales team has increased and our clinical team has increased, we feel more confident now to be able to kind of expand more accounts. And that's what we'll be focused on. Another key catalyst of growth here is obviously the trial that we've been investing on in catalysts, which is to compare Amulet to novel oral anticoagulant. So that's another opportunity. It's not one in 2023, but continuing that enrollment in that trial is an important driver for kind of the long-term growth strategy here of Amulet. CardioMEMS has done very good. We saw an indication expansion last year in the U.S., seen a nice step-up in sales. I think it's a great long-term opportunity. I think it's part of those 5 products that are driving a lot of growth. And I'd say probably the next kind of big area, I mean, we've been investing in Salesforce and rolling this out. Next big area here is working on that NCD. I think that will remove some of maybe some regional hang-ups in terms of reimbursement. So the NCD is something that we're going to be working on this year with the data that we've collected as part of all of our trials. So I think they look very strong as part of that group of 5 products. I'd like to close up the call here. Just a few remarks. The operating environment still remains challenging, right? But it's not as challenging as we saw back in Q3 of 2022 in October. There are definitely signs here of stability. There are signs of improvement, whether it's in the macroeconomic side or whether it's specifically in the segments that we are competing in. And Abbott is well positioned. We're well positioned to both capitalize on this improving environment or to navigate if there's any unforeseen volatility over here. That's what our portfolio has been built for. That's what our balance sheet is set up for. It's set up for these kind of situations and these kind of scenarios. We always knew that pandemic level testing was not a base case. We knew that eventually this would move down to an endemic-like testing. And we're -- our view here is that in 2023, we'll start this process of moving to that and -- so as a result of that, we did do this forward investing into our growth areas, whether it's devices, diagnostics, certain areas in EPD or nutrition. And that's allowed us to grow at the pre-pandemic level, this high single-digit top-tier growth without having to make the OpEx investment that you would expect to be able to sustain that growth. So we're getting that flow through on the P&L and net leverage on our investments. I do recognize the cost pressures. The company recognized those cost pressures. We talked about this now. To Vijay's question, we're going to be working relentlessly on getting our gross margin back to that pre-pandemic level, and it's a combination of working in our cost profiles and our GMI programs, but also as we accelerate the growth in our device business, that mix shift contributes to that. And finally, our balance sheet is strong and provides us the strategic flexibility we need to navigate. And we take this balanced approach where we can provide returns to our shareholders, while at the same time, investing for the long term. So thank you for being on the call. Overall, I think Abbott is very well positioned as we kind of exit this kind of pandemic state and move into more of an endemic state. I think we're well positioned and now it's all about execution. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. Scott Leinenweber : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. . Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.  Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong results to start the year. First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.03, which is above consensus estimates, driven entirely by strong underlying base business performance, excluding COVID testing. Organic sales growth excluded COVID testing increased 10% led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition.  As you'll recall, back in January, I expressed some optimism that the headwinds Abbott and other companies faced over the last few years were starting to peak and in some cases ease a bit. As we move through the first part of the year, that's exactly what we continue to see. Most notably, the impact of COVID has rapidly and significantly lessened. As part of this transition, certain behavioral shifts have been evident across society. One simple illustrative example has been the significant increase in travel and tourism, we've all seen, heard about or experience firsthand.  A much more relevant and important behavioral shift that we're seeing in health care globally has been the increased priority people are putting on getting healthy and staying healthy. And for our businesses, the impacts have been increased routine diagnostic testing volumes, improved medical device procedure trends and strong demand for consumer-based health products. The net results this past quarter was strong, broad-based growth across our portfolio. Importantly, this growing focus on health adds to and enhances other favorable demographic trends such as a global population that's growing older and living longer and increasing access to health care around the world. Combination of these favorable market dynamics, along with the strength of our growth platforms and new product pipeline provides a strong foundation for sustainable, top-tier growth going forward. I'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 11% in the quarter. This continues EPD's impressive stretch of consistent strong performance, including double-digit growth each of the last 2 years. Growth this past quarter was led by strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management. Turning to Nutrition, where sales increased more than 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., Pediatric Nutrition growth of more than 35% included the impact of lower sales in the first quarter of last year due to a voluntary recall of certain infant formula products. We continue to make good progress, increasing manufacturing production and recovering market share in this business. Internationally, total Nutrition sales grew mid-single digits overall, and sales in global Adult Nutrition also grew mid-single digits, driven by strong performance of our market-leading Ensure brand. Moving to Diagnostics, where as forecasted, sales growth was negatively impacted by a significant decrease in COVID testing sales compared to the first quarter of last year. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales growth was led by mid- to -high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. In Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was led by strong performance in the U.S. and Europe, which was partially offset by soft market conditions in China early in the year, though we're seeing improving market demand over the last several weeks. Excluding China, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales grew nearly 8% globally. And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 12.5% globally on an organic basis, including mid-teens growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth internationally. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, including approximately 50% growth in the U.S. and mid-teens internationally. During the quarter, Libre received U.S. FDA clearance for connectivity with automated insulin delivery systems. We're working with leading insulin pump manufacturers to integrate their systems with both Libre 2 and Libre 3 as soon as possible. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew more than 8% overall in the quarter. And impressively, organic sales growth rate improved sequentially compared to the prior quarter in every one of our cardiovascular device businesses. This broad-based strength was led by strong double-digit growth in Heart Failure and Structural Heart. In Heart Failure, sales of CardioMEMS grew more than 30%, which represents the third quarter in a row that CardioMEMS sales have grown more than 25%. In Electrophysiology, performance was led by high teens growth in Europe, including strong, broad-based performance across big 5 European countries, which was driven by cardiac ablation catheters and mapping systems.  In Structural Heart, growth was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, along with strong contributions from 3 recently launched products, Amulet, Navitor and TriClip, which combined to grow nearly 50% in the quarter. And lastly, in Neuromodulation sales grew 11%, driven by a recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management, which targets a large segment of the market where we didn't previously compete.  So in summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding financial expectations on both top and bottom lines. The strong performance we're achieving is broad-based and fueled by strong execution, new products and improving market conditions. And our core foundational growth platforms have strong momentum and are achieving exceptional results, positioning us well for top-tier growth going forward.  And now I'll turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our first quarter results. Sales decreased 14.5% on an organic basis due to, as expected, a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 10% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.3% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, which reflects flow-through impacts from the elevated inflation we experienced last year on certain manufacturing and distribution costs as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 28.3% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be at least high single digits. We're now forecasting COVID testing-related sales of around $1.5 billion, which is below the full year forecast of approximately $2 billion we provided in January due to current testing dynamics we're seeing in the market.  For the second quarter, we forecast COVID testing sales of around $200 million. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of a little more than 2% on second quarter reported sales. Lastly, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged, but now reflects a lower earnings contribution from COVID testing sales compared to expectations in January, offset by raising our underlying base business earnings forecast by a little more than $0.10 based on our strong performance and outlook.  With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Congratulations on a nice start to the year. So Robert, you raised the base business organic growth and held EPS flat despite lower expected COVID testing sales. Can you please provide more color on the trends you're seeing across your businesses and geographies that allowed you to maintain EPS? And how does that feed into 2024? It sounds like you're thinking more about the base business, ex testing going forward? And I have 1 follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure, Larry. I think that you summarized it pretty well there. We reduced our COVID forecast right now from $2 billion to about $1.5 billion, but maintained the previous guidance, and that was the result of a better performance that we're seeing in our base -- in our underlying base business. I think that's actually a pretty great trade-off to have our base business have a raise of just over $0.10 here, offsetting this decline in COVID testing.  As I said in my comments in the beginning, Larry, back in January, we were seeing already some signs of a better environment, right, specifically in devices we're starting to see already the hospitals and the systems starting to get their handle on staffing shortages. From an inflation perspective, we talked about some of the commodities starting to turn a little bit, not all of them, but some of them starting to turn. So that's really translated, I'd say, in improving top line on the base business, better diagnostic testing, more procedures. I'd say if you look at the procedure trends throughout the quarter, if you look at cardio specifically of around 8%, you look at the way we exited February and specifically March, they were double digits in March. So the real impact there was, I'd say, the reopening of China in January and the beginning of the quarter. That created a little bit of friction, but it was pretty broad-based across the systems in Diagnostics and Devices, U.S., Europe, Asia. We saw good performance in Japan also. So that gave us a lot of confidence that we're on the right trajectory here.  And I'd say we're forecasting at least these high single-digit growth for the base business. And that's because of what we've been talking about over these last couple of years, which is reinvesting some of those COVID revenues and profits into the base business. So we're able to drive accelerated growth through without having to provide extra funding, let's call it that way, to that growth. So I think there's a real strong start to the year to see double digits in Devices, EPD, Nutrition, we continue our recovery there. So it's a really good strong start to the year. I think it's very sustainable. Of course, we're going to keep pushing and wanting more. But I think it's a good starting point. Regarding your 2024 question. I get it -- these last couple of years, Larry, usually in our first call, it's always about what's going to happen in the next year because of COVID. So I get that question. I'd say right now, I'm not going to give any specific guidance, but if you look at our underlying base business, we're a little over -- right now, we're forecasting for this year a little over $4 of EPS. And we always start our planning process here as double digits. This year, we're forecasting really strong double-digit growth because like we've talked about, making those investments, getting the leverage through the P&L and not having to invest to get that additional earnings growth. And that's our starting point as we go into next year, targeting that double-digit EPS growth. And I think it starts with driving a strong top line. And if we maintain a strong top line, which I'm sure we'll get into all the growth drivers here, I feel very good about them and the sustainability of them and the investment and the execution.  So we keep that strong top line. There's obviously work that we got to continue to do on margin and margin expansion, and that's a big area of focus for us. Those are really the elements here. Strong top line on the base business going into 2024 and targeting that double-digit growth with that top line and margin expansion. Larry Biegelsen : That's super helpful. Just for my follow-up, Robert, Cardio and Neuro was strong this quarter at about 8.5% organic. Can you talk about the trends there and the sustainability of that? There's still concerns in the investment community about your EP business with PFA competition coming. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, like I said, I think the trends in the quarter were very positive. I think, like I said, I think it's a combination of improving conditions. I think the hospital systems have done a really good job right now at managing through the staffing shortages, and we're starting to see the impact there. And then the combination of our product launches and execution of those product launches. Like I said, I think it was pretty broad-based across the geographies. And really, the only challenge we had was in January in China, but I think we're starting to see, again, a lot of growth in that market, too. So I think it's very sustainable. Regarding your question on PFA. Yes, I mean, I think it's an interesting technology. We've been working on it for several years now, Larry. And haven't been as public about what we're doing. That's probably driven by my direction to the team, but I think we'll share more about it at [ HRS ] this year in terms of everything we've done. As a backdrop to that, I guess I would say one of the benefits of having a very large installed open mapping system based on the markets, we actually get to see these systems being used in real world. And it's a great product development tool to be quite honest with you. So a lot of our focus and the development of our program, Larry, is really looking at some of the gaps and some of the challenges we're seeing in these first-generation catheter systems and really looking at addressing those. So I think what the team has been working on is really unique and differentiated. So I don't think that PFA will be the one tool to rule all tools. I think that it will be a tool that will be important. We're obviously working on our system. I think that the companies that are going to be winning in this space are going to be those that can effectively work with PFA and at the same time, work with RF.  So I think there are a couple of questions that are going to still need to be answered over the next 12 to 18 months, Larry. I think safety and efficacy is one that still needs to be -- we see certain signals in certain markets. So those, I think, need to kind of work their way through the type of cases, type of patients that are going to be used with this product. I think one big question on the PFA is kind of can it actually improve real-world procedure times. I think that's the big question I have in terms of what I've been seeing, what our teams have been seeing. And then given all the pressures that the health systems have is a 3x to 4x premium on RF, is that actually sustainable. So bottom line, I think our device, cardio device portfolio is well developed across all the different areas of growth opportunities that we have. And I think that PFA is going to be an important technology that we've been working and investing on to bring to market and looking more as a second-generation product. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Congrats on the strong start to the year. I was hoping to ask 1 question and related follow-up. But what is -- Rob, just to help think through some of the core gross margin and operating margin trajectories from the core business with the COVID testing, volumes coming down and the historic margin contribution in the last couple of years, but I'd love to just hear about drivers of gross and operating margin expansion. Like pre-COVID, we were thinking 50 basis points or up to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion was plausible for your business. And maybe just help us think through the trajectories, but also any leverage you can pull to support double-digit EPS growth trajectory in 2024, if there's some unpredictable headwinds that pop up. I just have 1 related follow-up. Robert Ford : Sure. I mean I think as I said to Larry, I mean, I think it starts with the top line, right, and being able to drive that top line and especially the top line coming from our med device portfolio, which obviously has margins that are accretive to the overall company. So looking at the growth drivers there, whether it's the Structural Heart portfolio, the EP portfolio, Libre and Diabetes or recovery in Nutrition. I mean, I think these are all important areas of top line growth that will drive accretion to our margins. One of the challenges that we all faced has been the impact of inflation on our input costs. And as I said, I think some of those are normalizing a little bit. I think last year, a lot of the focus was just to ensure that we had access to all the raw materials, right? And I think in those situations, we ultimately had to deal with elevated prices. And I think that some of these will unwind over time. This is not a -- I don't think this is a quick fix, but it's definitely an area that we're going to see steady improvement over the next couple of years here in terms of improvement. We've been able to take price where we can to offset some of those inputs, those cost input increases, but I think it's really the focus on the top line with our device portfolio that drives the accretion and then combined with focusing on our gross margin improvement programs, which we have across all of the businesses and that get the attention and the focus every month in our operating meeting. So the combination of those 2 factors are what gives us confidence for that margin expansion. Operator : Mr. Jennings, please make sure your line is not on mute. Joshua Jennings : I was on mute. I apologize. I wanted to just, related follow-up, you already touched on taking price, Rob. And would love to hear mostly on the device business, how pricing is shaping up in 2023. But also if you could touch on any other businesses where price is turning into a tailwind for your business that would be great to hear. Robert Ford : Yes. I think on price, we've historically, as a company, our high single-digit growth really driven by volume, whether it's expanding markets or taking market share. I'd say on the device side, pricing historically has been a headwind for us. I'd say, over the last 12 to 18 months, it hasn't been one. So we've been able to, at least, kind of hold pricing, I wouldn't say gone out and did big pricing increases, but at least being able to hold pricing. I'd say more on the consumer side of the business, Josh, is where we've been able to kind of take price. If you look at our Nutrition business, we haven't been able to offset 100% of the commodity increase, but we've been able to apply some price increases globally across the portfolio.  In our Established Pharmaceutical business, there are segments of the market where it is more kind of cash pay. And we've been able to implement pricing increasing there. I think the team in EPD has done a pretty good job at how to implement those and still have good share positions across our therapeutic areas. So those are probably the areas that we've been able to implement pricing increases. And to your point on tailwind, if we start to see the commodities and some of the input costs come down, especially these more consumer-based businesses, I think the strength of our brands, whether it's in Nutrition or an EPD, there's an opportunity there to have that kind of tailwind. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Great. Congrats on a nice quarter here. Maybe to start, Robert, we just saw you get approval earlier this week for Medicare reimbursement for type 2 patients that use basal insulin for Libre 3. Clearly, a really big opportunity. But would love to get your thoughts on, first, how this impacts Abbott. And then broader how you see improving reimbursement, both in the U.S., around the world evolving over the next few years and the benefit it could add to the Libre business? Robert Ford : Sure, Robbie. I've talked about how this is an important part of the growth strategy and an important part of the market opportunity for [ CGMs ] as a whole.  We've been investing and generating the clinical data to be able to kind of support this. So this is a great opportunity for us. I'd say I talked about, there's about 4 million type 2 basal insulin users here in the U.S., about 1/3 of them are on Medicare. So it will start there. I think we built a robust kind of position in this patient segment, and that includes not only the clinical data that we produced, but building a sales force that's focused more on the primary care side. I think the product lends itself very well to this patient population also. So I think we're excited about the opportunity. I think I've sized it at about $1 billion plus in terms of opportunity in the short term here. And as the CMS reimbursement starts to play out, we know that there will be eventually a spill onto private payers here in the U.S. It's difficult to forecast that because each plan will look at its own population and make its own determinations. But I think that provides a nice tailwind of growth over the next couple of years for this franchise. And I don't think it's just a U.S. situation. We're seeing other countries around the world also start to expand the reimbursement. And it's a combination of both the clinical data that supports the use of CGMs on this patient group and also specifically, I'd say, for FreeStyle Libre the value proposition in terms of being able to support a larger group of patients have the benefits without necessarily having to have a significant premium, I guess, call it over that. So we've seen markets outside the U.S. already kind of do that, and we're seeing good results in terms of its implementation. So I think it's a great opportunity for the category and more specifically for Libre. Robert Marcus : Great. And maybe a quick follow-up here. Structural Heart had been challenged throughout the pandemic, and here we are with a nice double-digit growth quarter from you. Can you speak to -- is this the start of a strong recovery here? Anything in the quarter that feels durable to you? And then also, you had some, in my opinion, good TriClip data at [ ACC ] earlier this year. Your thoughts on how that might evolve over the year as well. Robert Ford : Yes. I mean I think we've always looked at our Structural Heart portfolio over the -- at least the last 3, 4 years and made all the investments in terms of building a product pipeline, building commercial infrastructure globally in the market. So this is definitely an area of growth. I think the entire portfolio looks really strong and really durable and really sustainable, Robbie, whether it's our position in mitral, our building of our position in the tricuspid area. We're entering the aortic area with Navitor seeing good momentum over there also. Amulet, the launch of Amulet also. So I think we've really built a strong pipeline of products and commercial footprint here. So I think it's doing what -- this quarter, what we've always envisioned it to do, which is to be a top-tier growth contributor to Abbott. Regarding your question on TriClip, I agree with you, too. I was pleased with the results. I was pleased with the outcome. As I said in the past, I don't think it's a one study, and that's it. I think you have to continue to invest in generating clinical data. It's what we did with MitraClip. But the trial enrolled really fast. And I think that's always a good sign in terms of the speed of enrollment, in terms of its acceptance and excitement from the physicians. And that's because there's not a lot of good treatment options for these patients.  As you know, traditional surgery over here has got a high mortality rate, and diuretics don't really work well. So I think the measures we saw in terms of the TR reduction, the quality of life improvement scores, I think they are probably some of the best that we've ever seen in a heart failure trial. So the bottom line, I think these patients are in rough shape, and I think the physicians know this. So we feel good about the data. We've already submitted it to the FDA. So that's been submitted. I know the CMS will probably review this in parallel. And I believe that click-based devices here are going to be the first option. They've got strong efficacy data and a very good safety data also. So I think -- you think it's good data, I think it's good data, too, and I'm cautiously optimistic here of bringing this product. We're seeing great momentum in Europe. So that's a proof point here that I can tell you is a lot of great growth that we're seeing in Europe. Operator : Our next question will come from Rick Wise from Stifel. Frederick Wise : Sorry for my scratchy voice, a little bit. I was hoping we could talk about Diagnostic broadly ex COVID, you're thinking about what's next, broadly for the franchise as COVID wanes. But more specifically, we haven't had an [ Alinity ] update in a while. I know this is a multi-platform, multiyear rollout process. Where are we in that process? How much more do we have to go? And any other diagnostic perspectives you'd want to share? Robert Ford : Thanks, Rick. Yes, I mean, I think -- so the way we were thinking about Alinity and Alinity rollout, it was a multi-platform, multiyear rollout, right? If you look at these contracts, that you enter in there between 7 to 10 years. So you're really looking at 12%, 15% of the market that's up for renewal every year. So we always looked at this as multiyear. It did take a back seat a little bit, I would say, during COVID as a lot of hospital systems weren't necessarily focused on RFPing their diagnostic, really just focusing on treating patients and doing the tests related to COVID. So what we began to see, I'd say, probably middle of last year, definitely into the end of the last -- definitely into Q4 of last year and going into this quarter is those RFPs in that process are restarting back up again.  So -- and I think we saw this a little bit on our growth rate here, again, excluding COVID. And you look at our Core Lab business, which is the predominant base of our Diagnostic business, growing 7% if you take out China, which started off a little bit roughly in the 8%, which is the range that we tend to target here, Rick. So I think we're restarting the process and reaccelerating it. I think it's going well.  I think we saw good growth in the U.S. and good growth in Europe and that's good. One of the areas that got impacted during COVID also was transfusion. So we saw a drop in donations during COVID. So I'm glad there was inventory in the blood banks to be able to deal with that. But now we're starting to see donation start to ramp up again and the rebuilding of inventories and the picking up of donations. So I think that, that's also another positive sign.  And specifically on the blood bank side, our system Alinity s system, it really requires a lot less manual labor. There's a lot of automation in there. And I think that's something that we're seeing a lot from the blood banks as donations are ramping up again, the ability to take advantage of that increased demand with our system. So I would say that we could probably grow faster than that, but I think it would come at some margin erosion because you're going to have to place a lot of boxes to be able to get to the double-digit growth.  So I think that this growth rate that we've established here 7%, 8%, 8.5% is the right growth rate where we can actually drive top line growth and at the same time, drive bottom line profitability. I think our margin profile in this business is probably one of the highest amongst the industry. So I think the team has done a really good job at finding that right balance. So all in all, I think -- it took a little bit of break during COVID, but it's restarted right now, and I like the systems we have, the position we have and the commercial execution that's in place. Frederick Wise : Okay. That's very thorough. As a follow-up, I wanted to focus on Nutritional, but I'm going to also sneak in a quick CardioMEMS as well. Nutritional, it's great to see the 10% performance, the strong U.S. recovery. It sounds like you're making solid progress. What's next -- when do we get back to normal in your view? And what is the new normal growth? And just to sneak in the CardioMEMS, jeez, I've been watching the CardioMEMS story, Robert, for over a decade back to St. Jude days. And I always thought it was great technology. What's Abbott's special sauce that you're driving such a superb performance? And where do we go from here with CardioMEMS. So why -- what's happening? Robert Ford : I guess on the Nutrition side, I think the team has made a lot of progress. They work incredibly hard at this. Our manufacturing and our market recovery are in line with our expectations. I've talked about -- we've talked about this business being between 4% to 6% in terms of the target growth range, maybe towards the upper end of that range. And ultimately, that's when everything kind of normalizes and you don't have some of these comps, that's what I expect this business to be in.  Regarding CardioMEMS, this has been a little bit of a journey for us. I think we found the right combination here of what I would call, making the investments that we needed to make on the clinical -- generating the clinical data and the clinical trial. We've obviously had an expansion in our label that happened last year. But I think the biggest and most important part here is commercial execution on the ground and thinking about workflow in the hospital systems, right, managing that and addressing that and working with the hospitals to address this workflow has been probably the biggest impact that the team has had. And then we're going to continue to invest in more clinical data and product upgrade. So I feel great about this product. Operator : Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on the [indiscernible] this morning, and I had 1 back, Robert, on this base EPS question. I think based on some of the numbers you disclosed, it looks like the base earnings EPS is about $4.10 in fiscal [ '23 ], excluding COVID testing. Assuming base EPS grows double digits, historical average algorithm, we're looking at something like 450-ish for fiscal '24. The variables here are of endemic COVID testing run rate, [ what if ] inflation coming down and capital deployment assumptions, right? So if you could just parse out, is $250 million, $300 million like a right number for endemic COVID testing. And what is your current inflation -- total gross inflation that Abbott has taken a hit on versus prepandemic? And what part of that inflation is coming down? Or could there be some pricing offsets in that cap deployment? Robert Ford : Sure. So I think you've got the numbers kind of in the right direction there, Vijay, if I followed all of that. And I would say, as I said, that primary driver of that is going to be the base business performance driving that growth. Regarding COVID for 2024, listen, I'm going to need to see a little bit how the testing environment evolves. We brought down the forecast for this year based on what we're seeing. I'd say there's very little public investment, I would say, in testing.  So it's mostly now a private market. I think we do very well in that segment with the brand that we've built, not just here in the U.S., but overseas also. But it might be a little bit early to try and forecast what COVID is going to be next year. But I think the number you threw out there of a few hundred million dollars is maybe a good starting point. But again, we're going to have to see how that evolves during the year. Regarding your inflation question, I'm going to ask Bob to address it. Robert Funck : Yes. Vijay, so we saw a lot of inflation, which we talked about on the last few calls, really hitting us last year, it was probably tuned around $1 billion. We saw some carryover inflation there into this year, but we've essentially been able to offset that through some of the gross margin programs we have across our businesses, which Robert talked on as well as taking some price in some of the areas of the business, again, with more consumer-facing businesses. So we've really been able to kind of mute that carryover inflation this year, but we still have probably about $1 billion, call it, 240, 250 basis points worth of -- where the headwind currently sitting in our gross margin. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And then sorry, Robert, capital deployment, I think CSI acquisition, people thought was on the smaller side. How are you thinking about capital deployment? And then one on product side. The Libre U.S. number, 50% was a big number. Is there anything from a competitive perspective that's going on? Is Abbott gaining share? Or is this the underlying market growth? Robert Ford : I'll talk about us. I mean I think the 50% growth there is pretty strong. We've been at this rate for couple of quarters now. I think it's a combination of our product launch and our execution and expansion of the market. So I think the 50% here is -- like I said, I don't know what the other manufacturers are going to -- are seeing, but that 50%, I'd say that's our growth rate. And so I think it's doing very well. Sorry, what was your first question? It got... Vijay Kumar : On cap deployment, cap deployment. Robert Ford : Yes. I mean I think you guys almost feel like you want to have like some sort of model from us in terms of how we do this. I guess the best model -- the only model that we're looking at is what's the best return for our shareholders here. And what we found is having this kind of balanced approach where we're committed to a strong and growing dividend. We make the investments in our organic opportunities to drive organic growth. And we've been doing those in Med Device, in Diagnostics, in Nutrition. And if there's an opportunity for M&A, to able to add to the portfolio, then we'll do that. And we announced the -- our intention to acquire CSI. And I think it was fit exactly our criteria here, Vijay, which is -- it's a great strategic fit, wanted to build more of a position in the peripheral side. You've been seeing what we've been doing. We acquired a thrombectomy company about 1.5 years ago, now looking at atherectomy with CSI. So it's a good strategic fit.  They have a strong position in a growth area that we like, and we believe that we can add value and the deal made sense financially for the company. So that kind of fits into our framework of how we look at M&A and how I've talked about it. So the allocation is balanced, and we'll look at what's the best return for our shareholders as we allocate the capital. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : Nice quarter. A couple of catch-up questions. Can you update your guidance and thoughts on interest expense, and where you are on share purchases in the quarter and plans for the year? And I'll toss my real question in. EPD, another quarter of double-digit growth, what is driving that? And in your view, how sustainable is that in a potentially recessionary environment? Robert Ford : Okay. I'll take the EPD question here. Listen, I think that this is a -- we've been doing this for many years here, I would say. I think we've carved out this, I talked about this, nice little space for us in the global pharma market, which is, I call, fast-growing emerging markets with a branded generic focus. There's a way of how to operate in this. It's not operating the way you would operate with proprietary pharma. And it's different from operating in pure generics. And I think that what you're seeing now is really an organization that has kind of figured out the right sweet spot on how to execute on this strategy. And you're seeing the results over the last couple of years. We tend to really focus on local for local. We pick the right markets, and we develop portfolios that are relevant for those specific markets by having local R&D, local manufacturing. So that's done very well for us. And I think the team has done a really good job at driving profitability. So not just the top line, but also the bottom line. One of the challenges here, Joanne, is obviously FX, but they've actually -- this group has actually driven absolute dollar profit growth in the business. So I think they've figured out how to do this really well, not just with portfolios, but also channels and integrating that. It is a very unique model. And I think the team have done a really good job at understanding it. From a geography perspective, I mean, in my opening comments, a lot of growth in Southeast Asia, a lot of growth in Latin America for us and great growth in India, too. As you know, we've got a large business in India there, too. So I think it's working very well. And I think it's very sustainable, too, given the dynamics of these markets. Regarding your question on interest... Robert Funck : Yes. So Joanne, in terms of kind of net interest expense for the year, we're forecasting a few hundred million dollars there. And then you had a question on share buybacks. As you know, historically, we do buybacks to offset dilution. And so we did some buybacks in the first quarter, again, a few hundred million dollars' worth of buybacks. Scott Leinenweber : Operator, we'll take 1 -- go ahead. Operator : Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Danielle Antalffy : Just a question on specifically 2 components of the Structural Heart business. The first being MitraClip. Robert, just curious about what you're seeing in that market. That was a market that was severely impacted by both COVID mortality and hospital staffing constraints. Just curious about where you think we are in the recovery specifically in that market? You did seem to put up another decent growth quarter this quarter. And then I have 1 follow-up on Amulet. Robert Ford : Sure. I think it was double-digit growth in the quarter. I think what we saw there was continued international momentum, and I think that's a great opportunity for us is to be able to expand the technology internationally. We have a new manufacturing site that we invested in, that's up and running, and I think that will give us the opportunity to be able to expand this more internationally. So I think that's a great growth driver for us. And then recovery in the U.S. As I said, I think some of the systems have figured out how to manage the staffing shortage, our teams play an important role in that also. So I think that -- listen, I'm cautiously optimistic here that this part of the ramping up of MitraClip has been addressed. From our side, we continue to focus on driving the patient referral funnel. I mean that was probably one of the areas that got shut down that we were starting to build. So I'm starting to see good momentum there on building those patient referral funnels. Danielle Antalffy : Okay, that's great. And then on Amulet, the question I have there is really about where you think you are in the launch. I mean that's a product that very high growth market. But let's be honest, you launched, I think, that product during Omicron right? So just curious about how you would characterize where you are in the launch of Amulet. Robert Ford : Yes. And listen, it's going well. We've got a nice kind of ramp. I guess I wanted that ramp to be a little bit more vertical. I would say one of the challenges we face there is exactly like you said, it's difficult to launch a product right into the pandemic. We saw that with a couple of products also. But I think that the team has done a really good job here of being thoughtful about how to build a strong and sustainable position in the market. We're not in the entire market. We haven't gone out and launched into all the accounts. But the accounts that we have launched into, Danielle, we're actually seeing roughly about a 25% market share into those accounts.  So I think that's the right kind of base to work off from ensuring that the accounts that we're in, we're starting to see repeat usage, continued usage, expanded usage. And as we start to see more of that, then we'll start to ramp up and start to go to new accounts. So I think this is an exciting area for us. Yes, I would want it to be a little bit more vertical in terms of its launch, but I'm very optimistic about the product, about the team, about the position that we built in. So -- and we're investing in it, right? We've got our CATALYST trial here that's enrolling pretty well, too, comparing Amulet to NOACs. So I think this is a great opportunity, a great area of investment and growth for us. Scott Leinenweber : Operator, we'll take 1 more question. Operator : And our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Matthew Miksic : Thanks so much for squeezing me in. So you covered a lot of ground, obviously, out of here. So maybe, Robert, if I could just ask -- just 1 follow-up on your comments this morning, which came across, I think, to most folks as noticeably more bullish and encouraged by what you saw in Q1? And maybe just recognizing that investor expectations have also risen a bit throughout Q1 as checks and everything came in during the quarter. But would you describe what you're seeing in the environment as something like a volume recovery or some other companies have used this backlog concept or something that might is strong now and may ease whenever, later in the year? Or is what you're seeing maybe something more general in terms of lifting productivity and volumes that could be more sustainable? Robert Ford : Yes. I guess the way I'm seeing this, and I've traveled quite a bit during this first quarter, and I made the statement in my opening remarks. I sense in talking to systems and talking to consumers, again, not just in the U.S., but around the world that there is this focus now of, okay, COVID is behind us, but I want to stay healthy, I want to get healthy, and I want to stay there. So as it relates to procedures, what I'm seeing is people say, listen, I've been putting this off not because of COVID, not because there's some sort of backlog. But I've been putting this off for a couple of years, I want to go and address this. Or on the consumer side of our products, whether it's EPD or Nutrition, we're seeing, again, a lot more focus on, okay, I'm going to spend some of my disposable income on these products, on these health products. So I don't see this as like a backlog aspect here that we're going to work our way through. Maybe there's some areas or geographies that you might have a little bit of that. But we tend to -- on the procedure side, we tend to work with the systems and we play a role and preplanning this procedure. So we have a sense of what the funnel is. And I don't see like this oversized funnel over here because of a backlog. What I do see is more funnel just because people are wanting to invest in their health. And on the flip side of that is I think the systems have figured out whether it's in diagnostics or whether it's in cardio procedures, they figured out how to deal with some of these staffing issues that I don't think are -- will ever be back to normal. So I think that what you're seeing are systems, obviously, addressing some of the shortfalls, but not just by hiring, but also using technology, working with companies to figure out how to offset some of that delta and labor shortage. So I think this is very sustainable. And I think you're seeing some of the companies that are reporting -- yesterday, I think we saw some companies report talk about growth and procedure [ change ]. So I think it is sustainable. I don't think it's a bolus of backlog, so at least that's how we're seeing it, at least on our products. I'll just wrap up here then. I think like I said in my comments, I think we're off to -- we're definitely off to a very strong start to the year here. Growth in our underlying base business has accelerated, and it's strong, and it's across the board, whether it's the different product groups, platforms or geographies. We're now forecasting at least high single-digit growth in our underlying base business year. And I think this is a pretty unique and differentiated growth profile. Part of it is market conditions improving, but I also think part of it is our new product pipeline that continues to be highly productive. So we're really pleased with how we started off the year. And with that, we'll wrap up, and thank you for joining us. Scott Leinenweber : Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President of Relations. Michael Comilla : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.08, which reflects an acceleration in the contribution from the underlying base business. Organic sales, excluding COVID testing, increased low double digits for the second quarter in a row and was led by mid-teens growth in Medical Devices, along with double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition. On our last couple of earnings calls, I've highlighted improving underlying demand trends across our businesses. These strengthening trends continued in both our institutional and consumer-facing businesses this past quarter. Within the institutional businesses, health care systems around the world have continued to improve their ability to expand the supply of health care services through ongoing efforts to adjust protocols, manage the labor challenges and increase the overall available capacity to treat patients. In our more consumer-facing businesses, we're seeing consumers prioritize spending for health care products, which is driving increased demand for our products in the U.S. and internationally. I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob, and I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., growth was led by Pediatric Nutrition growth of more than 20%. We continue to make good progress in increasing manufacturing production and have now recovered approximately 75% of the market share in the infant formula business that was lost last year as a result of the voluntary recall. Internationally, total Nutrition sales grew 6%, led by growth in both Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses. Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, sales increased 12.5% in the quarter. This strong performance was led by growth across several markets, including India and China; and therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, women's health and CNS pain management. This business continues to execute at a high level and capitalize on the favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends in emerging markets. Moving to Diagnostics. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales grew 7%, led by Core Lab Diagnostics, where sales grew 10%, driven by performance in the U.S., Europe and China. This broad-based strong performance reflects the increased demand for routine diagnostic testing globally. And in the U.S., our blood transfusion testing business continues to make good progress, recovering from the impact of lower plasma donations that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew more than 14% on an organic basis, including double-digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally. In Diabetes Care, FreeStyle Libre sales exceeded $1.3 billion in the quarter and grew 25% on an organic basis. During the quarter, Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France for all people with diabetes who use insulin. This achievement was a direct result of the unique value proposition that Libre offers, a fully featured continuous glucose monitor made available at an accessible price. Abbott has led the way in expanding reimbursement coverage for continuous glucose monitors in order to bring the benefits of this life-changing technology to more people around the world. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew more than 10% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology and Structural Heart. In Electrophysiology, performance was led by international growth of more than 20%, which included high teens growth in Europe and strong growth in China. During the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our TactiFlex ablation catheter, the world's first ablation catheter with a flexible tip and contact force sensing technology, which helps to deliver improved procedure outcomes and faster procedure times. In Structural Heart, performance was driven by MitraClip growth of approximately 10%, along with growth from several recently launched new products. Earlier this year, we submitted for FDA approval for TriClip, our minimally invasive tricuspid valve repair device that helps treat a condition on as tricuspid regurgitation, a leaky heart valve disease. The clinical trial data supporting our submission showed that TriClip is a highly effective and safe treatment that provide a significant improvement in the quality of life for patients. TriClip is currently being reviewed by the FDA, and we look forward to bringing this first-of-its-kind technology to patients here in the U.S. In Rhythm Management, growth of 8% was led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker. And during the quarter, we received FDA approval for our dual-chamber leadless pacemaker, a first-of-its-kind technology that allows for 2 pacemaker devices to communicate with one other inside the body to provide minimally invasive treatment for those with abnormal heart rhythms. Aveir was specifically designed to be upgradable and retrievable in order to evolve with patient changes and therapy needs over time. This unique technology offers the potential to revolutionize care for millions of people who require a pacemaker. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew 16%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management, which targets a large segment of the market where we previously did not compete. During the first half of this year, we introduced several new innovations, including the launch of Eterna, and label indication expansions for treating painful diabetic neuropathy and chronic back pain for those who have not had or are not eligible for back surgery. So in summary, we exceeded expectations on both top and the bottom lines. Growth in the underlying base business accelerated, driven by improving market conditions and contributions from both new products and legacy growth platforms. And our pipeline continues to be highly productive, which will sustain our strong growth profile in the future. I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Robert Funck : Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our second quarter results. Sales decreased 9.2% on an organic basis due to, as expected, a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11.5% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales, compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales, which reflects continued flow-through impacts from the elevated inflation we experienced last year on certain manufacturing and distribution costs as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 27.2% of sales in the second quarter. Lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be in the low double digits. We're now forecasting COVID testing-related sales of around $1.3 billion, which is below our full year forecast of around $1.5 billion that we provided in April due to current testing dynamics, including lower demand for testing, following the end of the public health emergency in May. For the third quarter, we forecast COVID testing sales of around $100 million. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1.5% on full year reported sales. Lastly, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged, but reflects a lower earnings contribution from COVID testing sales compared to expectations in April, offset by raising our underlying base business earnings forecast by approximately $0.05 based on our strong performance and outlook. Compared to the initial guidance we provided back in January, we have now raised our underlying base business earnings forecast by more than $0.15, offsetting the lower contribution from COVID testing versus our initial forecast. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $1.10, which reflects strong growth on the underlying base business. We forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be in the low double digits, and exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our third quarter reported sales. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Joshua Jennings from TD Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Congratulations on another strong quarter. The core business is generating nice momentum. Organic sales growth accelerating, earnings power increasing. Robert, it would be great to hear your views, first, on the drivers of the back-half momentum, assuming an updated low double-digit organic revenue growth forecast for '23. And then second, it'd be great also to get your thoughts on the sustainability of this building momentum in '24 as the business is creating some more challenging comps for next year. Robert Ford : Sure, Josh. Yes, it was a very strong quarter, broad-based growth. And -- but listen, I still think that we could do better, and I know my team feels that also. If you go back a little bit in terms of a couple of years when COVID was happening, we always said that there was a great hedge share for us, right? And when COVID would subside, we would have a strong base business and making investments. And I think that's what you're seeing right now play out in these last couple of quarters and what we think is going to continue to play out throughout the rest of the year and going into 2024. We saw a very strong growth across all 4 sectors, excluding the COVID testing piece of it. And as I said in my opening remarks, the institutional business, the consumer business, there was an acceleration from Q1 to Q2, growth versus Q2 of last year. So all the right indicators here trending positive and with great momentum. Devices and Diagnostics, there was a nice step up. I attribute that really good improving market conditions, whether it's the hospital systems addressing some of the bottlenecks that they had in care, but also markets that are reopening and that trend continuing, but also new products. So market conditions was part of it, but new product launches also contributed quite a bit there. EPD has sustained, I'd say, high single-digit, low double-digit growth the last 2 years, and I think that continues. I think we're probably one of the best-positioned large health care companies in emerging markets. We've got a unique strategy there, a lot of regionalization and a lot of local for local, and the team does a really good job at executing that. The double-digit growth in Nutrition was as expected. We're seeing the recovery in the Pediatric business, recovering our market share. My comment there of the 3 quarters of recovery is more general and broad-based. But once you start looking at different segments of the -- and from the market, different SKU sets and different types of form, there are certain segments where we're already back to leadership position. So that's moving it all in the right trajectory. And Adult is doing very well in several countries. So COVID declined as we had forecasted. We decided to bring our COVID number down a couple of hundred million dollars because we're seeing -- as the public health emergency ended, we saw a little bit of a decline in testing there. So we'll see how that's going to play out in Q4. It's probably at the first quarter, we'll see, Josh, of an endemic respiratory season. So we'll see how that's going to play out. But the base business is doing really well. And I'd say, from a geographic perspective, it was pretty broad-based also across all geographies : U.S. Europe, Asia. Obviously, China reopening was really positive, too. But it wasn't like this over-indexing in our growth rate with China opening. I mean if you look at our growth rate, excluding China, it was -- it only added about 1 point of growth to that 11.5%. So it's pretty broad-based across the market. So pleased with the top line. We believe it's very sustainable, which is why we increased from at least high single to low double-digit growth rate. And I think the pipeline and the productivity is another kind of key aspect in our quarter, a lot of product approvals, and that's going to drive it. It's probably a little bit early to kind of go through a specific guidance for 2024. But I think if you look at this COVID decline, this anticipated COVID decline that we had this year, I think it's kind of overshadowed a little bit about the strong and the strength in the performance in the base business. And you're starting to see -- as that number comes down in COVID, you'll start to see really the strength of the base business. So if you look at the base business, it's contributing about $4.10 of earnings for the full year this year. That's about $0.15 higher to what we originally guided back in January. And I think that's pretty significant growth, even at $4.10 on the base business, and that's really been driven by top line. So you look at the leverage in the P&L, the investments we made during COVID were able to drive a lot of growth there. So pipeline is delivering pretty significantly. And I believe that, that is the sustainability going into 2024, that top line. Of course, gross margin is a constant area of focus for us, whether it was the impact of FX or the impact of inflation. But I'm already seeing 3 out of our 4 major businesses here showing improved gross margin profiles versus the end of last year. So we're seeing good momentum over there. So if I put this all into account, I think we're achieving a lot of growth, top and bottom line, the new product contributions, strong pipeline and then the opportunity that we'll have for gross margin expansion. So I think we're well set up as we go into the second half of this year and as we go into 2024. Operator : And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Congrats on the nice quarter here. Just one for me. Robert, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the med tech top five and the pipeline, specifically how you're thinking about Aveir and the dual chamber approval and TriClip you mentioned earlier, and just the sustainability of that 11% cardio neuromod growth we saw this quarter. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, that group of products, they did pretty well in the quarter. Combined, those products, they grew about 40%, Larry. If you take the Q2 run rate and annualize it, it's annualizing to about a little over $650 million. I expect to do better than that in the year as the next quarters progress. Regarding your question on these products, I can go through some of them here. I mean, on the Aveir side, we saw a lot of positive developments this quarter for leadless. If you remember, we received FDA approval for the single chamber last year. And if you look at some of the claims data, at least the claims data that we're looking at, showing that we'd be able to capture about 1/3 of that market. So that's doing really well. But what's really exciting for us, and quite frankly, it's a lot of KOLs that I've spoken to, especially at HRS this year, was the approval for the dual chamber, which is a much larger segment of that makes up at least 80% of that $3 billion worldwide pace market. And it's the first-ever technology, right, where you've got 2 implanted devices communicating with each other. So it's a huge opportunity for us, I think, to really change paradigm here. It's a little bit of a different implant than what EPs have been accustomed to doing, with pacemakers that have leads. So our focus here at the beginning, I think, is really to look at the bigger part of the market and make sure that we do a really good job at creating a real-world kind of strong clinical results, making sure that the implant technique gets well understood. And so we'll focus a lot on training and training physicians. We'll be opening new centers, of course, but we're going to -- this falls in the bucket, Larry, of just making sure that we go at the right tempo out of the gate so that we've got a bigger eye on the larger market and the larger conversion because I think that that's a huge opportunity for conversion over there. So there, I'm very excited about, and the team is already starting their launch plan here. Amulet grew 25% this quarter, which is a great growth rate. And again, we're also focusing on generating great real-world clinical results there, being thoughtful about how we open the accounts, build a strong, sustainable position. This is a fast-growing market. It's a great opportunity for us. And so that's done well. And TAVR with Navitor, again, our quarterly sales, we're looking at this the other day. Our quarterly sales have roughly doubled in the last 18 months. Now, yes, granted it's a smaller base, but I'm just hearing really good feedback from the implanters now, once Navitor is out, regarding the implant technique, regarding the outcomes. So I think we're building a really good position here, obviously, in the U.S. following the launch, but internationally seen real strong performance, whether it's market share gains or our ability now to open new accounts with this new product. And then TriClip is, we're seeing similar international performance. Physician enthusiasm here continues to build as now they've got this much better, I'd say, a real effective option here to treat patients that are suffering from TR. So -- and I think the publishing of the TRILUMINATE data earlier this year really gave a boost to those international markets. I mean, we had clinical data out there, but the TRILUMINATE data, I think, really, you can see this correlation in terms of what we're seeing in terms of implants there post publishing that data. So I'm excited to bring it here to the U.S. I mean, we submitted it to the FDA earlier this year. The clinical data that supported the submission, as I said in my opening comments, is really strong, great quality-of-life improvement. I'm enthusiastic about the opportunity in the U.S. I mean, it's a PMA submission. We submitted in January. So we didn't necessarily bake in any kind of significant sales this year, but I think it's a great contributor for us next year. So -- and then on neuro, I mean, this market moves a lot with innovation. And we introduced quite a bit of innovation, I would say, over the last 6 months in this market. There's great opportunity to execute on that, and there's more to come also in that business, too. So I look at the cardio and neuro business, just with these products that we've mentioned here, this group of products that we recently launched, billion-dollar segments, and that we're in the early innings. So I'm excited about it, and I think these got a lot of momentum and sustainability on our cardio and neuro business, Larry. Operator : Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Danielle Antalffy : Robert, I do have 2 product-specific questions, but you totally stole my thunder with that very thorough answer there. But if I could follow up on specifically Libre and MitraClip. So did see U.S. deceleration in the quarter for Libre. Just wondering what you're seeing out there. You have a competitor launching a new product, but you guys are launching Libre 3. And you do have the basal coverage for Medicare now, but how you see basal ramping? That's the first product question. And then the second question is on MitraClip. And another -- a quarter was fine, but this is a market that had been growing double digits pre-COVID. Just curious about where you think this market falls out on a normalized basis once we're through staffing constraints, once we get through what feels like a little bit of an air pocket in the patient population given the high mortality rates through COVID. So those are my 2 product questions. Robert Ford : Okay. Thanks. So on your Libre question, we had a really strong quarter there, Danielle. We grew 25%, yes, 30% in the U.S. I think it's pretty strong growth still. And internationally, we're up 22%. So that's very positive now that we've kind of put behind us some of the upgrading activities that we are doing towards the second half of last year, so you're seeing the impact there. The basal is a great opportunity. In my comments, I referenced France. Yes, this wasn't just like a tender award. The French authorities looked at claims data. They looked at data from basal users using the product. We've got over about a 70% share of that market. So they looked at it and say, \"Wow, this is really having an impact\". So that's good. It provides us great momentum. You look at -- now you've got U.S., Japan and France reimbursing for basal. I mean those are 3 of the top 5 markets in the world, and we're well positioned there. U.S. coverage began in April. So that's playing out nicely also. So I think we got great momentum here. I'd say what's really exciting is a lot of the upcoming launch activity and pipeline activity that we'll have in the second half of this year. If you look at our integration with pumps, it's my understanding here that sometime in this second half, we'll see Tandem integration with our CGM system here in the U.S., and that will be exciting. One of the things that we've also got rolled out and planning is, as you might remember, we got L3 approved full iCGM. But together with that approval, we also got a 15-day claim. So we'll be launching our 15-day sensor here in the U.S. second half -- in the second half of this year. So that's exciting, too. And the team is on target here to start and initiate our glucose-ketone dual-sensor trial sometime in Q4 here. So a lot of pipeline activity in the second half. Probably the one that I'm most excited about, Danielle, is actually Libre 2 streaming. I think this is an incredible opportunity and what the team has been able to do. I think it's the most exciting launch that we have in the second half here, which is really our ability to convert our entire Libre 2 base from scanning to be able to have real-time streaming through an app update. We ran our first conversion in the U.K. over the weekend. There were some challenges there as we rolled it out. Team worked over the weekend. But as of -- I think as of end of day, Monday, 90% of the user base was converted. And the social media posts that I've been seeing are just incredibly positive. So just think about our ability here to convert our entire L2 base into a slightly smaller version of L3 across the world with all the manufacturing capacity we have. So I'm really excited about that. So I think Libre is on a great trajectory, great momentum. And I think that's going to continue. Regarding your question on MitraClip, yes, I think the performance was -- I think it was pretty strong, 10% growth. International was up 20%. So U.S. was more modest. And I think you pointed to some of the challenges that we are seeing. I'm not sure it's so much the staffing portion now, Danielle. I mean, I think it was probably in the second half of last year. We're not seeing that in the other parts of the business. So I think the U.S. piece here is really our ability here to reignite and restart that referral funnel here in the U.S., which was impacted by the pandemic. And I think this is going to take a little bit of time, but it's a key -- it's a key area of focus of the U.S. commercial team here is to really look the commercial and the clinical team to really restart those that referral process from the cardiologists into the hospitals. This is a -- continues to be an attractive growth area, and you can see that. Where we don't have some of these issues here in the U.S., we're looking internationally to accelerate as a way to kind of balance it out. And we're seeing great growth internationally here. So the market is still very attractive. We're having a lot of success internationally. And in the U.S., we're going to focus on this patient referral funnel here, and I think we'll start to see kind of improvements in the numbers. Operator : Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congrats on a solid print here. Robert, I had a 2-part question. One, you did mention double-digit organic sort of base. Is that -- like should we worry about the comp issue for fiscal '24? Because I'm thinking about Lingo, which I think is just launching, is that enough to sort of maintain some of the strength we're seeing? So any comment on Lingo launch, update on Lingo would be helpful. And my second part is on gross margins, down sequentially. If I'm looking at that 56% overall for the year, it looks like we're probably looking at bottom half of the EPS guidance. I know you had mentioned $1 billion of inflation impact. How should we think of that benefit in margin expansion in back half of year '24? Robert Ford : So yes, I'll take the Lingo question, and then I'll ask Bob to fill in on the gross margin. On the Lingo piece, listen, this has been part of our strategy, Vijay. It wasn't -- it was an afterthought as we were building Lingo platform. We knew it would be in this situation where can we expand beyond diabetes. We've been very thoughtful about it and very intentional about it. The opportunity during COVID to invest heavily in this was our opportunity. And as I've said in the past, to be thoughtful about this, we had to create a separate group, a fully dedicated group. I was with them a few months ago. And if you look at the team, the scientists, the engineers, the data experts, the marketing team, et cetera, they're just focused on this. But it's interesting, their backgrounds here aren't necessarily with diabetes, right? They're more digital health, they're more consumer health. And they've got this target, which is to do something that not a lot of well-established companies, health care companies do, which is to create a product that's really targeting a healthy population and a healthy population that wants to stay healthy. So the product was launched yesterday in the U.K., kudos to Lisa and the team for getting that through. And the value proposition is pretty simple. And I think that's how we needed to think about it for this patient segment here -- for this consumer segment, sorry. And it's really to deliver personalized like metabolic improvement and metabolic health. And the way it does that, Vijay, is that it's teaching you about glucose spikes. It's teaching the consumer about how your body reacts to food, how it reacts to sleep, how it reacts to exercise. And the goal is to minimize those spikes throughout the day. So the Lingo coach, it learns -- it first learns about your metabolism, right? And then after it learns about your metabolism, by wearing the sensor, it then assigns you a daily target, and we're going to call this the Lingo count. And this is basically a number that is the amount of spikes that you're allotted to or assigned to during the day. And we're going to track that daily progress and track to that target. And we believe that, that's a great kind of behavior modification tool for those that don't have diabetes. Their charts, there's data. There's all that, that you have in the app. But we believe that the simplicity of this Lingo count is really key to modifying behavior. It's a subscription-based model. It's direct to consumer. We are looking at opportunities for partnership, but it's direct to consumer. The website -- the web shop is open. And the pricing is pretty much in line with our cash pay price for Libre. And I think the key aspect here is -- for this app, is that we have to constantly provide content to the app, constantly new information, new data. And if I think about everything that's going on in the world of AI, and I think about -- how I think about AI for Abbott, we have a lot of opportunities. I would put this one here together with Libre as our biggest opportunity to capitalize on AI and what it can do for personalization. So it's out in the U.K. It's launched yesterday. We'll study. We'll learn from the U.K., and then we'll roll it out to other markets. I'll preempt your question, which is always like, is it going to come to the U.S.? Yes, it will. We intend to file in the U.S. at the end of the year. I don't expect big contribution right now from a financial perspective early on. Maybe my team will surprise me, but I absolutely expect this to be a significant contributor over time for us. And so that third part of the growth stool here for that platform is out of the gates, and we're excited to see what we can do. Robert Funck : Okay. So Vijay, on the gross margin question. So back in January, we guided a gross margin profile of 56% of sales for the full year. And through the first half of the year, the base business, so excluding COVID testing, is right in line with that. We are, however, seeing lower gross margins on our COVID test do -- really due to the significant decline in volumes that we've seen compared to our assumptions at the beginning of the year. And so that's really what's being reflected in a little bit lower gross margin that you've seen. And I think for the balance of the year, we would expect to see gross margins roughly in the range of 56%, and then we would look for steady improvement after that. As Robert talked about, it's a key focus area for us. Each of our businesses have gross margin improvement programs in place, with teams that are dedicated to that effort. And as -- so as we work into 2024, we would expect to see some improvement overall in our gross margins. Operator : Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : Briefly, can you sort of tear apart the Electrophysiology growth rate of 17%? How much of that is in the U.S.? How much of that is oUS? And what do you think is driving that? And then I'll just jump in with my second question, which is, if you have reclaimed about 75% of the Pediatric Nutritional business, can you get to 100%? Or do you think you're more or less where you can get to? Robert Ford : Sure. So really good growth on EP. We're up about 17% total. U.S. was high single digits, around 9%. International was about 24%. In that 24%, Joanne, there's probably about 8 or 9 points of kind of China recovery. So if you look at the growth rate internationally outside of China, that was about 15%. So real strong growth. Again, if you look at Europe specifically, it was up just under 20%. So it's pretty broad based. And even if you look at the big 5 countries in Europe, did really well there. TactiFlex in those countries, that's been out there for a couple of quarters right now. We only got approval in the U.S. towards the end of the quarter. So that's doing really well, and it's really helping. We got really good feedback on the catheter. So growth is doing very well. The U.S. is probably a little bit impacted by kind of the capital cycle. If you remember, last year, we launched EnSite X, and it was like a very large bolus of kind of upgrading and capital placements that we're making. We get a lot of good feedback on the system, both from the users and from the administration, especially the fact that it's an open system. So that's done very well. If you look at the consumable part of the U.S. growth, it was up in the mid-teens. So that, I guess, the term used was tear apart the EP growth rate. But again, it's a great market. We've got a great position and good recovery, and I expect to see this continuing throughout this year. And sorry, what was your other question? Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : The other question had to do with the 75% recovery in Nutrition. Is that sort of your best case or is there more to go? Robert Ford : No, I kind of made my team, and I also kind of said publicly that our target here is to get back to 100% of our market share by the end of the year. A big driver of that is the manufacturing and the manufacturing kind of ramp up. And we started the manufacturing -- reopened the manufacturing process in July for specialty of last year and August and September for non-specialty. So that manufacturing has provided us the supply we need to fulfill the demand. We've got a very strong brand in Similac, and you're seeing that. So -- and as I said, I think maybe to Josh's question at the beginning, if you look at the different segments, first of all, if you start with WIC and non-WIC. In the WIC segment, we're back to leadership position or back to our position we had before the recall. And that was because we focused a lot on that Q3, Q4 time in that segment. So I guess, long-winded to say yes. I mean, we're still on target for that to be able to get to the end of the year with our pre-recall market share. So -- and like I said, if you pull -- if you break out some of the different formulas because there's a lot of different SKU sets and different types of formulas. In some of them, we've already -- we're already back to where we were before recall. So team's working really hard at this, and I'm not changing that target. Operator : Our next question comes from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Marie Thibault : I wanted to ask a fairly high-level one here on the Diagnostics business. Now that COVID testing is sort of behind us, Core Lab was really strong this quarter. I just want to kind of get an update on the areas of investment and growth in Diagnostics testing today. The Alinity rollout, how that's progressing? And whatever else, in terms of tests or trends, we should be paying attention to now in Diagnostics? Robert Ford : Sure. I think we had a really, really good recovery here. As the health systems are opening up, you're seeing that routine testing come back. And like I said, it was pretty broad-based, U.S., Europe, Asia, Asia without China. I mean, it was pretty broad-based, Latin America. So that's working well. I've said Alinity is -- it's a multiyear kind of cycle. If you look at these contracts there, 7 to 10 years. So every year, you got 15% that's coming up for renewal. I've also said we're trying to strike the balance between top line growth and gross margin and gross margin expansion. And I think this is the range that we feel is the right range. We can probably accelerate that more with more placements of instruments and more capital, but you have some friction on your gross margin as you do that. So we're being thought about how we make these placements and how we expand. The -- one of the areas that recovered really nicely, and I talked about in the opening comments, was on blood banks. As you know, we're a market leader over here. So as the blood bank business and as people come back to doing blood donations and plasma donations, we disproportionately benefit from that, not only here in the U.S. and around the world. So our big focus here is really to look at the assays and the tests that are missing on the menus and focus the R&D spend to be able to close those gaps. And that was one of the areas that we did during COVID was while one portion of the diagnostic business is working on the COVID testing, the other group was receiving investment to be able to develop new assays to be able to layer on. And that, Marie, is extremely -- it's a very important strategic driver for us because you've got the capital that's been placed out in the instrument, so we could add more assays to that. That comes with a much higher margin profile. So that's our key area of focus. Molecular is an area of focus. We've been working on expanding the menu in Molecular also. And then Point of Care. One of the most exciting assays that the team has developed for Point of Care is a rapid test for traumatic brain injury, sulfur concussion testing. We've got it approved on a plasma sample. We're doing all the work to be able to get it on a whole blood sample, which can then go through a clear waiver test. And then ultimately, you've got now a handheld 15-minute test, blood test, to be able to rule out a concussion that could be -- you can imagine the applications of that kind of test around the world, but specifically a lot in terms of this country. So that's a lot of our focus in Diagnostics. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Matthew Miksic : I have one clarification on some of the topics that came up earlier, and then just hopefully one of the kind of pipeline questions. So one of the things going on in CGM and wearables, as you talked about, Robert, and just to kind of separate these out so we can understand exactly how this will play together maybe over the next 18, 24 months : Libre 3, Lingo and sort of -- and ketone. So Lingo, you mentioned filing at the end of the year. Wondering if that's still ketones and lactates for that product? And then if there's a path forward that includes ketones for kind of the core CGM Libre 3? And then I have 1 just quick pipeline question, if I could. Robert Ford : Sure. Yes, the Lingo product that was launched yesterday, it was really starting off with a glucose-only component to it. We had a lot of debate about this, and we wanted to start off simple. The opportunity to add ketones to that is definitely in the mix, Matt. There's going to be a lot of learning here for us as we, like I say, market a product to a healthy population. And there's going to be a lot of learnings about that. But the idea, as I've laid out at CES a couple of years ago, is that we'll have a pipeline of different analytes that will come into this. Lactate is on the menu also. The team has figured that out. There is an interesting application for lactate, both in the consumer market, but also in the institutional market for continuous lactate monitoring. So bottom line, Lingo is -- it starts with glucose. And then we'll be adding on different analytes as we go learning through that. But all of those opportunities are all there. And I actually think that there's going to be an opportunity, as I've said, with ketones in the diabetes space, for sure. And that dual sensor with ketones-glucose is very strong for a specific diabetes population, but I also think it could be strong for a nondiabetes population also. Matthew Miksic : Great. And then the -- just on the pipeline. We hadn't heard much about what was happening with CSI post the acquisition, and, obviously, important strategic fit and add around peripheral and their platforms there. But they did have this IVL program that was kind of in process. I'm just wondering if you're ready to comment on where that is or when we might start to hear more about the progress there or your expectations for that? Robert Ford : Yes. Listen, the CSI, it closed this quarter. Thank you for asking that. I think it's going to really have a strong impact as we look at our vascular business and really focus on the growth in the peripheral. You can see that we've strategically been adding, either organically with our below-the-knee stent that we're working on that's currently in trial, and then all the inorganic moves that we've been making. So that's very clear, and we're super excited about having the CSI portfolio at Abbott. Yes, and you highlighted one of the ones that, as we're looking at it, that we were super excited about, and the IVL product. I'll put it this way, as we look and do a lot of the integration efforts, and we did a lot of that in St. Jude, and we learned a lot, I would say, from an R&D and portfolio perspective, as part of that integration exercise, that's one that gets probably a disproportionate amount of attention and share of mind from us as we're doing the integration and as we're looking at the program and thinking about would the program benefit with additional resources, et cetera. So I'm not prepared to comment on that right now, Matt. But rest assured that this one is high on my priority list as we're going through these next kind of quarters here of integration. Michael Comilla : Operator, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Our final question will come from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Maybe just on margins. It looked like there was a nice lift to base business' up margin. And I'm just wondering, is this all related to the improvement in Infant Nutrition? Or are there other factors at work? And then maybe just as a bit of a related question. You talked about the inflationary impacts on gross margin. I think we all understand that. But I'm wondering if you're seeing input costs actually start to come down now? And if so, when will we start to see that impact the P&L? Robert Ford : Sure. Regarding the op margin profile, we're actually back to our pre-pandemic op margin profile. So that's -- I think that's really positive. Obviously, the mix of how we get there is a little different. We got a little bit less gross margin from some of the points that Bob has raised here. But that op margin profile is really a combination of 2 things. I'd say, we made a lot of investments during COVID. I talked about them. We outlined them over the last couple of years. And as we go into this year, you're seeing this accelerated top line. We're seeing a lot of leverage in the P&L because of those investments, haven't had to make the kind of SG&A or R&D investments to be able to drive this 11.5% or low double-digit top line growth rate. So that's one of the big drivers there. Yes, your question on infant formula, that obviously contributes as the product -- as we're recovering the share and the manufacturing is ramping up again. But it's really a combination of all the areas, right? As the device business grows and grows disproportionately, that has a higher gross margin profile, too. So I'd say it's really across the board on all the businesses. And this is an area of focus that we have. To your question on gross margin, this is our biggest opportunity, I would say, maintaining this kind of growth rate and then looking at areas where we can improve our gross margins. Your point on endpoint costs are true. We are seeing certain input costs come down, certain commodities come down. And if we see that continue throughout -- going into next year, I think we'll have a great opportunity there. One of the things that I wanted to make sure we focused on going into this year was that we had the inventory we needed to be able to capitalize on the opportunities we have from a top line perspective. And if you remember, Jayson, second half of last year, supply chain is really challenged, and we had some challenges, right? And that -- those supply chain challenges had an impact on our top line. So going into this year, we told the team, let's make sure we've got all the inventory we need to capitalize on these opportunities. And one of the ways you do that is you've got to lock in your supply, you've got to lock in your volume, you've got to lock in your price. So as commodities come down and we start to look at our contracts for next year, I think that will be a great opportunity for us as we go through it. So that being said, I'll just wrap up here with a few closing comments. We had a very strong start to the first half of the year. We achieved double-digit organic sales growth on the underlying business. We've done it for 2 quarters in a row now. The growth was broad-based. It's not focused on one specific area or one geographic area, it's across the entire portfolio. And all of the areas have delivered great performance. The pipeline has been highly productive. And I think that's the key for us and for our strategy is to make sure that we're bringing new innovations to the market that can kind of sustain our top line and meet unmet needs for patients. We've raised the organic sales growth and the EPS guidance on the base business. And the EPS guidance on the base business is now forecast, as I said in the beginning, to be about $0.15 higher than our original guidance back in January. So momentum is building. We're well positioned for the second half of the year and heading into next year. So with that, thank you for joining us. Michael Comilla : Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations. Michael Comilla : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Funck, Executive Vice President Finance, and Phil Boudreau, Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. Based on our performance through the first 9 months of the year, we raised the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $4.42 to $4.46. Organic sales growth on the base business, which excludes COVID testing, increased double digits for the third consecutive quarter and was led by double-digit growth in all 4 of our major businesses. This acceleration in sales growth is a result of our strong position in attractive growth markets. In conjunction with the additional investments we made across the company during the pandemic. In addition to the strong top line performance, we continue to deliver accelerating earnings power on our base business, and remain on track to deliver on the financial commitments we set at the beginning of the year. With a positive growth outlook for the businesses and the momentum we're building across the portfolio, we are well positioned for a strong finish to the year and heading into 2024. I will now review our performance in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 18% in the quarter. In Pediatric Nutrition, growth of 25% was led by continued market share capture in the U.S. infant formula business, where we have now reclaimed the leadership position. Internationally, we continue to deliver well-balanced growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure taller brand. In Adult Nutrition, growth of 12% was driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands across the U.S. and international markets. Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased 11% in the quarter. This strong performance was broad-based and led by double-digit growth in several markets and therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, women's health and CNS pain management. In September, we announced an agreement with global biotech leader, mAb science to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. This collaboration will help introduce cutting-edge medicines in the areas of oncology, women's health and respiratory diseases, the people in countries that have historically lacked access to these treatment options. Moving to Diagnostics. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales grew 10%, led by Core Lab Diagnostics, where sales grew double digits, driven by above-market performance in the U.S. and internationally. Growth was driven by a continued increase in global demand for routine diagnostic testing and a strong recovery of our blood transfusion testing business following a period of lower plasma donations that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Rapid Diagnostics, double-digit organic sales growth on the base business benefited from increased demand for respiratory tests in anticipation of an earlier-than-normal start to the flu season in the Northern Hemisphere. And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 15%, including double-digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally. In Diabetes Care, FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, and grew 28%. The global Libre user base now exceeds 5 million people with nearly 2 million of those in the U.S. where the Libre user base has nearly doubled in the last 2 years. A recent analysis of our U.S. user base showed that a growing number of Libre users are using Libre in combination with GLP-1 medications as part of a companion therapy approach for managing their diabetes. On average, those using both Libre and GLP-1 exhibited a higher rate of use for both products, wearing Libre sensors more often and taking GLP-1 medication more frequently compared to other users. This increase in use or better compliance is a positive sign that these users are taking an even more active role in managing their diabetes. And while we traditionally think of therapy choices as having to compete against one another, this is a good example of a complementary relationship between 2 products that both help optimize the treatment of diabetes. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology and Structural Heart. In Electrophysiology, sales growth of 17% was driven by double-digit growth across all major international geographic regions and high teens growth of ablation catheters in the U.S. In Structural Heart, performance was driven by double-digit growth of MitraClip and strong growth from several recently launched new products, most notably Navitor, our latest generation TAVR valve. In Rhythm Management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual-chamber pacing. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew 19%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management which targets a large segment of the market where we previously did not compete. So in summary, this was a very strong quarter. With all 4 major businesses delivering double-digit organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales. Growth rates in the base business have improved every quarter this year on both the top and bottom lines. And the momentum we are building positions us well for a strong finish to the year and heading into 2024. I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil? Philip Boudreau : Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our third quarter results. Sales decreased 1.5% on an organic basis due to as expected a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluded COVID-tested sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 13.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in July. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55% of sales. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales which is below our original full year guidance of approximately 56% that we provided back in January. The difference is primarily due to lower gross margins on COVID tests due to lower volumes and price compared to our original forecast assumptions and the impact of higher inventory obsolescence as a result of maintaining higher inventory levels throughout the pandemic to help ensure product supply during a time when global supply chains were less predictable. As the global supply chain environment continues to improve, we're adjusting our inventory levels to align with that trend. Adjusted R&D was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 26.4% of sales in the third quarter. Lastly, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we now forecast ongoing earnings per share of $4.42 to $4.46, which is comprised of our year-to-date results plus ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.17 to $1.21 for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales to be in the low double digits and exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on fourth quarter reported sales. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Congratulations on another strong quarter. Robert, organic revenue growth nearly touched the mid-teens range for the core business in 3Q, and realize we've recently talked about the sustainability of the momentum generated this year. But I think investors would like to hear about your confidence level in the core business, delivering high single-digit organic revenue growth and solid margin expansion in 2024 off the 2023 comp that's only retire over the course of this year. Robert Ford : Sure, Josh. I mean the confidence level is very high, especially with this kind of momentum that we're seeing. Clearly, there's going to be some macro environment challenges as companies head into 2024. But I'd say our portfolio has really been built to withstand this type of environment, and we tend to do pretty well in this type of environment. And as I said in my comments also, we've further strengthened the portfolio and the position that we had with the investments that we made during the pandemic, and that's helped lead to a step up here in our growth rate this year. The base business has grown double digits, 3 quarters in a row, and I expect to be doing that again in Q4. And if you look at the EPS contribution, as I said in the comments, it's really having a positive impact and a lot of power coming through on the base business as we continue to grow that, and it's sequentially gotten better every quarter. So we're forecasting other step up in the fourth quarter. So if you look at that EPS for the fourth quarter and put it all together, the base business here is going to contribute to about $4.10 of EPS and we've raised that twice this year. So there's clearly momentum that's building here both on the top and the bottom lines. And I believe that momentum is going to sustain and continue as we go into 2024. I think it starts, Josh, always with the top line. And if you can drive a higher top line growth, I think that's really the building block. And if you look at our -- let's say, our pre-pandemic kind of growth formula here, we were growing around 7%. So I expect that to accelerate in next year without a doubt. And that's off a much larger sales base than when we were pre-pandemic. And like I said, that's based off the momentum that we're seeing, and increased contributions that we'll be seeing from a lot of our growth drivers that I'm sure we'll be talking about throughout the call. The Street models double-digit EPS on the base business right now, and I feel real good about our ability to deliver that. Obviously, a lot of focus is going to come from gross margin and gross margin expansion. And I think we've got momentum and tailwind here as we're going to go into 2024. So when we go to our call in January, I'll be able to kind of quantify that and give you better ranges on all of that. But I'd say it's really about reiterating and reinforcing our growth model, our growth framework, which is high single-digit revenue growth, double-digit bottom line growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow generation and a balanced capital allocation strategy. So again, I feel very good about sustaining this momentum going into next year. Operator : And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from JPMorgan (sic) [ Well Fargo ]. Larry Biegelsen : Just to be clear, it's Wells Fargo. So Robert, China has been in the news a lot. Love to hear your thoughts on how you're thinking about China, big picture. How is Q3? And what are you expecting from the VBP impact in the EP business and from the anticorruption initiatives we've been hearing about there. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, China has been and will continue to be an important market for us. As it relates to, I think, this theme on this anticorruption discussion points there. Listen, we've been operating in China for 35 years. We follow our compliance standards follow all applicable laws. I didn't see any kind of meaningful impact in Q3. Larry, I was actually there last week and had a chance to meet with the teams and go through the businesses and I didn't really see any meaningful impact. Devices grew 20% in the quarter. So I think that's -- we'll just have to keep on monitoring that situation, but I didn't see any real impact in the quarter. As it relates to VBP, listen, this is a term that's used for China, but I think it's just a common theme that we see across the world with governments trying to provide the care to their populations and manage their budgets. So I don't think this is anything completely extraordinary than what we've seen. There was a VBP on the EP business. That process started earlier this year in April, I'd say about 80% of the market has now been implemented and expect the remainder of that to be implemented by year-end. Yes, there's a little bit of a price impact that we felt. But net-net, it was a positive for our EP business in China because we're able to pick up share and pick up volume. So I think that's the status there. I think as announced a VBP on diagnostics. That's not unexpected either. I think the process will start sometime in the first half of next year. Right now, from the list of products that we've seen, it involves about 20% of our Core Lab business. And then as we've seen with businesses that have capital and service tied to it, the rollout is a little bit different from the rollout that you see on what I would call more pure consumables. So it's more of a kind of phased approach like we saw in EP. Each province will go and do their implementation. So it will take a few quarters to implement here. But like I said, I don't think these are different than what we see in other markets in terms of how we manage the balance of our technology and our access. But I'd say China is still a big opportunity of growth, not just in Devices and Diagnostics, but in Adult Nutrition in our Pharma business. So it's an important market for us, and the team is doing a really good job at operating there. Operator : Our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Congrats on a really nice quarter. Robert, I want to ask you the overwhelming topic of discussion in the past few months has been GLP-1s and the possible impact on the future med tech market growth. You talked about it with respect to diabetes, but I'd love to just get your thoughts on a broader basis on GLP-1s? And do you see it as a negative, neutral or positive to your different end markets you participate in over the next 5, 10 years? Robert Ford : Sure, Robbie. Obviously, this has been a hot topic over the last couple of months. And let me just start off by saying with 20-plus years of experience in diabetes. I think every time new therapies, new technologies come to address this disease in this population, I think it's all great. And these are great new medications that are going to have very positive effect on the treatment of diabetes. There's obviously a lot of investor -- thanks to Robbie, about the potential impact of these drugs and what's going to happen to different industries and different companies. I feel that the investor angst is it's probably driven more by those that have a little bit less domain knowledge in Medtech, I would say, seem to be moving a lot with like headlines or any new study or publishment there or publishing of any kind of study headlines, et cetera. So we've seen valuations in Medtech significantly be impacted by the fear, like you said, about the reduction in these market sizes, whether it's going to happen in the next few years or it's going to happen in decades from now. And I guess my view there is that I understand that new technologies will naturally cause us to think differently about the future. And I think early on, those initial thoughts about the future are generally impacted more by motion than facts and data. And I think that's what you're seeing right now today as it relates to GLP-1 and Medtech markets. I think there's a -- if you think about it long term here on the bigger picture, I think there's a fundamental mismatch here on revenue and revenue forecast that we're seeing versus potential impact to patient and patient TAMs. I've looked at the consensus forecast for this class of drugs looking out 4 to 5 years here, they seem to be in that $60 billion to $70 billion range, which is pretty significant as a category. It's probably one of the largest categories, I think we've ever seen. But then if you take the pricing, at least the public pricing that we've seen, whether it's the U.S. pricing or the lower international pricing, and you convert that into user bases and back into the numbers, I mean, we're looking at 10 million to 15 million people in the next 4 to 5 years that will be on this drug. That's a real small fraction of the size of these medical device markets that we're talking about, right? There's about 0.5 billion people with diabetes, maybe another 0.5 billion people that got cardiovascular disease and maybe there's an overlap of people with diabetes and cardiovascular, but still, you're talking tens of millions of people with maybe 1 billion or under 1 billion people. So I think there's a little bit of a mismatch there in terms of how we're seeing this impact equating to revenue and the potential growth of the revenue with the patient pool TAM. So that's one big area, I would say. I think there's another question here of just about the question of coverage. And obviously, these drugs have great outcomes and great outcomes impact. And then the question is, what's the appropriate cost to achieve that outcome. I've seen a lot of discussions and new stories about payers and what the payers are going to do and insurance companies and PBMs and pharmacy chains. Those aren't payers. The real payers are the employers and the companies that pay for these. And I think as you look at companies and higher medical expense costs, inflation. I think that's going to be a factor as we go into next year also. So I think that's -- those are, I'd say, the bigger aspect here on the long term. On the short term, though, as you mentioned, on the diabetes side, actually seen as a positive impact on the diabetes business. As I mentioned in the opening remarks,  we completed an analysis recently that showed a significant number of Libre users were on these drugs. And the data showed that those that are using both products are actually using more of those both products when you compare them to other users. They tend to wear Libre sensors more often, and they tend to take their GLP-1 medication more frequently. And I think that's a great thing, because higher therapy compliance ultimately is going to improve health outcomes. And that's not different, Robbie, this complementary relationship, Medtech very well. It's not uncommon to see that. Medical Device procedures you have patients that are taking medications either before and after their procedure. And you see it in diabetes, like I said, I've seen this in my 20 years, where it's very common to use multiple tools in combination, whether it's insulin and oral meds, whether it was fast-acting insulin and long-acting insulin. And so I think more treatment options here is a good thing for patients. And I think these drugs are a real nice addition to the mix. I think as you go forward, though, I think there are some -- but definitely some other areas of interest related to this topic that we're exploring. I think one thing that is clear to us as we've gone through this process is to really use the data a little bit more to our advantage. Since the launch of Libre, we've collected the de-identified data from the user base. I'd probably go as far as to say that we probably have the most robust glucose data set in the world. I think the last time I looked at it, we've got close to 50 billion hours of glucose monitoring data. So I think Libre is a perfect platform here to actually evaluate the effectiveness outside of a more controlled trial look at it more in a real-world setting. And there's just so many different ways we can look at the data, look at how the drugs work over time, does 1 drug work better than the other. What kind of job they do in terms of a profile in terms time and range. So again, I think we can do this on a population level. We can do this on an individual level. So I think that's going to be, I'd say, an important thing going forward for us here is to use that data set to be able to kind of explore that. And I'd just finally say with the portfolio -- with a diverse portfolio that Abbott has, where we look at health care, across the full spectrum from nutrition to diagnostics to then treatment. I think that this then provides the company with an opportunity to further explore where we can bring value to patients that are using these drugs. And I think it's common knowledge here that there are side effects, as there are side effects with most drugs. And one of those being increased loss of muscle mass. I'd say, we have experience here in the area of nutrition, and losing that amount of muscle mass as a ratio is -- it can be problematic. So we've got an opportunity here to be able to develop, whether it's a nutritional product or other products that can help address one of these side effects, which is muscle mass loss. So there's good opportunities for there -- for us also in the portfolio. So bottom line, I think it's fantastic science. It's fantastic biology. This is great for public health in the short term. I think the concerns are overblown. And I think in the long term, if we want to look out 15, 20 years, I mean, I think it's -- I think there's still a lot of question marks there, given some of the facts that I've raised, so. Robert Marcus : Really appreciate that, Robert. Maybe if I could sneak 1 more in on CGM, something that I think has really flown under the radar with the GLP-1, noise is you've recently gotten type 2 basal coverage in France. You have it in the U.S. and Japan as well. Just thinking about future opportunities in countries to approve type 2 basal, which could materially expand your reimbursed coverage opportunity around the world. How should we think about that? And how do you size that opportunity over the next few years for Abbott. Robert Ford : Sure. Well, we had a really good quarter, up 28%. International was up 26%. U.S., we continue to do pretty well in the plus 30% range there. And to your point, we saw a nice impact from that basal coverage, especially in the international markets, right? And it's nice to see the international growth accelerate again. I remember last year, the question mark about  our international growth and a lot of our focus was on our upgrade strategy for Libre 3. So getting the sales team now reworking the demand generation. And a lot of that growth is, as you pointed out, we're seeing nice growth from that basal segment, especially in France and Japan, where we got reimbursement -- differentiated reimbursement, right? We've added about 150,000. I think that was the day that we reviewed over the last 12 months, of basal users onto the user base. And if you look at that last 12 months, a larger portion of that $150,000 was happening towards the second half of that. So there's definitely acceleration ongoing there. I was actually surprised to see the speed at the U.S. coverage. So right now, about, I'd say, of commercial payers have now adopted some level of basal coverage. So that's very positive. So both those 3 markets, U.S., Japan and France are doing very well, in terms of basal and basal coverage and providing that kind of tailwind of growth. And again, there's a lot of good data to be able to support while that it benefits these types of patients also and saw that in the data that we presented with the French claims data. So I'd say, yes, it's a great opportunity. It's not something that's happened. We've been focusing on this, generating the clinical evidence, building the sales forces to be able to reach a primary care team, investing in direct-to-consumer advertising where we're allowed to do that. And that's a key growth driver here of this target, we have to reach $10 billion by 2028. I'd say that's an important growth driver. It's not the only growth driver, but it's an important growth driver, and we've got a lot of good momentum there, Robbie. Operator : Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Danielle Antalffy : Robert and Phil just wanted to follow up on Josh's question earlier, and I appreciate you're not going to give 2024 guidance. But just at a high level, there's a few puts and takes I can think of, Robert, I appreciate the momentum in the underlying business, but you will have competition coming on the EP side, which has been a strong double-digit grower looking at MitraClip and a quarter of double-digit growth, that was great to see, like how sustainable is that? And comps are just inherently potentially a little bit tougher. So if you could maybe walk through in a little bit more detail. Some of the puts and takes at a high level that we should consider nutrition, tough comps there, should consider as we think about 2024, that would be awesome. Robert Ford : Yes. I mean you're -- not sure we'll do a planned review here. But I mean there's a lot there. I'll try and touch on some of the topics there. I mean I'd just go back to -- we have a growth model and a growth forecast that I'd say, during the last 2 years has been masked a little bit by COVID and the ups and downs of COVID testing, but being able to sustain high single-digit growth, double-digit growth in the bottom line that's what we've been doing this year, a pretty significant double-digit bottom line because we forward invested back in 2022. So if you look at our top line growth, right now, we haven't had to put as much SG&A to build but to kind of support that growth this year. So -- but the growth model of that high single-digit growth and double-digit bottom line growth is happening throughout this pandemic with COVID testing. And as the COVID testing numbers come down, you get to see that a little bit more now. So I feel good about delivering that in 2024. Yes, there's a macro environment that's out there. But as it relates to all the elements that are directly in our control, I feel very good about it. Your comment on Electrophysiology, yes, we'll have competition. We have competition today. We grew -- in Europe, we grew mid-teens and we've been growing mid-teens for the first 9 months with the competition that you referred to. So we feel good about our position. there. On MitraClip, we've seen double-digit growth in MitraClip for the last 3 quarters, big driver of that has been international and growth international, and we're starting to see a little bit now of a rebound in U.S. U.S. was up 5% in MitraClip this quarter. And again, that's sequentially better from the previous quarter and sequentially better from the one before that. So -- and we've had competition in that space also we've had competition internationally and we've had competition in the U.S., too. So again, you referred to comps, see yes, there's -- listen, I'm not going to deny there's some comps. Obviously, probably the biggest one there is nutrition this year. But every year, there's comps. Every year, a company has got comps. And I'd say if you remove some of those comps from our Q3 would still be growing double digits also. So again, I feel good about our high single-digit growth forecast. I feel good about our double-digit EPS growth. We've got a lot to work with. Yes, there's challenges, but we have a lot to work with. We've got a great pipeline of products that we're going to be -- that we've not only just launched, but that we're going to be launching also. So yes, there's always puts and takes, Danielle. But I think in the aggregate, if you look at the aggregate of our positions in these markets, I think we're in a real strong position. Operator : Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : Nutrition, your comments, if I remember them correctly, are that you are back in a leadership position in the Nutrition business. Are you back at 100%? Are you humming along? Do you feel like there's anything that's lagging or maybe ahead of the game? And I'm going to squeeze in your current thoughts on M&A, particularly given a lot of pullbacks in valuations. Robert Ford : Sure. We never believe that we were going to recover all the share in a quarter, right? So the way this market works and the way we've kind of modeled it out is that we'll showing month-by-month kind of sequential increases in our market share. So if you look at the volume right now is measured by a third party, we've now crossed over that leadership position in the month of September. We're not 100% back to where we were before the recall, but I always said that we would be there towards the end of the year. So we're probably at about 90% back to that initial -- to that pre-recall market share. But it's nice to see across all the segments here, real nice sustained growth in our market share. And even if when you look at different segments of the IMS. So if you look at the channels, WIC and non-WIC, WIC we've been a market leader since the beginning of the year, and that was a result of our strategy in the second half of last year to stay focused on that underserved population. And the non-WIC channel, we're seeing nice continuous month-by-month gains of market share. And I think the team is doing a real good job. I think we can all see that the shelves are pretty well replenished right now. And now it's just about continuing to execute on our demand generation. And I feel good about what the team is doing and recovering that market share. So that's gone pretty much to plan there. And then what was your other question? Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : M&A, particularly given pullbacks on valuations? Robert Ford : Yes. Well, listen, we've completed 3 transactions over the last 6 months. We acquired CSI and in the process of integrating that business. I think it's going to be a nice addition to our vascular business and start to reposition that business to kind of more higher growth markets. This quarter, we announced the acquisition of Bigfoot and this is just going to be able to allow us to broaden our offerings with Libre and provide a nice opportunity from a global perspective, and then also an announcement on the EPD side to expand access to biosimilars. So we've been active, and we continue to be active. Yes, I think valuations have come down. The same way they came down, let's say, post pandemic in that 2022 time frame. It's a good opportunity. Like I've said, I think sometimes companies need to understand if it's a short term or if there's something more fundamental in that valuation, but we're in a great strategic position to be able to execute on our M&A strategy, which is really focused on can we add value to the asset. And does it fall into our strategic framework of areas that we want to invest in and growth in the ones that I highlighted here are strategic, and we believe that we can add a lot of value to them. So we've got plenty of capacity to engage. And if there's the right opportunity that comes along in this period, we'll be ready. Operator : Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Robert, congrats on the good print here. I had 2 questions. My first one is, could you just elaborate on this China VBP for Diagnostics. How big is Core Lab in China for you guys at this point in time? And I think I heard 20% would be impacted next year? Is the assumption or rest of Core Lab would be impacted in fiscal '25, like how do these contracts flow up? Because my understanding is you will see volume gains or those volumes and the asset price headwinds? Robert Ford : Yes. So the way this is kind of working out, right, this was announced recently, I think proposals are due within the provinces that are going to be bidding, Vijay, I'd say, in the next 30 days, right? And then there's like another 30 days, 30 to 60 days to evaluate all the proposals. So I think that this is going to probably start, I'd say, late Q1 and into Q2. Right now, the list of assays that are on VBP equate to about 20% of the market. So our annual sales are in China are about $1 billion. So -- and then if you look at the specific assays, it's infectious disease, there's some fertility assays there, et cetera. So that's where the -- that's where the VBP is kind of focused on. I haven't heard and team hasn't heard about expanding that to other areas of other areas of testing, such as oncology or hormones or other areas like that. So right now, I'd say, this is going to be our focus in 2024. If there's volume upside to begin, yes, there could be volume upside to be gained. I mean we do have good market share in some of these segments and others, we have lower market share, so it presents us an opportunity. So I think in areas where you've got higher market share, you'll feel more price. And then if you can offset that price by gaining volume in segments that you've got lower share. So I don't think that's rocket science there, and we'll just have to see how that all plays out. But we've had experience gone VBP in China. We've gone through it with stents. We've gone through it with EP certain parts of our pharma business, certain parts in CRM also. So team knows how to do this. They know to kind of think about it and manage it pretty well. We adjust some of our -- our cost structure is also as a result of that. So I think the team has got a good formula here how to manage it. And we'll just have to see how this kind of plays out. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Robert. And my second one, I know you touched upon PFA. I think Abbott's launching their own PFA at some point in fiscal '25, '26. How should we think in the interim, right? I think your peer had pretty robust assumptions for what percentage of procedures would be PFA. Is Abbott concerned about share loss when you think about that medium-term time frame? And are there offsets to it, right? When you haven't touched upon Lingo. I think previously you had said Lingo could be as big as Libre, where will be on Lingo launch? Robert Ford : Yes. So we'll have to see how -- what other companies report to go to see if we're gaining or losing share right now. But I'd say we still have got good, robust growth. I'd say as we look into 2024, I'd expect us to grow generally in line with market, which has historically been double digits. We've got some good innovation that's rolling out on the RF side. And as we've spoken about our EP business, we talk about PFA. That's going to be a product that's going to be really geared towards AF ablations, you still have VT and SVT ablations, where we do have good positions over there. A good portion of our sales are also on the mapping side and the mapping and the diagnostics and those consumables. So I see those being less impacted also. So I'd say for 2024, we've got a good opportunity with our EP portfolio to be growing there in line with the market. And I think to the previous question, yes, we've got plenty of different shots on goal here to be able to deliver our high single-digit growth rates. And we've got a very rich portfolio, and we're in exciting markets. Yes, Lingo didn't touch on it because it wasn't asked, but now that you have asked, yes, it is a great growth opportunity for us. We're launching it in the U.K., I'd say, I'd call it more of a controlled launch, Vijay, to understand kind of the marketing mix, the marketing messaging, the positioning, the inner positioning with Libre and the learnings we've got are fantastic, and I'm excited about a full-on launch in the U.K. starting next year. And then the opportunity to be able to bring that here to the U.S. I've been public about our intention to file Lingo here in the U.S. by the end of the year. And I think that's going to provide another great opportunity for growth for us also. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Matthew Miksic : So maybe follow up on a couple of pipeline opportunities and growth drivers, one being TRILUMINATE and TriClip, sort of if you could maybe walk us through the expected pathway for commercialization in the U.S. on that front? And then back to diabetes, I know the GLP-1s dominated to the discussion there, but with Tandem rolling out integration with their pump and kind of making wider availability here of closed-loop integration in Q4. Just it would be great to hear your thoughts on what that ramp looks like, what additional support or efforts you expect will be required on your end? And just what we can expect over the next 12, 18 months, that's out there and available to patients. Robert Ford : Sure. On your question on TriClip, yes, so we submitted to the FDA for review earlier this year. It's my understanding that CMS is going to review this in parallel also. I think I made a comment to this last time, we'll likely see a panel review here, and I don't think it's unexpected to be quite honest with you. A lot of the novel therapies go through an advisory panel process with TAVR, saw with MitraClip. So I expect that to be the case here for TriClip. Right now, the expectation of that panel is I said the date that we think we have right now is January but we'll have to see how that occurs. But again, I don't -- the fact that we'll probably go through a panel, I still feel very enthusiastic and confident about the opportunity that we have with TriClip. Not only this is -- these are patients that are in real rough shape and it's not a lot of treatment options. And we've shown in the TRILUMINATE study that we can reduce TR and our understanding and our belief is that reduction of TR is important, and we'll be going through that. And then I'd say the safety profile of the TriClip product is very important as you think about building a new category and a new area, but you've got 5 million people here, Matt, that suffered from TR globally. I believe this is a 1 billion-plus opportunity for sure, and we're committed to building a real strong position on here with innovation on the product and strong clinical evidence to support it. What was your other question, sorry? Matthew Miksic : Sure. Closed-loop integration with Tandem and maybe the ramp or expectations for that process? Robert Ford : Yes, it's my understanding here that we'll see a launch sometime by the end of this year with Tandem. And we're excited about that. There's about 150,000 to 200,000 new pump users globally. So I think this is an area that we've historically haven't been a player in, and now we will be a player in. We've launched an AID system in Europe, let's say, more towards the end of last year into this year, and I was reviewing the results of the team. I mean that pump company has had tremendous kind of growth partnering with us. And so that's a proof point there that when you bring in the choice and the option and you put it together with Libre that there's a real strong value proposition to connecting the pump with Libre. And then as I've said, we want to be a leader in this space, not just be a competitor. So there's a lot of work ongoing right now with our dual analyte glucose ketone sensor, which we believe there's a lot of applications there, Matt, but I think one of the clear applications and value propositions is to be able to kind of pair that with an insulin pump and have a much more richer algorithm and safety algorithm in the insulin delivery system. So we feel good about that. Michael Comilla : Operator, we will take one more question, please. Operator : And our last question will come from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Just a couple of quick ones. First, what is the updated expectation for COVID testing revenue here in '23? And then second one, Robert, you alluded to gross margin expansion in '24. Can you just frame the sources of gross margin? I assume nutrition is a key driver there. And then maybe just bigger picture, and I appreciate that everyone in the industry is facing these challenges. But is there visibility into clawing back to pre-COVID gross margin levels. Robert Ford : Sure. Yes, there's visibility. I mean, the visibility is in the first half of 2024, then I'd say no, but we do have a plan to be able to kind of drive gross margin and gross margin expansion. I'd say as you look at it into next year, Jayson, there's really a couple of elements here that will be tailwinds for us. I'd say lower commodity costs, that for sure. And those were pretty big headwinds for us in, I'd say, in 2022 and 2023. On one hand, you've got commodity costs in nutrition, but you also got other commodity costs that are impacting the entire company. And what we have seen, and I think a lot of companies have seen this is those commodity costs start to bend and move down the other way. So -- and that will be particularly important for us as we think about nutrition, which is highly dependent on a large number of commodity and commodity inputs. Seeing a lower freight and distribution. And again, I think a lot of companies are seeing that, but we're seeing that not only just in terms of rates but also with more normalized supply chains, we can use different modalities of freight that can also lower cost and not using air all the time. So that's going to help. We've got a, I think, a pretty robust process and teams in place that work on gross margin and gross margin improvement plans have been very busy, I'd say, over the last 12, 18 months, I expect those teams to continue to deliver on their strategies to deliver cost reductions, and then favorable product and portfolio mix, right? So as our faster-growing, higher-margin businesses and new products become a large portion of our overall sales and sales mix. I think that also contributes to that. So yes, we understand that gross margin is key to be able to deliver on that double-digit bottom line EPS growth. And we're -- this is something that we work on every year. And I think we've got a little bit more of a better environment for our teams to work on. So on your COVID question, I'll ask Phil to give you the details there. Philip Boudreau : Jayson, relative to 2023 COVID testing sales forecast full year is about $1.5 billion here. Robert Ford : Okay. So I'll just wrap up here with a few comments. It's clear that we're seeing broad-based growth across the entire company. As I said in my comments, we've now delivered double-digit organic sales growth here for the past 3 quarters and forecasting that type of growth again this next quarter EPS contributions and the growth in the base business has increased every quarter, and we've exceeded the expectations we set for the initial guidance of the year.  The pipeline to some of the points that were made there, a big kind of opportunity for us going into 2024 is our pipeline, and it continues to be productive with several new product approvals, indications reimbursement and geographic expansions there. So momentum is clearly building and well positioned for a strong end of the year and going into 2024. So with that, I'll wrap up and thank you for joining us. Michael Comilla : Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations. Michael Comilla : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance; and Phil Boudreau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our 2023 results as well as our outlook for this year. But before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time have positioned the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic. In the 2 years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier given the large size of our company. We expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range, but then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. And while our procedures-driven businesses such as Medical Devices and Routine Diagnostic Testing experienced a slowdown due to the healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our Branded Generics Pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course and our Nutrition business accelerated as people around the world place a greater emphasis on protecting their health. While some companies saw their entire portfolio suffer during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient. It was also during this time that we created a multibillion-dollar COVID testing business in just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world. COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. And given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors and other stakeholders. But we knew that the pandemic would not last for ever, so we planned ahead. We pulled forward or accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels, knowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred. And the experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale-up and subsequent scale down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company. Our R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last 2 years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications and geographic and reimbursement expansions. And this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD, for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. In Nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs with particular emphasis on the fast-growing Adult Nutrition segment. In Diagnostics, we announced approvals for new tests, new instruments and a new laboratory automation solution. And in Medical Devices, we announced 10 new product approvals along with several new opportunities to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio. These new opportunities are well balanced with each of our 7 Medical Device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline-related achievement. Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth, both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year. Sales, excluded COVID testing grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11% higher than our original guidance of high-single-digit growth. Adjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. And this is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio and a strong indication of the top-tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic. Turning to our outlook for 2024. As we announced this morning, we forecast sales growth excluded COVID testing to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion. We forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business. I'll now provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 14% in the quarter. In Pediatric Nutrition, double-digit growth in the U.S. was driven by continued market share capture in the U.S. and from formula business, where we are once again the market leader. International growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In Adult Nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results. Moving to Diagnostics. Growth in Rapid Diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing. The flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to that of the prior year. But in Core Lab Diagnostics growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems paired with our broad test menu offering. Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations. The system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the U.S. I'll wrap up with Medical Devices where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in 6 of our 7 Medical Device businesses. In Diabetes Care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion. In terms of sales dollars, Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters. In Electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double-digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe. In Rhythm Management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single-chamber and dual-chamber. In Structural Heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products, including Amulet, TriClip and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis. In Heart Failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19% driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management. So in summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year. We outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024. I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil? Philip Boudreau : Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our fourth quarter results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which, as expected, reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our outlook for 2024. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024. For the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales to be in the range of 8% to 10%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast nonoperating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Congrats on a nice end to the year here. So Robert, pre-COVID, Abbott was growing 7% to 8% organically as you mentioned, you're guiding to 8% to 10% today for 2024 off of a higher revenue base. What has changed? And what is giving you the confidence to guide that high to start the year? Maybe talk about the key assumptions, and I'll leave it there for my one question. Robert Ford : Thanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and quite frankly, as we talked about throughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take some of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business. I think ultimately, that's really the factor here. I mean, we operate in these 4 business segments and their underlying attractiveness still is very sustainable. So strengthening our positions that were already pretty strong in each of these 4 segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of healthcare to be in. So I'd make the case here that all 4 of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range. If you look at EPD, as I said in my comments, I mean, these are 3 consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging geographies in different markets and they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line. I think even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they have expanded their op margin profile by 300 basis points. So a pretty strong position, strong team. And then we layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which historically hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets. It's probably been more of a developed markets play. So I think that's going to provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition I think did an incredible job here. As we said at the beginning of last year at regaining our leadership position here in the U.S. I think it speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product. But even Adult -- our Adult Business, our Adult Business has increased $1 billion since pre-pandemic, and it's just strengthening and getting stronger. I mean it's $4 billion, growing high-single digits. There's a lot of med tech businesses, Larry, that command very strong premiums in terms of the valuation just by having those kind of growth rates and sizes. So -- and we're making investments in that channel also.  So diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our Core Lab business has done very well. I've talked about our algorithm and formula here and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here. I think that's the result of our portfolio. And quite frankly, the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute. And our Rapids portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there, for decentralized testing, and we've been making investments on new assays to be able to go through those instruments. And then Medical Devices historically was in that high single-digit growth. I think what's changed there to become now a double-digit grower for us on a very large-size business is that you have historically double-digit growth businesses like Heart Failure, EP, Structural Heart, EDC, I mean, those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in Medical Devices, our CRM and Vascular businesses, that we're showing very little growth historically and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4 with CRM. I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology. On Vascular, it's been a combination of adding inorganically to the business and organic plays to reposition some of the portfolio to higher growth segments. So I think that's really in a nutshell across all these very 4 attractive segments. We've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. And I think you're starting -- you saw that last year, every year, double-digit growth and they've gotten stronger and they've gotten better and they've gotten more growth opportunities with them. So I think that's really the driver there. I mean if you -- I've gotten some of the headlines here about accelerating sales, but not seeing maybe that come through in the -- on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that COVID had on us and the clouding of it. Our Core business grew EPS last year, 40-plus percent. We're forecasting double-digit earnings per share growth this -- at the midpoint, double digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry. So I'd say, yes, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics. But we've proven to be pretty resilient there. And I think the range captures the opportunity that we have on the earnings side. I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range, but it's only January. So I think this is a good starting point. Operator : Our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Joshua Jennings : Congratulations on the strong finish to the year. I was hoping to just follow up on your comments there, Robert, on just the earnings power and just the margin expansion trajectory. I know Abbott is a unique story relative to peers because you didn't have the margin headwinds during the pandemic due to the COVID Testing business that you developed internally. But was hoping to just -- thinking about the pre-pandemic margin expansion trajectory of the business in that 30 to 50 basis point range. And I just hope if you could just give us a little bit more color on some of the drivers of market expansion and how your team sees that trajectory going forward in '24 and into the outyears? Robert Ford : Sure. I mean, listen, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here to recover to their operating margin and try to get back to their op margin pre-pandemic. We're in a pretty unique position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at -- is already at the pretty pandemic level. And I think what you saw us do there, Josh, and I talked a little bit about it in my comments, is I think we managed very well strategically the spending piece of it. We accelerated the spending investments when we were at our -- COVID sales were at their peak levels a few years ago. And then we held that spending flat these last couple of years, even though our top line was growing pretty significantly here. So I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line. And that is, if you think about our big 5 activities this year at the company, and we could do all 5 in the same time. But I'd say gross margin is pretty high up there in our priority. We're forecasting a pretty nice step-up in our gross margin profile this year, roughly around 75 basis points. And there's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement program. So every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis. They all get reported out. So there's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs. Some of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say, over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. So whether it's commodity costs, freight and distribution, all those elements seem to be, let's say, right now and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, turning into tailwinds, so that helps. And then the other part here is just, I'd say, portfolio mix. So as some of the Device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow those are higher-margin businesses and they provide that mix element in that gross margin expansion. So I think this provides a nice opportunity for us this year. But I expect over time, we'll get back to our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. It's -- for me, it's not a question of if -- it's just a question of when we could target 50, 75, I mean it's never going to be as linear as we always would want, but that kind of expansion for us, I think, really provides a good opportunity to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years. So I'd say that's our biggest opportunity. I think we did a really good job at leveraging spending. And I think you see that in our profiles. So our big opportunity here is gross margin, and we're all over it. Operator : Next question will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Marie Thibault : I wanted to ask a little bit more about your Electrophysiology business. That segment has been very strong, and I've been impressed that you've been able to put up that European growth rate in the face of some competitive PSA launches. So I would love to hear what's going on behind the scenes there, how you're getting those growth rates and how you're thinking about the U.S. EP business as we see some PSA launches this year? Robert Ford : Sure. Well, I think we've showed pretty strong robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual end market competition, it's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story. U.S. has been strong. China has been very strong for us this year, especially in VBP. I mean there were some price challenges throughout the year with VBP, but the volume we picked up, the market share we picked up more than offset that. So it's really been across the board here. And I think it really is about the strength of the portfolio. So not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think is at the core, good mapping disposables and diagnostic disposals also. And I think launching TactiFlex, which is the flexible tip combined with the contact force. We've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's outcomes to the patient or time of procedure. We've seen that consistently around the world. And then on top of that, I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers. And yes, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We've talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. So I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth as we look to more PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the U.S. Listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology. I think there are some challenges with some of these first-generation products. I do expect there to be uptake and usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first, at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the Cryo segment. And then from there, then kind of moving past that, so right now, I think -- I guess, that's my assumption in the U.S. until I see something differently that it will follow a similar pattern. And then the question will just be kind of the speed. But I think the team has done a really good job here on the ground with the technology. Operator : And our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Robert, maybe I could ask on Libre. This is the most successful medical device. At the conference just a few weeks ago in San Fran, you were talking about really robust growth rates moving forward and targets. Maybe you could help us understand where the growth is going to come from in '24 and beyond and one question I get a lot from investors is we see the IQVIA script data. It's the best we have. It seems like Libre sales or at least prescriptions are flattening out, yet the sales keep growing. How do we think about the discrepancy there? And how big is the Medicare DME business? And the growth we're getting there from basal. Robert Ford : Sure. Strong growth in Q4 under $1.5 billion. U.S. was up 32%. And I'd say still haven't -- team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the U.S. market in 2023, I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. But being able to put those kind of growth rates in the U.S. without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system. I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale and our brand. The growth is going to come from -- I've been pretty consistent about this, Robbie, and then we've a lot of opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here. But I'd say, okay, the basal is a big opportunity. It's a large opportunity for us. And I also think it's multiyear. So I don't think it's just a '24, '25. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely 2-plus years easily. And Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean you referenced IQVIA, Robbie. 7 out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre. And I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has, so it's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the U.S. In Japan and in France, where that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution on growth. I think right now in the U.S., most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private -- private commercial Medicare represents about 1/3 of the market. So I think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the awareness, build the traveling experience with primary care. And that's what we're doing. That's what we have been doing, quite frankly, for some time. So it's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us, and like I said, easily 2-plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have, Robbie, is looking at a segment that really hasn't been -- we haven't been able to access which is that of pump connectivity. I think this represents a great opportunity for us. If you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for us. You got 150,000 to 200,000 I guess, new pumpers every year, and that patient segment has -- we haven't been able to target it, but now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers. I think this is a great opportunity for us. And I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option especially for this patient population, where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important, right? Recently, there was an independent third party study. I think this is the first time we've seen an independent head to head study that was published a few weeks ago, showing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's MARD. So I look at that and I say, okay, through a pump company, and you're wanting to provide the best solution to users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment. So I look at the basal, I look at the pump, it's probably good drivers for us in '24, '25, but we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform like I've said. To your question on IQVIA, I think anybody who kind of follows Pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market. So the pharmacy channel in the U.S. gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. So maybe that's what you're seeing. Operator : Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Danielle Antalffy : Congrats on strong end to the year and strong guidance. Just, Robert, since the story seems to be very much about top line growth. I haven't heard you reference the Fab 5, one of my favorite analogies in a long time. So just wanted to -- and maybe I just missed it, but I just wanted to get an update on those 5 products or where you think you guys are in launch trajectories, revenue contribution for each of those products. Do you still think there is a Fab 5? And where -- how they sort of factor into the growth, the 8% to 10% organic growth for 2024? Robert Ford : Yes. Thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say, yes, they are great products, and we didn't think about calling them that because they were going to be a flash in the pan for 1 or 2 years. We look at these as really long-term great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company over the next few years. And quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year, and they'll accelerate. So I think this year -- sorry, in 2023, those 5 products represented about 0.5 point of growth. I expect that to increase in 2024 to about 1 point of growth, total Abbott contribution. So they're definitely stepping up and I'd say some of them, I would call market creating opportunities, tricuspid I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement, generating referral pathways. We know how to do this, and we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products, right? But with products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do regarding clinical work as it relates to market expansion, development -- and market development. I'd say some of the other products on that list, I'd say, are probably more market conversion, and these are already attractive -- large attractive growth segments that we're targeting with our technologies, Navitor in the TAVR space, Aveir in the CRM side. I mean these are large segments that were coming in, and will have different value propositions. I think Aveir has got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market and the value proposition for Aveir I think is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implanter, to the patient. So -- we -- I expect a lot from Aveir in terms of growth. I expect a lot from Navitor. And we're going to be expanding. So we'll have 2 new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision and Navitor Titan. And so we're investing in those areas. And yes, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it. And they continue to increase. They'll grow 50%, at least we're forecasting a 50% growth next year and they will contribute about 1 point of growth to the overall company. So that being said, I will say those are great products. They take a lot of focus, but we still have a lot in the chamber here, too, whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test. We're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users this year. Also, we're doing a lot of work on [indiscernible], which is our PFA solution. We put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials. I talked about biosimilars in EPD, our dual analyzer sensor for Libre, we're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the Diagnostic market that we're currently not competing. So yes, Fab 5, a lot of great contributions, but there's a lot in the chamber here, and I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025 is just having a robust pipeline. Operator : Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : Nice start to the year or nice end to last year, too. So here is a question I have in Nutrition, you've done a great job of sounds like returning to normalcy. I'm wondering if there are pockets that still need to sort of get back on track or whether we should think of this returning to sort of a mid-single-digit segment growth category. Robert Ford : Yes. I think kudos to the team here, we set out a target at the beginning of last year -- this time last year to get to market leadership in our October call, we had already confirmed that and let's say, over the last couple of months, that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the #2. Yes, I mean I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share. And I'd say, given the strength of the portfolio of team and what we went through and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre-recall share. I don't know exactly when, but that will be my expectation on that. You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire Nutrition portfolio. So I'd say we're probably above that 4% to 6% range that we used to have prepandemic, at least into 2024. As I've said, I think that we can be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down. And I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the Adult segment, which is growing high-single digits and of which we've got very high market share positions across the globe. And this position with the brand we have, the science that we have, really aligns to, I'd say, a pretty sustainable demographic trend that we're seeing, which is just an aging population that is focusing on Healthcare and on Nutrition. So I'd say that's probably an opportunity for us to maybe break out of that higher end 6% range going forward. But I think right now, you'll see the impact of the share in the U.S., some partial year impact of the price allow us to be above that 6% range. And then as we move into next year, what's going to be the impact of some of the launches that we have planned for the Adult segment and what is that going to do for us? Operator : And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Robert, congratulations on a nice Q4 and a solid guide. I guess my one question is on M&A. Looking at the balance sheet phenomenal position, you at least have a minimum of $20 billion of firepower, Abbott hasn't done any large deals in the last few years. So my question is, how do you see the opportunity for larger-sized deals, what is Abbott's appetite for a larger-sized, more meaningful transaction? Robert Ford : Well, yes, we've got a strong balance sheet and provides us a lot of flexibility on our capital allocation plan. On the M&A side, Vijay, listen, I think it starts off with -- we've got great pipeline. We have great organic opportunities here to be able to kind of drive top-tier sustainable growth. So that ends up putting -- allowing us to be in a selective position here where we're not trying to use M&A as a way to kind of bulk up our top line or to cover any kind of top line gaps that might be there. So that allows us to be sustainable -- allows us to be more selective. And if there are opportunities that fit strategically and can generate an attractive return, then like you said, you've done the math, we've got the flexibility and the firepower to do that. But I'm not looking to acquire businesses simply to make the top line look good. Profitability matters. Earnings matter. And when you get into these larger size deals, you have to have very strong conviction and understanding of that to be able to generate those returns and not just look at it as a top line play. I think they're harder nowadays. You look at what we did with St. Jude, and we have looked back at the deal model that we put together spot on in terms of all aspects there of how we thought this business would impact the company. So I'm not discarding anything like that. I'm just providing you the framework that says they're harder to make work if you want to look beyond just top line and you want to look at ROICs and all the right financial metrics here in terms of how you deploy capital. And -- but I don't feel that we need to do anything like that to cover a top line kind of gap. If we ever did something like that, it was because it would be strategic and looking at the company kind of long term and not trying to feel a top line gap. Michael Comilla : Operator, we'll take 1 more question, please. Operator : And our last question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Travis Steed : So some of the insurance companies are getting surprised by higher procedure utilization. Some of the tech companies are kind of calling out above-normal growth. So curious, Robert, if you look at your net device markets, are there areas where you think you're seeing some kind of above elevated catch-up still coming through? Or do you think this is kind of more normalized growth rates that you're seeing in 2024? Just kind of curious on some of your thoughts on the overall market. Robert Ford : Yes. I don't think that we're seeing kind of any kind of catch-up or pent-up or anything like that. I think what you're seeing here is more -- at least I can speak for our portfolio. I just think you're seeing more adoption of the technologies, right? So I think there was some disruption. We've talked about it in some parts of some procedures that require a little bit more preop planning or imaging before and imaging after. I mean I think those -- that combined with the labor shortages that occurred 2022. I think that, that probably slowed a few of them down, but I don't think that there was a bolus returning as a result of that. I just think we got back into a normal cadence here of being able to see procedures increasing. We saw that in structural heart procedures, saw that in CRM and EP procedures, not just here in the U.S. but around the world too. So seeing that also in routine diagnostic testing, Travis, a lot of our -- a good portion of the diagnostic business, our Core Lab business is actually in the hospital. So we also get to see that, too. And I didn't see a bolus of testing coming back. So we try and triangulate this. I just see this as procedures are returning back to normal. And because the -- because these technologies that are being developed and launched into the market are so -- it got such great opportunity to improve care, improve life of patients. I just think you're seeing the return to the adoption and the adoption curve. Some are faster than others, just given, I think, the market and market positions, et cetera. But I wouldn't account for it to be some sort of pent-up piece over here. Okay. Well, I'll wrap up here. And like I said in the beginning, very successful year 2023, in many ways, it sort of represented this transition year regarding the coming down of COVID. I think we did a really good job at managing the scale up and the scale down, a lot of healthcare companies actually participated and -- in trying to solve the COVID problem and I think we did a good job here at being able to scale up and scale down. Our performance here is now transitioned from being driven by COVID testing to once again being driven by a broad-based strength across the entire company. We delivered double-digit organic sales growth on every base business every quarter. And we're clearly entering 2024 with a lot of momentum. The pipeline we talked a little bit about it, continues to be highly productive. And I'm forecasting here top-tier growth in 2024. And as you look at our range on the EPS guide, like I said, there's probably more upside to that than downside. But we're in January. So we're off to a good start and looking forward to executing this year. Michael Comilla : Okay. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants\u2019 questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mike Comilla : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance; and Phil Boudreau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note, that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.98, which was above analyst consensus estimates. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance ranges for both earnings per share and sales growth. We now forecast full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.70 and organic sales growth, excluded COVID testing related sales of 8.5% to 10%. Organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing related sales was 10.8% in the quarter, which represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The strong start to the year was driven by broad base growth across a portfolio, including growth of 14% in medical devices and established pharmaceuticals. In addition to exceeding expectations of both top and bottom lines this quarter, we accomplished a number of objectives across the pipeline, including obtaining several new product approvals and achieving important clinical trial related milestones. I'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the coal over to Phil, and I'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 8% in the quarter. Strong growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in pediatric nutrition, driven by continued market share gains in the U.S. infant formula business and growth across our international portfolio of infant formula, toddler and adult nutrition brands. In January, we launched a new nutrition shake called PROTALITY, which provides nutritional support for adults pursuing weight loss. As people eat less and lose weight from taking GLP-1 medications, undergoing a weight loss surgery, or following a calorie restricted diet. A portion of what is lost is lean muscle mass, which plays an important role in overall health. Combination of high protein and essential vitamins and minerals that totality offers can help people preserve muscle while pursuing their personal weight loss goals. Turning to EPD or sales increased 14% in the quarter. This quarter was a continuation of EPDs impressive trend of strong performance, including double-digit growth in four of the last five quarters. In addition to a strong track record of top line growth, this business has delivered equally impressive gains on the bottom line with an operating margin profile last year that reflected more than 350 basis points of improvement compared to 2019. Moving to diagnostics, where sales increased more than 5%, excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in diagnostics continues to be led by the adoption of our market leading systems and demand for testing that takes place in a variety of settings, including hospitals, laboratories, urgent care centers, physician offices, retail pharmacies, and blood screening facilities. Our development efforts and diagnostics focus on developing new systems and creating new tests that play an important role in making healthcare decisions, expand the accessibility of testing and deliver a result as fast as possible. In April, we received FDA approval for a point of care diagnostic test that could help determine if someone suffered a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in just 15 minutes. The test is run on our portable i-STAT Alinity instrument, which allows concussion testing to move beyond the traditional hospital setting and into urgent care centers, physician offices, and other locations that are closer to the patient, with nearly 5 million people in the U.S. going to the emergency room to be checked for suspected concussion each year. We believe this test has the potential to transform the standard of care for concussion testing, and I will wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 14% in diabetes care. FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter and grew 23%. As I previously mentioned, that Libre has several new growth opportunities that will help continue to fuel the strong sales trajectory we have forecasted. One of those growth opportunities relates to the continued expansion of reimbursement coverage for Libre, for individuals who use basal insulin therapy to manage their diabetes. Last year, we announced that Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France to include all people, who use basal insulin as part of their diabetes management. During this first quarter, Libre obtained reimbursement from a select number of institutional payers in Germany for basal insulin users who also use oral diabetes medication to manage their condition. These select public and private payers cover a limited number of the approximately 1 million basal insulin users in Germany, but this is an encouraging sign of the potential for further coverage expansion not only in Germany but across other European markets. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10.5% overall in the quarter, led by double-digits growth in electrophysiology, structural heart and continued acceleration in our cardiac Rhythm Management and Vascular portfolios. In electrophysiology, sales grew 18%, driven by double-digits growth in all major geographic regions and across all major product categories, including double-digits growth in ablation catheters and cardiac mapping related products. We continue to make great progress toward bringing our innovative PFA catheter, Volt to market. In March, we completed enrollment in our CE Mark clinical study, putting us on-track to file for international approval before the end of the year. We also recently began enrolling patients in our U.S. clinical trial called VOLT-AF, which will generate the data needed to support an FDA approval filing. In structural heart, growth of 13% was led by strong performance in several high-growth areas, including TAVR, LAA, mitral and tricuspid repair. Structural heart is an area that we have invested in over the past years in order to create a diversified portfolio that can sustainably deliver double-digits growth. In the past, we relied almost exclusively on MitraClip to drive the growth, but today the portfolio and growth are more balanced and reflect increasing contributions from newer products like Navitor, Amulet and TriClip. In April, we received FDA approval for TriClip, a first of its kind heart valve repair device designed for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation or a leaky tricuspid valve. Data from the clinical trial supporting this approval demonstrated that, patients who receive TriClip experienced a significant improvement in the severity of their symptoms and quality of life. We are excited to now offer this life-changing treatment option to people in the United States that suffer from this condition. In Rhythm Management, growth of 7.5% was led by AVEIR, our recently launched leadless pacemaker. AVEIR has rapidly captured market share in the single chamber pacing segment of the market and is now being used for dual chamber pacing, which is the largest segment of the pacing market. This revolutionary technology is helping to deliver growth rates in our Rhythm Management business that significantly exceed the overall growth in this market. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew 17%, driven by Eterna, a rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management. In January, we announced the launch of Liberta, the world's smallest rechargeable deep brain stimulation device, which is used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. In summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding expectations on both top and bottom lines. And as a result, we have raised the midpoint of our sales and EPS guidance ranges. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin expansion initiatives and we're seeing strong returns from the investments we are making across our growth platforms. Our pipeline has continued to be highly productive, delivering several recently new product approvals and we're very well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year, and I'll turn over the call to Phil. Phil Boudreau : Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our first quarter results, sales increased 4.7% on an organic basis, which as expected includes the impact of year-over-year decline in COVID testing related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales underlying base business, organic sales growth was 10.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.9% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in exchange having a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.7% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.7% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 29.4% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.70, which represents an increase at the midpoint of the range compared to the guidance range we provided in January. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance for organic sales growth. We now forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing to be in the range of 8.5% to 10%. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 2.5% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on second quarter reported sales. Lastly, for the second quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 to $1.12. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robbie Marcus : Two for me. I'll just ask them both up front. First, Robert, we almost never see Abbott raise guidance particularly on the top line in the first quarter. Looking back over the past, I don't know, 5, 10 years, it's very rare. First part is what gave you the confidence to raise the midpoint of the guidance this early on in the year? And then second, obviously, there's been a lot of concern during the quarter with competitor\u2019s loss in a case for NEC as it relates to infant nutrition. I was hoping you could address that what's your stance on the ongoing litigation? I think there's about a thousand cases that have been filed and any upcoming data points or timelines we should be looking for. Robert Ford : Let's go first to your question on the guidance, yeah, you're right. I guess I had to go back and take a look at that. I think the last time we did raise in Q1 was in 2016. I would say the framework here, Rob, is we've always done is, we set a guidance at the beginning of the year, which we believe is top tier, and then throughout the year, we want to beat that guidance, and we consider top tier to be high single-digit double-digit EPS growth. And that's obviously excluding the COVID testing portion, which is what investors are really more focused on. So that was the guidance that we set a couple months ago, back in January. We will target always have that top tier guidance and find the appropriate balance between, the opportunities. And obviously the challenge is that bracket that range. If you remember in January, I said I thought that there was more opportunities than risks. I think that some of the risks that we saw in January, I still think they haven't gone away. They are still there, whether it's geopolitics or whether it's FX, those are still there. But clearly the performance of the business continues to be very, very strong. And some of our businesses, a lot of our businesses actually accelerating our in performance. As I said in my comments, five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth here. You look at each of the businesses, EPD consecutive, three consecutive of double-digit growth, great margin expansion, and the teams are now working to be able to introduce biosimilars in all the markets that we are participating in. Nutrition has done an incredible job at recovering share and growing our adult business. We have grown adult over $1 billion versus 2019. Diagnostics continues to have a great track record here, outperforming the market. We have got some great large account wins both in the U.S. and internationally that we're rolling out into this year. And medical devices, I mean, what can I tell you? It is just been a real strong performer. The team's done an incredible job there. Last year, we were the fastest growing MedTech Company, at least from what I have seen from our guidance and from the other guidance\u2019s in the market. That's what it seems to be again this year. So you put all that together, plus the pipeline that's been contributing to an accelerated level, great new product approvals. I put all that together and I just feel that this type of performance that we deliver just gives us the confidence for the remainder of the outlook of the year. We felt comfortable raising the guidance again, in the first quarter, which is as you pointed out something that we don't usually do. I continue to believe going into the second quarter, as we move through that there's probably more opportunities than risks here, as we move forward. I guess that's the framework of raising our guidance in the first quarter, which is something that we usually don't do. Just great performance and great momentum. And then your other question was regarding the net cases. I would say from a date, we have some court cases that will happen in July. So that's maybe a milestone that we want to look at. But if you are asking me about kind of our framework of how we look at this. I'd say, for decades, we've provided specialized nutrition products that help doctors. And I think that's a key thing here. It helps doctors to provide the lifesaving nutrition to the premature infants. How you feed a premature infant, it's a medical decision, Robbie. Health care providers, they're going to use a range of options to meet the unique needs of each baby. That includes mother's milk, that includes pasteurized donor's milk, but that also includes preterm infant formula, because where mother's milk is not available, there is not a sufficient supply of donor milk to satisfy the nutritional needs of all of these premature infants that are born in the U.S. And quite frankly, even when they're available for some premature infants, human milk may lack some of the calories, the proteins, the vitamins et cetera that are necessary to support the nutritional needs of the premature infants. That mother's milk needs to be fortified in order to boost the nutritional output. The medical community, they consider these products to be critical part of the standard-of-care for feeding premature infants. Most of the societies when you read their positions, it is a standard-of-care to use these products. The doctors who work in the NICUs, they've used our products for decades and they continue to do so today. Countless babies, Robbie, have benefited from these products, lifesaving experiences over many, many years and there are clinical studies that have repeatedly established that, these products are safe. These litigation cases, they're really seeking to advance a theory promoted by plenty of lawyers that distorts the science and it distorts everything that we know and it's not supported by the medical community. We are preparing for our cases to be able to kind of lay out the facts, the science and the data and we stand behind our products. Robbie Marcus : Appreciate it, Robert. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. I'll echo, Robbie's, congratulations on the strong start to the year here. Robert, I just wanted to focus on EP. A multipart question here, but just one. The EP business grew nicely in the first quarter in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Can you talk about what drove that? What you're seeing with PFA in the different geographies? Your expectations for your EP business going forward before the Volt launch? Just lastly, it sounds like we should expect the Volt approval in Europe sometime next year based on the filing date. Just want to confirm that. Robert Ford : Sure. Like I said in my opening comments, we completed the trial. There's a six month follow-up, Larry. That means that, we will be on target here to file for CE mark by the end of this year. Then, it's just going to depend on that process. I think that's probably our anchor point here is getting the filing in before the end of the year. Yes, I mean, I'm not surprised by our EP growth. I know many on the call might be, but I'm not surprised. First of all, it's an important therapy. It's an underpenetrated disease. We know there's plenty of growth in this segment, and as a result of that, it's highly competitive. But we haven't been surprised by the growth. If you look at PFA, it's been in Europe for three years. If you average our growth rate over those last three years in Europe, we've been growing mid-teens, and the growth, it remains broad base. It was broad based in Europe, again, this quarter where we saw double-digit growth in ablation catheters. Not just on the mapping side, on the ablation catheter side also but then also great growth on the mapping side, and this technology has now come to the U.S. I think we probably had maybe two months of seeing the technology be rolled out here in the U.S. I think the competitors have been very aggressive here in terms of bringing the technology to the accounts in the U.S., and I can say, we've mapped a lot of those cases, Larry. I'm not going to say we've been in every single case, but I'd say, a vast majority of the cases we've been in there. And there are some similarities to Europe, but there are some differences to Europe. I think one of the things that we saw in Europe was that there was this inclination to use the technology starting off as kind of a one shot. So that had an impact more on the CRYO business than I would say on the RF side. And that's what we saw in our mapping cases. We saw here, at least in the first couple of months, that's where a large portion of those cases occurred, at least the ones that we mapped were in places where they were traditionally used in CRYO. I think the difference that we saw a little bit in Europe is that at least 90% of the cases that we were part of direct or indirectly were using mapping that that number was lower in Europe. So that's probably a little bit of the difference I saw here in the U.S., and that bodes well for us. Our end site system, our mapping system, our mapping catheters are widely viewed as an excellent option here for mapping these PFA cases. We have a large install base. Customers are familiar with it. Don't need a make room, don't need a fight for capital. We've got best in class clinical support. And the architecture here is open, as I've said in previous calls. So it integrates well with these PFA catheters. We actually recently released a software upgrade last month that provides even better visualization to these catheters and potential for faster procedures and less floor time. I think this is a perfect combination, quite frankly, in a time where there's going to be market transition, There's a lot of new products, there's a lot of choices. And when you have a situation like that, I think flexibility is key, and that's what we heard from our customers. One data point that I thought was also interesting to your question of what helped drive that in the cases that we were part of, and we saw, we also observed that an RF catheter was pulled in about a quarter of the cases that we saw. So on top of the PFA catheter, an RF catheter was pulled to do touchups, et cetera. I'd say right now, everything that we've seen in Europe on the positive side is happening. And then I think there's some interesting dynamics here in the U.S. that could be favorable for us also, but it's still very early. If I look at March, we had probably one of our most, we look at cases per day. That was probably one of our highest months. So far so good. And we're excited about the technology, we're excited about our program. We released data on our program and some recent medical meetings that occurred. And the feedback, from those that have been used in our product are very positive. And the integration with EnSite in including like the tissue contact force algorithm and the visualization, all of that is seen as a real promise and a differentiator versus what's being used today. Operator : Our next question will come from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Josh Jennings : Great to see the strong start here, the Q1 results. Robert, I was hoping to just ask first on Libre and just internationally, any other payment or coverage decisions that we should have on our radar in various countries. Sounds like you have made sense, some nice progress already in Germany, and then in the U.S. I was hoping you could just help or share your thoughts on the share gain opportunity in integrated pump segment of CGM market versus the share loss risk in the Type 2 non-insulin cash pace segment with a competitive launch share early in 2024. I just have one follow up. Robert Ford : On your international question, I mean, it's always difficult to forecast exactly by month a quarter coverage kind of payment decisions. I can tell you though that the team has a full global map of all the work that's being done regarding clinical information and negotiations, et cetera. It's difficult to kind of forecast it, but what I have said is on previous calls and on some of my prepared remarks that I think you're going to see this just this build that will be occurring globally in the market as the data proves and shows the clinical medical and health economic benefit by reimbursing for this patient population. And I think we're well positioned there. Internationally, I think we got some pretty large markets already. Canada, Japan, France, Italy, Germany, those are markets that are either fully reimbursed or starting their process. And like I said, I think you will see as the year progresses, whether it's in medical events or just as the year progresses, I think you'll see more coverage decisions. Maybe they don't get splashy, big PR news, but we are seeing continuous increasing there on that. On the U.S. side, I guess I disagree with your premise that I'm going to be trading share gains on the pump side for share losses on the non-insulin side. I mean, I'm just, right now I'm looking at the data, third party audited data, 7 out of every 10 new prescriptions for this basal population, which is primarily served by the primary care channel, 7 out of 10 are going to Libre. I think our product's going to get even more competitive and compelling, I think this is a great opportunity and our objective here is to maintain kind of our shared dominance and our share leadership as it results in this patient segment. But we do have an opportunity here to participate a little bit more actively in what is a little bit more of a smaller segment of the population, but nonetheless a very important one, which is the AID and the market system. There's 150,000 to 200,000 new starts a year. There's an opportunity for share gain also of existing users. I think that, the opportunity to bring a dual analyte sensor with ketones. We showed some data at ATTD this year, that showed the safety benefit or the value proposition of a dual analyte sensor for AID system. I think that's going to be a compelling value proposition. We are working with all the pump companies here and I think as the year progresses, we'll see connectivity occur whether it's with Libre 2 Plus our streaming product or whether it's with Libre 3. This is an area that we are focusing on and it's a new segment for us to compete in. But I don't think that, we are going to be taking our eye off the ball as it relates to the basal opportunity that exists. Josh Jennings : Understood. Thanks. And then just wanted to ask on the transcatheter tricuspid market, congratulations on the TriClip approval, but there's been some questions around the patient opportunity breakdown between TIER, TriClip and replacement with EVOQUE. Maybe just any internal team thoughts on that patient opportunity breakdown and then maybe you could share on the pricing strategy for TriClip in the setting of competitor pricing its replacement device at a significant premium? Thanks for taking the questions. Robert Ford : I'm not going to comment on our pricing strategy for competitive reasons. It is a differentiated and novel technology. There is an opportunity, but we'll have to see how this all plays out. You got NTAP submissions and all this stuff going on right now. What we are focused on here is, launching the product and getting cases ramped up and that's what's happening. I got some feedback yesterday from the team after a couple of weeks, real nice cadence of growth. We are obviously focusing on our initial cases on most of the account that were part of our pivotal trial, but just but just real nice cadence growth there and great feedback from physicians and patients post-surgery. I mean, if you're trying to poke at, what's the breakdown going to be about replace and repair, listen, I think it's good to have options. I guess my view here is that, I believe that, probably safety is a key driver here, just to start off with. I think TriClip has shown a very strong excellent safety record, both in clinical trials and real world use. I think that's going to play a key role here in determining repair versus replace. I expect repair or TriClip at least to be the preferred option unless the valves are too damaged and then obviously replacement is the only option. But there is a large pool of patients here. You got 5 million people globally, 2 million people here in the U.S. and it's going to be an opportunity here that we will be generating more data, expand the indication of the product. I think this is easily a $1 billion opportunity for us here as we build the capabilities and as we build more clinical data. Operator : Our next question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Travis Steed : Maybe just while we're on the pipeline, talk a little bit about AVEIR it sounds like that that product's going really well. And then I had a question on gross margins as well. Trying to think about is this the right pace to kind of get back to pre-COVID levels and still the opportunity kind of longer term for gross margins? Robert Ford : I think if AVEIR's done very well, I mean, we all know the advantages it has over the competitive system, whether it's single and dual chamber, the longer lasting battery, the ability for replacement, retrievability, upgradeability. It's done very well. From a single chamber perspective, I think we are now at about 50 share of the US market. So that's been doing very well. It's performed, we started doing our dual chamber procedures towards the end of last year. Seeing a nice kind of ramp up over this first quarter here. Focus here really is a really about, it's a completely different procedure, right? If you think about how these devices have been implanted, this is probably the first time in like 30 years that you have like a real meaningful change on how this is done. Our focus here is really getting great clinical results real thoughtful approach here about opening new sensors and training. And that's been working very well for us. And you could see the impact on our growth rate. I mean, historically our CRM business has been relatively flat with some platforms going up, some platforms going down. Our goal here with this program was to get our CRM portfolio to at least be contributor to growth mid-single digits, 6%, 7%. These last couple of quarters we've done seven and a half percent, and so AVEIR's been doing well, and it's going to continue to get better as more and more physicians get trained and we increase the amount of accounts. So I really like the cadence of how we're forecasting this business and the impact that it's going to have on our CRM portfolio. What was your other question? Travis Steed : Just on gross margins, kind of thinking about the path back to pre COVID levels over the long term and is this the right kind of cadence that you're -- this year's cadence, the right way to think about that? Robert Ford : I think that's a good cadence. I think we're forecasting here about 70 basis points of improvement this year. Feel good about that. I've talked about this not being a question of if, just a question of when, so I think that's not a bad cadence. And we're going to focus on the things that we can control and the things that we can control are obviously our cost and our cost teams and the teams that are working on improving gross margin, they're delivering great results here, while at the same time maintaining high service levels not running to back orders, et cetera. But probably the biggest the biggest opportunity we have here Travis, is just to expand the gross margin through portfolio mix. When you have our medical device businesses growing at mid-teens consistently over the last, whatever, four or five quarters, that has a real strong impact on our gross margin. So a lot of focus on what we control our gross margin, the cadence. That's what we are targeting. It's not really a question of if it's just a question of when. Operator : Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore, ISI. Vijay Kumar : Robert, I had a two forward question. A lot of questions on pipeline, but I'm curious when people ask us on sustainability of growth, if you could elaborate on pipeline, what else is there? When you look at the future, that gives us the confidence of sustaining its premium growth within the med tech industry. My second part was on the financial modeling side, looks like FX headwinds came in a little bit higher. Prior guidance that is $0.20 headwind to EPS from FX. Did that increase? I'm just curious on because some questions on why the high end of the guidance was not raised. I suspect the FX headwind increase. Robert Ford : As I said, there are certain challenges that still remain with us from January and FX is one of them. I'll let Phil answer that one. On your question on pipeline, listen, I could spend a whole hour on this just going through the pipeline, but I guess I would bucket them into like three categories, Vijay. I would say you got your current contributors and Libre and Alinity, they still operate like pipeline projects and products. We still got multiple innovations going through them. MitraClip, great familiarity, AVEIR, Navitor, TriClip, Amulet, PROTALITY or our concussion tests, I think got great opportunity and CardioMEMS, I mean, these are all products that I would still characterize them as early innings. Yes, they're established, but they're still early innings and they got a lot of growth rate there. The second group of products I would call, probably near-term future contributors, so think about it in the next 12 to 18 months, these products coming to market and starting to kind of generate revenue there. Our lingo product, I'm very excited about that and bringing that to the U.S. and expanding that globally. Our dual analyte sensor, our Volt system Esprit, which is our drug eluding bioabsorbable stent for below the knee. It will be the first of its kind. We are developing a whole new Alinity system that will target a segment of the market that we currently don't participate in. And there'll be more to come on that. And then just the great opportunity we have with biosimilars into the emerging markets and doing it in a very capital efficient way. And bringing that and leveraging our position there. That's our next 12 to 18 month kind of catalyst there. Then thinking about beyond 2026, I mean, we are working on a PFA, RF catheter. You got leadless, another kind of leadless pacing system that would be launching. We have a second generation Amulet, excited about entry into the IVL market sometime in 2027, coronary DCB, we're working on kind of new TAVR systems also that allow us to branch out into other segments. We've got a whole plethora of new analytes in our bio wearables market that will start to come out and have different applications in 2026. And then on top of that, all the clinical work that we're doing to expand indications, expand market, whether it's in TAVR, whether it's in LAA, whether it's in mitral. So we've got, I'd say a real nice cadence here of products and pipeline beyond, I'd say, the next 12, 18 months. We're looking at this '26, '27, '28 and I feel really excited about that. There's obviously more that we need to do and add, but I think the base here looks really good in terms of the pipeline. And then I think your question on FX, Phil, you want to take that? Phil Boudreau : Yes. I mentioned at the onset here, Vijay, in Q1, we saw about a 2.9% headwind on sales growth and we kind of the current rates anticipate something similar here in Q2. From a full year perspective at the current rates, it's about a 2.5% headwind on the top-line. That said, kind of the earnings guide that we have here is in line with the organic sales performance and drop through to earnings on the increased midpoint on EPS guidance. Operator : Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning. May I add my compliments and congratulations to the quarter? I have two questions put them right up front. The first one is on concussion testing. I'd love to understand the go-to-market strategy for that, how you think about the financial benefit impact and all that kind of good stuff? But I think my second question is a little bit more big picture. As you step back in a post-pandemic environment a couple of years into the CEO seat, how do you think about taking Abbott sort of to the next level? I mean, we all sit here and take a look at an incredibly strong balance sheet. How do you put that cash to work? Are these segments, divisions, ones you want to keep? Or how do you think about adding to it? Robert Ford : Sure. On the point of care concussion test, I guess I'd summarize the opportunity here in twofold. I think there's a market conversion component to this, Joanne. I mentioned there are 5 million ER visits to diagnose a concussion. The number one method there to use that is on a CT scan. I think there's an opportunity here to transform that and allow one to get a faster response in that emergency kind of emergency room visit, which is where the -- and the point of care team already have a good position with some of our other blood gas and other assays that we provide to that segment. I think this will slide right into that team. The value proposition here is going to be, okay, what's the cost of the system and can we bend that cost curve. I think we've shown a little bit how we think about things Joanne, if you look at Libre, if you look at Binax, if you look at how we think about pricing our products, when it comes to market conversion and the opportunities that we have there? We'll be able to do it at a nice return for our shareholders. I think that's an important part. The market expansion opportunity that we have, I think is going to still require some work on the product. Right now the product is approved whole blood, but it's a venous draw. We're going to be working on a capillary draw and if you can then run this assay, taking a sample from a finger prick, then you can look at bringing that technology even closer to where the need for a rapid concussion test would be. You could just look at how many universities exist in this country, how many high schools exist in this country? You can do some multiplications there and say, this is a great market creation, market expansion opportunity. I think that that's how we're thinking about it commercially, conversion and creation slash expansion. There's some more work to be done in terms of the product and the claims and the trials there. This will be a multi-year kind of program over here where we'll start to see kind of nice growth in that segment. And then your other question was about the portfolio and balance sheet. And do we like the four segments? The answer to that is yes, we like all the four segments. We feel that it gives us a real unique view into the healthcare system as a whole starting with nutrition that's obviously the bedrock of good health. But then, things happen and you need to get a diagnosis. And we've got a great diagnostic portfolio that we've been expanding on and building on to make sure that we can capitalize on all the different types of modalities and locations where people can get tested. And then, once a physician knows what the problem is, then they got to run through treatment, right? And we do that either through a medicines business or through a medical device business. I think all four segments are super well aligned to the global demographics and trends in healthcare. And so we like that there's always opportunities to add, and we've shown that if there are areas that we feel that we can bring value in a combination then as you mentioned we've got a strong balance sheet and strategic flexibility to do that. As long as we feel that we can add value to that asset. We felt like that about CSI, we felt like that about St. Jude. We felt like that about Alere. And those deals, they obviously help kind of reshape the company and accelerate our growth rates. But I think that's predicated on us really believing that we can kind of bring value and we're not trying to fill some top line gap or some issues. ROIC for us matters, profitability matters. We've got opportunities and we could be a little bit more selective to be able to add, but I like the four segments that we're in. And they've been well to shareholders, especially the long-term shareholders. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Matt Miksic : Congrats on the really strong quarter, particularly med devices. I had one follow-up on the -- sorry, here, background. One question on structural heart. Robert, you talked a little bit about the portfolio and the combination of the leading peer device and MitraClip of being a little bit more mature in the category of structural heart, but being kind of augmented by some of these new products like most recently, obviously TriClip. And if you could talk a little bit about sort of the momentum in the portfolio as well as how much of the build out of this portfolio is still coming organically or under review kind of strategically, I appreciate it. Robert Ford : Sure. I mean I didn't want my comments on mitral to be construed like that 1 there is slowing down, and we're relying on others to drive the growth. I mean, that wasn't the intent. If you look at MitraClip this quarter, it's high single digits. And if you look at the last 5 quarters, that's what it's been doing between high single-digits, low double-digits. And that's good. But we always had a view here that this is an attractive area of growth, an attractive area of medical need. And we wanted to be a leader here. So yes, MitraClip, I guess we can call MitraClip, the founding father of our structural heart portfolio. But I think the team here has done an incredible job at bringing organic innovation into the portfolio. So if you look at our structural heart, I mean, we grew 13% today. MitraClip grew high single digits. But it accounted for 3% of that growth. The rest -- the other 10% came from all the rest of the portfolio that's being built. So I think that you'll continue to see that. We'll continue to make investments in this business, continue to make investments in the pipeline. I'd say right now, most of it is organic, whether it's innovating on LAA, innovating on our TAVR side and all the clinical trial that we're doing there. If there's an opportunity inorganically, I just put that in the same bucket that I think I answered kind of Joanne's question here if it makes sense. And we can add it. We've got the flexibility to do it. But the whole strategy here was to say, listen, we're going to build a multibillion-dollar structural heart business that can sustainably grow double digits. And the way to do that is you can't be a division of only 1 product. And I think the teams over the last 4 or 5 years, have done a really good job at building that and there's more opportunity. I'd say probably the one that we're looking at and is very exciting for us is mitral replacement. We've launched our Pendine product, which was more a transapical system. Our Cephea system is the transfemoral transseptal and feedback that we've seen from early implanters, early first in man is that this is a great, great valve. So there's an opportunity there also. So I'd say most organic, but we got the capacity for inorganic if it makes sense. Mike Comilla : Operator, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : And our final question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Danielle Joy Antalffy : And yes, congrats on a strong start to the year. Robert, we spent a lot of time talking about the durability of growth in the med tech business. So I don't want to get too greedy, but just following up on Joanne's question regarding you guys do have a strong balance sheet. Are there any areas -- I guess sort of how do you feel about the state of the med tech business today? And do you feel there are growth areas within med tech that maybe Abbott isn't participating in today that Abbott could or should participate in today? And where are you looking beyond your current markets, if at all? I'll just leave it to one. Robert Ford : Sure. I get the attempt for triangulation here in the multiple different ways, and I guess I'll sign a little bit boring here in terms of how I talk about this. I've been public that, yes, we are interested. We look at areas that we can add value to. I'd say, probably the ones that have jumped out more at us in terms of a study and looking at are probably more in the medical device side and on the diagnostic side. We did look at a strategy for biosimilars for our medicines business and that was a pretty capital efficient way to do it. Yes, we're looking. We continue to study, but I'm not going to sit here and telegraph exactly it's this, it's that. I think the key thing here is just, I mean, look at our medtech business did this quarter, look what it did previous four quarters and that allows me to be a little bit more selective. Over the last couple of months we've seen some fairly large transactions in the medtech space. Those seem to be attractive growth areas. I talked about us getting access to some early IVL technology with the CSI acquisition. That's an important area for us to focus on. But I don't feel that, with our strong organic growth that we need to go out and not pay attention to like other key financial metrics that for us are important in terms of ROICs and those, because we've got that strong growth rate in medtech. You won't get me telegraphing here exactly, Danielle, what specific segments we are looking at. What I can tell you is, we have an active team. They study a lot. We look a lot. We follow a lot. If there's a moment that makes sense for us and those segments continue to be interesting, we've got the balance sheet and the track record to show that, we can drive value out of these acquisitions. I'll just leave it like that. Yes, we've got flexibility, that doesn't mean that we don't pay attention to other key financial returns as we're looking at it. I feel that I can do that because we've got such a strong top-line growth and great pipeline and prospects. With that, I'll leave it like that. I'll just close by saying that, we're very pleased with a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of double-digits organic sales growth on the base business. The investments that we've made during all those years of COVID are generating real strong returns. The pipeline continues to be highly productive, as I've outlined. We've got clear visibility to a pipeline all the way out to '27, '28. Obtained several new product approvals that are going to help us accelerate our growth in certain areas. Typically don't raise guidance in the first quarter, but given the strong performance and the outlook and the remainder of the year, we felt comfortable doing that and we're very well positioned to continue to sustainably deliver top tier results. With that, I'll wrap up and thank all of you for joining us today. Mike Comilla : Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 am Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbotinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. During the question and answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the star-one-one keys on your touchtone phone. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants\u2019 questions asked during the question and answer session, the entire call including the question and answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast with Abbott\u2019s express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mike Comilla : Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Phil Boudreau, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we\u2019ll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item Ia, Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rate, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we reported organic sales growth of more than 9%, excluding COVID testing sales. We also reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, which exceeded analyst consensus estimates and represents a 16% sequential increase from the first quarter. Based on our performance in the quarter and confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year, we raised our guidance and now forecast full year organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be 9.5% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $4.61 to $4.71. Our performance continues to be driven by broad-based growth across the portfolio with growth this quarter led by double-digit growth in medical devices and high single-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals and nutrition. In addition to benefiting from outperforming expectations on the top line, we are also seeing positive contribution from gross margin expansion coming from continued execution from our supply chain teams, lower commodity costs, and favorable sales mix. I\u2019ll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil, and I\u2019ll start with nutrition, where sales increased 7.5% in the quarter. Strong quarter in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in international adult nutrition and U.S. pediatric nutrition. International adult nutrition continues to perform at a very high level. The five-year compound annual growth rate of this business is more than 10%, which in addition to our market-leading position and commercial execution reflects the impact from positive demographic trends that drive increasing demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands. Through the investments we\u2019ve made to expand capacity, we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on these secular demand trends. On the topic of litigation, regarding pre-term infant formula and human milk fortifier, Abbott stands by our products and the information provided to the neonatologist specialists who have used them for decades. Necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, is a terrible gastrointestinal disease that primarily affects premature infants, and it is devastating to families; however, plaintiff lawyers are advancing a theory that is without merit or scientific support. These products, which are sold for hospital use, are incorporated into a feeding regimen along with human milk by experienced specialists and are an important part of the standard of care for the majority of preterm infants. Their use is supported by medical associations in the United States and other countries around the world. The products and their ingredients have been reviewed and are deemed safe for use by regulators, who have also reviewed their labels. There has been no increase in the rate of NEC, meaning these cases have not emerged in response to a trend or any new information, yet we\u2019re seeing plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers investing millions of dollars in misleading TV advertising in an attempt to move physician decisions from the hospital to the courtroom. Total revenues for these products are about $9 million annually, and have remained at that level for the past several years. If these products were no longer available, physicians would be deprived of the vital food that is needed in the NICU. This would create a public health crisis affecting every state across this country. We believe it\u2019s important for all who have an interest in health of preterm infants, who recognize the need for these products and to take action accordingly. Moving to diagnostics, where sales increased 6% excluding COVID testing sales, growth in the quarter was driven by high single-digit growth in core laboratory diagnostics and double-digit growth in point-of-care diagnostics. In core lab diagnostics, we continued to drive growth through increased adoption and utilization of our market-leading systems and global demand for our extensive testing menus across the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and blood screening. While our Alinity family of diagnostic systems first launched more than six years ago, given the long contract cycles common in the diagnostics industry, we continued to see a benefit in our contract renewal and competitive win rates with several recent large account wins expected to increasingly contribute to growth in the second half of the year. Turning to EPD, where sales increased 8% in the quarter, EPD continues to deliver at a high level as this business executes its unique branded generic strategy in emerging markets, where growth is supported by favorable demographic trends, including increasing populations, growing middle classes, and increasing focus on expanding access to healthcare. As you recall, we identified biosimilars as a new strategic growth pillar for this business. With our extensive presence in emerging markets, we have a unique opportunity to scale a licensing model that is capital efficient and can bring access to these life-changing medicines to millions of people in emerging markets. We began implementing this strategy last year when we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in the areas of oncology and women\u2019s health, with the first of these expected to launch in 2025. We recently completed additional agreements that provide Abbott access to biosimilar versions of market-leading autoimmune disease and GLP1 medications. Biosimilars represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market, and we look forward to continuing to build one of the most complete portfolios in the industry. I\u2019ll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 12%, in diabetes care, Freestyle Libre sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter and grew 20%. We announced in June that we received FDA approval for two new over-the-counter continuous glucose monitoring systems called Lingo and Libre Rio, which are based on Libre\u2019s glucose technology that is now used by more than 6 million people around the world. While over-the-counter availability is a new option in the United States, we\u2019ve been selling over-the-counter in international markets since Libre launched 10 years ago. Given our clear leadership position in these markets, we have demonstrated our ability to tailor solutions, approach and communication for the various types of users who compose the CGM customer base. Lingo is designed for consumers who are willing to improve their overall health and wellness. The Lingo wearable sensor and app will track glucose, provide personalized data, insights and coaching to help create and maintain healthy habits. Libre Rio is designed for adults with Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin and typically manage their diabetes through lifestyle modifications. In electro-physiology, growth of 17% was driven by double-digit growth in all major geographic regions, including 17% growth in the U.S., which represents an acceleration compared to the growth in the first quarter. Growth was broad-based across the portfolio and included 20% growth in ablation catheters. In structural heart, growth of more than 15% reflects an acceleration in growth compared to the first quarter and was led by several recently launched products that are driving new adoption and share capture in attractive high growth areas, including TAVR, LAA, and tricuspid repair. This quarter, we launched our tricuspid repair device, TriClip in the United States and continued our trend of capturing market share in the global TAVR market. In rhythm management, growth of 6% was led by Aveir, our highly innovative leadless pacemaker, and in June we announced that we received CE mark in Europe for Aveir to be used in dual chamber pacing procedures, which is the largest segment of the pacing market. In heart failure, growth of 9% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart-assist devices that offer treatment for both chronic and temporary conditions. In neuromodulation, growth of 8% was driven by strong demand in international markets for our Eterna rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device, which obtained CE mark in Europe last year. In vascular, we received FDA approval in late April for our Esprit dissolvable stent, a breakthrough innovation for people who suffer from blocked arteries located below the knee. Esprit is designed to keep the arteries open, deliver a drug to support vessel healing prior to completely dissolving over time. New products like Esprit combined with the investments that we made in our vascular business, both organically and inorganically, have expanded our presence in faster growing areas and increased the future growth outlook for this business. In summary, we exceeded expectations both the top and bottom lines and, as a result, we raised our financial outlook for the year. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin initiatives and, more importantly, our pipeline continues to be highly productive, and thus we\u2019re well positioned to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year. I\u2019ll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil Boudreau : Thanks Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our second quarter results, sales increased 7.4% on an organic basis and increased 9.3% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 27.7% of sales in the second quarter. Lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share of $4.61 to $4.71, which represents an increase compared to the guidance range we provided in April. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance for organic sales growth. We now forecast organic sales growth excluding COVID testing sales to be in the range of 9.5% to 10%. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of more than 2.5% on full-year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on third quarter reported sales. Lastly, for the third quarter we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.22. With that, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, and Robert, congratulations on a nice quarter. Thanks for your comments on the NEC litigation. I\u2019m wondering if you have anything to add on that, Robert, and then I have one follow-up question. Robert Ford : No Larry, I think I said everything I said during my prepared comments. I guess the only add here is I think this is way overblown in terms of its impact, and we are--we\u2019re working to obviously defend our position and--you know, working with all the different stakeholders so that they are aware of the situation, the gravity of the situation as it progresses. But I said all I had to say right now in my prepared comments, and if there\u2019s a need to kind of give further updates, we will. Larry Biegelsen : All right, thanks. Separately, Robert, your EPD business grew nicely in the second quarter, 17% in both the U.S. and international. What drove that, what are you seeing with PFA in the different geographies, and how are you thinking about the sustainability of that growth before bolt [ph] launches? Thank you. Robert Ford : Sure, well I\u2019m seeing what I thought I was going to see. It might be a little different from what some of you thought you were going to see, but what we\u2019ve been seeing is obviously an increase in the market, so right now the market has accelerated, seems to be growing above 20%, so when you look at our 17%, it\u2019s lower than the market but it\u2019s actually growing faster than what it was growing pre-pandemic, or just after we had done the acquisition. We\u2019ll see if the--I mean, that growth is obviously in value. We\u2019ll see if the growth in procedures actually translates. We are actually in more procedures than what we were in the past, given our mapping and our teams, but I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to say if the actual number of procedures is going to significantly increase. The market has accelerated, but it\u2019s predominantly, I think, price right now with the introduction of this new product. It\u2019s predominantly being used in de novo procedures, atrial procedures, right, and we think that\u2019s about a third of all ablation procedures, Larry. The other two-thirds, we continue to see, whether it\u2019s re-dos, VT, SVT, ablations, in that case we continue to see RF really being viewed as the better option for those procedures. We\u2019ll see how that\u2019s going to translate over time, but OUS, the penetration is around 10%, 15%. It\u2019s been pretty stable. From the point of view of mapping, I think we haven\u2019t seen a real big change of what we saw during those first couple of months of launch and in the last call, so over 90% of cases here in the U.S. are still being used as mapping. We\u2019ve got a 50 share of those mapping cases. I don\u2019t try and look at different types of denominators to get to that market share, so I make sure my team just basically has the best access and, from what we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s about 50%. RF catheters, similar to what we saw in the last call, still being used in about 20% of the PFA cases, so we continue to see that. I think the net effect of all of this is the market\u2019s growing, it\u2019s accelerating. We\u2019ve got a strong position. Everything that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, about our opportunity with the mapping and all of the other consumables is there. RF still plays a role, it\u2019s still an important role, and our business has actually grown faster than what it was growing before. If you look at \u201919, we were about 12%, \u201918 was about 14%, so we\u2019re actually doing better now. I think that is positive for the market, which is why we\u2019ve invested heavily in our PFA portfolio, which will--you will start to see hit the market in the--I\u2019d say next year, I\u2019m not going to try and time the quarter here, but definitely next year. I think this is good and the teams have done an incredible job at executing the strategy that we laid out, so kudos to them. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks so much. Thanks for the comprehensive answer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open. Travis Steed : Hey, congrats on the good quarter. I wanted to ask about structural heart - really stood out this quarter, accelerated from last quarter. Just curious how much of that is on MitraClip recovery, you got TriClip approved early, how much you\u2019re seeing from the TriClip side and how much is coming in from some of the other newer products, like Amulet and Navitor. Robert Ford : Sure. Obviously TriClip was an important launch and helped to accelerate the growth rate, Travis, but I think it\u2019s pretty broad-based here. I mean, if you look at TriClip, we were ready to go because we had certain built-in advantages in this area, right - we had the scale, we had the sales force, the manufacturing capacity, so we were ready to go. I think from our estimates here, even though we launched a quarter after our competitor with their system, I think the repair device is already in twice as many accounts as the replacement system, so we had a natural kind of built-in advantage here as we went to the market, and the cases are doing very well. The feedback has been very positive. But I think it\u2019s really broad-based here. Navitor has done very well, both in international markets and in the U.S., and the value proposition is starting to gain more traction - you know, great clinical profile, excellent hemodynamics, and that\u2019s driving a lot of opportunity for us in international and U.S. markets. We shared some data from our registry, from our Japan registry, and great safety also, so that\u2019s doing very well. Amulet, we saw really nice growth in the U.S. for Amulet this quarter - it was about 45%, so that product is doing very well and we\u2019re focusing here on continued, what I would call penetration in same store sales, so we\u2019re about close to 20% in the accounts that we\u2019re in. We\u2019re in about half of the market here in the U.S., so our opportunity here is to continue to expand the sales force and go to newer accounts, so that\u2019s done very well, too. MitraClip, I think we continue to see some continued growth internationally. In the U.S. with competitive activity, that\u2019s kind of slowed down a little bit of the growth, but I think with TriClip now coming into the market and gaining traction, we\u2019ll be able to provide a value proposition across both repair systems and drive there. So structural heart, the growth rate has accelerated from Q1, doing very well, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s really across a full portfolio approach versus just really trying to single out one product or one technology. There\u2019s work we have to do in MitraClip - that\u2019s clear, in the U.S., internationally it\u2019s done very well; but all the other products that I\u2019ve talked about are doing very well and gaining market share, and gaining adoption, so that\u2019s why you saw structural heart\u2019s growth rate actually accelerate, and I continue to see that that\u2019s going to be definitely for the rest of this year and going into next year. Travis Steed : That\u2019s super helpful. Then on your sensor business, how are you thinking about segmenting the market with Lingo versus Rio, and how do you think those markets are going to develop over time? When you look at your core Libre business, anything to call out, any changes in U.S. versus international market dynamics? Robert Ford : Well, you\u2019re trying to cover a lot of ground there with that question. You could probably spend a whole call going through all of that. I think at its highest level, Libre continues to do very well. There\u2019s still a lot of growth opportunity. Obviously the basal opportunity is the biggest one, and we\u2019re doing--having great progress over there, but even in the MDI segment, there\u2019s still a lot of penetration to occur in the MDI segment. I think in the U.S., there\u2019s still about a third of multiple daily injectors that aren\u2019t using CGM, and international developed markets, it\u2019s around 50%, so there\u2019s plenty of growth in Libre. Our strategy here with Lingo and Libre Rio is just really to have a full portfolio and look at this as a platform where we can expand the use of the sensor technology across different types of diabetes populations, but also what is probably the larger market, which is people that don\u2019t have diabetes, right? I think if you--if you take--right now, I would say we\u2019re doing to launch it here in the U.S. and we\u2019re going to start expanding globally, and we\u2019ll see how it looks like and what it takes to win there. But what I do know, based on the U.K. experience, is that it takes some time to educate and communicate with a patient population that, while excited about having new tools to drive healthier habits, they do need some time to understand its use. But I think it\u2019s a pretty big opportunity for us and one that we\u2019ve disproportionately invested to be able to get into this position. I think if you take Lingo and you look at U.S. and Western Europe, the adult population there, you\u2019ve got about 400 million people in those markets. If you take a single-digit penetration rate, a few sensors a year, you\u2019re looking at a multi-billion opportunity there, and we\u2019re not there yet. I think once we\u2019ve got better understanding of how this is going to work, we\u2019ll be better at forecasting it; but just at a high level and looking at it from a total adult population and relatively, I\u2019d say, modest penetration rate, it\u2019s a pretty big opportunity. Like I said in my comments, we\u2019ve done this for a while since we\u2019ve launched internationally, and we\u2019ve learned a lot and we\u2019re going to bring that learning and experience here to the U.S., so it\u2019s an exciting opportunity for us. Travis Steed : Great, thanks Robert. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Robbie Marcus : Oh great, thanks. I\u2019ll add my congratulations on a good quarter. Two for me, two product questions. Maybe just to follow up on the diabetes Libre question, Robert, how are you thinking about a holistic drive of advertising and word of mouth for these new products, especially as we move into the OTC, versus generating data, and how much will be necessary? I think back five years ago, and where we are today was probably not in most people\u2019s forecasts, and with the amount of data we have showing in non-diabetics how beneficial CGM is, how are you thinking about data versus not data, insurance coverage versus not insurance coverage, and how do the markets look one way or the other? Robert Ford : Yeah, I don\u2019t think--so from an insurance coverage perspective, if you\u2019re referring to Lingo specifically for non-diabetes, I think it\u2019s going to be--you know, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to be something that we\u2019re building a forecast assuming reimbursement coverage over it, even though I agree with you - you know, there is nice data that shows that people that don\u2019t have diabetes can benefit from this, Robbie, and it helps sustain behavior modification. Ultimately this is what it is, right - it\u2019s using data to be able to kind of help people that want to stay healthy, give them more information, and ensure that they can refine their habits or change habits. I think that that is at the core there - it\u2019s really communicating directly with consumers. If you think about the diabetes space and how CGM uptake, you needed both a communication with the patient and you needed obviously a communication with the physician. I think that that\u2019s still important for the non-diabetes. I think that some people will want to have some sort of recognition from the healthcare professional that this might be a good investment to do in, right, and the key thing here is just the utilization. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see people that don\u2019t have diabetes use this, you know, a sensor 365 days a year, but like I said, if they\u2019re using a couple times a year, there\u2019s still a benefit, and we\u2019ll be generating data on this over time. I think it\u2019s going to be important to generate data, even if it\u2019s not to communicate to payors to get reimbursement, but even if it\u2019s to communicate to physicians, the primary care and the direct consumers, that there\u2019s a value here of doing that. I think the key thing here is personalization and how do you personalize information and the data and the coaching, so the strategy here is, yes, you\u2019re doing to have to use TV to be able to communicate, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s--I don\u2019t think given our experience here that you could just go on TV and blast TV advertising and you\u2019ll get this big uptake. You\u2019re going to have to do some on-the-ground kind of gorilla marketing - let\u2019s call it like that, together with TV advertising to really be able to open up the market and then sustain it, right, and sustain its use. That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it, and that\u2019s why we have a separate team completely removed from the Libre and the diabetes team, that they\u2019re focusing on how to execute this strategy. I think it\u2019s more of an S-curve growth versus an out-of-the-gate. I know that everybody is focused on what the sales are in the second half, whether it\u2019s me or the competitor. I think the bigger picture here is, hey, there\u2019s a really big opportunity here and if we do it right, it\u2019s an opportunity that will be more than a flash in the frying pan. It will sustain itself and it could become standard, so. Robbie Marcus : Great color. One more from me - Aveir and the leadless pacing, particularly the dual chamber now with coverage, I think is an underappreciated opportunity. Maybe if you don\u2019t mind, spend a minute there, how you see this market evolving, and what\u2019s the early feedback on the launch so far? Thanks. Robert Ford : Yes, I mean, ultimately I think this whole leadless is going to change the growth trajectory of our CRM business. If you look at CRM, it grew 7% last year, it\u2019s grown 7% the first half of this year - it was previously a flat business, and we\u2019ve been doing that, I would say, with good success on dual, but I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s at full cycle yet, because one of the things that we\u2019re working on is ensuring that we\u2019re doing the training and we\u2019re getting physicians comfortable with the procedure, right? It\u2019s a completely different procedure versus what the entire industry has been accustomed to. We\u2019re using mapping, we\u2019re going into the groin versus doing pockets above the chest, so it is a little different and we\u2019re focusing on that. That being said, we\u2019ve been able to accelerate the growth rate just with a single chamber. I think right now after two years, we\u2019ve probably captured about 50 share, but to your point, the bigger opportunity is in dual, and the procedures are going great. Once physicians get several under their--you know, experience with several of them, they\u2019re talking about okay, how do we accelerate this and an opportunity to drive more patients into it, but we want to make sure we\u2019ve got a pretty large base of well-trained, great outcomes physicians across the United States. Listen, this is a $3 billion global segment and there really hasn\u2019t been much innovation in it, and here you have something that\u2019s truly unique and differentiated, and I\u2019d say once we feel that we\u2019ve gotten to a point where we feel good about the capabilities and training and the amount of physician coverage that exists, this is definitely a product that I can see going a little bit more mainstream, having more direct consumer communications because of the value proposition it affords them, so I think this is a great opportunity for us. It might be under-appreciated with the market, but it is definitely appreciated amongst me and the device team and the CRM team, and we\u2019re working hard to get to that point where you can really let it go strong. Robbie Marcus : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Josh Jennings : Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Robert, I wanted to just start asking about just this multi-year trajectory for Abbott. You\u2019ve been delivering top tier organic revenue growth performance over the last two years and potentially have a two-year double-digit stacked comp next year, but I think the team has been publicly stating that potentially the business could outpace pre-pandemic levels, which were in that 7% to 8% range. I think during this call, you\u2019ve put forward a lot that supports that type of trajectory, but maybe just to reiterate your confidence level there, and is this kind of outpacing your pre-pandemic levels over the medium term dependent on M&A, or is this the core business with internal development programs that\u2019s really going to drive this top tier growth out over the next couple of years? Robert Ford : Was that an attempt to get to the 2025 kind of question? I\u2019d say, listen - we\u2019ve been saying that we made investments during COVID to accelerate the company, make it stronger, build our portfolio so we could accelerate the growth, right? If you look at the last six quarters, we\u2019ve been delivering top tier, high single digit, double digit growth, and this is on a company that\u2019s doing $40 billion-plus of revenues, so I think that\u2019s pretty impressive. If you look at our med tech portfolio, it was the fastest growing med tech portfolio last year, fastest growing in the first quarter of this year. We\u2019ll see what happens this second quarter, but we\u2019ve positioned the company to be able to deliver this, and do I think that we can continue to deliver this top tier performance throughout this year and into next year? Yes, I absolutely do, because of, one, what we\u2019ve built, and then just the evidence and the proof points that we\u2019ve been able to reliably and sustainably deliver that. So yes, we feel good about our ability. The markets that we\u2019re participating in are attractive, so they are markets that we lead, and when those markets grow, our leadership benefits. There are markets that are attractive that we\u2019re entering, and there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for market share gain; and there are markets that are attractive that we\u2019re building, and there\u2019s no real clinical opportunity--or there\u2019s a clinical opportunity for our products that we\u2019re developing to come in there, so as we build those markets, they become attractive and our position gets solidified. I think that framework applies to all four of our business units have opportunities across those three frameworks. On the M&A front, yes, if we\u2019re able to find an asset that makes sense strategically to us, makes sense financially that could add even further to that growth, then we\u2019ve got the balance sheet to be able to do that; but it\u2019s not dependent--as I\u2019ve told you, it\u2019s really focused on the organic side to be able to deliver this top tier growth. Josh Jennings : Understood, and thanks for that answer. Another kind of high level question you probably receive regularly, but just wanted--it\u2019s our understanding as well that your team, the Board ever year at least once a year, maybe multiple times a year, is just considering the strategic fit of the four major business units for Abbott, and maybe just if we could get an update on your thoughts on the business combinations and the potential for spins down the line. Thanks a lot. Robert Ford : Well, we look at our portfolio on an ongoing basis. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s this one moment in the year that we do it - we\u2019re doing it on an ongoing basis, and the company has a history of ensuring that the portfolio that is assembled is not only delivering value to patients and governments and healthcare systems, but it\u2019s also delivering value to our shareholders. We historically haven\u2019t shied away from asking ourselves the questions and answering those questions, and if there\u2019s an opportunity to create value through addition or through subtraction, then the company has shown that it\u2019s ready to do that. I think the two fundamental questions about that is, is there an opportunity to create value for shareholders, and is there somebody that could do better with our businesses? Right now, you look at what we\u2019re doing with our businesses, we\u2019re performing at the highest level across all of the four segments. We\u2019ll see what happens during this earnings season here, but I feel very good about the team and what they\u2019re doing. Obviously there are areas that we could always do better, and we focus on that; but at the highest level, all four of our sectors have been delivering outstanding growth, market-leading growth, and quite frankly innovating and fulfilling our purpose and our mission, which is to help people live healthier lives. I like the diversity. The diversity provides both defense and offense capabilities, and as long as you\u2019re managing them within each one of their segments, allocating capital that is proportionate to their growth and their industry, and we spend a lot of time managing all four segments, then I think we\u2019re doing a good job at running them. Josh Jennings : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. David Roman : Thank you and good morning everybody. I was hoping to ask one question on the P&L side and one on the capital allocation side. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the P&L here. As I kind of look at the guidance here for the back half of the year, our math implies it\u2019s something like 100 basis points-plus of year-over-year operating margin expansion, and about 9% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. Can you maybe talk through some of the drivers that underpin that margin expansion on a year-over-year basis? Obviously we saw a turn here in Q2 versus what we saw in Q1, but maybe walk us through some of the drivers that get to that improved margin and earnings growth performance in the back half of the year. Robert Ford : Sure, I\u2019ll let Phil take that. Phil Boudreau : Yes, good morning David. Robert touched a little bit in his opening comments here on some of that expansion already this year, and we\u2019re in a pretty unique position relative to some of our peers in terms of our op margin profile, that we\u2019re already back to pre-pandemic levels, and we did that strategically through managing spend through the ups and downs of COVID testing. As we talked earlier this year, Q1 was really the last big comp on COVID testing impacts on sales and profiles. With respect to margin expansion and gross margin in particular, the guidance for the year is around 75 basis points as you highlight some progress here, and more to go, but the trajectory is there. We\u2019re focused on the things that we can control and execute on, and in particular some of this great portfolio contribution from our sales top line performance, particularly in accretive businesses, is a contributor here, and one that we anticipate will continue to expand here throughout the year. We have dedicated teams in each one of our businesses focused solely on gross margin improvement, productivity yield improvements, cost reductions, innovation that brings accretion to the portfolio. All of those elements are contributors here quarter in and quarter out and continue to contribute through the rest of the year. Then we also have elements--we\u2019ve talked about some of the cycles that we go through, be it in commodities markets and the like, some of the inflation the last few years, that are starting to sort of stabilize and normalize We\u2019re seeing freight and distribution profiles normalize and start to be more a tailwind as opposed to headwind, and we\u2019re also seen in commodity markets as well things not only stabilizing, but coming down and also contributing to tailwinds to gross margin, and anticipate that to persist here as well. The combination of all of those contributes to the confidence here and continuing to drive the top tier sales performance, but also expand margins throughout the year. David Roman : Super helpful, thank you. Then maybe just on the capital allocation side, maybe thinking about the other side of Josh\u2019s question, if you look across the sector here, we\u2019ve seen M&A pick up a little bit in the second quarter - I think there were two billion dollar-plus transactions announced with transaction multiples starting to trend toward the lower end of historical levels. But could you maybe give us your latest perspective on the M&A environment and how you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation as your cash balance continues to build nicely here? Robert Ford : Well, on the capital allocation more broadly, listen - I\u2019ve been pretty clear every call about we have a balanced approach, right? I know you guys cover a lot of companies that have different approaches. Our approach is balanced, and we believe that that balanced approach benefits the long term shareholder. One of the metrics that I believe, David, is a good measure of evaluating capital deployment effectiveness is ROIC, and if you look at ROIC over the last three years, we\u2019ve averaged around high teens, and that\u2019s on the higher end of the med tech peers that we often get compared to, so. We believe that ROIC is a good measure of how effectively we\u2019re deploying the capital, and we look at a balanced approach, so are there internal capital investments that drive future growth. We\u2019ve been talking about all these great opportunities we have, and we\u2019re funding them and they have great returns. Debt pay down - we don\u2019t have much this year, but we took care of some towers last year because we didn\u2019t want--we obviously didn\u2019t want to refinance them. Dividend and buybacks are--you know, the dividend is definitely core to our investment identity, and we intend to continue to grow our dividend, so that is a balanced approach. Even with all of that, we also, as you\u2019ve probably seen, we have opportunity from a balance sheet perspective to deploy that from an M&A perspective, and we\u2019ve been spending time talking about our strong top line and the pipeline that we\u2019ve developed, and that allows us to be a little bit more selective. You look at other transactions that happened and you have to ask, okay, what\u2019s the strategy behind that, and a lot of the time you can see you\u2019re having to sustain your growth rate, right? If you\u2019re in the business of driving top line through acquisitions, then you\u2019ve got to--you know, that\u2019s part of your model, you\u2019re going to have to keep doing that, whether the valuations are right or wrong, or not right. But we look at these strategic fit, can they generate an attractive return, can we make the business better that we\u2019re acquiring. We don\u2019t want to be just a holding, and I think that we\u2019ve shown that when we do, do our acquisitions, that\u2019s the framework, you know - fits in strategically, generates nice return, and we tend to operate them or add value to them than when they were a standalone, so. David Roman : Appreciate all the perspective, and thanks for taking the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good morning guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter here. Robert, one of the things that struck me when we spoke--I have two product-specific questions, when we last spoke is how you\u2019re looking at the sustainability of historically slower growing businesses and areas exposed to historically slower growing markets, so obviously I\u2019m thinking CRM. Can you talk a little bit about the strategy there - obviously Aveir is a big part of that, and just leadless pacing in general, and how sustainable--I mean, it\u2019s been, like, multiple quarters now of organic growth in the mid-plus single digit range, and then just one follow-up, another product question. Robert Ford : Yes, well that was part of our strategy as we looked at our med tech portfolio - you\u2019ve obviously got high growth drivers there with EDP, structural heart, diabetes care, neuro, heart failure, and we looked at CRM and vascular, and those are more flat businesses, so the combination of all that is you had a med tech portfolio that was growing 7%, 8%, maybe 9% a quarter there. To get to double digits, we needed those two businesses to get at least to mid single digits, right, and I\u2019d say on the CRM side, our strategy there was to really focus on Aveir leadless pacemakers. You know, there\u2019s a pipeline of products there - I don\u2019t want to tilt my hand here, but we didn\u2019t do Aveir DR and stop there. The team\u2019s gotten R&D programs to continue to advance those and even to look at the ICD market also and what are the opportunities that we can do to innovate. But there is space to innovate in that market, and that for me is important, is the diabetes market, you know, 15 years ago, people would say, gee, that\u2019s a slow growth market - well, now look at it, right? If you focus on innovation on meeting needs, unmet needs, you can turn a market around. From a vascular perspective, as I said in my comments, we\u2019re trying to--we\u2019ve been repositioning the portfolio to more higher growth areas, peripheral areas, endovascular areas, but we started that a little bit later than what we did in CRM, so I expect to start to see our vascular business start to also contribute to a higher growth rate, the same way that CRM is, and that just kind of bolsters our entire med tech portfolio and gets us into that 12%, 13% growth rate, at least that\u2019s our target. Danielle Antalffy : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then the follow-up question is on the structural heart side of things, and I know Amulet has been on the market for a little bit here, but my impression is that now it\u2019s kind of like Abbott is no longer fighting with one hand tied behind their back. Can you talk a little bit about that, and your 45% growth, I think you said in the quarter, where to from here for Amulet? Thanks so much for taking the questions. Robert Ford : Yes, so it was a great quarter. I think the team\u2019s kind of hitting its stride right now. As I\u2019ve said, our focus here was really to kind of drive adoption in the centers that we were at, versus expansion. The competitor has expanded the market - there is probably about 800 centers that are doing these implants, and we\u2019re probably in about half of it. Now, that\u2019s good, right - that provides a market expansion dynamic here in the U.S., but-. I mean, I\u2019m really encouraged by some of the data that I\u2019m seeing, and I think it starts with the data, right? You know, we had patient registry data come out where we showed that 95% closure rates were achieved post implant and sustained after 45 days, 90% of closure success rate using Amulet, for patients that actually fail to achieve proper closure rate with a competitive product, so I think that there\u2019s an opportunity here for our value proposition, and then we\u2019ve got to continue to invest. We are already investing on our next-generation Amulet, focusing on ease of use, focusing--and we\u2019ll maintain our superiority here that we believe we have regarding the ceiling of LEA. We\u2019re investing in clinical trials, obviously we\u2019ve been public about Catalyst, which is a trial that will compare Amulet to NOAC and to ablation treatment, so this is an exciting market for us and we will continue to invest in it, and ultimately it comes down to really looking at surrounding the electrophysiologist with the most comprehensive portfolio, whether it\u2019s on pacemakers and ICDs, structural heart interventions with stroke preventions, and then obviously ablations and AF treatment. At its highest level, that\u2019s the important side here, is Amulet fits an important role even though we report it as structural heart. It\u2019s really playing a role here to surround the physician, the EP with the tools they need to advance care. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you. Mike Comilla : Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hi Robert. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice sprint here. I wanted to touch on biosimilars - you know, you brought this up on the call. Can you elaborate on your strategy there? Are you planning to manufacture these products? Is Abbott going to be a CDMO in that space or do you plan to launch your own biosimilars, or is this more of Abbott being a distributor and taking advantage of your brand presence in emerging markets? What is Abbott\u2019s role in that place, and how do you size that market opportunity for Abbott? When should that start contributing to Abbott? Robert Ford : Sure. You know, this is one where I\u2019d say there\u2019s a couple phases to the strategy. The core premise of this, Vijay, is if you look at the emerging markets and the disease prevalence that exists in these emerging markets, they\u2019re no different than the disease prevalence in the U.S or Europe. You could look at some of them are higher, etc., but in general there\u2019s an opportunity to bring these biologics into the emerging market. For a variety of reasons, those markets have not been a priority for the originators. Their main focus has obviously been in the international developed markets - U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, etc., so this provides just a patient need opportunity that we want to size up. What we\u2019ve seen through some of our--you know, we have done some more regional biosimilar deals that we\u2019ve launched, and what we\u2019ve seen is that the growth of the molecule grows significantly once a biosimilar enters in terms of penetration into a patient population. It\u2019s a different dynamic in developed markets, as we know, but in emerging markets the category really expands, so what we wanted to do is to say, okay, before we start to think about manufacturing, before we start to think about that, we want to be able to understand what is the uptake of these products once you go ahead and put a concerted effort to developing these types of products in emerging markets. It fits right into our wheelhouse, where we\u2019ve got relationships with governments, we have relationships with physicians, and we\u2019ve got relationships with the distribution area. The question is how can you do it in--how can you execute that strategy that\u2019s capital efficient and doesn\u2019t erode gross margin of that business, and I give a lot of kudos to the team because they\u2019ve really been able to position our presence in these markets as an advantage to these players that really aren\u2019t focusing on emerging markets, they\u2019re focusing more on the opportunity that exists in developed markets, and now they can partner with one single company, reputable company to be able to use that capacity in other markets. I\u2019d say we\u2019re in the phase right now of, okay, is there sustainability to this, so the deals that we\u2019ve done give us access, our gross margin is not dilutive, and we\u2019re going to see how it goes. As you think about the ramp-up of what we\u2019ve got in the pipeline, we\u2019ll start launching in 2025, but you look at some of the big molecules that will come up for us \u201926,\u201927, that\u2019s I think when some of these very large oncology opportunities that we have will play a huge role for us and accelerate the growth there. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful. Maybe one last one on capital deployment. I know it\u2019s been asked - I\u2019m curious on share repurchases. You guys have done phenomenal growth. The street doesn\u2019t seem to be giving credit. Why not? You didn\u2019t see any share repurchase in the first half. Why is Abbott being conservative on share repurchases? Robert Ford : Yes, well we\u2019ve done a lot of share repurchases over the last couple of years, say catching up a little bit, to maybe not doing as much repurchasing after the two acquisitions we did in 2017 and 2018. If you look at our repurchases and dividends, it\u2019s been about $20 billion that we\u2019ve returned over the last four years, Vijay - $20 billion in dividends and buybacks, and that accounts for a good amount of our free cash flow over the last couple of years to our shareholders. We\u2019re not--the year\u2019s not over, and again we\u2019ll see opportunities. We\u2019ve got plenty of opportunities to be able to do that, so I\u2019d say I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good here at returning cash back to our shareholders over the last couple of years, and that commitment we\u2019ll maintain, so. Robert Ford : I\u2019ll just close here. This was a great quarter for us and, quite frankly, a great quarter in connection with five quarters before that, where we\u2019ve delivered above-market growth. I\u2019m really pleased with our continued strong performance. We\u2019ve raised our sales outlook, our EPS ranges for the second time this year. The toughest COVID test comps are now behind us, so I look forward to not having to--you know, we\u2019ll obviously report our COVID testing sales, but you\u2019ll start to see those comps start to dwindle away now, which means then that our EPS is back to growth. I think one of the questions there about showing our EPS exiting the year in high single digits, double-digit kind of range and getting back to our formula, that\u2019s what we\u2019re interested in, and we\u2019ve got a lot of positive momentum here heading into the second half of the year. With that, we\u2019ll wrap up, and thank you for joining us. Mike Comilla : Thank you Operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 :00 am Central time today on Abbott\u2019s Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mike Comilla : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Boudreau, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today, we reported organic sales growth of more than 8%, excluding COVID testing sales and adjusted earnings per share of $1.21. In addition to delivering another quarter of strong financial performance, we accomplished several key objectives this quarter, which included entering new strategic partnerships, launching new products and making several key advancements in our R&D pipeline. And I'll elaborate further on these accomplishments when discussing the performance of our businesses and summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 3.5% in the quarter. Growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in the U.S., and this included growth of 12% in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition driven by market share gains in the infant formula business and growth of 11.5% in U.S. Adult Nutrition led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. As the market leader in adult nutrition, we continue to expand our portfolio to meet the growing global demand for products that offer a combination of high protein, low sugar to help people optimize their health and wellness. Moving to Diagnostics. Our sales in Core Laboratory Diagnostics increased 4.5% excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in Core Lab was driven by global demand for routine diagnostic testing and continued adoption of our market-leading diagnostic systems and testing platforms, including recent large account wins that will help continue to sustain our growth into 2025. In our rapid and point-of-care diagnostics businesses, we continue to expand our test menus and capitalize on the growing demand for respiratory tests that can be performed at home or in more traditional health care settings. In September, we announced an exciting new partnership with the Big Ten conference to help boost the U.S. blood supply through a blood donation competition. Students, alumni and fans can donate blood for any of the 18 member universities at blood centers located across the country. And our goal with this competition is to help rebuild the nation's blood supply which is currently at an extremely low level, while also helping to create a new generation of blood donors. Turning to EPE, where sales increased 7% in the quarter. Growth was well balanced across the markets and therapeutic areas in which we participate. Our performance this quarter was driven by double-digit growth in several countries across Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, where our broad product portfolios focused on addressing local market needs continues to enhance our unique position in these markets. From a portfolio perspective, we continue to deliver broad-based growth across our key therapeutic areas of focus, including strong growth in the quarter. in the areas of gastroenterology, cardiometabolic, central nervous system and pain management. We also achieved several milestones this quarter as it relates to advancing our portfolio of biosimilars, which we built and continue to expand through collaboration agreements. The first of these biosimilars is on track to launch in emerging markets in late 2025. And I'll wrap up with our med tech portfolio, where sales grew more than 13%. In Diabetes Care, sales of continuous glucose monitors exceeded $1.6 billion in the quarter and grew 21%. In August, we announced that we had entered into a unique global partnership with Medtronic to connect Abbott's world-leading FreeStyle Libre CGM sensor with their automated insulin delivery systems. Abbott now has partnerships with five of the largest companies that offer automated insulin dosing pumps, allowing more people around the world to benefit from the connectivity with the Libre technology. In September, we announced the U.S. launch of Lingo, our new glucose monitoring sensor available for purchase without a prescription, the Lingo wearable sensor and app track real-time glucose data and provide personal insights in coaching based on your body's reaction to nutrition exercise and other lifestyle choices to help create healthier habits and improve overall well-being. In Electrophysiology, growth of 14% was driven by double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international markets and similar to previous quarters, the growth was broad-based across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in catheters and cardiac mapping related products. We also achieved several important milestones as it relates to our electrophysiology new product pipeline, and this includes completing enrollment ahead of schedule in our VOLT-AF U.S. IDE trial and after we complete the required patient follow-up phase, we expect to file for FDA approval next year. Earlier this month, we announced that we began enrolling patients in our focal FLEX clinical trial designed to assess our new TactiFlex DUO catheter, which offers physicians the option of using PFA and radio frequency energy to treat atrial fibrillation. And finally, we received FDA approval and launched our new adviser HD Grid X mapping catheter, which further enhances the cardiac mapping process when using PFA or RF ablation catheters to treat AFib. In Structural Heart, growth of more than 16% was driven by growth across our market-leading comprehensive portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions and transcatheter repair and replacement products. This quarter, we continue to capture market share in TAVR and saw accelerating adoption of Amulet and TriClip, which we launched in the U.S. earlier this year. And earlier this month, CMS began the process of evaluating TriClip for a national coverage determination, which, if approved, would help expand the addressable market through broader access in the U.S. for this first of its kind technology. In Ribbon Management, growth of 7% was led by Aveir, our highly innovative leadless pacemaker, and Assert our newest implantable cardiac monitor, which launched in the U.S. last year. In Heart Failure, growth of 14% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart assist devices, which offer treatment for chronic and temporary conditions. In Vascular, growth of 5% was led by double-digit growth in vessel closure and coronary imaging, along with Esprit our below-the-knee resorbable stent that launched in the U.S. in the second quarter. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew 5%, driven by strong demand in international markets for our rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device. So, in summary, we delivered another quarter of strong top line growth with sales growth with sales growing more than 8%. We continue to make good progress expanding our gross margin profile and remain on track to improve our profile by 75 basis points on a full year basis compared to last year. And as you saw, we achieved several important new product pipe loan milestones this quarter, and we're well positioned for a strong finish to the year and have great momentum heading into 2025. And I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil Boudreau : Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our third quarter results. Sales increased 7.6% on an organic basis and increased 8.2% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar weaken versus several currencies, which resulted in a favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our call in July. Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.3% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 27.2% of sales in the third quarter. Lastly, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.31 to $1.37, and based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of less than 1% on fourth quarter reported sales. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Travis Steed : In Q3 devices were really strong, but Nutrition and Diagnostics came in below expectations, but you still maintain the full year guidance, which is implying a step up of 9.5 or more growth in Q4. So, I just want to understand what happened in those divisions in Q3? And what's giving you the confidence to still reiterate the full year revenue guidance? Robert Ford : Sure, Travis. Listen, we got multiple business units here. I think, by my count, it's close to like 17. We always want all 17 to beat and top your estimates here. The reality is sometimes some of them fall short. And then the question is, is there something more long term? Is it more of kind of a onetime kind of challenge? I'd put that more in the second bucket over here. I think one of the benefits that we do have in having a broad diversified portfolio is that when you do have situations like that, Travis, other businesses can overperform and kind of make up for that. And I think that's what you saw in this quarter. I mean, you opened your question with devices did really good, and that's what helped us deliver on our quarter. And as you look forward to Q4, yes, we do have still very high confidence in the businesses, if I was at all concerned about it, I wouldn't have raised our guidance now for the third time this year. So yes, we're still very confident in both the EPS forecast that we've got. I think this is a great quarter now as we're into Q4 and there's less COVID comps, we'll see our EPS grow double digits back to the growth model that we had during pre-COVID. And yes, revenue at that 9.5% to 10% still feel very good about that. The issues that you raised there are kind of onetime in nature. On nutrition, the entire business did really well with the exception of our international pediatric business. U.S. was up 12%; pediatric, U.S. adult was up almost 12%; international adult was up high single digits. So, what ended up happening there is we saw some softness in the beginning of the quarter in some of our international markets for pediatric team quickly determined that it wasn't market. It was actually us and it was our commercial execution or lack thereof that was leading to some share loss. So, team took action pretty quickly in the quarter. We made some personnel changes, we calibrated our demand generation and what ends up happening in the quarter there as a result of that share loss is we didn't want to build excess inventory, so we shorted our sales to the distributors just to align that. But I feel good about what the team has put together. Early indications show that, that was the right move to do, and we've seen good progress there. So yes, disappointed, but the team knows that, and they acted quickly. So, I expect to see international pediatric and overall nutrition growth step up in the quarter. It doesn't change my thinking about nutrition for the quarter or for next year, for the long-term aspect of it, just something that we had to address. And then I think you mentioned Core Lab also came a little bit shorter than expectations. I'd say there, really, the driver of that was just the VBP implementation in China. If you look at our Core Lab business, our International Core Lab business, excluding China, the international business was up double digits. So, the teams in those markets are doing really well. And I'd mentioned this in January, we were going to see the VBP impact the Core Lab business. We had originally forecasted in April, it got delayed and pushed out to Q3. If you look at our growth rate in the first half of this year, it was over 7%. And some of that favorability that we saw in the business and that we rolled into higher guidance as a result of a little bit of that delay here. So, we'll go through the VBP transition. We've done it in a lot of our businesses. There's the pricing impact going forward, there's some transition-related items that happen, whether you're making pricing accommodations for the inventory that's already in the channel, et cetera. So I still feel very good about the business we've got there. I feel good about China continues to be a very attractive market for us. So we'll just work our way through this. But to your question on the quarter, yes, we feel good about the quarter. I wouldn't have kept the guidance if we didn't. We've got great momentum in the business. We're meeting with the management team yesterday. They're very committed and feel good about the momentum. So, I think we'll have a very good year with a good strong close in Q4. Operator : And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Larry Biegelsen : Robert, I wanted to ask about Libre and just big picture. You had 21% growth in Libre in Q3, which was good, but your competitors obviously having some issues. So, it would be helpful to hear your view of the state of the CGM market, talk about your confidence in the overall CGM market outlook and your goal of $10 billion in sales by 2028. And maybe just give us some color on what you're seeing so far with Lingo? Robert Ford : Yes, sure. Larry, I've always been very bullish about this market and talk about this market a little bit differently than when we talk about general med tech markets, right? This is a mass market opportunity that we have. And yes, we grew 21%. U.S. was actually up 26%, and we feel good about the market. The fundamentals are still very much there and they're still very much intact. This is -- you've got about 10 million CGM users globally, I think, right now. And you got over 100 million diabetics in the developed world, over 0.5 billion globally. So yes, I think this is a market that's got mass market potential to it. As long as you stay ahead from a technology perspective, as long as you stay ahead from a scale perspective, as long as you stay ahead from a cost perspective, for me, those are the three elements here that allow us and have guided our strategy from day one. And I don't think that you're going to have some changes in the market when you've got a market that's, whatever, $12 billion, $13 billion, growing 15%. There'll be more players for sure, there'll be more competition for sure. But we feel good about our position and the strategy that we've built. We've thought about this not just for the next year, we've been thinking about this, what is it going to look like a decade from now and how we built our portfolio and our position. So, I feel very good about this market. And I don't think there's anything fundamentally here that's significantly changed, at least from our internal way of thinking about it. So yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us. Libre is -- it will be a $6 billion-plus product. It will grow 20% this year. When we put out the $10 billion target, Larry, we talked about a compound annual growth rate of 15%. So, we're ahead of that, and we're going to work hard to make sure that we stay ahead of that, and we continue to gain share. We'll add $1 billion of revenue this year, add 1 million users. You got opportunities in type 1s on the pump side, on the connectivity side with pens. You've got opportunities with type 2s and basal. I mean I think that's just really still so much opportunity in those markets. So I feel very good about it. And as we've talked about Libre, we always viewed it as a platform. So you mentioned Lingo, glad to see that launch. Just as a reminder, we're really focusing on a very different population with this technology, right? We're targeting people that don't have diabetes. So it's a little bit of a different kind of business model, sale model. But so far, we've seen really, really good early interest. Great, great feedback from the users so far. The app, the data, the website, the Hello Lingo website, the delivery, the whole nonprescription stuff. That's working out very well. The 2 sensor pack is the most popular version right now. And I think that's a good -- it's a great way to start. I was looking at some of the initial reorder rates that came in last night. And wow, was I surprised at really, really much higher reorder rates than what we saw in the U.K., and I thought that I think the team did a really good job at adapting some of the learnings from the U.K. into that. So, I think overall, over time, this is going to be a great opportunity to be able to add to that $10 billion target as we build this user base out. So overall, back to your question on Libre, I feel very good about our position, what we're doing, and Lingo is off to a very good start. Operator : And our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Robbie Marcus : Congrats on a nice quarter. Robert, I wanted to ask this time of the year, we all -- we're looking for fourth quarter, but we're also turning our focus to 2025. I see The Street sitting at about 7% on the top line, 10% on the bottom line. I wanted to see if you had any comments about how you feel about that or your view into next year, realizing it's still on the early side? Robert Ford : Yes. It's a little early to give real specific guidance there, Robbie. But similar to you, we're also looking at '25, we've been looking at '25 also as part of our strategic planning process here, too. So yes, this is the time of the season, right? I'd say, yes, similar to last year, I look at the analyst estimates going into 2025, high single-digit growth, 10% EPS. And like I said last year, that feels like a very reasonable starting point. I think the difference going into 2025 versus when we were coming into 2024 is, as we go into 2025, one of the things that we don't have is what I would call kind of like the COVID cloud at least for a couple of the quarters ahead of us. And that kind of masked a little bit of our underlying kind of base EPS kind of business growth. So, I am looking forward to, in a way, not having that be kind of this kind of comp issue. But I think the high single-digit, 10% EPS, yes, that sounds like a very kind of, I'd say, a reasonable starting point. But if I take a step back also, I look at that and say, okay, here we have a company that's $40 billion in revenue, and we've been driving high single to high single-digit top line growth. I think that's pretty unique for us. And I think one of the reasons that is a combination of two factors. First of all, the markets that we're participating, they're very attractive, Robbie, whether it's their size, their growth outlook, whether their alignment to favorable demographic trends, the positions we have in them, and there's a couple of different types of markets that we're in, right? Markets that are probably a little bit lower from a growth rate perspective, but we've got tremendous scale, tremendous positions in them and that scale and that position disproportionate us and they provide great financial stability to our business. We've got other markets that are very exciting, high-growth markets that our goal there is to enter and capture share, whether it's TAVR or LAA, new diagnostic systems that we'll be launching and then other markets we're building right? And we're building them and creating them with first-of-their-kind types of products, whether it's Lingo that we talked about, TBI testing, leadless, biosimilars in emerging markets, so it's a nice collection of markets that really allow us to set these high single-digit target growth rates for us. And then the other part is pipeline, which is fundamental, right? And I think it's been highly productive. Recently launched products this year are going to contribute about $1 billion of revenue this year, and that's double to what it was in 2023. And I expect that to be the case again next year, right? So, I think it starts at the top line. We've made a lot of effort right now in expanding gross margin and delivering. That was a topic that we talked about last year, expanding margins and gross margin is a key focus of ours. But I also think we've been a pretty proficient allocator of investment. We've invested -- we've done increasing investments in areas that are -- we know are high-growth areas, and we've still been able to generate over $1 billion of spending leverage over the last five years. So, I'd say as we go down the P&L, I think that's another opportunity for us as we go down into 2025 is our discipline in terms of how we make the investments and our focus on gross margin. So, I think the combination of that will allow us to have that op margin expansion. And the balance sheet is in a great year -- sorry, balance sheet is in a great shape here. So, I think we've got all the elements that we need to go into 2025 with great momentum, markets, positions and financial flexibility there. Operator : Our next question will come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. David Roman : Robert, maybe if I could push a little bit more on the investment spending and help us think a little bit about the shape of the P&L on a go-forward basis. During the quarter, you did accelerate R&D and SG&A spending on a year-over-year growth basis. And maybe you could help us think through where are some of those incremental dollars going? How should we think about the trajectory of operating expenses in the context of gross margin expansion? And then with the announced share repurchase program, should we think about that as an effort to keep the share count flat or a view that this is an opportunity to return incremental capital to shareholders and reduce the share count? Robert Ford : Sure. Yes, I guess, on the investment side, if you look at what we've done with our expenses here, they've gone from 37% in 2019, down to about 34% this year. So that's where that $1 billion of spending leverage comes, right? If you look at our five-year CAGR, it's high single digits and our operating expense CAGR is about 4%. But it's not a cookie-cutter approach, David. We look at the businesses and look at their opportunities and make those decisions. R&D investments, they're a little bit more-longer term, right? So, once you commit to R&D programs, they tend to be a little bit more-longer term than making some SG&A decisions, where you could toggle up and down a little bit easier. But I mean, I think you could see where some of the growth is coming from, and that's being supported by those investments. Obviously, our med tech portfolio has been getting investments, I'd say, in EP, in structural heart, in diabetes care, in neuromodulation. I mean, all of the businesses, they come with a strategic plan and we look at where it makes more sense, whether it's to put more, more investment in the field with sales force and clinical people, whether it's to make the investment in a clinical trial, so we tend to have a pretty good process about how to do that. We've been making investments in diagnostics, soon we'll probably be talking about a new system that we're going to be launching for a whole new segment of the diagnostic industry. That's a longer-term program that's been a couple of years. So I think we've got a good process about how to make the investments knowing that R&D investments are a little bit more longer than SG&A. So -- and I think that's what we've been able to show. And I think that's one of the reasons we've been able to get to our op margin profile to pre-pandemic levels, which I'm not sure a lot of companies would be able to kind of say that. So -- but we haven't driven our op margin by expenses. I mean we've been driving our top line pretty effectively, too. So I think that's probably the best proof point that we know how to do this allocation and the cycles of the allocation, et cetera. And then I think you had a question regarding share count and buybacks. Listen, we -- as I've said, we've got a pretty balanced approach about how we allocate our capital. I've talked about the importance of the dividend and supporting that growing dividend and we'll continue to do that. The buybacks is just another element in that capital allocation strategy. We just announced that the Board recently approved a new $7 billion buyback program. The previous one that we had approved in 2021 was running down, and we thought it was a good time to put that in place. We've deployed around $8 billion towards buyback over the last five years. We took a little bit of a step up during a couple of years after the acquisitions that we did, we'd stepped that down a little bit. So we've stepped that up. Q3, we did about $750 million. I thought given our strong performance outlook here that we saw a disconnect between what we were doing in our PE ratio, and in fact, I still do. So it made sense to buy shares, and the buyback announcement is just part of our balanced approach to allocating capital, and we've got that authorization set. So if we feel that there is a disconnect going forward, we've got that opportunity to try and correct that. So -- and if that reduces the share count, yes, then it will reduce the share count. But we're not trying to drive our EPS through a lower share count. We're trying to drive our EPS through top line growth, David. Operator : Our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is open. Joshua Jennings : Robert, I wanted to ask about just structural heart markets. The TAVR market slowing down or decelerating, there's been some investor concerns about U.S. provider capacity and whether there's a bottleneck. I think Abbott is uniquely positioned because you do have offerings in transcatheter aortic, mitral and tricuspid solutions and left atrial appendage occlusion. We've got interventional heart failure interventions coming down the pike. Are you seeing any capacity constraints limiting growth? You had a strong structural heart quarter this in 3Q? Or are you concerned about that? Is that on the horizon or should we just think that hospitals are seeing this growth opportunity as well and building out capacity, adding cath labs, hybrid ORs, et cetera? I'd love to get your view on the current situation and whether you're worried in the next 12, 24, 36 months that we could run into a bottleneck in the U.S.? Robert Ford : Not seeing the bottleneck, not forecasting bottleneck, not concerned about the capacity here. Obviously, this is a this is a very growing area not only for those that are developing the technologies, but also for the health care systems that are delivering them and deploying them. I've been to some large centers over the quarter. I've been through some smaller centers over the quarter. There's always challenges, but I put it as a challenge, not specific to a given technology or challenges just whether it's ramping up a new technology, getting more people to train. So -- but I'm not hearing that the centers that we've been working with that capacity is a big rate-limiting factor today. I think if it started to become one and the demand is there, I think history has shown that make the right investments, the investments will be made to accommodate that demand. So -- I mean, this is obviously what's happened in structural heart over the last decade, investments will be made to accommodate that demand. So I'm not hearing that, and we continue to be very excited about the prospects that we had in our structural heart portfolio. I think the team has kind of hit its stride right now. We've got new management, new products launching and I'm very optimistic right now with what the teams are putting together across the entire portfolio. I think like you said, we're one of the few companies here that we can see the full spectrum, right, from -- all the way from surgical, structural interventions, all the occlusion and appendages and then looking at being able to see mitral, tricuspid, aortic, whether it's repair, whether it's replacement, I think the team is hitting its stride right now. And our focus here is going to be on both sides, making the investments on the R&D side. I think we've got a lot of new product investment in structural heart, new clinical trials, new indications, investments over there. And I think the different part of our investment profile, and we've been doing that for many years in mitral -- in structural heart, and I think that's why we have the portfolio we have. I think the piece that we're adding on now is like, okay, we've got the products, now we've got to increase our field presence to support either the market share gain that we aspire to or to support these growing new fields, whether it's tricuspid. So, our focus now is really to start to add more on the field side in these businesses to be able to kind of support that growth. But no, I think this is a tremendous area of growth of opportunity of underpenetration, of R&D, of clinical work. So, we're really excited about it. Operator : Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : I had one on, I guess, NEC infant formula. The FDA, CDC and NIH have put out a joint statement. It's a pretty strong statement saying noting that there's perhaps no causative relationship between infant formula and NEC. So, I guess my question is, how does this change Abbott's position in these lawsuits? Does it matter? What else can we expect from the government? Could we expect more announcements similar to this? What shape or form could it be? What can Abbott to do to perhaps ring-fence liabilities related to these cases? Robert Ford : Yes, sure. Well, listen, as it relates to our position, it's great to see the statement, and I agree with you, I think it was a very strong statement. It doesn't change what I have been saying, which is and the statement seems to be aligned and support what I hear from the market and what I hear from neonatologists, which is these products are they're medically necessary, they are considered the standard of care, and they're valuable tools. They're valuable tools for the neonatologists in their decisions, in their decisions and their discussions with parents and how to feed premature. And the labels, which is a component in all of this, they've been reviewed by the regulators and never call for net warning. So -- this is a consensus statement made by these three agencies, three regulators here in the U.S. and they're basically -- Vijay, they're actually endorsing an expert panel with dozens of researchers that were conveyed by the secretary of HHS, and I think the researchers issued a 100-page document-or-so. I think they looked at thousands of publications. I think it was 600-specific to the relationship between NEC and feeding. And in that joint statement, the agencies, they reiterated the importance of preterm formula as the standard of care. And they also clearly state there's no conclusive evidence that the formula causes NEC. So, I think this is only one of a handful of times where the three agencies, the most prominent and significant health agencies and regulators in the U.S. have come together and put out a joint statement. Obviously, we saw that during the COVID pandemic. But I think before that, I think it was during the HIV pandemic. So I think the statement says a lot, Vijay. At this point, though, at this point, the judge in our trial right now has not allowed the joint statement or the underlying report to be entered into evidence. I don't know the reasons there, but I think it would be -- we believe that it's the joint statement, the report, the expert testimony, I think those are important pieces of information for a jury to consider as they're making their decisions. So, I don't know how to cap that, but I would say beyond this case and as the cases move to more of the federal side, my expectation here is that the juries in these cases would be allowed to consider the criticality of that important evidence. So, to your question on the liability portion and kind of what to do? If I take a step back on this one, I've been thinking about this quite a bit. But as health care innovators, we develop health care products based on problems that we see. We run the clinical trials. We gather the data. We review the data with the regulators. You guys know this process pretty well. And ultimately, the regulator decides if the products are safe and they're fit for purpose and they decide how they got to be labeled. And that's the country, that's the market that I want to be in, where the products, the labels, they're evaluated through a well-established regulatory process by expert regulators that have unfettered access to the best scientific evidence rather than trying to do this, regulate products through uncertainty and unpredictive jury trials. So ultimately, to your question, if the regulatory process is disregarded, if the science is disregarded, it's going to be very difficult for any company to remain on the market with these products. Taking on that indefinite liability here, at least in the United States, that would be an issue that the United States would confront. It wouldn't be an issue for premature babies in international countries because this issue -- this is not an issue and the products are still available there. So yes, I do think there needs to be some fortitude here by those that can make decisions, prioritize the babies, prioritize preterm babies all 370,000 every single year that rely on these products. Over those that seem to kind of distort and abuse this tort system that we have in our country here for financial gains. I'm hoping it doesn't come to that. But I've been pretty clear that this is -- we stand behind the products, but if the process won't be -- is going to be disregarded then this is something that we will not continue adding to the liability here. So, there's a playbook it seems for these things to happen. You take a decade, 10-plus years to litigate this and come to some resolution. I don't intend to follow that playbook. And I intend to resolve this faster. And yes, there are different ways to resolve this and different ways to look at this. And we are having conversations at all levels to be able to express the concern that this could cause to families here in the United States. Operator : Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Congratulations on earlier-than-expected completion of enrollment in your PFA catheter clinical trial. But I would really love to get your view on the state of the electrophysiology market. What you're seeing in terms of PFA uptake and how that is impacting your mapping and navigation systems? Robert Ford : Sure, Joanne. I mean I think this quarter was a continuation of the trend that we've been seeing since the arrival of PFA. We're growing a little bit lower than the market. The market has kind of grown pretty significantly here. But if you look at our growth rate, prior to PFA, we're actually growing faster now with PFA. And I think there's a couple of factors there. I think you mentioned one of those, which is cardiac mapping. Right now, we're seeing about 90-plus percent of the cases, at least here in the U.S., being masked. If you look at where we were before, Joanne, we were mapping about maybe between 25% and 30% of RF cases, we're now mapping 50-plus. So that is a little bit of a tailwind for us. We're seeing a pretty strong growth in procedures. So -- and I think that's probably what's helped drive some of the market growth that we're seeing. But I also think that the volume increase is actually due to improved treatment guidelines that we're seeing and quite frankly, new technologies that are helping to identify AFib patients, too. So, I think it's a combination of factors there that are helping to drive more producers. And then for us, the RF portion of it is still a growth piece for us. As I said in my comments, we grew ablation catheters double digits, too. So, we're seeing about 20% of the PFA cases, at least the ones that we're mapping, use RF catheters and we're in those cases. So, I think the key thing here is just to at least right now, PFA is really being used for de novo procedures, right? So, if you kind of break that out, it's about of all ablation procedures are de novo. The other two-thiirds are VT ablation, SVT ablation, redos. And in those cases, they're using -- we're still using RF and RF plays an important role there, which is why we've initiated our focal FLEX trial to be able to have the optionality, to be able to toggle between PFA and RF. So, we still think that's an important part there. So -- but I think the team has done a really good job here at leveraging our open mapping system I made comments, we used the open mapping system as a design input for R&D programs to start off with. And now that open system is allowing us to be in more cases and partner more with the electrophysiologists. So I think that is -- that's what we're seeing, and we're very committed to be able to bring PFA to the market. We've completed the enrollment, like you said. And we completed the CE Mark enrollment beginning of this year. So we're committed to the space, but we do feel that it's a full portfolio approach. You need good mapping which is why we invested in our next-generation HD grid. You need to have a PFA portfolio that's pretty complete. You need to have RF, and I think that's what the team has been building, I'd say, very, very successfully. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is open. Matt Miksic : I'd a follow-up on Libre in the diabetes business. And just a couple of topics that come up quite a bit, the last few months around the market and competition. The first being kind of anything you can comment on regarding your share trends, in particular, in the DME channel, anything you're doing there differently, did differently, what you're seeing as a user of Lingo for the last couple of months, I complemented the team on putting together a great product. Question, just curious about the timing and the plan for Rio and thoughts on potential reimbursement for that certain non-insulin intensive type 2 community. And then lastly, just zooming out for a sec and getting back to your comments and plans for gross margin, how -- if you could to scale the expansion into OTC of Libre in this platform kind of plays a role in hitting your '24 gross margin plans and your plans for expansion going forward as you scale this business? Robert Ford : You lined up a lot there, Matt. I'm going to make sure that Mike here helps me stay with all the questions that you laid out there. I mean I think regarding your Libre question on competitiveness, yes, I think the team has done a really good job here in the U.S., not just in the DME channel but at the endo's offices, at the primary care channel, with the basal population. I think it's kind of an all-out all-channel, real strong execution there. U.S., we grew 26% in the U.S. this quarter. And that was having some of the challenges we had there regarding some kind of temporary supply challenges with Libre 3. So, we haven't really unleashed Libre 3 fully yet, and a lot of the share gains that we're getting are with Libre 2. But that piece is behind us. We invested in a new manufacturing line. We have a new manufacturing, a whole brand-new manufacturing facility come up and towards the end of the year. So that will -- as we go into next year, that will all be kind of behind us. So, I think our position here in the U.S. and globally, quite frankly, is strengthened by the product portfolio, the cost position that we had. You're mentioning gross margins in Libre. That's a key aspect here. We've always talked about. You got to have cost leadership here because as the market expands to basal and oral meds, GLP-1 users. And as that population grows, you're going to have a much larger TAM to operate in. But yes, you are going to see -- you're going to have to make some pricing adjustments to be able to get that reimbursement, so you got to have your cost structure in place to be able to benefit, have the top line growth and not have that come at the expense of gross margin. And our gross margins, as we've grown Libre, have actually expanded. As our manufacturing scale continues to ramp up, some of the costs associated with these products, because there's a lot of automation, we've been doing this from day one, some of the costs are depreciation in the equipment. So as a lot of our facilities are running through their depreciation schedules, those will help our gross margins, too. So I feel good about our opportunity to drive the market, to be competitive, to lead in technology, to lead in scale and cost and take advantage of what we believe is a mass market opportunity for us. I think you had a question on Rio. Listen, the initial focus is on Lingo right now. We've got that -- think of Rio as another arrow here in the quiver that we can pull out if we need to ahead of schedule. We do have a schedule. I'm not going to lay out what that schedule is, but for some reason we need to do that, we'll be able to do that. But the focus is on Lingo right now, and we've got a nice opportunity here to build a completely new segment of biowearables with consumers. So... Operator : And our last question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open. Danielle Antalffy : Congrats on a really good quarter here. I just wanted to follow up on the structural heart component of the business. Robert, you talked about this earlier in response to Josh's question. But just digging a little bit deeper, as we look into 2025, I mean, you've got potential indication expansion for LAA closure, but you do have some competitive data coming on the tricuspid side of things at TCP and whether or not that chose a mortality benefit. So just curious about how you think about those two markets specifically and sustainable growth in those franchises, there are some puts and takes there. So, I just wanted to get your sense of how to think about that as we head into next year? Robert Ford : Sure. Just to remind me again there, Danielle, tricuspid and what was the other one? Danielle Antalffy : Sorry, left aerial appendage closure... Robert Ford : Yes. Okay. Good. Yes, these are great areas of investment for us. And the investment of money, time, effort, thinking, power, all of that. So, I think, as I said on business hitting its stride, I definitely would say that about the Amulet team. They're definitely hitting their stride. We saw nice growth this quarter, 25% globally, 40% growth in the U.S. here. So -- and we're making the investments. I mean, I think you saw our registry data shows a really good positive results from Amulet, 95% of the closure rates achieved and sustained after 45 days, I think that's pretty good. 90% closure rate when using Amulet for those that have failed proper closure with the competitor product. So -- but we're investing in there. We've got our CATALYST trial that's looking at comparing Amulet to anticoagulants for people that have a risk of AFib, expect to complete that trial next year. And then the team has been working on Amulet 2.0. And I expect that we will be beginning or entering the trial in that business with that product towards the end of this year. So really nice progress on the appendage side, whether -- and quite frankly, PFO, too, is doing really well, and that's a great growth driver for us, too. On the tricuspid side, yes, there's going to be a lot of data coming out over the next 12, 24 months. I expect that. I think with any new category here, Danielle, you're going to have to make the investments. I mean nobody was doing anything from an interventional perspective on the tricuspid, right? So as companies are developing technologies, I think you are going to see a lot of clinical readouts and clinical data more to be able to kind of support the use of these technologies. I think we saw one recently at ESC specifically to TriClip, a European study, and this is the second RCT that's basically confirming what the TRILUMINATE RCTs showed, which is much superior to medical therapy and extremely effective at reducing TR. So, I think that's an area of investment for us. Without a doubt, I think that there's an opportunity here that the team's been working on regarding our full portfolio approach with our structural products, and I think TriClip plays an important role there. We're excited about the NCD that was opened and looking forward to that, so that's another opportunity for us in 2025. But quite frankly, I just think there's a great opportunity here with our team. We've got, I would say, some built-in advantages as it comes to the TriClip product. We've got manufacturing scale, the sales force and all of that. And there's definitely demand and we're seeing that and the launch is going very well. So, I think that, yes, you're going to see more data, and that's good, and it's a growth opportunity for us. I think this is a $1 billion business for us here over time. But you're going to have to make the investments on the clinical side to be able to kind of support the adoption of it. So very excited about structural heart overall. And ultimately excited about the entire company and business. We've had -- yes, I'm really pleased with the performance of the first three quarters. We're on track to finish the year at the high end of the initial guidance that we provided back in January. Sales growth has been strong. Gross margin profile continues to expand. EPS growth is now accelerating throughout the year as we were lapping some of those COVID comps. The pipeline is richer than ever. So, I think we've got great momentum heading into next year. And with that, I'm going to wrap up and thank all of you for joining us. Mike Comilla : Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mike Comilla : Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Boudreau, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we\u2019ll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2025. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2023. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the related GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis, for the non-GAAP financial measures for which the company is providing guidance because the company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort, the timing and impact of certain items, which could significantly impact Abbott's results in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. Robert Ford : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. First, I want to express gratitude to my Abbott colleagues around the world whose hard work and passion with the driving forces of Abbott's continued success. Abbott's commitment to innovation, operational excellence and serving the needs of our customers resulted in another year of exceptional performance, which included achieving sales growth of 9.5% excluded COVID testing, delivering 70 basis points of gross margin profile improvement, driving acceleration in the growth of our earnings per share throughout the year and developing and advancing new products through our rich pipeline. The strong performance resulted in generating $8.5 billion of operating cash flow, which was used to reinvest in the business, fund capacity expansions, repay debt and returned $5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. These accomplishments played a key role in continuing our well-established track record for delivering on our financial commitments, which included achieving results that finished at the high end of our initial guidance ranges we provided for 2024. These results included exiting the year with a very strong momentum as fourth quarter sales grew 10%, excluding COVID testing sales, and adjusted earnings per share increased 13% versus the prior year. For 2025, we're well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 8.5% and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.05 to $5.25, which reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint. I'll now summarize our fourth quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with Nutrition. Our sales increased 7% in the quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in adult nutrition, led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. We achieved a significant milestone last year with annual sales of Ensure surpassing $3 billion. This achievement helped deliver another year of strong performance in adult nutrition, with annual sales of adult nutrition products growing 9% last year. This strong performance is a continuation of a well-established trend, the five year compound annual growth rate in adult nutrition is 9%, which reflects the impact of our well-known and respected brands, favorable demographic trends, the significant investments we've made to expand manufacturing capacity to serve the growing global demand for our products. Moving to Diagnostics, where sales increased 6%, excluded COVID testing sales. Growth in the quarter was led by rapid diagnostics where excluded COVID testing sales increased 16% in the quarter. This was driven by strong demand for our portfolio of respiratory disease tests used to help diagnose influenza, strep throat and RSV. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, growth of 4% was driven by continued strong demand for our market-leading immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening testing panels. Excluding the impact of challenging market dynamics in China, the combined growth in all other markets was double digits in the quarter. Turning to EPD, where sales increased 8.5% in the quarter. Growth was well balanced across markets and therapeutic areas that we participate in, including gastroenterology, women's health, CNS and pain management. EPD also delivered broad-based growth across the markets we serve, including double-digit growth in several countries across Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. By focusing on the therapies most needed in these faster-growing markets, we continue to sustain our long track record of delivering strong growth, which includes a five-year compound annual growth rate for EPD of 8%. And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 14%. In Diabetes Care, sales of continuous glucose monitors were $1.8 billion in the quarter and grew 23%. For the full year 2024, sales of continuous glucose monitors were approximately $6.5 billion and grew 22%. This included growth of 27% in the U.S. where our market share on a revenue basis has increased by more than 10 share points over the last three years. In electrophysiology, growth of 9% was well balanced across the U.S. and international markets. As expected, growth in the quarter was impacted by a challenging comparison versus the prior year where we saw a sharp increase in demand for our EnSite cardiac mapping systems as customers prepared for the launch of PFA catheters. Excluding the impact of this prior year comparison dynamic, growth would have been double digits globally in the U.S. and internationally. In Structural Heart, growth of 23% was driven by strong performance across our market-leading portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions and transcatheter repair and replacement products. Structural Heart represents one of the most attractive areas in the field of medical technologies. It is an area that we have invested in heavily, and we're seeing those investments yield outstanding results. Our comprehensive portfolio of products drove an acceleration in sales growth in Structural Heart throughout the year. In Rhythm Management, growth of 7% was led by AVEIR, our innovative leadless pacemaker and Assert, our newest implantable cardiac monitor, which we launched in the U.S. last year. With growth of 7% for the full year, our Rhythm Management business delivered another year of performance that far exceeded the market, and we expect that to continue this year. Last month, we announced that we completed the first-in-human implant of a new version of AVEIR specifically designed to deliver pacing to the left bundle branch area of the heart, activating the heart's natural conduction system. This highly innovative device currently in development was granted breakthrough designation by the FDA. In Heart Failure, growth of 9.5% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart-assist devices, which offer treatment for chronic and temporary conditions. In Vascular, growth of 7% was led by double-digit growth in vessel closure products and growth from Esprit are below-the-knee resorbable stent. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew 8%, driven by strong demand in international markets for our Eterna rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device. So in summary, we delivered another quarter of strong growth, with sales growing 10% and earnings per share growing 13%. For the year, we achieved the upper end of the initial guidance ranges we provided for 2024. We made great progress expanding our gross margin profile, and we expect that progress to continue into 2025. The pipeline continues to provide a steady cadence of new growth opportunities, and we're well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth in 2025. I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil Boudreau : Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our fourth quarter results. Sales increased 8.8% on an organic basis and increased 10.1% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on fourth quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen against most currencies, which resulted in unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in October. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the fourth quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for 2025. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 to $5.25, which reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range and contemplates an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $1.05 to $1.09 for the first quarter. For the year, we forecast organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5% to 8.5%. Please note that we are no longer providing separate guidance for the sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales as COVID testing sales represents less than 2% of total company sales in 2024. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around 2.5% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our first quarter reported sales. We expect our full year 2025 adjusted gross margin profile to be around 57% of sales, which reflects an improvement of around 80 basis points versus the prior year. We forecast our full year 2025 adjusted operating margin profile to be in the range of 23.5% to 24% of sales, which reflects an improvement of 150 basis points versus the prior year at the midpoint of range. This improvement is driven by a combination of strong gross margin expansion and operating margin leverage. We forecast our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 17%, which reflects an increase compared to last year related to the adoption of the Pillar 2 tax framework. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter and guide. And maybe, Robert, I could start with the 2025 guide, once again guiding to high single-digit organic sales growth, healthy operating margin expansion, and nice to see 10% EPS growth back in the algorithm again. Maybe you could just speak to some of the key growth drivers and how we should think about the different business segments on the top line and some of the components of the operating margin expansion down the P&L? Thanks a lot. Robert Ford : Sure, Robbie. Yes, it's nice to see kind of the headline print now back to double-digit EPS growth. I think that's probably one of the things that -- it's one of the things you'll see now, Robbie, as we go into 2025. I mean, you've got a lot of growth drivers there. But I think one of the big things is that you don't have the COVID sales decline cloud that's kind of overshadowing all these real strong growth drivers that we got in the business. And you saw that in Q3 as we showed 13% EPS -- sorry, in Q4 as we showed 13% EPS growth. So I think that's one big aspect. It's just not having those sales decline. I mean we've got COVID sales in 2025, but it's, as Phil said in his comments, significantly less from our total revenue perspective. I think it starts with the top line always, Robbie, and the markets that we compete in, they remain attractive. We're seeing acceleration in several of them. I mean we're a very diversified healthcare companies so we get to benefit from all the different dynamics that are going on in healthcare, whether it's increased health and wellness focus from consumers, we get to benefit from that on our Nutrition business. Every treatment requires a diagnostic test, about 70% of them require diagnostic test, so we're seeing continued growth over there. And then we've got two areas where we focus on treatments, whether it's pharmaceuticals or med tech. And so all of those markets, they're accelerating. And then within them, we've got strong product portfolios that are either keeping up with these very high-growth markets, or we're outperforming the market and taking shares. And if you look at the contributions, we've got your current drivers, whether it's Libre, TriClip, Aveir, Navitor, Amulet, all of those products in the cardiovascular space. So the bases are loaded, I would call that. And then you've got a nice on-deck circle and the lineup of Abbott that are coming up right after that, whether it's biosimilars, volt, innovations in the Libre portfolio, some clinical trial readouts. So I think we feel very good about all of the businesses, and you saw all of the businesses improved their growth from Q3 to Q4. So I think it starts with the top line, and I think we're well positioned in them. To your question on the margin drivers, I'd say we've got -- we've done a lot of work on gross margin expansion. We've talked about that committing to a 70-basis-point improvement in 2024. We achieved that. We believe that we can achieve another 80 basis points of improvement in 2025, and that's what's embedded in that guide is continuous improvement on the gross margin in the tune of 80 basis points, will be driven by continued focus on gross margin improvement programs and then mix as some of the higher gross margin products continue to grow ahead of the company average, you get that mix effect. And then down the P&L, I think you've got an opportunity, as we've talked about in the past, to be able to leverage the business and obtain spending leverage across the business. And again, I think that was another challenge we had during COVID or as the COVID was coming down, we really only relied on one lever of margin expansion, which was gross margin equipment. I'd say now you've got two. We actually have two, which is our original formula, gross margin expansion and then spending leverage. So you put all that together, you've got about 16% actually underlying growth in the EPS coming from the top line, the gross margin improvement and the spending leverage. And then we've got, obviously, some friction on FX. I think every company is going to face that as we've seen the strengthening dollar, and increased tax rates, which also aren't a surprise. We've known about that. And so that brings us down to that 10%. So I kind of look at this and say, okay, what you've seen now for 2025 is the Abbott that we know, the Abbott identity that we built, which is high single-digit top line, double-digit bottom line, gross margin improvement, spending, leverage and productivity, strong operating cash flow. We know how to deal with FX. So we deal with it every year, and we're dealing with it again this year and still being able to deliver double-digit EPS. Dealing with a higher tax rate, so I think I saw some notes about calendarization about maybe Q1 not coming in. I could tell you, we looked at our Q1 and all of our gating or EPS is very much aligned to what it was in 2024. It's very much aligned to what it was pre-COVID. So again, all the elements of Abbott and the Abbott identity that we know are there, and we're looking forward to 2025. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Robert, I guess you talked about, it starts with the top line. You had another really strong year for CGM with over 20% constant currency growth of $6.5 billion in sales. So I'd love to hear you talk about your expectations for growth in 2025. The status of the Libre 3 supply issues and any color you have on the Lingo launch? Thank you. Robert Ford : Sure. So let me talk about Libre 3 supply. As we spoke about during the last call, Larry, there was a little bit of a mismatch, but our manufacturing coming up online and the demand that we were seeing, especially here in the US. That caused a little bit of friction there, but as I said, we were in process of getting our new manufacturing site up and running. I was there in November and seen the team and that's going now at full force. So Libre 3 supply with two manufacturing sites up and running and I think you'll start to see throughout the next one or two quarters a change here and a little bit on the NBRxs on the TRxs. I know you guys like to look at those quite often, I guess, those are an important metric to look at it, Larry, but they're not the only metric to see how the businesses are doing. I mean, I think you saw that in our Q4. We're able to grow the US 24%. So there are other elements that aren't measured. I think you also -- you guys also saw the impact of relying exclusively on those data's in Q3 as competitors had challenges also. So it's an important metric to look at, but I would say, it's not the only ones, and I think we've kind of shown that here. So Libre 3 is doing pretty well and it's just going to get better. As I look at 2025, I'd say there are some pretty interesting kind of growth drivers here for us. I'd say, first, as a base case, I still think there's under-penetration in the intensive insulin using segment. I mean, if you look at the US, there's still 25% of that segment that are not on CGMs, and if you think about that international, it's more like 50%. So I still think as a base case to driving all this growth, there's all this opportunity in this segment, but I think there are three areas in 2025 that I believe accelerates that opportunity for us. One of them is obviously basal coverage. And we continue to see with the publication of more clinical evidence, you see more and more markets move towards expanding basal coverage, reimbursement coverage. Now we have a couple of markets where we're the only ones that do have that coverage, whether it's Japan or Canada. These are large markets. So these are great opportunities for us where we've got this head start and we'll keep on driving that. So I think Basel is a big bucket of growth. I think the other area that I talked about as being an area of growth for us is more a kind of share -- ability to take share, and that's through connectivity strategies with insulin delivery systems. We've been talking about all the things that we've been doing with regards to partnership with insulin pump companies. And I think you'll see throughout this year several announcements on connectivity in different geographies, and that's gives us the opportunity to penetrate, albeit a smaller segment, but be able to penetrate that segment and take share. And I think the third area of growth for us of acceleration is just the whole OTC non-diabetes application with the launch of Lingo continue to see very nice trends. We've launched it in a restricted number of U.S. cities, but I think now that we understand what it takes to be able drive adoption with this completely different consumer segment that we'll probably be expanding this and expanding this more nationally here in the U.S. and potentially looking at other areas internationally due to bring this. So I think the Lingo launch is going very well. In several areas, I think, it surpassed some of my expectations, especially regarding reorder rates. And I think those continue, and I think that's going to be another kind of leg of the stool so as to say on growth. So I think those are really the kind of growth drivers that we've got planned for Libre. I think the insulin -- intensive insulin segment is still an opportunity, a pretty significant opportunity. And then you've got these three accelerators on top of that. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about EP growth, so still strong high single digits in the quarter, and I think it was even faster than that, excluding the tough mapping comp. There's a lot of things moving around in that market right now. One competitor had a big setback in DSA and your progress is moving forward with both. So just thinking about how you're thinking about EP growth in 2025 as you bridge the PFA in 2026 and your ability to kind of regain market share once both launches? Robert Ford : Sure. Yes, I mean, I think this was not a surprise for us, and it wasn't really driven by any kind of adoption of PFA regarding our Q4 growth rate. In fact, as I've said in previous calls, I think the net effect for us -- net-net effect for us has actually been very positive. What we did have was an execution of that strategy, Travis, where we said, okay, we're going to bridge ourselves, and one of the ways to do that is through our mapping. And that's what really drove our success in 2024 is we did in Q4 of 2023, really taking advantage of our ability to offer the only real open -- truly open mapping system. So that created that comp issue. It was double digits in Q4, 12% in the U.S., 12% internationally. So still seem very good. And I think, again, I would say, these results, I think we outperformed a lot of the expectations that many of you guys had about our EP business. And I think the driver of that has been the team. The team in the field has just been spectacular, I think. And I've been close to them last year and I think what they did was really strong. So, I guess I answered your question in 2025, really looking at what we did in 2024. And I expect to continue to benefit in 2025 from the -- just the general increasing procedure trends. We've got opportunities to grow with some recently launched products, whether it's our GridX, our next-generation mapping catheter, our new Agilis Introducer Sheath, I mean that's a great opportunity for us also. So, yes, it's going to be a little bit more competitive. It's been pretty competitive in 2024. I expect that intensity to increase when it comes to the ablation catheters. But I'm confident that we can maintain a strong position in the mapping segment and everything that comes with all the consumables that come with that. On top of that, our pipeline is very strong. We'll continue to engage KOLs and our customers. We've got an ongoing trial right now with a dual energy source catheter internationally and in the U.S. We've got integration with ICE. We've got kind of new sheets to launch. So, I think the pipeline allows us to continue that interaction with the KOLs and with the users. So, we should expect -- I think you mentioned bridging to PFA in 2026. It's more like 2025 on PFA, at least internationally. So, I feel good about it. And maybe you've got a tail of two halves, where the second half is going to grow faster than the first half as Volt comes on board. But I'd say, for the full year, high single-digits seems like a good place to start, call that our base case. And then to the point that you made about competition and some of the dynamics that have occurred in the last couple of weeks, it's still a little bit too early to tell, but that could be an opportunity for us also. So, I feel good about the business, not only the pipeline, but more importantly, the team that we've got. They're doing an incredible real strong job. Travis Steed : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hi Robert. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong finish to the year. I guess I had a two-part question, if you don't mind. Really strong operating margins, driven both by gross margins and operating leverage, but your gross margins are still below pre-pandemic levels. So, I'm curious, when you look at the margins, how sustainable are these trends, perhaps not at triple-digits, but should we be thinking about trend margin framework as gross margins normalize? And my second part is on balance sheet. I'm curious there's been some M&A activity picking up in MedTech. How you're thinking about devices versus diagnostics? I'm curious any thoughts on that cancer screening, MRD, et cetera? Robert Ford : I'll let Phil talk to the gross margin and the sustainability of that margin improvement, and then I'll take your balance sheet question. Phil Boudreau : Yes. Thanks, Robert and Vijay here. On the gross margin front, I think we spoke to this in the last few calls and nothing here has really changed relative to an underlying focus of the business and of the organization, as Robert touched on here. I think the difference in recent years causing that erosion was the significant inflation in commodity prices, which has really resorted back to, I'd call it, normalized inflationary pressures that we're very much accustomed to managing through with our organizations and focus on gross margin expansion. And so what you saw in 2024 was exactly that, the recipe we're accustomed to and the commitment in 2025 to do much of the same. So from expense standpoint, we expect this to continue, and it's not a matter of if, but when we get back to the legacy and historical gross margin profiles. Robert Ford : Yeah. I guess on your question on balance sheet. I've always talked about this, Vijay. I mean, we do take this kind of balanced approach. I'm not going to give you a formula of how much goes to here, how much goes to their. We do take a balanced approach. And on your M&A question, yeah, there's been an uptake of activity, no doubt. There are some good opportunities out there and whether -- and I don't think you're going to see a change in rate environment, but maybe on the regulatory environment, I think that creates opportunity. I've said that we've got a strong organic pipeline. It allows us to be selective. It allows us to look at opportunities that make sense strategically, but also generate an attractive return. I talked about how ROIC is important for us also. So not just top line, but return on that capital. So we do take a position here of being stewards of that capital. So I'd say, yes, we're in great position. We do have some debt to pay down this year, which we will. I don't anticipate rates coming down to the point that we might want to look at refinancing that. So we'll pay off that debt. It's about $1.5 billion this year. But even with that, we're in a great position with our balance sheet to be able to leverage opportunities that we'll see, talked about them. There's opportunities in med-tech, there's opportunities in diagnostics, and we're in a great position, and it allows us to be selective. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is open. Josh Jennings : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I echo Vijay's congrats on a strong finish to the year. Another margin question just because the operating margin guidance for 2025 was some stronger than expected, I think you talked about a lot of the drivers, Robert and Phil, but just a continued positive mix shift from stronger macro device contributions and the strong top line growth. But I was hoping you may just help us think through just the margin expansion opportunities in EPD, Nutrition and Diagnostics. And just with the outsized expansion in 2025, how should we be thinking about sustained open expansion in 2026 and beyond? And then should we be thinking about 50 to 100 basis points a year? I appreciate you taking the question. Robert Ford : Yeah. I'd like to get to that pre-pandemic gross margin. I mean, I know we talk a lot about this being behind where we were from a pre-pandemic. But our op margin profile, especially after our guidance for 2025 is actually ahead of that. So we've been able to achieve that through our spending and spending efficiencies. But I think that's the right range to have. I mean I think we've always had this notion. I mean, I talked about being able to offset FX and things like that and not provide any surprises. That's part of the algorithm there, which is we're just constantly having to address gross margin. It's not like this initiative either because of inflation or bits of tariffs or anything like that, it's just we're constantly working to improve gross margins. I'd say, on the nutrition side, those gross margins, given what we encountered over the last two years, those came down. But if you look at them, they have been improving sequentially almost like every quarter. We've got a ways to go to get back to where we were in 2022, Josh. That's a little bit more dependent on commodities and freight and distribution, things like that. But I think the teams have got a really good strategy here of kind of working on cost to serve and even, quite frankly, using some pricing where we felt we had to because of some of the increase in those commodities. So I think the Nutrition gross margin is definitely an opportunity that we've got over the next couple of years. The pharmaceutical teams have done an incredible job at maintaining a gross margin under pretty significant FX. I mean they do a fantastic job at offsetting FX. If you look at the margin profile in that business, it's actually increased several -- couple of hundred basis points over the last couple of years. So they've been able to do that also through gross margin. And I think the other element is just ensuring that we keep on driving the med tech business that have accretive gross margins quite frankly, across all of those different business units. And if we can continue to do that, then that's how you get to that model of maybe 50 to 100 basis points every single year. That's our target. We committed to 70, and we deliver to 70, we're now committing to 80 for 2025. And getting us closer to where we were pre pandemic. So I feel good about what we're doing, the strategy we got in place, the discipline that we have as a management team to review these programs and dedicate time. They don't just happen. We got to make decisions. There's oversight. So I feel good about it. Josh Jennings : Excellent. Thanks, again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. David Roman : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping, Robert, you could go into a little bit more detail on the Structural Heart business. As you kind of break down the pieces that portfolio, you have a balance of drivers, some more legacy like MitraClip and some that are more emerging categories, like TriClip and the tricuspid repair segment. But maybe you could help us think about the evolution of that business, which did very nicely through 2024, and how we should think about that into 2025? And maybe I could just contextualize the broader outlook here, and I appreciate your comments about getting back to the Aveir of high single-digit top line and double-digit bottom line. But it looks like 2025 does carry some headwinds that may prove to be one-time in nature like VBP dynamics in China on the diagnostics side, the transient competition in EP. So maybe you could kind of give us some color on Structural Heart, but also help contextualize the growth rate in 2025, as we think about the long-term as well? Robert Ford : Sure. I think it's interesting, like the sixth question comes on Structural Heart after we posted a 23% growth. So thank you, David. As I said in my opening comments, I think this is one of the most attractive areas in med tech. And it's one that we looked at several years ago and said, we're going to build truly a market-leading portfolio of products. And we're not going to just kind of rely on one platform to kind of drive growth, we're really to assemble a full area here and look across the entire area. And even in surgical, I mean I think, I look at our Epic valve, the feedback I keep getting on the surgical side of it is just doing incredibly well and it's really a preferred go-to on the mitral side for surgical repair, but -- replacement. But yeah. I think in the past, David, I think our Structural Heart portfolio was just viewed as MitraClip. And quite frankly, the sales would say, yeah, that's probably the case. But as we've been building out the portfolio, building on our stroke prevention with PFO approval, with Amulet approval and driving growth there, Amulet did very well in Q4 also grew 25%. Getting into the aortic segment, right, and really being a player there that has established now clinical credibility, whether it's through clinical trials, but also actual real-world usage of the product. They've been seeing some of Navitor cases here in the US and just the feedback has been very, very positive. So, building our aortic portfolio there. We're making big investments, whether it's in our clinical trials to build out our indications. We recently talked about -- shared that we are developing a balloon expandable TAVR valve, and we want to have a full aortic portfolio. On the tricuspid side, we were one of the leaders there to say, hey, there's no real good transcatheter opportunity here to treat TR. And TriClip has done very well. It's done extremely well, quite frankly, throughout this year. I think the team has done an incredible job getting approved behind the competitor. I would say right now, our data says that the ratio of repair and replace is about 2 :1, and we're leveraging all of that built in kind of infrastructure and scale that we already built with MitraClip. So what you see is a Structural Heart portfolio, $2.5 billion growing, let's call it, mid-teens because it much more diversified and, quite frankly, very competitive products in these high-growth areas. So I think that's going to continue, and we're committed to making these investments. We've got new versions of Amulet launch. We just got an approval for an updated version of TriClip to ease even more of the implant. You're going to see clinical trials read out in this area for label expansion indications in TAVR and in LAA. So this is an area that I think what you're seeing now, that kind of growth rate coming from the investments and just great execution from the team so. What was your -- your question was about growth rate and... David Roman : Yes, I was trying to speak a second there was just to contextualize the 25% growth rate given some onetime-ish headwinds like VBP in China Diagnostics and the dynamics in EP being potentially kind of transient as well? Robert Ford : Yeah. I mean, listen, every quarter, every year, there's always going to be some headwind. I want to do is here is assemble David, more tailwinds than headwinds, right? But yeah, I mean, you mentioned one, which is a little bit of a headwind for us in our diagnostic business regarding VBP. That's going to be with us in 2025 as they're rolling out new panels of testing that's going to go through that. But outside of that, I'd say, the diagnostics business is doing very well. Q4 growth rates in most areas were actually higher than the full year growth rate in those same areas, US, Latin America, Europe, even Japan was faster in Q4. So yes, we do have a challenge, but most companies are going to do it. And you know what, we've gone through these, David. Every company goes through a VBP, and what we're trying to do is, okay, we're not going to define the company by having this one kind of headwind. We've got a lot more tailwinds to leverage. We still have deal with it. We're still managing it. It's still an important part of the business. But the company is more than just VBP in diagnostics and one important market, but just one market. So I think the growth rate is very robust. I mean, 8% at the midpoint on a base of $40-plus billion, I think is pretty strong and pretty good. David Roman : Perfect. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the question and nice quarter. I'm curious if you could just sort of step back and talk about the overall health of the MedTech market. I feel like I'm constantly answering questions on things such as volume and price. And looking at you delivering mid-teens revenue growth, and I think you're seeing something that maybe not everybody is seeing, so I'd love to get your view on that? Thank you. Robert Ford : Sure. I mean, I think it does put us -- I mean, the way our portfolio is structured, Joanne, is that it does give us a little bit of bird's eye view into the entire health care system and the spectrum, right? And I think if you're getting questions on MedTech and MedTech growth, I think all you've got to do is continue to look at what companies are reporting. And what they're reporting is ultimately what we're seeing in the market, which is, it's not a pre-COVID pent-up demand. You are seeing a greater focus from whether consumers or the technologies that are being developed that are attracting more people into these procedures. So I think what we're seeing here is continued utilization growth really driven by whether it's demographics, combined with the innovation. I mean, what the industry is doing in terms of the innovation that we're bringing to the market, it's pretty spectacular and the procedures are getting faster, they're getting less invasive, and that's attracting more people to look at, select these procedures as a real viable first-line option versus guided medical therapy. So I think that's going to continue as long as we continue to see this innovation where we are obviously positioning ourselves pretty strongly in this, and you've seen sequential improvement in the growth rate across quite frankly, a lot of our businesses in MedTech. So I think the utilization is definitely increasing. I think there's maybe some questions, okay, what's going to happen with pricing? We've historically seen some price erosion in the past. I'd say, over the last couple of years, it's actually been pretty stable. So I don't know how that's going to play out. We've got a scenario here where we believe that with our portfolio, we'll see some pretty stable pricing. But I think utilization, combined with stable pricing is what's driving this MedTech growth. And we're seeing it in diagnostics, too. A lot of our diagnostic business is actual hospital-based diagnostics. So, we're seeing those diagnostic tests and those routine diagnostics tests continue to increase, high single, double-digit, low double-digit growth rates in terms of utilization. So, I think that MedTech is benefiting from just this increased utilization and consumers wanting to take care of themselves and looking at these technologies as a viable option for treatment. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open. Danielle Antalffy : Hey good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on a really good quarter, strong end to the year. Robert, we've talked in the past, I mean, obviously, we talked a lot about MedTech in the high-growth areas, but some areas where you've excelled or the legacy sort of slower growth businesses, I'm obviously thinking CRM being one of those mid- to high single-digits growth. Can you talk about -- that you find in CRM other legacy businesses. I'm thinking like heart failure, peripheral, and maybe how you're thinking about elevating those growth profiles in 2025, but then also longer term? Thanks so much for taking the question. Robert Ford : Yes. So, one of our strategies that we looked at a couple of years ago, Danielle, was if you looked at our MedTech business, it was growing like 8%, 9%. And that was a combination of probably like high-growth areas like EP, Structural Heart, Diabetes, even Heart Failure. And 40% of the portfolio was relatively flat and that was mostly our Vascular business and our CRM business. And the way we looked at it is to get our MedTech to be best-in-class, to be able to grow 12%, 13%, 14%, we need to continue the strong growth rate of Structural Heart, EP, Diabetes, et cetera. But we had to find a way to accelerate the growth rate of our Vascular and CRM businesses. And we said, if we can get them, these are historically been flat growth markets. If we can get them to grow 5% the way that would then work out is that we'd be able to elevate our MedTech portfolio to the mid-teens. So, that's what we've been doing over the last couple of years, and the team have been executing on that. I think on the Vascular space, what you've seen us do is kind of used a little bit a combination of organic and inorganic to accelerate and increase our participation in higher growth areas, specifically in the peripheral side. So, -- and I think you started to see that. We've been growing -- this quarter was a good quarter. Our target was around 5% for our Vascular business by having those -- by having stronger pipelines and portfolios in that more Peripheral space. And you're seeing that now start to happen. On the CRM side, our big strategy here was organic and getting to launch a very comprehensive and be the leaders -- sorry, leaders in leadless. So, we launched a single chamber a couple of years ago, launched a dual chamber last year, going to get into conduct and pacing leadless also. And I think that you've seen that over the last two years, our CRM business has grown 7%. And I think we can continue to extend that with the strategy that we're doing, which is to really lead in this area. I actually think that Aveir is probably the most underappreciated opportunities that we have in our portfolio. Look at it right now, you're asking the question towards the end of call, but I think really what you're seeing is these businesses, the focus, the innovation, the execution and now you're seeing those start to deliver on that strategy to bring these flat businesses up to mid -- at least mid-single-digit growth. I think there's the team doesn't like that I characterize them like that. So that's good. I'm glad that they think that they can do better than that. But we've got a lot of opportunity in those big areas, and we think there's innovation to be had in those. So we feel good about it. Danielle Antalffy : Thank you. Mike Comilla : Operator, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is open. Matt Miksic : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just maybe a follow-up here, given the tech guidance you gave for this year and some of the dynamics in US and overseas or tax policy, It'd be great to get your perspective on maybe the direction of where those things are going. And how we should think about them for having? Thanks so much. Phil Boudreau : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. There's a lot of narrative at the moment going on. But to your point and to the guide that we referenced in our opening comments here, what we've reflected is all current tax laws and guidance and geographic mix of where our business growth is coming from, which is about a 150-basis-point increase in the midpoint of this guide. That increase in the guide is driven by the increased adoption of the rollout here of Pillar 2 as is currently enacted in countries. And so that's what we reflect. We continue to be a good taxpayer, compliant taxpayer, and we'll see how more of this narrative unfolds here. But currently, we're running the operations and reflecting what's known and as Robert highlighted, absorbing still within the way we run the business. Robert Ford : Let me -- I want to add in on that one, Matt. I think you'll hear this topic come up quite a bit. And if I just take a bigger picture here. I mean, corporate tax rates tend to get higher politicized and especially during election years, and it's really not a political debate. In the business world, it's just an expense. It's just another form of expense. And in our world, when one expense goes up, you've got to manage and other expenses have got to come down or maybe not increase at the same rate that they were increasing. And I think what you'll find sometimes, you get a small handful of companies that maybe had a really low tax rate and then that viewpoint then gets unfairly applied to every large company, and then you get these predictable narratives of companies have got to pay their fair share, et cetera. The reality is, most companies pay their fair share and then some. I mean, I could talk about Abbott. Our cash taxes are over 20%, and that's one thing that people never talk about is we use these GAAP rates. But what really matters is cash taxes. That's the money that's going to be paid. But more importantly, US companies, companies like Abbott, we play a key role in making the US economy so successful. We're conducting a significant portion of the R&D in the US. We invest billions of dollars in capital projects, which then drive this drop growth. Our CapEx spend has increased over 60% over the last couple of years. We increased our workforce by 20%. And when you increase that workforce, you're investing hundreds of millions of dollars in employee health care and employee benefits. So this Pillar 2 legislation -- this Pillar 2 rule here that got adopted, that's added. And we -- I think this rate that Phil is kind of quote, that's an additional $200 million of expense. That's all it is. It's $200 million of expense that is not going to investing in other areas. And what's even more challenging is of those $200 million, two-thirds of it is actually going to be paid taxes to overseas countries. So that's not really a good policy for the US. And so we're absorbing this. We're managing it. And I think as still said, there are a couple still some new policies or new issues that we have to kind of work on. But I think the overall goal here has got to be to ensure the competitiveness of US companies and US multinationals. And I'm hoping we can get to that during the next 12 months or so. Let me just kind of close then on the call. I think we had a really strong finish to 2024. We exited our Q4 organic sales growth was over 10% and top line, 13% EPS, as I said, finished at the higher end of our range, expanded our gross margin, delivered what we said we were going to do. The pipeline continues to be highly, highly attractive, steady cadence of great new growth opportunities. And I think, to Vijay's question, we've got a balance sheet that's going to provide us a lot of strategic flexibility. So I think we're really well positioned to 2025. So with that, I want to thank you for joining us today. Mike Comilla : Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you all for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
