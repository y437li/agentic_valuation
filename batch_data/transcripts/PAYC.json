I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Craig Boelte, Chief Financial Officer of Paycom. Mr. Boelte, you may begin. Craig Boelte : Thank you, and good afternoon. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives and expected performance, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. While we believe any forward-looking statements we have made are reasonable, actual results could differ materially since the statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on April 15, 2014. You should refer to and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking information. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Also during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our press release that we issued after the close of the market today, which is located on our website at www.paycom.com. I will turn the call over to Mr. Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarterly conference call as a public company, following our Initial Public Offering, which priced on April 14. Here at Paycom, we are very confident in our future. And it is personally satisfying to see the Software-as-a-Service technology company that I founded in 1998 expand from payroll solutions in the cloud to an end-to-end human capital management suite. Today, we are the only human capital management company with a single database end-to-end product in the market. We capture employee data from the applicant, all the way to retirement and everything in between, providing functionality in talent acquisition, time and labor, comprehensive payroll, talent management and human resources. All the functionality is included in one application, which eliminates the need for integration with other systems, making it easy to use and more efficient to manage. Because the data is in one place, it is accurate, trusted and highly impactful. While others claim to manage the entire employment life cycle, they are often dependent upon partners and rarely provide the full-service payroll function that is mission critical to facilitate the employment life cycle. At Paycom, we truly have a single end-to-end offering. Now before we dive into the results, I'd like to thank our employees. Many of these -- this group are also investors in our company. I would also like to thank our clients, our investors and our advisers who were essential to getting us here. I'd also like to welcome the many new investors we met during our roadshow. We look forward to continued conversation with you over these years. I'll begin today's call with highlights from the first quarter, and since this is our first quarter as a public company, I'll spend a little more time than usual introducing you to Paycom. I'll then turn the call over to Craig to walk through our financial results in greater detail and provide you with our second quarter and full year outlook. I will then outline some of our key initiatives for 2014 before turning it over to the operator for your questions. So let's dig into the first quarter. We continued our solid momentum in the first quarter with a 34% increase in total revenue to $37 million, approximately 99% of which was recurring revenue. Annualized new recurring revenue, which is an estimate of the annualized amount of the first full month of new client revenue, increased to a record of nearly $12.6 million in the first quarter, up from roughly $9.6 million for the same quarter last year. This was a very busy quarter as well for our technology team. In addition to growing our technical headcount by 61% since the end of 2013, the bulk of which are programmers and developers, we launched several new applications and enhancements, including a new survey tool and enhanced employee self-service features including mobile. We also launched a new data analytics tool called Paycom Report Center, which we are also very excited about. Paycom Survey is a newly launched product that touches every user in an organization from top down, or from C-suite to the employee. In a matter of minutes, an HR administrator can create an employee survey with just a few clicks, push out the survey to get a pulse of the workforce. The solution is built from a single database and can be used in conjunction with our deep analytics and reporting tools to gain valuable insight into manager performance, employee on-boarding and departure trends. During the first quarter, we completed our employee self-service redesign, which includes responsive coding that dynamically adapts to any screen resolution that the employee may be using. This is truly a consumerized user interface that effectively rightsizes the content to fit the device or screen that employees use on a daily basis, whether on a tablet, a smartphone, a laptop or a high-definition monitor. This is just another example of how we build technology with the end-user as our starting point. This redesign makes engaging with data and analytics even more user-friendly than it already was and provides a crisp, clean view of our solutions. We are receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback from employees and managers who use our platform as their daily communication portal. Included in the redesign, we also added a new employee self-service feature called Employee Directory, which allows real-time access of all employee information as defined by HR policies. Employees love this because there's one less browser and one less database to log into. It puts all relevant, accurate and secure information at their fingertips. We launched most of our redesign in the first quarter, and already we are seeing a change in behavior and usage. Employee log-in frequency is up 170% year-over-year. And employees are now engaging with our products 3x to 5x more than they used to. Finally, we launched Paycom's multiclient code development. This feature is particularly useful for our larger clients and enterprises that have employees spread across separate business entities and tax identification numbers. If an employee transfers from one entity to another, companies traditionally had to transfer the records and tax codes. With Paycom's single database architecture, information now moves seamlessly when transferring employees, which maintains the integrity of the tax and compliance reporting chain. I'm very pleased that our clients are pulling our technology development teams deeper into the product suite and strengthening our competitive position in the market. Due to increased demand, we expanded our geographic footprint ahead of our expectations, opening 5 new sales offices in Baltimore, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Portland and Silicon Valley. We now have 31 sales teams in 30 offices around the country, with coverage in 25 of the 50 largest MSAs in the United States. As we've seen with our newly opened offices, we expect to see meaningful contributions from these locations as the year progresses. As a reminder, we typically seed our new offices with experienced sales managers, which makes the ramp up to revenue more efficient. And as I will get into later, we're seeing that the strong demand for our technology is making it even easier to sell, as well as expand into new geographies. Craig will speak to our financial performance in more detail later on the call. But needless to say, I believe, we're off to a very good start as a public company and I'm excited about our growth opportunity. Since this is our first call as a public company, I want to take a few extra minutes to provide additional background on Paycom and describe our technology, our opportunity and our growth drivers. I founded Paycom in 1998 with the vision of transforming the payroll and human resources industry with an automated Software-as-a-Service solution that included not only the functionality, but the added benefit of real-time reporting and analytics. Paycom is the only SaaS HCM provider offering a single-database platform for the entire employment life cycle. It's a key differentiator that sets us apart from other players in the space. We're disrupting a large and growing HCM market. At our core, we are a technology company with deep roots in SaaS architecture. Our comprehensive solution was developed on a massive single-database architecture in the cloud to solve the data integrity dilemma faced by many businesses. With Paycom, an individual's information exists only one time and in one location. And because our solution is built to manage the entire employment life cycle, which includes comprehensive payroll and tax reporting, there isn't a need to integrate with another database. Because our applications span the entire employment life cycle, our clients can streamline the full range of employment processes from recruiting and hiring, through termination or retirement and everything in between. While our single-instance, multi-tenant SaaS solution is fully scalable across clients of all sizes, we derive 86% of our revenue from businesses which have between 50 to 2,000 employees. Without Paycom, these businesses are forced to integrate and patch together multiple products and databases to complete the entire employment life cycle, leaving them with data integrity issues and decreased usage. While we believe we have the most comprehensive solution in the market, we are continuously innovating and expanding our SaaS solution to meet the evolving demands of our clients. Our internal and proprietary development process is 100% focused on the end-user, from the frontline employee to the reporting and analytical requirements of the C-suite. Based on client feedback, sales team input and proactive innovation analysis, our R&D group assesses best-of-breed functionality and then performs a rigorous development process and quality specifications. Once approved, our developer teams can turn the high-quality new applications around very efficiently. Our SaaS solution and single database uses standardized development processes, which allows us to ramp up valuable technology talent very quickly as well. While we are a technology company first, we have been very successful at turning our sales organizations into a key competitive strength. Our go-to-market approach is built on 2 core principles : number one, ensuring we are targeting companies that have a high probability of becoming long-term customers with high up-sell potential; number 2, ensuring we have the right sales reps and the right sales leaders selling the Paycom way. We have developed our sales processes internally, and we use our proprietary CRM to manage sales activity and deal flow. We have deliberately developed a sales recruiting, sales training and sales production process that is not dependent on any third-party. We traditionally promote from within and have a very low turnover amongst those reps who have achieved, what we call, executive rep status. We also have a dedicated team of client specialists that provide personalized one-to-one client support. They work hand-in-hand with our sales professionals to ensure seamless implementation as the clients switches over to and deepens use of our solution. These efforts, combined with our industry-leading SaaS solution, helps us maintain a high annual revenue retention rate, which over the past few years has been consistently 91%. So in summary, this is a very exciting time for Paycom. It's just the beginning really, and we're bringing enterprise-class solutions to the small and medium business market in a profitable and efficient way. We have multiple vectors to drive sustainable growth, and we'll remain focused on developing new products and features that our clients want. We will continue to increase our penetration within our existing markets, add new clients and enter new geographies. There is a tremendous whitespace opportunity ahead of us, and we will continue to strategically meet the market demand with our disciplined approach. Now, let me stop there and turn the call over to Craig to walk through our financial results. Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. I would also like to reiterate how pleased we are with the company's performance in the first quarter. I will review our first quarter financial results, as well as our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2014 in detail in a moment. Before doing so, I want to quickly review a few key elements of our financial model, as this is our first quarter as a public company. One of the attractive characteristics of our business is that approximately 99% of our revenues are recurring revenues, based on fees clients pay us for our talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and HR management applications. The services related to recurring revenues are rendered during each client's payroll period, with the agreed upon fee being charged and collected as part of our processing of the client's payroll. Collectability is reasonably assured as the fees are collected through an automated clearing house or a direct wire transfer as part of the client's payroll cycle. Because of the recurring nature of our SaaS-based business and high retention rate, we have excellent visibility. We charge implementation fees for the deployment of our solution and generate other revenue from -- as part of our time and attendance services. Implementation revenues are recorded as deferred revenues and recognized over the life of the client, which is estimated to be 10 years. Because this is a cloud-based SaaS model, we enjoy high gross margins of roughly 80%, with cost of sales largely consisting of hosting and support costs for our applications, along with employee-related expenses for client support, delivery and bank charges. We operate our own data centers and have been consistently benefiting from scale advantages to drive leverage. We kept paid commissions to our sales reps based solely on new sales at the time of their first monthly billing cycle. This is a onetime commission paid, which we recoup over the life of the client relationship. While the impact of rapid growth puts near-term pressure from the sales and marketing expense line, this is more than offset over the long-term given the predictable recurring nature of our client relationships. With this background in mind, let's review our results for the first quarter. As a reminder, as I review our fiscal first quarter results and our outlook for the second quarter in 2014, my comments related to certain financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and net income, are on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other nonrecurring charges, including transaction expenses related to the Initial Public Offering. Total revenue in the first quarter of 2014 grew to a record $37 million, an increase of 34.1% compared to the same period last year. Within total revenue, recurring revenue was $36.5 million, representing 98.6% of our revenue, and growing 34% year-over-year. Implementation and other revenue of $0.5 million was up 42.4% over the prior-year period. As a reminder, the first quarter is a seasonally strong quarter due to annual tax form filings.  Annualized new recurring revenue or ANRR, a key performance indicator for us, was $12.6 million, up from $9.6 million in the same period last year. The strong growth that we saw in total revenue and annualized new recurring revenue was driven by accelerated growth in new clients and increasing average revenue per client as we continue to move upstream to larger clients. Our solid results are being bolstered by success of our sales force in adding new clients in our mature offices, which are offices that have been open for at least 24 months, adding new clients in our more recently opened sales offices and selling additional applications to existing clients. Total gross profit for the first quarter was $30.1 million, representing a gross margin of 81.3%. This compares to gross margin of 82.4% in the prior-year period. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was largely a timing issue related to investments in headcount to support our growth. Turning to operating expenses. Total administrative expenses of $26.9 million increased 56.6% year-over-year as we continue to invest ahead of our growth opportunity by adding new sales offices, adding to our R&D talent and incremental costs of being a public company. As Chad highlighted in his remarks, we increased our technical staff by 61% since the end of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.6 million or 17.7% of revenue compared to $8.2 million or 29.6% of revenue in the first quarter of 2013. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased investment to support our growth, including sales commissions, new office openings and increased headcount. We are pleased that we opened 5 new offices in the first quarter, more than we have in any prior year, and setting us up well for continued growth in 2014 and beyond. Non-GAAP net income was $1.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, based on 48.4 million shares, versus $2.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, based on 47.9 million shares in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash equivalents of $13.1 million and debt of $86.3 million. In April, we successfully completed our IPO, raising $64.3 million. In concurrence with the IPO, we repaid $65 million of debt, leaving our only outstanding debt relating to our Oklahoma City headquarters and data center facility. With that, let me turn to guidance for the second quarter and for fiscal 2014. For the second quarter, we expect total revenue in the range of $31 million to $32 million, representing a growth rate of 31.8% at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $4 million to $5 million, representing an EBITDA margin of 14.3% at the midpoint. Excluded from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA outlook for Q2 are stock-based compensation of $0.1 million, transaction expenses of $0.3 million and a onetime adjustment of $4.1 million related to the early payoff of our debt. For fiscal 2014, we expect total revenue to be between $139 million to $142 million or 30.6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $19 million to $22 million, representing an EBITDA margin of 14.6% at the midpoint. Excluded from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA outlook for fiscal 2014 are stock-based compensation of $0.4 million, transaction expenses of $1.1 million and a onetime adjustment of $4.1 million related to the early payoff of our debt. In summary, we are seeing very strong demand for our solutions and we plan to continue to invest in the areas of R&D and sales and marketing to fuel our high recurring revenue growth, while at the same time, delivering attractive profitability. With that, I'd like to turn it back to Chad. Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig. As you can see, we are very excited about the future of Paycom and have high expectations. Before we open it up for questions, I want to layout 3 key initiatives for driving continued profitable growth in 2014. First, we will continue to invest in our industry-leading SaaS solution. Our internal technology capabilities and product development are second to none, and we will continue to go deeper into the product suite throughout the year. We look forward to consistently adding new functionality, like the recent survey tool and mobile employee self-service and reporting modules. Second, we will continue to invest in our people. Attracting new talent and getting them up to speed the Paycom way is critical to our long-term success. We have been very successful in this regard and expect to continue to add to our deep bench of R&D and sales teams. Finally, our sales office growth strategy is working and we are confident this is the right go-to-market model. We added 5 cities in the first quarter because the demand was there and we were able to attract the talent we needed to act quickly. We will continue to opportunistically add new offices as the sales talent and market conditions demand. Just to give you a little more perspective, we had planned on opening 3 new offices in the first quarter this year and one more in the remainder of the year. We exceeded our internal goals and opened 5 new offices, because what we are finding is that the demand for our product is exceeding our expectations. At the same time, we are getting better at developing our sales talent and they are ramping up their productivity faster. Our value proposition is resonating with businesses as they experience the benefits of our single database solution. As important as SaaS is, it's not a standalone solution. The product has to be differentiated. Paycom's key differentiator is that our SaaS solution uses a single database to provide all functionality included, eliminating the need to patch together multiple solutions, which allows a business to turn what was disparate data into actionable information. Because of that, we are winning our clients over, and they're changing the nature of their employee communications and processes. We really appreciate your interest in the Paycom story and this is just the beginning. Paycom's off to a great start as a public company. We are excited about our current growth prospects and the opportunity for our company in the coming years. I believe we are well-positioned to sustain and build upon the positive business momentum we have well into the future. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator and open up the lines to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : A couple of questions for me. First, can you talk a little bit about the mix this quarter between payroll and non-payroll? And talk -- and Chad, maybe talk a little bit about the opportunity, like obviously, at the moment, majority of the businesses still have payroll. But as you kind of rollout new businesses like you've mentioned this quarter with the surveying business, how does it work in terms of kind of monetizing that? And how do we -- you see the market versus the payroll market in terms of as an opportunity? Chad Richison : All right. Well, first, Raimo, thanks for congratulating us and we're looking forward to this. So to answer your question, payroll is the core of any business function as you look at it. So 100% of all the companies that we work with, they do have our payroll offering. Over the years, payroll's represented a smaller percent of the overall. It's starting to -- even though we have clients that do -- 100% of all of our clients do have the payroll offering, we've done a good job at developing out the entire employment life cycle. So in answer to your question, I believe that payroll -- we'll continue to see growth in the payroll side. But the other offerings, the popularity that we've had in the other offerings are going to continue to grow as well. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. And then, like on the investment side for the year. So obviously, you kind of overachieved in Q1. I mean, how do we have to think about it? Like what triggers like extra spending versus non-extra spending if I think about the rest of the year? And how do you do -- how do you think about this new offering at offices? Do you do -- kind of do them -- you try to do them at the beginning of the year and then the rest of year is nothing, like you just kind of let them go live and kind of start performing and then you do that -- the next thing next year? Help us to understand that process that goes on at Paycom there? Chad Richison : All right. So from the -- it looks like that there was a couple of questions there. I'm going to take the first one. But as far as the sales office openings, we traditionally had a lot of success starting these in the beginning of the year, but just because they're able to ramp up by the end of the year. You're able to get staffed. We do onboard several clients. Even though it's well-distributed throughout the year, we do onboard several clients as well in January. And so we like to get those on-boarded and not really open up offices potentially at the first of a quarter. What happened is in the first of the year is we saw some large opportunities. I mean, we've had increased demand for our products in certain areas, and we actually had the staff that was in a good position that we could actually promote into these new positions. And so we captured that opportunity due to the demand that we had for our software. Raimo Lenschow : So in a way, if you think about it, so 2 things came -- the 2 things basically came together, which doesn't really, in other words, happens like -- so you had the right people and the right city and they just -- the 2 of them came together, so it would be silly not to use it. Is that the way to think about it? Yes? Chad Richison : Yes, that's correct. And we're always going to look at the opportunity that way, for us anyway. The larger that we become as a technology company, as well as a sales organization, over time, you have more technology to sell, so you do have a lot more pull for your product, as well as you have a deeper bench of future leaders. And so over time, it becomes -- it's never easy, but it does become easier for us to open up additional offices. Raimo Lenschow : Yes. Okay, perfect. And then, one last question for me. It's like, maybe it's more for Craig or actually maybe for both of you. If I compare Paycom with other companies, I mean, you're using kind of option for employees a lot less than the other guys, a lot less. Can you talk a little bit about why that is? And how are you incentivizing your people? Chad Richison : Could you restate that question, Raimo? Raimo Lenschow : Yes. So I was trying to say like, if you look at Paycom and look like how extensively you use option -- well, you're actually -- you're not using options to your employees extensively, if I look at the charge that you have compared to other technology companies coming out of the Valley. Like can you talk a little bit about how you kind of motivate the people? I mean, a lot of these other companies say I need to give out options to get the employees happy, et cetera. What's your thinking behind that? And how are you doing it? Craig Boelte : Okay. I'll take that one, Chad. Chad Richison : All right. Go ahead. Craig Boelte : Raimo, what we've done is we have probably 200 to 300 employees that are actual owners of the company through the -- through our options plan. Prior to our reorganization on January 1, we were an LLC and we were able to use incentive units to incent the employees. So our valuation of those was significantly less. And as part of the conversion on January 1, they are still owners in the company, but our comp charge was significantly less. As we move forward, we will continue to put plans in place to incent our people and keep them involved. Operator : Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Just 2 questions. I wanted to start with the 61% increase in the technical people. Are all of those being accounted for inside of R&D? And I want to make sure that I heard correct. I want to understand kind of where you're allocating that talent to today.  And maybe the follow-on to that is have you hired what you want to hire in the technical area for 2014? Or is there still more investment to come? Craig Boelte : I'll take the first part of that question, Sterling. Part of our R&D is capitalized as self-developed software. So what you're seeing on the income statement isn't the full amount of the R&D spend. So -- then, I'll turn it over to Chad. Chad Richison : Right. And so we increased our technical headcount by 61% this quarter, and these are programmers, developers and what we call QA, as well as product development. All of our development -- most all of our development and definitely what this group coming in will be working on, it's all future development. It's not maintenance of the product. And so we have a lot of plans to continue to bring our SaaS technology to the market and we have some ambitious items that we'd like to go ahead and get completed as well. And so as the opportunity presents itself in the future, we'll continue to grow our R&D staff. Sterling Auty : And then, my follow-up question is when you look at that 50 to -- your core market, where you've got 86% of your customers currently. Some of the larger players, obviously, aren't standing still. I think they're investing in SaaS-related solutions also. Where do you think you are in terms of the head start that you've got on them? And the investment that you're making, is this going to be enough to kind of sustain that lead? Chad Richison : Well, that's a good question. I cannot speak for the others. I think you do have companies that are around, that are actually trying to -- they are actually in the process of converting to SaaS. This is a very serious industry that we're in. And we're really in an industry where, if you -- if you're 99.9% accurate, you get an F. And so everything really has to be locked up. So we will continue to spend on the R&D side as we need to. And we've attracted a lot more research and development talent over the last year. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Davis from Canaccord. Richard Davis : You kind of talked about it at a high level before, but kind of -- who and in what percentages are you replacing incumbent vendors? Who do you see the most? And I'm sure we'll be asking you this over the quarters and years as we go along to see how that evolves. Chad Richison : All right. Well, most of the time, the overwhelming majority of the time, we are replacing an incumbent provider. And most of the time, they have 1 or 2 -- well, most of the time, yes, at least 1 or 2 databases on the small end that we're replacing. As you move further up market, it could 3 or more. Obviously, the largest legacy providers are the ones that we're going to run into the most. And we continue to have a lot of success competing against both them and others. Richard Davis : No names? Chad Richison : Well... Richard Davis : That's all right, I understand. That's fine, I was just teasing you. And then, one other question that sometimes I get is, is having a single database kind of one of the key differentiating? Is that one -- is that the most important reason that I pick your guys in a competitive takeoff? Or, I mean, obviously, it depends on the customer, et cetera, but is that a plurality of the reasoning behind me as a potential customer choosing you guys? Chad Richison : Yes. I think it's really what the single database provides on the back end. So it's really about the functionality and experience you can have with the single database, so that you're not -- you do not have the need to integrate or patch together multiple systems to actually use your data, which we actually turn into information. Operator : And our next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel. Brad Reback : Craig, I think you mentioned during the prepared remarks that you've had success moving upmarket with some of your more recent customer additions. Could you maybe give us some sense, if you look at the average customer that you acquired here in the first quarter versus what the average customer looked like a year ago or 2 years ago, from where they're starting and how much upmarket you've been able to go? Chad Richison : Our average customer count is trending the way it has been trending for years now, which continues to trend up. And this is Chad, by the way. Brad Reback : Yes, Chad. But Chad, I'm sorry, not average customer count, but the size, the average customer size. What that customer looks like today versus what that customer looked like 2 years ago? Are you getting bigger customers? Chad Richison : Yes, we are. Our actual employee size per customer continues to trend up. 50 to 2,000 employees is a broad range, and there's a lot of opportunity for us to capture in that range. And really, that's the market segment that's highly dependent upon the information. And we have a very strong value proposition for them. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Brendon Barnicle : Chad, just following a little bit on Brad's comment. One of the things we'd heard from other companies this quarter was some difficulty in closing larger transactions. We saw some of them get delayed and pushed out a little bit. I'm wondering if you saw any of that in yours? I'm not sure that the ones we heard about were kind of in the size range. It might have been quite a bit larger. But I was wondering if you saw any changes in that -- the characteristics of closing some of your larger deals? Chad Richison : Thanks for the question, and no, Brendan, we have not seen any changes in that. As we reported, our ANRR for this first quarter was a record for us, and a lot of that has to do with our ability to close businesses right in our wheelhouse. Brendon Barnicle : Terrific. And then, you continue to build out the sales force and go city-by-city. And I was wondering how sales hiring was? That was another thing we heard this quarter from many companies is sort of some challenges in getting all the hiring they wanted done. I'm just wondering how that looked for you guys through the quarter? Chad Richison : This quarter, we actually exceeded our sales office opening expectations with actually being able to open 5. And a lot of that was due to the demand for our technology, but also our ability to find and source candidates to actually come and work for us. And so we have not experienced any problem with finding talent. Brendon Barnicle : And in terms of the sales talent, are you still sourcing that primarily from some of the -- from your competitors who have -- kind of larger and slower? Or are there some new sources? Chad Richison : Right. And so we do not traditionally hire from competitors. But that said, we're going to remain open to anyone that's talented in the sales process and wants to actually come work for Paycom and do things the Paycom way. We're always open to those individuals. All right. Well, I want -- I'm sorry, go ahead. Craig Boelte : Are there any more? Chad Richison : Yes. Any other questions? Operator : Sir, at this time, I'm showing no additional questions. I would like to turn the conference back over for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. Well, I want to thank everybody for participating in today's call and for your interest in Paycom. We're very proud of the hard work and dedication of our employees and we're excited about the huge opportunities ahead of us. And we look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter.

And welcome to the Paycom Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Results Teleconference. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) After today\u2019s presentation there will an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig Boelte, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Craig Boelte : Thank you and good afternoon. Before we get started I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives and expected performance are forward-looking statements within meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. While we believe any forward-looking statements we have made are reasonable, actual results could differ materially because of statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our final prospectus that was file with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 15, 2014. You should refer too and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking information. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Also during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our press release that we issued after the close of the market today, which is located on our website at www.paycom.com. I'll now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig, and thanks to everyone joining us both on our conference call and online. I'm excited to spend this time with the investor community, as we believe that the human capital management industry is at the beginning of a multiyear transformation and that this presents opportunities for well-positioned providers to capture the value offered by this change. We believe that Paycom is leading the charge of this transformation due to our superior technology and unique approach and is poised to grow faster than the industry by continuing to grow our market share. As you can see from our earnings release, this was another outstanding quarter for Paycom. Demand for our software as a service technology and end-to-end human capital management solutions remains very strong and our differentiated offering is resonating in the marketplace. We saw accelerating growth in the second quarter with the 39.3% increase in total revenue to $33.3 million, approximately 98% of which was recurring. Annualized new recurring revenue, which is an estimate based on the annualized amount of the first full month of revenue attributed to new clients also increased in the second quarter to $11.5 million, up from roughly $8.3 million for the same quarter last year. Results are driven by the power of our single database, end-to-end solution and the associated superior data that comes with a single database that spans the entire employment lifecycle. This data is key to our value proposition. We capture employee data from the applicant all the way to retirement and everything in between, providing functionality and talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and human resources, all of the functionalities included in one solution, which eliminates the need for integration with other systems, making it easy to use and more efficient to manage. For employers this means that when an applicant has hired into the system his or her data is populated across all functionality from payroll to performance management. Employees love this because there's one less browser and one less database to log in to, plus our solution puts all relevant, accurate and secure information at their fingertips, such as their pay rates, deductions, benefit selections, performance reviews and much more. Now before I do a deep dive into our technology, I want to backup and spend a few minutes describing our view of how HCM will evolve over the next few years and how this evolution will transform the way that companies manage their employees and leverage HCM to drive business. Let's turn back the clock about 15 years to the year 2000, at that time, Internet usage was ramping and the cloud was virtually nonexistent. Based on our experience, we believe at that time human resource professionals accounted for virtually all usage of HCM functionality and data. We believe the C-Suite usage was very small, mostly in the form of high-level printed reports and employee usage was very low as well. Fast-forward to today, the Internet is everywhere and the use of cloud computing and fast models are continuing to grow. Looking at usage of HCM applications and data today, we estimate that HR professional\u2019s usage still accounts for the overwhelming majority of total use. C-Suite usage has grown slightly but employee usage has grown substantially. What does this mean on a practical basis and how does this form our vision of HCM? Simply put, we believe and have been executing with this belief for years that the optimal model of HCM is one where the employees are empowered to enter their own personal data into the system, as well as retrieve such information at will. With Paycom our client\u2019s employees enter everything from new higher data and time off request to expenses and changes in beneficiaries. This model is much more accurate and allows employees to access much more data than they had previously. It also allows HR professionals to spend less time on data entry and occupy more strategic roles within the organization. As you look at the next wave of workers, today's youth are growing up surrounded by technology. It is clear they will be overwhelmingly comfortable with entering their own data. Based on our view of industry trends, we expect that over the next few years, employees will be entering much more of their own data and account for significant usage of HCM systems. Employees want and expect to be able to manage their information, empowering them with the ability to do so, helps keep top talent motivated and engaged, a proven driver for reducing turnover, improving productivity and increasing customer satisfaction. In addition to improved employee engagement, we anticipate that these changes will ultimately drive efficiencies, lower costs and potentially unlock new ways of doing business that will improve our client\u2019s day-to-day operations. We believe Paycom is the most favorably positioned company in the HCM space to take advantage of this trend. Due to the fact that we provide the functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage the complete employment lifecycle. As you know a key difference between Paycom and our competitors is the way we have approach building our HCM suite. Many of them have chosen to simply integrate their own products or integrate products from other vendors for core functionality like talent management, applicant tracking or benefits. Our suite is built as one unified solution using our Paycom framework. Aside from not being dependent on others to deliver our core functionality, this approach gives us key engineering benefits, such as a more seamless user experience and significant code reuse between modules. Each time we built within our framework we get faster and more efficient at building HCM applications. The most recent example of this strength was displayed during our new client redesign where we chose to build new code generation tools that automatically write much of the predictable coding we would have done, leading us to faster development and greater overall consistency. This client redesign follows the employee redesign from last quarter and we have received extremely positive feedback from our clients, who now have the ability to access the system anywhere, anytime and from any device. This development framework has allowed us to create a broad unified suite that allows us to approach clients with a full-featured solution from the onset and allows our clients to transform their payroll and HR efforts immediately upon implementation of the Paycom system. Even with our expanded solution, we continue to improve. At Paycom, we can leverage the work we put in several years ago in establishing our single database architecture and create new applications and features more quickly for minimum cost. Additionally, as you might expect all new applications and functionality work well with our existing suite, which makes for easy conversations with clients as we present our solution. Our software development team continue to innovate and deliver and we launched several new features this quarter, including Paycom Push Reporting, which is a smart analytics feature that generates reports based on client\u2019s specified metrics. Push reporting eliminates the need for someone to pull or generate a report. It does the work for you. Client feedback on our push reporting functionality has been extremely positive so far. And we've already new client wins because of this feature. Last quarter, I highlighted our employee self-service redesign with responsive coding that dynamically adapts to any screen resolution that the employee may be using. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter we rolled out this enhancement to the client side and the response has been tremendous. Our clients are now able to be more productive than ever with the ability to access key HCM data and processes from any location and the device that best suits their needs. These are two recent examples of how our clients are pulling our technology development teams deeper into their development efforts and strengthening our competitive position in the marketplace. As I highlighted last quarter, we view our sales organization as a key competitive strength. And I'm pleased to report that the momentum of our sales efforts has continued this quarter. As we continue to increase new business sales across our mature and growing offices, while adding new clients at a robust pace. I'm particularly proud of the speed with which we are ramping up new team members at the five new sales offices opened in the first half of 2014 and the skill with which our experienced team members are helping our new associates learn the Paycom culture and how to sell the Paycom way. As a reminder, although new sales teams won't reach maturity for 24 months, we look forward to them making revenue contributions toward the end of this year. To sum it up, Paycom is continuing to succeed in our mission to bring enterprise class solutions to the market in a profitable and efficient way. Our investments in technology and expanding our sales footprint are already yielding positive results. We believe we are at the beginning of a multi-year growth cycle as new and potential clients continue to learn how Paycom can help and improve their businesses. I will now turn the call over to Craig to discuss our financial results. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks Chad. Our momentum continues into the second quarter and we were pleased to see this reflected in our financial results. Before I review our second quarter results in our updated outlook for 2014, I want to again quickly review a few key elements of our financial model. As we detailed last quarter, the vast majority of our revenues are recurring revenues. These are based on client fees for our broad and growing suite of applications which include talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and HR management applications. The services related to recurring revenues are rendered during each client\u2019s payroll period and are charged and collected as part of our processing of the client\u2019s payroll, which provides reasonable collectibility and excellent visibility. Our cloud-based SaaS models supports gross margin of approximately 80% with cost of sales largely consisting of hosting and support cost, along with employee-related expenses for client support, delivery and bank charges. As Chad highlighted earlier, we believe our data is a key competitive advantage and to this end, we operate our own data centers. Regarding our operating expenses, we pay commissions to our sales reps based solely on new sales at the time of their first monthly billing cycle. This is a one-time commission paid which we recoup over the life of the client relationship. While our continued robust topline growth results in near-term increases on our sales and marketing expenses, this is more than offset over the long term, given the predictable recurring nature of our client relationships. With this background in mind, let\u2019s review our results for the second quarter. As a reminder, as I review our fiscal second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal 2014, our comments related to certain financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income or non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes stock-based compensation and other non-recurring charges, including transaction, expenses related to our initial public offering as well as losses related to retirement of related party bid. Total revenues in the second quarter 2014 grew to a record $33.3 million, an increase of 39.3% compared to the same period last year. Within total revenue, recurring revenue was $32.7 million, representing 98.2% of our revenue and growing 39.6% year-over-year. Annualized new recurring revenue or ANRR was $11.5 million, up from $8.3 million in the same period last year. Our continued strong revenue growth in the second quarter was primarily driven by the addition of new clients. We continue to see success in adding new clients in our mature offices, which are offices that have been opened for at least 24 months as well as adding new clients in our more recently opened sales office. Total gross profit for the second quarter was $26.9 million, representing a gross margin of 80.9%. This compares to gross margin of 8.1% in the prior-year period. Turning to operating expenses, for the second quarter, total administrative expenses were $23.8 million as we continue to invest ahead of our growth opportunity by adding new sales offices, adding to our R&D talent, an incremental cost of being a public company. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.1 million, or 18.2% of revenue compared to $4.4 million, or 18.4% of revenue in the second quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP net income was $2.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share based on 50.3 million shares versus $0.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share based on 48 million shares in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $14 million and debt of $27.4 million. The debt represented financing on our corporate headquarters. During the quarter, we use net proceeds from our IPO and existing cash to retire $65 million of outstanding debt. With that, let me turn to guidance for the third quarter and for fiscal 2014. For the third quarter, we expect total revenue in the range of $34 million to $35 million, representing a growth rate of 33.7% at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $4.5 million to $5.5 million representing an EBITDA margin of 14 .5% at the midpoint. For fiscal 2014, we expect total revenue to be between $143 million to $145 million, or 33.8% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $22 million to $24 million, representing an EBITDA margin of 16% at the midpoint. In summary, our momentum continued into the second quarter and we anticipate ongoing success through the rest of the year as we leverage our investments in R&D and sales and marketing and strive to deliver revenue growth. With that, I like to turn it back to Chad. Chad Richison : Thanks Craig. In conclusion, we had a great second quarter in our first years as a public company. We remain very excited about the opportunity we see for our company. We believe, we are well positioned to leverage our ongoing sales momentum and technology advantages to continue to drive innovation across our technology platform, take share and build our recurring revenue base for the next several years. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to the operator and open up the lines to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations to a great second quarter. The first question I have -- like I had, was can you talk a little bit about the dynamic of the payroll versus non-payroll this quarter? Chad Richison : Sure. Raimo, as we've talked about in the past, all of our new business comes in, well, all of our business that we have, every client that we have here now comes in with the payroll offering. And so everything that comes in does have the payroll. We continue to expand our product offerings. And we\u2019re becoming more aggressive in the initial sales call to where we have been able to penetrate more as somebody comes in upfront. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: Yeah. Okay. And then on these non-payroll modules like what are the trends that you are seeing there? What are the modules that are easiest to sell and where do you see growing momentum starting to pick up more? Chad Richison : Like our competitors, I mean, this is -- we don't necessarily disclose module by module, we do see it as one solution. I mean, however, I will say unlike others, I mean, we are providing the ANRR. We have 30 sales teams, 6 to 8 reps on each team focused exclusively on new business wins and the overwhelming majority of all ANRR comes in new wins is what they are. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: Yeah. We look at that. Okay. So you open up five offices in Q1. Did you open up any more in Q2 or are there plans or are you just now in a staffing mode for those five offices? Chad Richison : Correct. So we did open up five offices in Q1, which was a couple of more than what we had forecast. As we stated earlier, it takes on average 24 months within the ramp-up to maturity and we\u2019re seeing them trend to that point now. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: And so -- are there plans for doing more this year or like are you done for the year basically, the next cycle starts next year? Chad Richison : Well, we\u2019re always reviewing opportunity. And as we go into the future quarters, I mean, that something will definitely be looking at. But we didn't open up another one this quarter because we opened two additional first quarter early. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: Yes, okay perfect. And then last question for me is like so as now as a public company what has been the reaction that you've seen from the client base and kind of working in the market environment, has there been any change and improvement because you've got more recognition or any change from a competitive nature that ADP is taking you more seriously now or anything along those lines? Chad Richison : Well, I can't speak from the competitors. I know that we are finding it easier to have conversations with the clients and win prospecting. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: Yes. Okay. Perfect. That's it for me. Thank you. Chad Richison : All right. Thanks. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And our next question will come from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan. Albert Chi - JPMorgan: What\u2019s going guys? This is actually Albert Chi on for Sterling. Great job on the quarter. The results were pretty solid, but just a question I have is, do you think you could update us on the competitive environment from both your HCM SaaS competitors and maybe touch on what some of the larger incumbents have been responding with. I know when your competitors on the larger incumbent side had, kind of had talked about strong demand in the SaaS application. So can you talk about the dynamics between the sort of response and what's currently out there in terms of your direct competitors? Thanks, guys. Chad Richison : Sure. Thanks for the question. So we've been competing with substantially the same people, since I started the company in 1998. It's really been the usual suspects, save a couple of new ones, maybe smaller ones. It\u2019s a highly competitive market and our competitors continue to come out with new products and target new markets and new market segments all the time. We still plan on taking market share and growing. I mean, it's been our model since we started and we continue to be strong at it today. Albert Chi - JPMorgan: Thanks. Operator : And the next question will come from Brad Reback of Stifel. Brad Reback - Stifel: Hey guys, how are you? Chad Richison : Hey, Brad. Brad Reback - Stifel: Chad, to your comment earlier about higher attach rates, can you give us any sense of how much higher ANRR for your customers today, where it might've been a year ago or two years ago? Chad Richison : I can't give you specifics on that, the specific number, but it's trending up. We have added new modules if you will. Again, we\u2019re selling one solution but we've added new product features over the last three years. So as we go into a new client or a new win, we\u2019ve have more to sell them. Brad Reback - Stifel: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on the new office side and the potential to add in the back half of the year. If there is an opportunity, does EBITDA guidance potentially assume some of that or have a factor in for that or would that be added expense to that guidance? Thanks. Chad Richison : I do not -- I'm trying to get to the just of the question. We are -- we would choose to open up an office or not based on the opportunity or demand or our ability to accelerate it once open. And we don't really go into a market that we don't plan to have a lot of success in. So I wouldn't necessarily say it's EBITDA guidance that's driving that decision. Brad Reback - Stifel: Yeah. No. I apologize. If you did open offices in the back half of the year, would that be a headwind to the $22 million to $24 million EBITDA guidance you gave or it might that already had some wiggle room and conservatism baked in that it could handle it? Craig Boelte : As we look to the full-year guidance on adjusted EBITDA, we feel comfortable with the numbers we provided and included in that is increase in sales force headcount as well. Brad Reback - Stifel: Great. Thanks very much. Chad Richison : Thank you, Brad. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chad Richison for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. Well, thanks again to everyone for participating in today's call and for your interest in Paycom. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking to everybody next quarter. So thank you. Operator : Our conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig, and welcome to everyone joining us today for the call. We had strong financial results for the third quarter of 2014. Our total revenues of $36.6 million grew 42% from the comparable prior year period. Highlighting our success annualized new recurring revenue or ANRR was a record $14.9 million in the third quarter of 2014, up 52% from the comparable prior year period. As a reminder, ANRR is the annualized amount of the first full month of already on-boarded new recurring revenue and we view it as a robust indicator of our future revenue. Our ANRR growth is a testament to both of our new client wins and also our ongoing success in bringing on larger clients. It reflects the growing demand for our industry leading software solution. We've made great progress so far in 2014, checking off several of our goals as we strive to become the leader in the payroll and human capital management industry. From our five new sales teams to our ongoing application introductions and enhancements and our initial public offering, our momentum is strong and growing. We are taking active steps to ensure that this momentum is sustained through the fourth quarter and beyond. Regarding our cloud bases SaaS solution we are relentless in our efforts to ensure that our solution remains best in class. We continue to drive our software development in the third quarter of 2014 with adjusted R&D increasing approximately 100% on a year-over-year basis. Our software efforts are helping drive our results. We continue to see examples of clients turning to Paycom when competing offerings like the functionality and ease of use our solution has. I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes discussing an upcoming enhancement to our solution that we believe will drive substantial value to our current and future clients and also drive growth for Paycom. As you know, the Affordable Care Act or ACA was a transformative piece of legislation in this country. The requirements imposed on individuals and organizations are significant. At Paycom, we quickly realize that our clients had many questions about how to obtain and maintain compliance with the ACA. Our early responses made Paycom a trusted resource for the ACA in the payroll and human capital management industry. We have been a leader for some time in providing education and timely information to our clients and HR professionals alike. More and more businesses are turning to Paycom for expertise in navigating the ACA. In addition to be a trusted resource of ACA information, we also provide solutions. And because of our proprietary SaaS platform, we are able to change and update our applications to meet the ever changing employer mandate. In fact, I am pleased to share with you that this Thursday we are releasing an industry leading ACA solution. This comprehensive solution will encompass robust functionality, empowering employers to navigate one of their single largest changes to the healthcare system our county has ever seen. Paycom's new and existing clients that utilize our payroll, time and attendance, benefit administration and HR management applications have the resources they need to be fully compliant with all ACA employer mandated requirements. With this functionality, the clients will be able to deploy information needed in order to remain ACA compliant. We believe our answer to the ACA mandate is unparallel. This upcoming development is just one of the ways that our R&D investments are resulting in innovation. Paycom is helping HR professionals evolve into a strategic role and become a valued resource to the (inaudible). In our experience, we are seeing that potential clients cannot find the functionality they require with competing offerings. If you want an easy way to do it all, including a full service payroll option, Paycom is the best solution. This value proposition is resonating with current and prospective clients as evidenced by our 52% ANRR revenue growth. I would like to share with you a few examples of some new client wins from the third quarter that illustrate the breadth of the appeal of the Paycom SaaS Solution. These new clients hail from very different industries and geographies indicating the broad success we are experiencing in the marketplace. First, we signed a parking solution provider with nearly 2,000 employees converting them from one of our large competitors. This client had been maintaining five separate systems. They were excited to switch to Paycom as they were looking for an innovative partner that can grow alongside them. Next, we added a restaurant chain with multiple locations and close to 2000 employees. This client had been handling their payroll and HR needs with an in-house solution. The risk mitigation and clear benefits from automation were appealing to this client. Finally, we were excited to bring a regional health insurance provider with over 1500 employees on to the Paycom Solution. This company was utilizing one of the other SaaS provider\u2019s solution and was having issues with maintaining and integrating the spare data in systems. We are particularly proud of this last deal as it was generated by one of the five new sales teams we recently launched beginning of this year. And this shows how quickly our teams can get up to speed. In addition to our leading SaaS Solution, our go-to-market strategy is one of keys to our success. The success of our sales organization continues to improve as we become more seasoned and as word spreads regarding the power of our solution. As an example, our Tulsa, Oklahoma team is on pace to achieve nearly $2.5 million in ANRR this year. This achievement is even more remarkable when you consider that the city of Tulsa has a population of approximately 440,000. When you compare that to a city like New York where we currently have a single sales team just now reaching maturity, we believe the run rate for adding new teams to current cities as long and the potential for growth and mature teams is also substantial. We also have had consistent success with our new sales teams. We are continuing that trend and align the ground work for additional new sales team launches soon. We have deployed our office group to sign leases. And they are setting up office space for the new sales teams we will be announcing very soon. It is our strategy to deploy as many sales teams as we can to provide a platform for our future growth. We will do this while also sustaining our current growth and, just as importantly, remaining profitable. And on a more personal note, I want to mention that I have spent some time visiting our sales teams around the country. I am pleased to report that the excitement level in the field is strong and growing. Our sales associates recognize that they are armed with a highly compelling solution and they are in front of a sizeable opportunity consisting of thousands of potential clients, all of them can benefit from the capabilities of the Paycom Solution. We are continuing to ensure our sales team members at the most powerful emanation as evidenced by our upcoming ACA offering, as well as several other enhancements to our solution. In conclusion, our forward progress continued in the third quarter of 2014. Clients are embracing our solution with enthusiasm. Our 42% revenue growth as well as our outperformance in ANRR with 52% growth is evidence of this success. Additionally, our software development productivity was impressive. We are optimistic as we look to execute against our opportunity for continued growth and to lead the payroll and human capital management industries with our cutting edge cloud-based solution. We continue to believe that our ability to provide a comprehensive human capital management offering creating and hosted of a flexible, single database architecture is a key differentiator for Paycom. With that, I will now turn the call over to Craig to discuss our financial results. Craig Boelte :  Thanks, Chad. Before I review our fiscal third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP financial measures that excludes stock-based compensation and other non-recurring charges including transactions expenses related to our initial public offering. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the table on our press release. As Chad highlighted, we saw continued robust growth in the third quarter. Total revenues were $36.6 million representing year-over-year growth of 41.7% from the comparable prior year period. While our growth was primarily driven by new client additions by our mature sales teams we\u2019re also starting to see additions from our more recently opened sales teams. Additionally, we continue to increase the average revenue per client as we continue to onboard larger clients. Within total revenues, recurring revenues was $35.9 million representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 42.4% from the comparable prior year period. ANRR was $14.9 million, up from $9.8 million in the same period last year and representing 52% growth from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $30.2 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 82.4%. This compares to 79.3% in the third quarter of 2013. As we have detailed in prior calls, our cost of revenue consists largely of hosting and support cost, along with employee-related expenses for client support, and ACHDs. The sequential improvement in gross margin was largely driven by cost disciplines across most of the inputs that make up our total cost of sales. While we recognize the gross margin improvement for the third quarter of 2014 we also recognize the need to stay ahead of the growth on a staffing basis. We invested heavily at the beginning of the year to account for new sales team growth and, as Chad mentioned, we are preparing for new sales teams in the upcoming months and we will meet the staff appropriately to handle the anticipated new business. As such, we expect overall gross margin to be similar to historic levels going forward. Turning to operating expenses, as a reminder, we pay commission to our sales reps basically on new sales at the time of their first month of billing cycle. This is a one-time commission pay which we recoup over the life of the client relationship. For the third quarter, total adjusted administrative expenses were $25.4 million. This compares to $18 million in the third quarter of 2014. As Chad mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to increase our software development staff. We continue to invest heavily in technology with adjusted research and development expense increasing 100.6% from the comparable prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.6 million or 18% of revenue compared to $3.8 million or 14.6% of revenue in the third quarter of 2013. From time-to-time you will see variability in our adjusted EBITDA margin as we continue to invest for growth. Regarding the third quarter of 2014 we are starting to absorb cost of new sales teams. Non-GAAP net income was $2.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share based on 53 million shares versus a breakeven net income or 0 per diluted share based on 46 million shares in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of $18.5 million and debt of $27.2 million. As a reminder, this debt represents the financing on our corporate head quarters. With that, let me turn to guidance for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect total revenues in the range of $40 million to $41 million representing a growth rate of 33.7% at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $5.5 million to $6.5 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.8% at the midpoint. For fiscal 2014, we expect total revenue to be between $147 million to $148 million or 37.1% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $25 million to $26 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.3% at the midpoint. In summary, our momentum continued into the third quarter and we anticipate ongoing success for the rest of the year as we leverage our investments in R&D and sales and marketing and strive to deliver revenue growth. With that, we will open up the line for quarters. Operator? Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow at Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, this is Harry for Raimo. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter. I have a couple of questions. I guess I would just start of by asking how are you guys -- what kind of traction are you seeing and success are you seeing with your non-payroll modules? Chad Richison : Thanks for the question, Harry. This is Chad. We do see it as a one solution as we've discussed earlier. The longer we had a module out the more success we have not only selling it but also implement it and increased. So we continue to drive all products or all modules into the client base. Unidentified Analyst : And good client feedback and from a competitive standpoint otherwise happy clients. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean you have to continuously develop the modules I mean as you put them out initially I mean version seven is always better than version one. We've learned a lot over the years in how we've released the modules. We've taken a lot of knowledge from that in the past and we continue to work on our modules. Unidentified Analyst : And can you guys give a little bit of an update on your plans for new offices that you\u2019ve talked about a little bit of that? Chad Richison : Yes, so our goal is to continue to penetrate both existing cities as well as open new cities with sales teams. As I mentioned in the past, we do take existing sales managers who are proven, we relocate them to a new city or in a current city where we\u2019re going to add a new team as I mentioned earlier like a city like New York and then we backfill them with an up and coming sales executive who is ready to be in management. We've identified several mangers who are ready to relo as well as several backfills to be able to backfill those positions. And as I mentioned in the call earlier we are currently -- we have deployed our office sales team setup group. We are in the process of negotiating leases and getting those prepared to be able to launch sales teams. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And the five new sales teams that you guys added this quarter, were those existing city expansions or new cities? Chad Richison : We did not add five sales teams this quarter. Those are the five sales teams added earlier in this year first quarter of this year. They are doing well and we did have at least one of the examples I mentioned of one of our current sales did come from one of those new sales teams but they\u2019re trending nicely. Unidentified Analyst : Got it great. Thanks. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Richard Davis at Canaccord. Richard Davis - Canaccord: Hey, thanks very much. Two kind of pretty straight forward questions, one, when we kind of talk with companies or customers that use your product, ease of use always kind of comes out as a key factor, and then I know it\u2019s about the back end database but is there anything on the front end that you\u2019re doing to make it easier to use because it\u2019s always easy to use is always kind of a new thing, so just more on the software development side of the house. And then you talked about kind of adding people. The second question would be, are you \u2013 because when I thought a lot of companies may -- and it\u2019s hard to find people, you guys are doing a good job on that \u2013 could you just kind of triangulate around finding the people I mean obviously you\u2019re doing a good job people. I mean obviously, you're doing a good job here, but help me out on that. Thanks. Chad Richison :  Sure. Okay. So on the first question, it's really I think understanding not only why prospects by but also how they are going to use the system. I think ease of use is all about innovation; it\u2019s being able to sit down and watch people actually use the system; we\u2019re users of our own system. We do actually invite clients in; we watch them use the system. And we were active in soliciting, as well as documenting client feedback to make ease of use a key. The easier your system is to use the more they are going to use it and the stronger -- the stronger overall solution we have provided. As far as good people, a lot of what Paycom and lot of what we have done in the past is hire good people and give them the proper training and support they need to grow. And so from that, we are able to find good educate people that want to come in and be a part of our organization. And so, really for us it's finding good people that care, who are educated and wish to be a part of this team. And then, from there we give them the tools to the proper training and support as well as management needed to growth their career. Richard Davis - Canaccord: Excellent. Great. Thank you so much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle at Pacific Crest Securities. Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities :  Thanks so much. Chad, I\u2019m interested in your commentary on the ACA Solutions. And I\u2019m curious as to what people are doing now otherwise and what your competitors are even trying to offer in place of this, given how much it is changing? Chad Richison : Yes. So -- and I appreciate you stating that that fact that ACA is -- it actually is still changing. I mean, there are still rigs that we are looking for. A part of the ACA goes into effect 2015 with report to do 2016. There is a piece of it that goes into effect in 2016 for 2017 and then even another in 2018, and even the range changes for -- who complies with what pace as far as the payer play component. And so, we have done a couple things. Number one, it\u2019s important to mention that a lot of the information needed comes out of both a time and attendance system, because ACA I really based on hours worked to identify who those are, who are full-time employees so that we know which employers are even eligible. As well as there is a component for making the healthcare affordable. And in that case, you need to know how much an employee's premium is as far as what they are responsible to pay, coupled with how much the employee makes. And so -- and then there is documentation of this, including the notice of the exchange from the beginning, and that's notifying employees that are even eligible for the ACA. And so, with the Paycom System, we were actually able to take three of our models that we have currently. And really if clients have already implemented our time and attendance benefit administration and have our document storage system and on boarding process, they are really able to take that. There is very little they are going to need to do to be able to maintain it, because we are able to grab the information from the same system and provide the reporting. Now for those clients that may not have all of those systems and may be they have not chosen to implement those systems yet, we have developed a system that's actually coming out Thursday, which will allow them to input the information that does not currently exist because they are not using that piece of the system that will grab the pertinent data that we do have at a payroll and allow them to comply with the ACA mandate. Regardless of which path someone chooses, at the end of the day, Paycom will be helping clients with their Form 1095 for employees, which will be due in February 2016 for everything done through -- for the year of 2015, as well as the employer copy 1094. And so, there is a lot of moving parts. There is -- if you don't play, you penalize those payments and thus is collecting money for that, remitting it to the IRIS. We\u2019re still waiting on regs on that even for who that's remitted to and how that's remitted. So anyway, I'll stop there, but there is a lot going on with ACA and we feel like what we're providing is strong. Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities : Great. That was helpful color. And Chad, and maybe this is more of a question for Craig. The ANRR was impressive at 52% year-on-year growth. We only have a limited numbers going back. When was the last time you guys saw that kind of growth level? Craig Boelte : I mean that's definitely one of the largest growth year-over-year that we have seen in the past. As we reported last quarter, we were in the 40% range on that. So this was a very impressive quarter for growth. Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities : And you highlighted some of the reasons why it was better in terms of the additional products. But in terms of how we think about it the growth trending, should we be thinking of this more than 50% versus a 40% type growth rate? Craig Boelte : No, it can have some variability from quarter-to-quarter based on when deals come on. But the 50% growth rate was a very impressive number for this quarter and we look forward to continuing to bring on new business. Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities : Terrific. Thanks, guys. Chad Richison :  Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Reback at Stifel. Brad Reback - Stifel:  Hey guys. Thanks a lot. On ACA Solutions, will the gross margin on that product be similar than the rest of your portfolio? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean I would say -- I mean, for sure it will be similar to the rest of our portfolio. I mean, payroll is the hardest thing we do as far as keeping it with all the tax laws and what have you. And payroll has other components involved depending on which date we\u2019re filing taxes with and what they\u2019ll actually accept. We\u2019re going, we\u2019re learning ACA as far as how it\u2019s deposited and penalties may be deposited and how it\u2019s all filed and reconciled but we would expect this to be a high gross margin product as we've developed it to be. Brad Reback - Stifel: Great and just one follow up related, any reasons to think that you won\u2019t have more sales teams added in \u201815 than you did in \u201814? Thanks. Chad Richison : Well that\u2019s a loaded question there. We are definitely always trying to accelerate our growth in all areas and as opportunities present itself I mean we\u2019re looking to capture them. Right now we\u2019re talking with our existing sales management staff to identify who is ready to relocate and start these new teams and then be able to actually backfill them with the strong bench we have ready to do that. And so as we've identified these people we\u2019ll start opening in these cities but we do believe we\u2019re ready to begin opening several here very soon. Brad Reback - Stifel: Great, thanks a lot. Chad Richison : All right. Well thanks everybody. I want to thank everybody for participating in today\u2019s call and we look forward to speaking to everyone again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Richard Davis - Canaccord Genuity Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities Corey Greendale - First Analysis Operator : Hello and welcome to the Paycom Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2014 Results Teleconference. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig Boelte, Chief Financial Officer of Paycom.

A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our press release that we issued after the close of the market today, which is located on our website paycom.com. I'll now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig, and thank you everyone joining us today. We have a lot of ground to cover as 2014 was a transformative year for Paycom with many achievements and incredible progress. Let's start with our fourth quarter and full year results. I will quickly touch on our results at a high level while letting Craig handle a deeper look at our financials. We had a stellar fourth quarter with revenue of $44 million representing growth of 45.4% from the comparable prior year period. This growth rate is a testament to the ongoing compelling nature of the Paycom Solution. We are continuing to see success in the marketplace as perspective clients continue to see the value offered by a robust yet easy to use single date base offering. For the fourth quarter of 2014, our adjusted EBITDA was $7.8 million, which represents growth of 120.7% from the comparable prior period. Now let's take a look at our full year results. For the full year 2014, our revenue was nearly $151 million which grew 40.3% compared to 2013. For the full year 2014, our adjusted EBITDA was $27 million. In addition to offering best-in-class functionality and allowing rapid product development, our single data base platform in history is a cloud provider from day one allows Paycom to be very profitable as our results for this quarter and the full year underscore. We ended the year with 1,021 employees which represents employee growth of 21.5% over the comparable prior period. This contrast with our revenue growth of 40.3% for the same period and highlights the increasing productivity of our team. 2014 was a pivotal year for Paycom as we hit several key milestones in our goal to become the leading provider of payroll and HCM services. We went public in April, and our initial public offering has broaden our visibility and profile and has helped to spread the Paycom message with potential clients as we continue to grow. We expanded our sales office footprint in 2014, adding five new sales offices in the first quarter and laying the foundation for our future growth. These new offices are continuing to ramp up and every passing month we are encouraged by their improving performance. Today we are pleased to announce that we continue to build on our momentum with the opening of new sales offices. This past month we opened an additional five new sales offices bringing our total sales teams to 36. These new sales offices are located in Cincinnati, Kansas City, Nashville, Pittsburgh, and a second New York City office located in Brooklyn. It is our strategy to open new offices with proven sales managers from an existing territory and we are excited to deploy these proven sales professionals and what we anticipate will be very productive territories for Paycom. As a reminder, it typically takes a new sales team 24 months to reach maturity. So these new offices announced today are poised to drive growth in 2017 and beyond. We are optimistic that our offices opened this month will share in the success our established offices have enjoyed today. Our sales executives are second to none in terms of their drive, attitude and training. They also have the benefit of selling what we believe is the premiere solution in the industry. When we survey the landscape and evaluate the feedback we receive from our current and perspective clients, we believe that there remains ample run way for ongoing growth as Human Resource professionals and forward thinking C-suite executives continue to learn about the benefits they can achieve with the Paycom Solution. Let me spend a couple of minutes highlighting a few examples of new clients that joined the Paycom family in the fourth quarter. These examples were chosen from a large pool of new clients to showcase the breadth of appeal of our solution. All of these new clients were using a SaaS provider. First we converted the healthcare provider with roughly 3,700 employees, they had been using a variety of vendors across payroll, time and attendance and benefit administration. They chose Paycom for our superior Affordable Care Act reporting abilities, as well as the very attractive option of consolidating all of these functions under one provider. This client will also utilize our background check capabilities, which is a crucial function for a healthcare organization. Next, we signed a higher education client with nearly 300,000 employees. This client had been using one of the legacy providers SaaS offerings and was attracted that the robust reporting capabilities offered by the Paycom Solution. And it's worth noting that the economic impact of our solution presented a significant economic return for this organization. And finally but not least, we broaden a quick service restaurant group with over 2,000 employees. This company was using a separate HR and payroll offering and wanted to have a single solution. I\u2019m very pleased that we are going to drive over $75,000 a year at these clients bottom-line. I'd also like to point out that all three of these examples are clients with employee basis had at least 2,000 which underscores the trend of Paycom reaching further up market and is evidence of the flexibility and scalability of our solution. Turing to our solution, our R&D spending increased over 100% in 2014 and we were able to generate substantially more functionality including Push Reporting, Candidate Tracker, Surveys and Schedule Exchange. We also launched our Affordable Care Act offerings which is enjoying great traction these early days of the act, as client seek to understand the impact of the Affordable Care Act and how they need to stay compliance with the evolving requirements of this legislation. All of these enhancements are the result of listening carefully to our clients and responding quickly to their request and also working to anticipate their needs. We are able to leverage our single database architecture and our skill development teams to create new enhancements quickly and efficiently. Today, we are extremely excited to announce the launch of a new application that we have been working on for nearly a year. Paycom Learning, our Learning Management System or LMS represents what we believe will be the best-in-class learning management system in the marketplace. Paycom Learning is a new application and like all of Paycom applications, it's really just additional functionality of the same solution and does not require any integration. Paycom Learning will allow our clients to offer educational modules to their employees. Workers often need to obtain certifications or recertification\u2019s in order to maintain their status or improve their career path. Additionally, new hires are often required to take mandatory training courses like ethics, compliance, company overviews, skills or job safety during their on-boarding process, just a name of few. Traditional HCM vendors learning systems are often comprised of multiple point products for multiple vendors. We don't run into many companies that offer LMS within their full-suite of payroll and HR offerings. With the Paycom system, everything is provided in one solution. For example, the Paycom LMS video is viewed in a browser and does not require to download of video software to view. This makes it easier for all employees to complete their course. Additionally, the system makes it easy to connect the learning and certification to the applicable job title. Even pay levels can adjust to reflect employee progress. This saves time for both the employee and also HR professionals, further enhancing the efficiency of the organization. We look forward to introducing this new offering to the marketplace and we believe, we will see strong appeal for Paycom Learning as companies continue to realize the benefits they can achieve by going with the single database system. To conclude, we had a great first year as a public company. We believe our compelling offering, dedicated sales force, and continued product innovation will help us to sustain our momentum through 2015 and beyond. Now I'll turn the call over to Craig to discuss our financial results and outlook. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks Chad. Before I review our fiscal fourth quarter and full year results and also our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal 2015, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income, our non-GAAP financial measures that excludes stock-based compensation and other non-recurring charges including transaction expenses related to our initial public offering and our recent secondary offering. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release. Our fourth quarter results were strong with total revenues of $44 million representing year-over-year growth of 45.4% from the comparable prior year period. Our growth in the fourth quarter continued to be primarily driven by new client additions by our mature sales teams, door are most recently opened sales teams are producing on track with our expectations. For the full year 2014, total revenue of $150.9 million represents growth of 40.3% as compared to 2013. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $43.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 45.1% from the comparable prior year period. Annualized New Recurring Revenue or ANRR was $20.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 up from $14.3 million in the same period last year and representing 43.8% growth from the comparable prior year period. For the full year 2014, ANRR was $59.6 million representing growth of $41.8% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $36.5 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 82.8%. This compares to 80.4% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Cost of revenue consist largely of hosting and support cost along with the employee-related expenses for client support, and ACH to fees. For 2015, we expect overall gross margin to be approximately 78% to 82%. Turning to operating expenses; as a reminder, we pay commissions to our sales reps based solely on new sales at the time of their first monthly billing cycle. This is a one-time commission pay which we recoup over the life of the client relationship. When we experience strong sales performance in a quarter, there is a potential for us to see increased expenses in that quarter depending on the time of when the sales occur. For the fourth quarter, total adjusted administrative expenses were $30.7 million. This compares to $23.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.8 million or 17.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $3.5 million or 11.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, adjusted EBITDA was $27 million representing approximately 18% of revenue as compared to $19.9 million or 18.5% of revenue in 2013. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $3.1 million or $0.06 per diluted share based on approximately $54 million shares versus a non-GAAP net loss of $100,000 or zero per diluted share based on approximately $46 million shares in the year ago period. For the full year 2014, non-GAAP net income was $9.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share as compared with non-GAAP net income of $2.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share in 2013. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $25.1 million and debt of $27 million. As a reminder, this debt represents the financing on our corporate headquarters. With that, let me turn to guidance for the first quarter and for fiscal 2015. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect total revenues in the range of $49 million to $50 million representing a growth rate of approximately 34% at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $9 million to $10 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19% at the midpoint. For fiscal 2015, we expect total revenues to be between $194 million to $196 million or 29% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $32 million to $34 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17% at the midpoint. In summary, we had an excellent fourth quarter, which capped a strong first year as a public company for Paycom. With that, we will open the lines up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow at Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, this is Harry on the phone for Raimo. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a really great quarter and the new product. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on that. So how do you see the product with regard to early traction with your existing customers? Competitively, are you doing rip and replace of I guess it would be maybe cornerstone, or what are you seeing on that end? And in terms of pricing, how is that shaking out? Chad Richison : Thanks Harry. So this is a product that we actually released to our sales organization three weeks ago. I know that we have brought in one deal as of last week I believe and it's in conversion right now. So it's still very early. This is a product we\u2019ve been working on for a year but really we started this when we entered the talent management market about 2.5 years ago. We knew this would be an area that we would end up developing out. And as we listen to both prospect and customer demand, this was an area that we thought would have some traction. And so we\u2019ve developed that out like with any products we do develop. We do develop products out that we expect to be best-in-class and we would expect the same with LMS. As far as pricing, this will raise our overall cost per employee which we have right now just to annualize which we have right now stands at about 400. We haven't given any hard, fast numbers on exactly how much that would be but this will be an additional cost as an add-on to our talent management functionality. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And just a quick follow-up from a high-level, obviously, as you mentioned, it's still very, very early. But what have your conversations with customers generally been like, if you've had any other than that one that you've brought in generally positive feedback? Have they've been a part of testing on any level? Chad Richison : Yes. We definitely had a focus group come in as we were going through our development of the product. And some of the focused group were our current customers. All companies, especially customers that we work with or prospects that we actually sell in our employee count range that we go after, they are all providing training at some level for their employees. And so they are all doing this either using another product or more often than not we\u2019re going to be seeing them using multiple products and doing it manually. There are number of products that you could cobble together to actually perform these tasks which many companies do. And then there are also companies out there that do this through their Learning Management System, you mentioned one earlier. And so, we\u2019re going to be seeing a mix of both and we are excited to be getting out there with this product. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Nemeroff at Credit Suisse. Michael Nemeroff : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. And congratulations on a really strong quarter and a good end to the year. So a couple of questions. New office openings, five at the end of this year, which is going to drive growth in 2017. I understand that. Is there any chance that you would maybe step on the accelerator and open more than what you're thinking over the next couple of quarters, let's say, and then really trying to juice that growth a little bit faster? Chad Richison : We are definitely happy that we were able to open up five this first quarter. I know we somewhat set a trend and then we opened up five first quarter of 2013. We are always looking for the opportunity to open up new offices and as I mentioned before, our model is, we take an existing sales manager who has proven, relocate them to a new office and then backfill them with an up and coming sales rep who has proven to be a leader and therefore able to be a sales manager. So, a little harder to do when you have seven offices and it's gets a little easier when you have 15 officers and gets little easier when you have 31 and 36 offices. And so, we still do have a bench of sales managers that are ready to relocate. We also have a bench of people that are ready to backfill them. Right now we are going to focus on absorbing those offices that we have opened to ensure success. And then as we make moves in subsequent quarters, we will definitely be announcing those. Michael Nemeroff : That's helpful. So, the first example that you mentioned, Chad, in your prepared remarks of a 3,700 employee company. I'm just curious, how long was the sales cycle was that versus some of the other smaller ones? And how experienced a salesperson did that close that in? And as you start to move up and sign larger companies, would you consider hiring more enterprise-level salespeople, which I know is somewhat inconsistent with your current sales training model? Chad Richison : I will say this, as far as the 3,700 employee company, we chose this from a sampling of clients that we've actually brought on. I can't point to the exact sales rep that has sold this. This may have been a sales rep that's been with this for four months. We have a world-class training program. We do put out reps that can sell enterprise level companies right now and if you want to say enterprise is above 2,000, or enterprise is above 3,000, we\u2019ve proven that quarter-after-quarter as we have continued on. So, we are looking to continue to add sales reps at the new offices that we're opening right now, five new offices we are opening, we\u2019ll be adding sales reps to that. We\u2019ll continue to add sales reps to maintain 100% staffing in the offices we're in. We have chosen the model that we chosen to be able to actually hire very intelligent people with Bachelor Degrees or better. Some have outside sales experience, many do not. Some are changing career. We have chosen that model. We do feel like we have great success with that. I do think our numbers from last year and years prior actually reflect that. So, I'm very proud of the group that we have our sales group. I think they are second to none. And if I could find better people to do it a better way, then we would be a change into the model. But again we feel very confident in our model and the success we are having. Michael Nemeroff : That's great. And just one quick one for Craig. The gross margin guidance that you gave for 2015 was 78% to 82%. It's been firmly over 80% for the last couple of years. I'm just curious, is there anything in that 78% to 82% that would cause you to think that it will be closer to 78%, or what's the logic behind that? Craig Boelte : No, that's just the range we gave. As we continue to open the offices, we need to staff and train ahead of that growth and to handle that new business coming in. So we'll continue to have cost discipline in the gross margin but you don't want to give a range in that just to handle that growth. Michael Nemeroff : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Have a good night. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Murphy at JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Thank you. I will add my congratulations as well, Chad. You had mentioned several wins with companies above the 2,000-employee level. And so I'm curious, when you look at the 2015 deal pipeline, is that also tilting in the direction of larger organizations? So do you think there's some kind of a sustainable change afoot here? Chad Richison : We have really been focused on those clients that have greater than 100 employees for a while. Now I say that in 2013, we put out as part of our S-1 filing, we put out that 86% of our revenue came from companies that had greater than 50 employees and we definitely are not going to ignore that market either. But we do have sales reps that continue to gain confidence in our value proposition as well as a market that's gaining confidence in our value proposition as we've moved up market. And again as someone has success selling a 2000 employee company, and then you realize that 3000 employee company isn\u2019t that much different. And we have success selling that. And then as we have more sales reps by nature we\u2019re going to sell more of them. And so, I\u2019m not going to say that we\u2019re necessarily shifting our market in a different direction, we\u2019re just having people that are having success selling businesses. This isn't our first quarter to have companies that have well over 2000 employees on-boarded onto our system and so. I see that trend continuing as well as ICS to continue to sell in the mid-market, which we\u2019ve been successful at. Mark Murphy : Okay, great. In terms of the Affordable Care Act offering, is there any way to quantify the contribution? For example, is that providing a tailwind for the ANRR growth that is detectable to you? Is it adding a point or a few points here and there? And given the dynamic that's driving that, does that feel as though it's going to be sustainable? Chad Richison : I wouldn't be able to necessarily say, because our ACA product is a part of our overall system, it's not something that at this point in time we\u2019re charging more for. It\u2019s included in our system. There will be some additional fees if everything holds together and the rigs are correct and everything. At the end of 2015, first of 2016 as we file Form 1094s, as well as Form 1095s for both employers and employees. I couldn\u2019t necessarily say that ACA is providing us a tailwind it is a conversation piece. And I do think that the way we provide our ACA products very important for clients especially those that want to do less of the work, because again if you have our benefits administration system, time and attendant system, and document storage system, all in one system, you have a substantial amount of work already completed for you and everything is right there. And so I think the way we tied it together probably has helped us win some deals. I don\u2019t know if we wouldn\u2019t have won those deals anyway. So it\u2019s just hard to quantify the tailwind that's there. Mark Murphy : Okay, great. And, Chad, the last question for me. Have you detected any evolution in terms of the platforms that you are displacing? For example, if you were to look across ADP, Ceridian Paychecks, ERP vendors, you mentioned the SaaS vendors as well in your prepared comments. Is that mix trending in any particular direction, or are you seeing any different type of behavior from any of those categories? Chad Richison : They have always been very competitive and I would actually include our large incumbent as SaaS vendors. They do have SaaS offerings. It would be very rare for us to go out and convert someone from an installed product today. If we're converting someone from one of our competitors whether it's a newer SaaS competitor or whether it\u2019s an incumbent vendor, we\u2019re converting them from their SaaS offering. And so, our competitors have always been extremely competitive and we continuously see them innovate their products and that hasn't changed in this last quarter. Mark Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from John DiFucci at Jefferies. John DiFucci : Thank you. Hi, Chad and Craig. My first question is a follow-up to Mark's, just his last one. You obviously had a head start on the established payroll processes with cloud services building your system from the ground up as a multi-tenant solution and being able to add modules on that, all as one contiguous solution. But now, these cloud vendors, as Chad, you talked about, they're actually pushing offerings that they tout as cloud-based services themselves. In some cases, they're different, or at least they don't quite have the same kind of efficiency, at least the infrastructure doesn't appear to be that way. But I'm just curious, are you seeing -- you mentioned that that's who you're going up against, but are you seeing any increased friction as they really -- increased sales friction, as they really start to push these products when they realize that they need to do that? Chad Richison : I would go back to what I said early and maybe try to explain on that little bit more. Our competitors whether it be incumbent or other SaaS - traditional SaaS providers, have always been extremely competitive. It's really about the total value proposition. The cloud hasn't been a key differentiator for us for probably eight years. When we're going up against our competitors, they are in the cloud, they\u2019re using their cloud version or a true cloud product. And so, and from the client side that's what they know. They log in on the Internet, it\u2019s there, it's on the Internet, and it allows them to do their work. And so, it is not unlike years passed all of these vendors be it incumbent or SaaS vendors continue to get better at what they do. And that's why we have continued to innovate our product to keep what we feel is a very strong value proposition for those clients. John DiFucci : Okay, thanks, Chad. I apologize for the background noise here. I'm actually on a train. But I guess the numbers speak for themselves too, when you think competitively. But I guess one other question, and this is a question you get asked by investors. Some of your most mature offices, which I would say could probably some of your most productive offices, are in the location where your headquarters are in the oil patch. And I assuming that they are generating good business there. Given the issues around the energy sector, I'm just wondering if that's had any affect on your business with these customers and these particular -- in that region? Or do you expect any affect? Chad Richison : Right. We do get that question, I mean I think back to your prior statement, the numbers do reflect what's going on here. Now this isn't our first, we've been in business since 1998, and in 2008 we didn't have 36 officers or even 20 or 15 officers. And so, we were heavily concentrated in the Southwest in the Midwest. And we went through the oil crisis or whatever you want to call it then, with very little impact on our business. I mean as oil prices go down, it does have a tendency to hurt many companies and their employment. And then other companies do get a little bit of an uptick when the price of oil goes down. And so, we aren\u2019t heavily concentrated across any one industry. We are very diversified in that and I think that helped us. An answer to your question would no, we have not seen any impact that we could point to based on the price of oil. John DiFucci : Okay, great. Nice job, guys. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Richard Davis at Canaccord. Richard Davis : Thanks. Two things, one, thanks for trying to recruit my daughter. That was nice. Two, maybe it's the radio stations that I listen to, but I hear a decent number of ads for you guys. Could you talk about how you think about radio and, more broadly, media advertising as a driver of demand for your various offices? Thanks. Craig Boelte : Yeah, I will tell you that, we really use radio as more of a branding if you will for companies that we\u2019re already in. Maybe little bit of a softening the beaches. We get very little business from either radio advertising or even pay per click type advertising. So our sales model is direct. We also do have referrals that we do receive from both our current clients and third-party influencers. And so it's hard to say, but our phone isn\u2019t ringing from the radio ads. But they\u2019re good branding. And if we're already in there talking to someone, and they do hear our ad, it is some good branding. Richard Davis : Got it. So it's more of an overlay, which makes sense. Okay. Craig Boelte : It's a part of a marketing - it\u2019s one piece of our overall marketing strategy which includes radio, direct mail, through email, training seminars and I can continue on and on. Richard Davis : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle at Pacific Crest Securities. Brendan Barnicle : Thanks so much. Chad and Craig, does the adjusted EBITDA guidance include just those five new offices that you're announcing today, or have you left room for additional office openings? Craig Boelte : Our adjusted EBITDA guidance we are guided through the full year as well as the first quarter. Obviously our first quarter included those five new offices that we\u2019re opening. And as new offices come on, the cost of those new offices comes on over time as well. So at this point, we\u2019ve definitely included for those five offices opening first quarter. Brendan Barnicle : But have you left yourself any room if you decide some market looks good that you hadn't planned on that maybe open in the back half of the year or later this year? Craig Boelte : We are always going to look at opportunities, during the year and I would say, we obviously had some room, for opening new offices throughout the year. Brendan Barnicle : Great. And you guys are now at 36 offices. How many do you think you can do here in the U.S.? Chad Richison : So this is Chad, I think we can do well over 100 offices in the U.S. Brendan Barnicle : Chad, would you get to that 100 level before you looked at maybe doing international, or at what point would you think about some of the international expansion? Chad Richison : I could necessarily answer that, I mean as I sit here today, I mean we\u2019re going to be responsible with the way we grow the company both our topline as well as, - as you mentioned the adjusted EBITDA and our margins. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to do that and do it in a way that make sense. I think as long as we're having success doing what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re going to do that. And the market in the U.S., is over $20 billion market today and that's the outsource piece and so you have a whole other side that doesn\u2019t currently a user vendor. And so, we are squarely focused on the market that we have today, there is a lot of opportunity for us as well as others that are out there. And so, we\u2019re going to look to capture that as we sit here today. Brendan Barnicle : Terrific. Thanks guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Corey Greendale at First Analysis. Corey Greendale : Congratulations on a great year. So a couple questions. First of all, just a housekeeping question. I'm sure this will be in the K, but what was your retention rate in 2014? Chad Richison : Our retention rate in 2014 was 91% consistent with our prior years. Corey Greendale : Great. Next question, slicing and dicing your growth drivers a number of different ways, given that you keep adding products, and it sounds like you're moving up customer size. I would think that even your mature offices are still growing to some degree, is that right? Can you give us some sense of the growth rate of a typical mature office right now? Chad Richison : That's not something we\u2019ve talked about but it is true that the longer and offices opening, is opened the stronger their pipeline and one can deduct from that, the more they are going to sell over time. Corey Greendale : Okay. And then, Craig, you somewhat addressed this question on the gross margin. But I think the guidance, if you take the midpoint of the 2015 guidance, it implies that EBITDA margin is down about 100 basis points. Is that just because you have more non-mature offices, and is that primarily played out in the gross margin line or is there anything else you'd highlight? Chad Richison : No, we are continuing to staff, we\u2019ll have to continue to staff those new offices as well as continue to ramp up the offices that we opened last year and so that's reflected in adjusted EBITDA number. Corey Greendale : Okay. And the R&D spend in Q4 picked up a little more than at least we had modeled. Is that -- are you actually spending more, or was it a different capitalization rate? And what are your thoughts on R&D spend in 2015? Chad Richison : R&D spend for 2015 is going to continue to increase. We\u2019re very focused on our R&D, we\u2019re very focused on product creation, as we\u2019re able to roll-out several products last year, one substantial product also at the beginning of this year that we talked about. We actually had other pieces of functionality that have been rolled out as well although not a significant in fees, overall significant to what we\u2019re able to do and so. We're going to continue that into the year. We\u2019re in a business that it\u2019s a hard business. I mean payroll are hard business, understanding taxes, reciprocity laws, deposit filling rules, ACH rules, settlement rules and whatever, it\u2019s hard business. And so, you have to continue to staff for that, and stay on top of that because it's ever-changing. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to do that and focus on that and with that, yes we will continue to add to our R&D group in 2015. Corey Greendale : Okay. And then just one last quick one for you, Chad. Congratulations on the new product. I think in general, customers at the lower size of your spectrum historically haven't had a learning system. Can you just give some -- do you think that's going to change? Is there some functionality that would make this attractive to smaller employers, or what do you see as the ultimate penetration rate of this product relative to your others? Chad Richison : Well, I definitely think, LMS is something that in the past had been some unreserved for larger businesses of companies that we work with as far as the larger end of the mid market. But I also believe companies that have 50 employees can use an LMS system. I mean they are providing training at 50 and 75 and 100 employees. I mean all rules are starting to apply, training is important. And so, they are providing this to their employees at some level. They are training their employees. They are having their employees go through standard ethics training and other training. And so, I also think it depends on what type of company it is to whether or not they would be more geared toward offering it sooner it rather than later. But I do feel like this is a product that you\u2019re going to see pick up. Again, the easier something is to distribute it, the more companies, the more businesses that are going to purchase it. And so, I think with our product we\u2019ve made it extremely easy to distribute. If you are client with us today, you already have it. All you have to do is call and we can turn it on for you. And so, it makes it easy to distribute the employees are already used to signing in, they are already use to using the full suite of products. And so, I do believe it can have an impact for the smaller end of our mid market as well. Corey Greendale : I think it's a good point, and thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from John DiFucci at Jefferies. John DiFucci : Thanks for taking my second question here. And it's just a follow-up to Brendan's question, and I know you will be asked it. So I rather hope you can address it on the call. Craig, you said that your guidance for adjusted EBITDA does leave some room in case you open up another office or two -- or you didn't say an office or two, but opening perhaps another office. Does your revenue guidance include any contribution from new offices beyond the five you just opened, or does the revenue guidance include the offices you have in existence today? Chad Richison : I can take that. This is Chad. From the revenue perspective, the five offices we've opened in the first quarter will represent a very, very small, somewhat non-existent amount of revenue for us as it relates to 2015. It really going to start having an impact toward the end of 2016 and again they should reach maturity in 2017, as it takes that 24 months. And so, I think again we are going to be very responsible with how we open up offices. We are not going to sacrifice adjusted EBITDA. We don't feel like we\u2019ll need to in order to open up offices. There is multiple levers that we have here and a way to calculate that and one is continuing to generate a good revenue, profitable revenue that we're bringing in to the business. And so, that's the way we are looking at it. We have opened up five, the guidance we\u2019re giving right now is guidance based on those five, as we move into subsequent quarters and if we choose to open up additional offices at that time. We are going to be responsible in a way we've given our guidance and we're going to open them up responsibly. And so, I think we are very comfortable with the guidance we've given today. And we\u2019re going to stand behind that. John DiFucci : Okay, Chad. And I realize that there's very little contribution from the office, but when you open an office at the beginning of the year, if my memory is correct, you can get or expect to get some revenue out of that, maybe $0.5 million or so. So it sounds, though, like in your current guidance, you're assuming the offices you have today. And am I -- I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is that what you just said in a nutshell? Chad Richison : What I want to make sure I understand your question. I guess what I'm saying is that, the offices that we've opened in first quarter of this year as they start, we start hiring into those offices and as those reps start going to training, and then as the rep start building a pipeline, and then as they sell a deal, and then as we start converting that business, and then bring it over as revenue, it's going to take some time. But it will still follow the same timelines that all of our other offices have followed, in which they\u2019ll reach maturity in 24 months. And so, the bulk of the business that we will be bringing on this year, as well as subsequent year, and any years that we've done prior, comes from those offices that are already mature, that have been opened for 24 months or longer with as you mentioned the little bit of sprinkling from the new offices. John DiFucci : Sorry, Chad. I just didn't want to have everybody hear the announcement. But listen, thank you. Appreciate you taking my question. Chad Richison : I think that's our last question. So I want to thank everyone for participating in today\u2019s call. We had a great first year as a public company. We remain very excited about our value proposition. It continues to resonate as clients look for an easier way to do complex things. And we look forward to continued growth and progress into 2015. So, thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending this presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I'll now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig. Thank you to everyone joining us for the call today. This April, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of our IPO. And our first full year as a public company Paycom has evolved across several fronts. We have broadened our application offerings further extending our lead as the best-in-class cloud based payroll and human capital management solution. We expanded our sales footprint to 3016s and we are continuing to develop our current and future sales leader. Most importantly we have built upon our already impressive revenue growth which underscores our continued and growing momentum. I'm pleased to announce very robust first quarter results. Total revenue for the first quarter was $55.2 million representing growth of nearly 50% over the comparable prior year period. Annualized new recurring revenue or ANNR was $20.2 million representing growth of 60.5% over the comparable prior year period. We benefited from several growth drivers in the first quarter. And I'll spend a few moments highlighting some of the key points of our growth. Then I will discuss the enhancements we have made to our platform and how they contribute to our current and ongoing growth. I will share some examples of new client wins in the quarter and show how these illustrate our progress. Craig will then provide some insight into our financials and outlook for the second quarter and fiscal 2015. Turning to our results and growth drivers in the first quarter, we were pleased to see certain synergies beginning to take effect in building momentum, namely the combination of our expanded industry-leading offering along with our increasingly experienced and confident sales force. Our record financial performance this quarter resulted primarily from our mature sales offices along with contributions from our new sales offices continuing to build momentum and adding new clients. That, coupled with increased success selling larger companies, drove our record growth. As many of you know, we opened five new sales offices in the first quarter of 2014 and another five in the same period of 2015. The sales offices launched in 2014 are becoming more seasoned and this is resulting in better financial performance. As we have stated in prior calls, it takes a new sales office approximately 24 months to reach maturity and the offices opened in 2014 are progressing in line with our expectations. In some cases we're even seeing certain new offices outperform our expectations, largely in the form of selling to increasingly larger companies. When a Paycom sales professional see as colleague successfully close a deal with a large business, the impact is electric and contagious. While our target client segment remains companies with 50 to 2,000 employees, we are seeing our sales professionals become increasingly inspired to sell to the large end of our target market and they are frequently seeing success in their efforts. Speaking of our strong and growing team of leaders, I'm incredibly proud of one award in particular, that we received in the first quarter. As an organization, we earned first place recognition among mid-sized companies in the 2015 leadership 500 excellent awards presented by HR.com. HR.com is the largest social networking site for human resource professionals and it is an important voice within our industry that our potential clients trust. We were recognized for our leadership development program and it was extremely satisfying to receive this award as we placed tremendous internal importance on our leadership development and are 100% convinced that our future success is dependent on developing our talents to achieve their highest protection. Let me take a moment to highlight some exciting new client wins we enjoyed in the first quarter. First, we converted a restaurant group with over 3500 employees that had been utilizing one of the large legacy provider SaaS solutions. With Paycom, they were able to eliminate redundant work due to the multiple database infrastructures with their existing provider. And looked forward to enjoying the efficiencies our system has brought to their processes. We also on-boarded a temporary staffing company with over 2500 employees. This company had not been using a competing service. With a clear perspective on the landscape of provider options, this client chose Paycom to help them grow and become more efficient. Finally, we signed a building products company with over 2,000 employees that had been using multiple SaaS providers. They desired a single vendor for both their payroll and human resource software and were attracted to the ability to use a single platform for both administrators as well as users across their 20 plus locations. As you can see, our cloud-based solution has broad appeal across a wide section of verticals. We anticipate this success will continue as the power and flexibility of the Paycom solution becomes increasingly well-known to both human resource professionals and see suite executives seeking to maximize the value of their human capital assets. As you might expect, larger companies have greater, more complex HCM needs and our solution is evolving to serve them. Paycom learning are recently adding Learning Management System or LMS is gaining steady traction with businesses that recognize the benefit of a powerful yet flexible training system that is completely unified with the payroll and other existing applications. Since releasing it in February, we have experienced several wins. Organizations across a wide range of sizes and verticals are switching to our software solution because of its easy to use reporting functionalities and customized courses all from within a single application that is tied to each employee's record. Many of our new LMS clients are switching to us from incumbent systems while for others this is the first time they are utilizing a robust LMS system after attempting to conduct everything in house. Additionally, Paycom's Affordable Care Act or ACA offering continues to act as a beacon to companies who recognized that their runway for compliance with this new law continues to shorten and our robust ACA dashboard and reporting capabilities are the best way to prepare for the upcoming requirements. The flexibility and scalability of our single database solution allows our development teams to create new applications and improve existing ones very quickly. As with prior quarters, we have increased our software development expense over 100% for the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the prior year period. We are very excited about the new applications and the further enhancements that we'll introduce throughout the year. In summary, we had an excellent first quarter. We remain energized and excited for the remainder of 2015 as we look to enhance our many value propositions, all of which are resonating well within the marketplace. Now, I will turn the call over to Craig and to discuss our financial results and outlook. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our first quarter results, and also our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2015, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA a non-GAAP net income or non-GAAP financial measures that excludes stock-based compensation and other non-recurring charges including transaction expenses relating to our initial public offering and our recent secondary offering. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release. We had a very robust first quarter with total revenues of $55.2 million representing year-over-year growth of 49.3% from the comparable prior year period. As Chad mentioned, we continued to see strong new client additions in the first quarter primarily driven by our mature sales teams. Additionally, our revenue in the first quarter was positively impacted by strength in our tax form filings business, which is a reminder consist of our annual tax form filing for our clients. As many of you know, this is a seasonal aspect of our business that we experience every first quarter. Strength in our tax form filing business resulted in approximately $1.5 million of revenue outperformance relative to our expectations in the first quarter of 2015. This outperformance in tax form filings was primarily driven by robust ANRR in the third and fourth quarter of 2014. This flowed through our financials positively impacting gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. Combined with the ongoing sales momentum, this resulted in a strong revenue performance in the first quarter of 2015. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $54.4 million for the first quarter of 2015 representing 98.4% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 49.1% from the comparable prior year period. ANRR was $20.2 million for the first quarter of 2015 up from $12.6 million in the same period last year and representing 60.5% growth in the comparable prior year period. As a reminder, ANRR is an estimate based on the analyzed amount of the first full month of already on-boarded recurring revenue. While this quarter's ANRR was an overachievement, we expect to return to a more normalized ARNN growth rate throughout the remainder of 2015. Total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $46.9 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 85%. This compares to 81.3% in the first quarter of 2014. This is a very strong gross margin for Paycom and as mentioned earlier there were factors that positively impact gross margin. As we look to the remainder of 2015, we expect overall gross margin to be approximately 80% to 82%. Turning to operating expenses, as a reminder we will pay commissions to our sales reps based solely on new sales at the time of their first monthly billing cycle. This is a one-time commission paid which we recoup over the life of the client relationship. When we experience strong sales performance in a quarter, there's the potential for us to see increased expenses in that quarter depending on the timing of the client's onboard process. For the first quarter, total adjusted administrative expenses were $35.5 million. This compares to $26 million in the first quarter of 2014. Administrative expenses progressed according to internal expectations in the first quarter of 2015. A portion of our GAAP general and administrative expense was due to costs related to our follow-on offering in the first quarter of 2015. R&D expense increased to 111.7% from the comparable prior year period as we continue to build out and also refine our software offerings. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.6 million or 24.7% of revenue in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $6.6 million or 17.7% of revenue in the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from the sales dynamics I mentioned at the beginning of my prepared remarks. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2015 was $6.7 million or $0.12 per diluted share based on approximately 57 million shares versus 1.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share based on approximately 48 million shares a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $35.7 million and debt of $26.5 million. As a reminder, this debt represents the financing on our corporate headquarters. With that, let me turn to guidance for the second quarter and for fiscal 2015. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect total revenues in the range of $45 million to $46 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 36.6% at the mid-point. We expect adjusted EBITDA on the range of $7.5 million to $8.5 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 17.6% at the mid-point. For fiscal 2015, we expect total revenues to be between $203 million or 35.2% year-over-year growth at the mid-point. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $35 million to $37 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.6% at the mid-point. In summary, we had an excellent first quarter and look forward to continued momentum through 2015. With that, we will open the lines up for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John DiFucci of Jefferies. Please go ahead. John DiFucci : Thank you. Hey, Chad and Craig, listen this was surprisingly strong quarter. You guys have been putting up strong numbers but this is even better than it has been. I guess my first question, I just have two. Can you tell us what the contribution was from tax form filing? I know that that helped, but I mean we expected it to help. I mean we expected it; we modeled that based on what you've done over the last year. Just trying to figure out if that was just a lot better than we expected. Craig Boelte : John, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it was about around $1.5 million of an outperformance on the tax form filings and that really flowed through the entire financial statements through margin as well as to the earnings per share and net income. John DiFucci : Okay. But can you tell us, Craig, what exactly it was? We expected to see a lot of growth out of that anyway or is that something you just prefer not to at this point? Craig Boelte : It really \u2013 John, the tax form filing really due to the ANRR achievement in third and fourth quarter of last year we on-boarded the those clients. And so any client, even if they've just been with us for two weeks of December, we have to provide them with the annual tax form filings as if they had been with us for a full year. And so, we did have some accelerated ANRR in both third quarter and fourth quarter of last year and those contributed to the annual tax form filings business for February and January. John DiFucci : Okay. And if I could ask another question. ANRR this quarter up 60.5%. As you point out just now, Chad indicates strong future revenue and that number is \u2013 and I know you said you expected to go back to more normalized rate going forward and I think that's prudent to expect that. I guess where are you seeing it? You mentioned you're seeing some \u2013 like some of the new offices are sort of in line although some of them seem to be outperforming, selling to some larger customers. Are you also seeing more attach? Are you seeing a higher attach of your HCM modules this quarter than you have in the past? And I guess how do you expect that to develop going forward? Craig Boelte : Yes. And so what I will say is that the new offices even the ones from 2014 and 2015 contribute very little to this number. I mean really these are the mature offices that are continuing to sell more than they have in the past. And then it's almost in all of the above. Definitely you do have them not only selling more deals; they're selling larger businesses as well in some markets. And they're more comfortable with the products that we've released over the last couple of years. And so, although we're not necessarily disclosing exact attach rates, what would be true is that clients are taking more products today than what they have in the past. A lot of that has to do with maturity of the products as well as client size we're targeting. John DiFucci : Okay, great. Nice job, guys. Thanks. Craig Boelte : All right. Thank you, John. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Nemeroff of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Nemeroff : Thanks for taking my questions. And I will echo John's incredulation about this really, really strong results. Congratulations on that. Chad, you talked in your prepared remarks about the strength in ANRR are coming from selling some larger customers. I was curious \u2013 can you give us a sense on what the average number of employees is? I don't know if that's something that you track and whether you could share the growth in that number as you start to move up slowly with larger customers? Chad Richison : Yes. It's not something that we're tracking. What I can say is that we are selling larger \u2013 more companies than what we had before and they tend to be at the larger end of our target market, which again, we still say is 50 employees to 2,000 employees. We are selling more as sales reps become more comfortable in that market. They're selling more of them. And so naturally, you could somewhat deduct it because of that the employee size is continuing to increase. Michael Nemeroff : And so last week -- thanks, that's helpful, Chad. Last week Ultimate Software had mentioned that they saw a little bit of same-store sales decline in this their employee base, their customers shrank. I know you guys are growing through it because you're growing so fast. I was curious; did you notice the same dynamic at your existing customers that they saw in the quarter? Chad Richison : No. And it's not something that I can say we specifically looked at either. But, I can't say, confirm or not whether that's happening with us. I do know that if it were, it hasn't been anything material that we've seen. Michael Nemeroff : That's great. That's helpful also. And then Craig, you had mentioned in your prepared remark that given the strength of ANRR growth in this quarter that you would expect it to sort of go back to normalized levels. I'm just curious, is there anything specific or kickers or spiffs that caused ANRR growth in this quarter to spike that you're expecting it to fall back down to more normalized levels or is it just a little bit of conservatism there. Chad Richison : Yes. So Mike, this is Chad. If you kind of looked at last year, Q1 we had 31% ANRR growth and then Q2 we had 38% and then Q3 we had 52%. We followed that up Q4 with 44% and just as a remainder to everyone, ANRR is when a deal starts, not necessarily when it's sold. We did have some deals pull into the March time period that might have otherwise started in a subsequent quarter. And so I don't have the forward look all the way out to what's going to happen toward the end of June, but that does impact, ANRRs less about when we sold it and really about when it converts again a full month's revenue that hits commission. And so with that, I mean it was a very strong ANRR performance this quarter. It was 60% and that's the largest we've had. And so we're just, we're wanting to make sure we're responsible with our future forecasts and that's why we do believe it will be more at the normalized level moving forward. Michael Nemeroff : That's really helpful. And approximately how much do you think was kind of pulled forward from maybe the Q2 ANRR that you started to bill for? How much of that ANRR was possibly pulled forward I guess. Chad Richison : Yes. I mean it is our \u2013 it's hard to state that because every, this isn't uncommon. I mean every month you are going to have something move on you whether it pulls in or pushes out of when it comes to start date, something could have been ready to go in December and pushed out to January and caused it to happen that way as well. And so, second quarter it will just really depend on starts. But, I just thought that was important to point out that we have had a little bit of fluctuation in ANRR growth although it\u2019s been strong from quarter-to-quarter, will have a little bit of fluctuation. And it's really important to look at ANRR is an annualized metric. We do report it quarter-to-quarter, but it levels out as an annualized metric for us. Michael Nemeroff : Very helpful. Guys, congratulations. Great results this quarter. Thank you. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Please go ahead. Harry Mateer : Hey, guys. This is Harry on for Raimo. Thanks for taking the question and again congrats on a great quarter. It's really impressive, impressive result. I just wanted to touch on kind of obviously this is very, very strong quarter and kind of pretty meaningful acceleration I guess on a year-over-year perspective from Q1 last year. Do you think that there's been any sort of change in the model or is there just a better demand environment than you were expecting because it seems as though you're kind of discounting the newer offices and which is great because obviously sometime down the line you expect those to be more productive, but it seems like you would have pretty good visibility with the mature offices and all of a sudden you're getting this very, very positive result. So can you just kind of talk about how you view the success there? Chad Richison : Yes. We do expect our mature offices to continue to mature. I mean I don't believe we're ever done and we continue to hit new highs and mature office sales year-after-year. I mean we've been doing this a while and it should happen that if we do it on a continual basis, we'll continue to get better at it. And so that's really what's happening. Our offices are becoming more mature about the managers and salespeople are having more success. We're doing a good job converting the business and we have more to sell than what we've had in the past too. I mean we released several new products over the last 18 months and all of them are making meaningful impacts. And not really just on the revenue side but to the client's business and so we're going to continue to do that and look forward to the future. Harry Mateer : Great. And just a quick follow-up. Thanks for the color there. But, it might be a little too early to say so I appreciate that, but in any event, is the success that you're seeing with some of these larger customers something that you think with time could change your general outlook in terms of the good market effort? Perhaps it's something you need to allocate more dedicated resources to whether it's on the sales side or support side of things. Obviously, it's really great from the revenue side when it works out that you close these large deals. But, you do you think at any point if you see the demand there at the upper end of your target customer size ranges is much better than expected that you have to kind of change how you're thinking about managing the installed base and going after new business? Chad Richison : Well, we definitely continue to change the way we implement our services to clients regardless of size. I mean we continue to get better at it. I can tell you back when we were a staff of ten and I myself was a salesperson, I went out and brought on a company that had 1500 to 2,000 employees. So we've always been in this business. Now back then it was only payroll. But it was online. And so we've always been in this market. This has always been our target market, true. They are becoming more sophisticated as our products become more sophisticated to meet those needs and we continue to get more of them as we creep even higher. And, you're going to convert and implement a company differently that has 3500 employees with 3500 employee users and maybe 400 or 500 manager level users that use all your products. It takes a little bit more time, but also it takes training as well. And so we've been focused on that. I'm not going to say that this year's been uncharacteristic in those training efforts or changes to our implementation services as they have been in the past. I think you're just seeing us sell more of them because we do have more mature offices and a stronger sales force than what we've had in the past and more product to sell. Harry Mateer : All right. Great guys. Thanks and congrats again. Chad Richison : Thanks, Harry. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. AlbertChi: Yes. Chad and Craig, this is Albert Chi for Mark. Congratulations again on the great quarter. Great results. But, I want to ask you about the outperformance of some of your offices versus the others that you have mentioned. And I know that you've had a diverse set of openings across the geographies, and are you seeing any differences or patterns in a way that certain cities or geographies are ramping up verses others? You mentioned Brooklyn, Cincinnati and City et cetera? Chad Richison : Yes. With those office it's really too early. I could more speak to the 2014 offices. I mean our 2015 offices are just really getting their first trainees back into their office and trained. They may have sold a few deals, but very limited on information from those offices. Now the offices that have been open a year, it's typically manager specific and so it really depends on which manager opened that up office, what their history was with us in the past and how they go in there. They're all trending as we have expected and they're all doing well. I did mention some are doing better than others. But they're all doing exactly what we expect them to do and they will all mature within the next year or so. Albert Chi : Got it. That's helpful. And just one more actually. So you mentioned that you had some traction with the LMS, Learning Management System. And I know it's early, but can you talk a little bit maybe about how it's affecting some of the other competitors in the learning management space? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes, I can tell you I am aware, I have stayed close to the learning management and watching that traction. I do know we have had some competitor takeaways from your traditional learning management systems and we've also converted companies over that may have been using \u2013 maybe an off-the-shelf for lack of a better term-type provider or even a patch together in-house-type system. So at the end of the day, all companies provide training to their employees through several different methods and we've found a way to automate that and leverage the same system that perspective clients and current clients would be using. And so we've had success. Again, we're still new to that. It's a new product. But we're very comfortable with the traction that we're having at this point. Albert Chi : All right. Thanks. Congratulations again. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord. Please go ahead. DJ Hynes : Hey, guys, it's DJ on for Richard. So Chad, maybe just back to the 5 Q1 office starts. Are those offices fully staffed? How quickly does that happen? I guess what are you seeing on the sales hiring front? And I guess the related question to that would be curious about your bench of sales leaders. I know you typically relocate guys when you open a new office. How do you feel you are in terms of quantity of leaders to relocate and kind of implications for how you think about office starts for the rest of the year? Chad Richison : Right. Well, I'll take that last question first. Just through numbers, the more teams you have, the larger the bench you have. And so as we continue to add teams, it definitely increases the bench there. Now the first question as far as offices open this past quarter. It does take an office 24 months to get to maturity and really the most that \u2013 the largest number of sales reps that one manager can manage effectively that are brand new is kind of three right off the bat. You might have one that could manage four. And so those offices that we started first quarter of 2015, they're really just building. I would be surprised I mean from the numbers I do know of, I don't think any of them have more than two at this point being trained and in the field. And so we'll look for those offices to reach maturity and full staff with 7 to 9 sales reps as well as a strong backlog and pipeline as we round first quarter 2017. 2014, it's a little bit different. You do have some ramping up quicker than others because they're at different parts, different cycle within their \u2013 or different part within their maturity cycle. But they continue to grow as well and so we've been monitoring that and again they're all progressing as we expect. DJ Hynes : Got it. And then maybe for Craig, I guess on the R & D side, you guys continue to call out the growth on that front. Shall we think of Q1 as kind of a new run rate level or were there extraordinary expenses related to kind of getting the LMS product out the door? How should we have think about that line going forward? Craig Boelte : On the R&D side, we're going to continue to invest. Our group was also developing the LMS but also working on additional products and as well as our existing ones. So moving forward, we've had over 100% for the last several quarters and we're going to continue to spend in the R&D area. DJ Hynes : Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale : Hey, good afternoon and my congratulations as well. I had a couple of questions about the guidance. So Chad as you pointed out, the growth in new ANRR has been somewhat, that's been great throughout the quarters but as low as 30%, as high as 60%. But, when you say a more normalized levels, not to be too cute about this, but are you talking more like a 30% or 40% or what do you have in mind? Chad Richison : Again, when I was speaking earlier, I was also talking to the best way to look at ANRR is on an annualized basis. And so as I talk about ANRR I really do view it as an annualized basis because quarter-to-quarter really depends on when a company can converts or when a company actually transitions and converts on to our system for a full month and naturally how you have to look at it. Corey Greendale : Okay. So looking at the full year in 2014, I think new ANRR was up 42%. Is that what you mean by a normalized rate? Chad Richison : I believe that a normalized rate for us would be consistent with prior years for us. I don't have those numbers exactly in front of me. But again, I look at it on an annualized basis of what we should experience on a going forward -- as we go forward. Corey Greendale : Okay. And then looking at the full year guidance, so I know your philosophy is to operate the company in a profitable way. If I look at the full year EBITDA guidance, I think the beat in Q1 more than accounts for how much you write, in other words you raised your EBITDA guidance by $3 million and I think you beat by $3 million just in Q1, which suggests that you are basically not changing your EBITDA guidance for the rest of the year despite raising the revenue guidance. So I just wanted to ask you about that. Where is the incremental spending that is resulting in that offset to revenue? Chad Richison : Yes. And so for us as we continue to bring on new business revenue, we have to hire. I mean this month we grew over 40%. As you continue to grow, at a very high rate, you have to hire people and get them trained and prepare to service these clients and it requires the resources that have knowledge to be able to do that. And so we always have to hire those people ahead of the revenue received and so sometimes you'll carry people with you a little bit longer so that you can get them trained, up to speed and ready to catch the revenue that's going to be coming in, in subsequent quarters. And so we would expect to spend to be on staffing and staffing at staffing levels which will allow us to do that. Corey Greendale : Okay. Would some of that be in sales to potentially drive more growth, not this year, but maybe next year? Chad Richison : Well, you'll definitely have additional sales reps added in the cities that are still maturing which I believe at this point we have 8 or 9 or no, excuse me, 10 or 11 that are still maturing. And so you're definitely going to have some of that. But, it all just contributes to that. Corey Greendale : Okay. And then just one quick one on the learning product. It sounds like you're getting some good adoption early on. Is that largely up-sell to existing customers, or are you finding new customers adopting the learning product right away? Chad Richison : Yes. It's primarily new customers that we're bringing on to our system. I know that we have had some current customers because we do take feedback from current customers and that's really sometimes where you learn which products you're going to release. And but for us, I know that the majority of what we've brought on were brought in with the deal. Corey Greendale : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And our nest question comes from Sarah Hindlian of Brean Capital. Please go ahead. Sarah Hindlian : Hey, guys, congratulations on a great quarter. I think I missed a question in there for a second; I got distracted so I apologize if this is a repeat, but I did have a couple for you. You mentioned that you were displacing some staff vendors. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color in terms of who else you're displacing if you're entirely displacing staff vendors with these larger clients, or if there's some more legacy in there as well. And then, I did hear you speak a little bit about new offices and I know you added five. Last year you've already added five. And I apologize if you've already answered this, but are there any plans to do any more this year? Chad Richison : All right. So on the legacy \u2013 on the legacy SaaS providers or SaaS providers; however you set it out, it is rare that we would replace any provider that isn't a SaaS provider at some level whether they're a legacy provider providing a client solution or whether they have started out a SaaS provider. That's who we're displacing. It would be rare that we would displace somebody at this day and age that has an installed product. Now you might \u2013 we have might also have some people that aren't using a vendor, but they're using it in-house product that they're using themselves and we might run into a little bit of that. But primarily any time we're replacing another vendor, we're replacing either a legacy provider SaaS product or version of SaaS product or we are replacing another SaaS provider. As it relates to the offices, we've added five so far this year. We're continuing to absorb those and watch those mature and support them. We're always looking for additional opportunities. I wouldn't say that we would not open up another office this year, but I can't confirm that we're doing that either. We're continuing to look at all of our options and if something makes sense for us, we'll definitely be communicating that with everybody and move forward. Sarah Hindlian : Okay. Great. Thank you guys. That helps a lot. I appreciate it and congratulations. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Chad Richison for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you. So our first quarter marked an important milestone as our company celebrated our first full year as a public company. We remain as excited as ever regarding our prospects and opportunity to transform the payroll and HCM industry. We'll be presenting at the Jefferies Global Technology Media and Telecom Conference in Miami on May 12 and at the JPMorgan Global Technology Media and Telecom Conference in Boston on May 19. And I look forward to meeting with many of you in person in the coming months. So thank you guys for participating on our call today. Operator : And thank you, sir. Today's conference as now concluded. And we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig Boelte, Chief Financial Officer of Paycom. Mr. Boelte, you may begin. Craig Boelte : Thank you, and good afternoon. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. While we believe any forward-looking statements we have made are reasonable, actual results could differ materially, because of statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our Annul Report on Form 10-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2015, and as maybe supplemented by subsequent Form 10-Q filings. You should refer too and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking information. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by applicable law. Also, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today, which is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig, and thank you to every one joining us on today's call. In the second quarter of 2015, our sales momentum continued with revenue of $49 million. This represents growth of 47% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Revenue for the first six months of 2015 grew 48% compared to the comparable prior-year period. Annualized new recurring revenue or ANRR was $16.5 million, representing growth of 43% over the second quarter of 2014. Our cloud-based offering continues to gain traction in the marketplace, as both managers and employees recognize the advantages they can enjoy with our intuitive single-database system. The foundation of our ongoing sales success is our industry-leading solution. To maintain this leadership, we are relentlessly focused on software development. In addition to rolling out new applications, we also continue to deepen the functionality within each of our existing offerings. As a result, we once again more than doubled our research and development expenditures, growing our investment 103% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. In the second quarter, we augmented two of our existing solutions with the release of Enhanced ACA and GL Concierge. I will spend a few minutes describing each of these offerings and how they will provide businesses with the premier solution in their respective categories. We were excited to deliver a new Affordable Care Act compliance offering to the market in our Enhanced ACA application. While we already provided an intuitive and convenient ACA dashboard that has been very well received, our Enhanced ACA application offers even greater functionality to our clients. Based on feedbacks from our well-attended monthly ACA webinars, we believe businesses are more concerned than ever by the employer mandate reporting requirements. With this in mind, we set out to aid eight businesses in their pursuit to better monitor, report and evaluate the organizational needs in order to comply with this significant piece of healthcare reform. Before Enhanced ACA, we provided clients with the ability to run reports and track and set required ACA periods, all through our ACA dashboard. With Enhanced ACA, users are able to get up-to-date information and proactive alerts when approaching applicable large employer status and when part time or hourly workers are nearing full-time status. This new solution also offers easily accessible historical data for auto trial purposes, advanced reporting including action items, as well as updates on legislation and compliance requirements. Additionally, with enhanced ACA we remit Forms 1094 and 1094 on the client's behalf. As employers gear up to report for the first time in 2016, we have had numerous clients sign out for the enhanced ACA service. We expect this momentum to continue as we near the end of the year, for which the required data and reports will be filed with the IRS, and furnished to individual employees. Our second major development at this quarter was General Ledger Concierge. GL Concierge gives accounting professionals expansive General Ledger mapping, transparent auditing, customizable file layouts and intuitive reporting capabilities, as well as real-time alerts on items impacting that reporting. Our General Ledger application is completely customizable allowing companies to automate the import fee to various accounting software solutions. Through our push reporting application introduced last summer, on-demand GL reports can be automatically generated and sent to all necessary recipients within an organization. We are seeing strong demand for this payroll GL application, and we expect this demand to continue. These new applications underscore the power of our substantial and growing solution. While we are seeing a strong reception of these new offerings, they are still in initial rollout and we anticipate their respective financial contributions will be modest this year. I'd like to take a moment to provide a quick update on Paycom Learning, our recently launched learning management system or LMS. We are proud that our software is streamlining and formalizing company's training processes and helping them enhance and maximize the value of their human capital. Since launching the application in February, we have seen a strong reception from the marketplace. Through Paycom Learning, businesses are engaging with their employees and taking advantage of our ability to pull courses into the onboarding process, consolidating what were once multiple tasks into one. Here is a quick real world example of how our LMS application helps our clients. A large auto dealership group added Paycom Learning and is enjoying the functionality that derives from our single-database solution. With our system, they are able to store certifications for dealership, compliance, audits in one system and can easily pull courses into employee's career paths to help those workers achieve individual career goals and fill mission-critical roles. This is just one example of a trend that we are seeing across many clients in the industries. Our expanding solution and the growing awareness of our single-database human capital management or HCM offering continue to allow us to reach up market to larger organizations. I'm happy to share that we continue to bring on larger clients in the second quarter, and we would like to take a minute to highlight three new clients we won this second quarter. First, we added a large disability and senior support services organization that operates across several states. Prior to joining Paycom, the 5,000-plus employee company was using numerous tools that resulted in an incomplete HCM process. This client now uses multiple applications within our software to streamline their HCM practices and is extremely pleased with the benefits they receive by deploying our solution. Next, we won a facilities management company with nearly 2,500 employees. They also had been utilizing multiple methods to meet their payroll and HCM needs. They are now using several Paycom applications to enjoy a full HCM deployment that should greatly enhance their business practices. In addition to the anticipated $70,000 in annual cost savings, this client looks forward to a potential $200,000 in Work Opportunity Tax Credit that our solution will help them realize through strategic candidate sourcing and hiring. Finally, we brought on a restaurant group that was utilizing a professional employer organization or PEO service prior to Paycom. The group, which has over 3,200 employees added numerous Paycom applications, including time and attendance, benefits administration, E-Verify, applicant tracking and Paycom surveys, these are just five of the multiple Paycom products that the group added. Businesses like this restaurant group enjoy the flexibility and convenience of having an HCM provider that builds and develops its offerings in-house and delivers it within a single application. As I've stated on previous calls, we are continuing our trend of bringing on clients at or above the top-end of our target range, as evidenced by these new client examples. These highlighted wins are indicative of our success in the marketplace that demonstrates the power and scalability of our software. In conclusion, we had a very productive second quarter. Our sales success continued, while our development engine fired on all cylinders. We are optimistic that our momentum will continued through the second half of the year and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Craig for an update on our financials and our guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our second quarter results and also our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2015, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income or non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation and other non-recurring charges including transaction expenses related to our initial public offering and our follow-on public offering. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release. Our sales momentum continued in the second quarter with total revenues of $49 million, representing year-over-year growth of 47% from the comparable prior-year period. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $47.8 million for the second quarter of 2015, representing 97.6% of the total revenues for the quarter and growing 46% from the comparable prior-year period. ANRR was $16.5 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $11.5 million in the same period last year and representing 43% growth from the comparable prior-year period. As a reminder, ANRR is an estimate based on the annualized amount of the first full month of already onboarded new recurring revenue. Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $41 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 83.6%. This compares to 80.9% in the second quarter of 2014. Our gross margin strength was driven by revenue outperformance as well as ongoing cost discipline. Turning to operating expenses, as a reminder we pay commissions to our sales reps based solely on new sales at the time of their first monthly billing cycle. This is a one-time commission that we recoup over the life of the client relationship. When we experience strong sales performance in a quarter, there's a potential for us to see increased expenses in that quarter depending on the timing of the client's onboard process. For the second quarter, total adjusted administrative expenses were $30.1 million. This compares to $23.2 million in the second quarter of 2014. Administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue as compared to the first quarter of 2015, as we are beginning to see some leverage in our model. R&D expense increased to 103% from the comparable prior-year period. As Chad detailed, we're continuing to make investments to broaden our suite of offerings. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.1 million or 26.8% of revenue in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $6.1 million or 18.2% of revenue in the second quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2015 was $6 million or $0.10 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $2.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share based on approximately 52 million shares a year ago. You should note for modeling purposes that our stock-based compensation expense reached approximately $1.1 million per quarter, as we issued restricted stock under our long-term incentive plan in July. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $42.7 million and debt of $26.3 million. As a reminder, this debt represents the financing on our corporate headquarters. With that, let me turn to guidance for the third quarter and for fiscal 2015. For the third quarter of 2015, we expect total revenues in the range of $51 million to $52 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of approximately 40.7% at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $9 million to $10 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 18.4% at the midpoint. For fiscal 2015, we are raising our revenue guidance from $203 million or $205 million up to a range of $210 million to $212 million or 39.8% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2015 in the range of $44 million to $46 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 21.3% at the midpoint. In summary, we had an excellent second quarter and look forward to continued momentum through 2015. With that, we will open the line up for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Harry Mateer : This is Harry on for Raimo. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter. I was just hoping you could give a little bit of color on progress around new office openings. And now that we're heading into the second half of the year, if you haven't have any clarity or just initial thoughts on office openings in the New Year, I'd really appreciate any color around either of those. Chad Richison : We opened up five offices first quarter of this year, which was our largest year of office openings to date. Those offices are doing very well. All of our offices typically progress at very close to the same rate, especially in aggregate when you look at all of them. And so they are continuing to progress as well as the ones in 2014. We are always reviewing new opportunities. We will, in the future, have additional office openings, but we haven't announced any plans for that right now. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Michael Nemeroff : Maybe if I can just ask Harry's question a different way. You're growing really fast. You opened up five new offices this year and I understand how long it takes for the new offices to generate revenue and come up to speed. How many offices do you think you'd need to open in 2016 to keep the growth rate somewhat close to the same growth rate that you're performing in 2015? Chad Richison : Well, I think the growth rate that we'll have in 2016 is substantially with the offices we've opened to date. I mean, as you know, and we've discussed prior in calls and in meetings, the offices that we opened this year are going to have a great impact in a couple of years. So they're not going to have a significant impact this year. And they're going have a little bit of an impact next year, but not significant, when you look at the overall number of offices that that we have impacting our revenue. So to answer your question, the number of offices we would need to open in 2016 to impact 2016 growth number is minimis. But the number of offices we would need to open in 2016 to continue, to work our overall growth plans into the future, we're going to have to open up some offices. We know that. We continue to identify areas and we continue to be underpenetrated in the areas we're in today. And so we look at both current geographies for additional offices and/or leaderships teams. And then we also look at new geographies. And so we're still going through that process. We do have a bunch of candidates that continue to build and we do have matured sales managers, who are also willing to help us expand in that area. And so that's really the way we view it. Michael Nemeroff : And then the ANNR this quarter, obviously it couldn't have matched the 61% last quarter, but still just incredibly strong again. What is driving that? Was there any pull forward again like you said last quarter into Q1 or anything anomalous? So you mentioned ACA as a very strong uptick with customers. If you can maybe give us a sense of how much ACA impacted the ANNR this quarter and maybe thoughts on what the trajectory of ANNR might look like for the rest of the year, that'd be helpful. Chad Richison : ACA in itself or Enhanced ACA itself has very little impact on this quarter's ANRR. I think our position as a thought leader in being able to provide an Enhanced ACA software as well as corresponding service, I think helps us win some deals, because of the importance of the legislation and the impact of the filing, if you don't file things correctly. And so I think that's helping us. What's happening is that we have both mature cities and new cities maturing, but within each of those cities, we have reps that are maturing all the time and these reps are selling deals and continue to bring in not only businesses that are at the top range of what our typical target has been, but we're bringing in more of them. And so it gets harder and harder to grow a grown number, but with proper product and a good sales staff and support group, we're able to do that. Operator : The next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. John DiFucci : I actually have a follow-up to Mike's question there on ANRR. We're seeing growth at elevated rates, 43% this quarter, down a little bit from the very strong quarter, as you pointed out last quarter, but still greater than the revenue growth rate last year, which obviously bodes well for growth this year net revenue. I guess, when I look back, and I look at the numbers it looks like there is an inflection point. Obviously, business is good, but over the last four quarters, we've sort of seen it, and I'm just curious, if there is something that you can comment on around that timing? Was it partially due, Chad, do you think maybe to increase brand awareness from the IPO? Was that helpful? Is it just the timing of new modules coming out? And then, just help us to understand, I mean it's a good thing, but just help us to understand what's happened over the last four quarters. I mean it was nice growth before that too, but we certainly have seen an inflection point in the business? Chad Richison : I mean, I can't say, I definitely do think. I mean, having an IPO definitely didn't hurt brand awareness. I think there was also some significant motivation on our end, going through the IPO process coming out the other end, standing where we stood at the time and just having this feeling of we can do a lot more than we're doing. And we really started down that track last year. But it was just one additional gear that we went through. I mean, we've had this type of growth or similar growth in the past as well. And so for us it's just continuing to work to plan that we started working a while back. And I do believe that as our product has matured and we've gotten better at each module, we become a much stronger prospect for other clients that are wanting to utilize this technology. And so we're having a greater wins, and more of them, which you're going to have to have to grow a grown number. John DiFucci : If I might too, I noticed ADP employer services grew about 6% in the quarter on a constant currency basis. So obviously, a fraction your growth here, but obviously, I mean that's a big opportunity for you, right, from a competitive standpoint. Are you seeing any changes in the competitive activity from ADP? Are you seeing any increased challenge, I mean they talk about it, so called cloud-solutions of their own now? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, I think the answer to your question is no. I think it's been business as usual, but I say that in respect to ADP's -- I wouldn't say ADP is a company that's necessarily been asleep at the wheel and it's come to getting out there selling business and driving growth for themselves. And so we see it as kind of business as usual, but I mean we continue to have success with ADP, as we do with all of our competitors. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Chad, I wanted to ask you, you referenced that you're bringing in businesses at or above the top of your targeted range in terms of size, and that definitely got my attention. So I was wondering if you can share any more color. Were there any unusually large clients you signed this quarter or are you seeing a change in that trend or the segmentation in the forward pipeline at all? Chad Richison : The answer to that's, no. I mean, the size of clients, the difference between one client size and the other were very similar. There wasn't any client that stood out, that made up the difference there. Well, the same as last quarter. There wasn't any client last quarter, when we had the growth last quarter that stood out. But what's happening is we're receiving more of the clients at that level. I mean we were bringing on 4,000 and 5,000 employee companies five years ago, we just weren't bringing on as many of them as we do this year. And I think it's also important for everyone to note that our focus hasn't changed in the size of clients we go at. We have a very strong value proposition. It's just that our products continue to mature, and as the value proposition resonates with people at the large end of our focus, more and more want to use it. But we're still very focused on the 50 employee to 2,000 market as well. Mark Murphy : As a follow-up, I'd say the single biggest question that we hear from investors at an industry level is that there, frankly, is a pretty impressive breadth of HR software companies that are delivering profitable growth and seemingly living off the natural churn from ADP and Paychex and Ceridian and others, and combined with some ERP replacements and of course some greenfield opportunity or new business formation. But even the companies that are providing the churn seem to be doing fine, as I think you referenced in answering John's question. So there is question of just when will be the music end kind of at an industry level? And yet, we look at the combination of growth and margin that you're delivering here and it is in absolutely elite territory, no question about it. So I am curious, is there any change in the sourcing of the new deals that you're booking? For example, more or less success against the service bureaus or the ERP, is there anything else? And is there anything you're seeing in the pipeline that would make you more or less confident in the ultimate size of the opportunity here for Paycom. Chad Richison : It's a very large TAM. I believe that the TAM continues to grow. I believe, we're just entering the HCM technology phase. If you really go out and visit with the client, many of them, when you visit with clients are using new technology the old way still. And so I still believe, we're at the beginning of where HCM is heading. Even with the deals that we've brought on from LMS, I mean these are large companies and many of them were still doing it themselves through email and other ways. And so I believe it's still a developing industry. And I think that probably accounts for some of the growth of others that are so large, the ones you've mentioned. The other, I would mention is there is very few of us that do full-service payroll. I know, we talk about, there is a lot of HCM companies out there, and there may be. But as far as when you're talking about the ones that are doing full-service, payroll, tax, depositing, filing, reciprocity law and everything else, I mean six or seven of us, and you name three of them. And so I do believe that's a special expertise that a few of us have that we do that we're good at. So I think the industry is growing. And I don't see -- and the other part of your question was, are we seeing any difference in in-house versus those deals that are using another vendor, and it's still true today that the overwhelming majority or greater than 80% of the business that we do receive comes form companies that had another vendor at the time of decision. And so we don't really see that changing. And we don't expect competitors to stop innovating or trying to keep their client base. I mean, we expect them to do that, and we have our own strategy here for imposing our will and what we want for this company. Operator : The next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Brendan Barnicle : Craig, I might have missed this. But did you share with us customer retention rates for Q2? Craig Boelte : No. We typically report customer retention rates on an annual basis, and we reported that at end of the 2014. And it was very consistent from prior years. Brendan Barnicle : Any color on it in terms of change or anything along those lines? Chad Richison : No. Brendan Barnicle : Chad, on the Learning Management Systems, I was wondering who you were seeing competitively? You mentioned in the prior question, you're largely replacing going in situations where nobody had anything. But are you seeing competitors, when you go in to bid for those for that business? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, we do see competitors and it's all over the board. I mean it's a mixed bag of when I'm going to called point solution providers, which are providing just LMS and maybe mixing with a little bit of something else. From even maybe our premier competitors even, which we've kind of mentioned some on this call. So it's a mixed bag. I was more trying to illustrate the fact that there is still very large companies out there that are really not even in an automated system for even LMS. And so I was really just trying to kind of set the stage for how I do believe we're still at the beginning of overall HCM usage. Not necessarily being sold, but how it's being used. Brendan Barnicle : I know you talked about it on prior calls. But can you just remind us about your economic sensitivity and what you guys have seen in prior economic slowdowns? Craig Boelte : We've been through. I mean we started our company in 1998. I can't really speak for everybody else's, but this business I do believe it takes a while to build it and then it's also fairly strong, once you're there. You do have base fees. You do have price proceeds. But we haven't really experienced -- well, we haven't experienced any type of hiccup through this economic downturn, if you want to call that, which definitely, when you look at some industries it qualifies. Nor did we in 2008, when we had the mortgage companies and the financial institution as well as energy going through something very similar. And so we're very diversified across all industries and many geographies. Our Florida office didn't go down in 2008 or Arizona office didn't go down in 2008, when you had the housing market and everything else. And so we typically -- definitely, I mean we're industry agnostic, when it comes to that. Operator : The next question comes from David Hynes with Canaccord. David Hynes : Chad, maybe a couple of questions around pricing to help us get a feel for no attach rates and penetration of the customer base. I guess, I'm curious on a per employee per month basis. What's a customer paying, if they sing up for just base payroll? And then what's kind of the average new customer onboarding at? And then if they bought everything, what would they be paying you? So it will help us get a sense for how successful you are attaching adjacent modules and then penetration of the base. Chad Richison : We don't disclose individual pricing or what each module cost publicly. We have discussed in the past, our annualized opportunity for any one employee is around $400 annualized. So we have discussed that in prior calls. David Hynes : And then any sense as kind of where average employee is now to get us a feel for how much growth there could be within the installed base? Chad Richison : It's not something that I could disclose. But it's definitely something that we monitor. David Hynes : And then, Craig, maybe help us a little bit on seasonality of the sales and marketing spend. I mean, you obviously talked a little bit about the variable comp. What other factors that go into that line items as we kind of think about our models going forward? Craig Boelte : On the sales and marketing, typically first quarter is going to be a fairly high. Our sales season ends at the end of January. So typically the sales reps will be at one of the highest rates in that first quarter. And then throughout the year that will hit certain gets, and their rates will continue to increase in terms of commission. So second quarter is typically a little lower and it builds throughout the year through first quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Jim MacDonald : I'd like to go into the ACA a little more. How big an opportunity do you think that is? And can you tell us, whether you plan to price at monthly or are you going to price the form separately like a W-2? Chad Richison : With ACA we came out initially with the ACA dashboard, because we were still kind of waiting on the regs. Now, we've implemented enhanced ACA. There is a fee for enhanced ACA, and that fee also rolls over into an annualized fee for forms filing. It's really hard for us to sit here today and say, okay, what exactly is the revenue opportunity for that. But what I will say is, I believe every client or prospect out there -- well, first of all, I believe every prospect out there should be using us. But then from that standpoint when someone becomes a client, I believe every client that has 30 employees or more really needs to pay attention and get on some type of ACA program. With the new bill that was signed after the Supreme Court ruling, if you try to do ACA correctly and you don't, its $250 a form with a $3 million minimum. If you don't even try to do it right, its $500 a form and there is no cap of what you can be penalized in the year. So I mean, it's a serious filing. It's something that's new, obviously to our industry. It's something we are looked at to perform on behalf of a client. I think companies that use a company like ours or some of our competitors. I mean they depend on this, so they don't have to have that expertise in-house. And so I do believe on an ongoing -- and this is just the beginning. We don't know where ACA filing and reporting requirements are going to end. I mean, you typically start-up one way and then it will change over time. And so I do believe ACA represents an opportunity, as much for Paycom, but also for our industry as a whole I think ACA definitely represents a revenue opportunity. Jim MacDonald : And my follow-up on the ACA. When do you think this revenue will -- I mean, will it start to hit in the September quarter? Will it sort of get to a level it's going to get to by first quarter next year? Any thoughts on how this revenue will layer in? Chad Richison : I mean I would expect first quarter of next year there to be some ACA revenue. How measurable is it and what impact does it make, I don't know? I mean, the same question could be asked for rising interest rates, what did that do to us, as they rise as well. But I do believe there's going to be something there. Well, I know there will be something there. It's just to what extent it's substantial or how measurable it is, I don't know yet. Operator : The next question comes from Sarah Hindlian from Brean Capital. Sarah Hindlian : Just one quick housekeeping question and then a couple of others. How much R&D was capitalized in the quarter, Craig, if you wouldn't mind? And then less housekeeping, I know we were just talking about ACA. Is the treasury going to be issuing any updates on Form 1095 before the end of the year or do you think everything is still on track there for fiscal year '16 reporting? And then finally, just one more question. How should we be thinking abut your normalized ANRR going forward? Should we still be thinking of it on an annualized basis in the mid-30% growth rage or should we be thinking about it trending higher? Chad Richison : So I'll answer the last. And I'll let Craig finish up with the how much of R&D did we capitalized for this particular quarter. On the ANRR, we're not going to give any future guidance on that. ANRR is somewhat guidance itself into future quarters. And so moving forward, we're going to report ANRR. It has been strong. I did say that last quarter just to kind of let people know that we really jumped out there, but you never know what happens with us. And so moving forward, ANRR isn't something we're going to forecast. As far as what the IRS is going to do with the ACA, I mean we except them to continue to address Forms above 1094 as well as Form 1095. And then you have both Form B and C for both of those, depending on if you're an insurance company or an actual business that's issuing these. And so with anything, anytime, something new comes out there is always and after the fact thought of how can it be better, what other information do we need, how do we make others compliant? So I would find it very hard to believe that there is not more coming down the pipe from the reporting agencies. I would also be surprised if we're not full steam ahead, Katy bar the door, on this right now. I don't see it changing. It's here. Those people that aren't compliant are going to be in some trouble. And I do believe that. Craig Boelte : In terms of the capitalized R&D, it's around 30%, so slightly above 30%. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Brad Reback : Quick question, I'm sorry if I missed this. How is the productivity from the new offices you've layered on in last 12 going? Chad Richison : So I did talk about that earlier, Brad, yes it's going well. It does take an office 24 months to mature and these offices that we've opened at the first of the quarter, each maturing as they should be. Brad Reback : And given how strong your growth has been, have you given thought to going even faster with new office openings? Chad Richison : We definitely look at those opportunities. I mean it's important for us to have assured success. Each time, we do open up an office and we're very happy the way they're progressing now. And then as opportunities present itself through both backfill opportunities and new manager relo opportunities and prospect revenue opportunities, then we'll look to move into additional markets in the future. Brad Reback : And geographically, have you seen any unevenness in growth around the country? Chad Richison : We have not. Not geographically. I mean, you're going to have some offices that do better than others, but you could have an Orange County doing getter than an L.A. or San Fran doing better than a San Jose. So I wouldn't really be able to point geographically if there's a difference there. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chad Richison for any closing remarks. End of Q&A Chad Richison : And so I want to thank everybody for joining. We did sustain our momentum through the first half of 2015 and are extremely proud of our progress we achieved in broadening our industry-leading solution. We're going to be presenting at the Pacific Crest Global Technology Leadership Forum in Vail, on August 11 and then again at the Canaccord Growth Conference in Boston on August 12. And we look forward to meeting with you guys then. Thanks a lot. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Craig Boelte, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin. Craig Boelte : Thank you, and good afternoon. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. While we believe any forward-looking statements we have made are reasonable, actual results could differ materially, because of statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2015, and as maybe supplemented by subsequent Form 10-Q filings. You should refer too and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking information. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by applicable law. Also, during the course of today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today, which is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig, and thank you to everyone joining us on today\u2019s call. As with our prior quarters, I\u2019ll provide some high level comments regarding our performance and perspective on the marketplace and also I share some examples of customer wins we achieved during the third quarter of 2015. Craig will then provide a deeper look at our financials and finally we will open up the line for questions. So let\u2019s get started. As you may have read in our press release earlier today Paycom enjoyed continued momentum in the third quarter of 2015. Our revenue for the third quarter of 2015 was $55.3 million representing growth of 51% compared to the comparable prior year period. Annualized new recurring revenue or ANRR was $31.8 million, representing growth of 113% over the third quarter of 2014. We believe this robust performance was due to the ongoing market embrace of our powerful yet easy to use cloud-based solution as well as our top-notch sales organization that continues to mature and hit its stride. Let me spend a few minutes providing some insight into our view of the market for human capital management software. From our perspective they remain substantial potential for improvement in how companies recruit, manage and serve their employees. As we speak with perspective customers we routinely encounter companies that have substandard solutions in place, and as a result are not fully leveraging their valuable talent asset. Many of deploying multiple systems that have been piece together over years, in these situations we typically find multiple log on requirements for employees. As well as a difficult user interface. This leads to low employee usage of the system which in turn contributes to already unreliable data for HR managers and few if any actionable insights for this C-suite. The other paradigm we often encounter is companies that have invested and what they believe to be a sophisticated hi-tech system, only defined that due to its complexity only a very small number of employees are capable of using it. These companies often surfer from the exact same issues this companies deploying multiple systems namely low employee usage and the resulting low quality data that precludes action and improvement. The Paycom solution, it\u2019s easy to use but also very powerful due to its single database architecture this combination provides the benefit of very clean data that can produce actionable insights. Additionally, it gives us the ability to continually refine and improve our existing solution, as well as consistently launch new applications that continue to enhance our appeal in the marketplace. To this point we\u2019ve continue to evolve our solution growing our R&D spending well over 100% in the third quarter. Examples of these enhancements include our pre-hire checklist which allows our clients to streamline the employee onboarding process and get their new hires quickly up to speed instead of filling out I-9s, W-4s and enrolling and benefits during their new employee orientation new hires can hit the ground running and make an impact on day one. Another example is our newly added customized personnel action form. This new piece of functionality empowers our clients to create actionable forms that can be completely customized based on position or departmental needs. For instance, with our customizable personal forms managers can notify departments of specific changes that may need to be made such as giving employee access to different systems or restricted work areas. We believe this new component is more efficient and easier to use than anything currently available. We also delivered two new features, geo-fencing and geo-tracking to our current clients who utilize our time and attendance module. Geo-fencing is clients the ability to set geographical boundaries, where their employees are authorized to be when using Paycom\u2019s web time clock on smartphones, tablets or other electronic devices to clock in and out. Our geo-tracking technology means our clients can track employee\u2019s geographical location when they\u2019ve clocked in and out. The coordinates we collect can then be entered and viewed on Google\u2019s display map, together these applications empower employers to help mitigate time theft, a problem many organizations face. These are examples of how our ongoing development improves our clients\u2019 user experience. While simple in nature, the positive client feedback we\u2019ve received regarding these enhancements continues to motivate us that the best possible solution in the market. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that the single database foundation of our solution makes it easier for us to develop and launch these other enhancements, which contribute to our continued growth and success. However, our solution is not the only area that we continue to improve. I\u2019m pleased to report that our sales organization is performing extremely well, as I mentioned on past calls we continue to see our sales team sell more at the upper end of our market. Additionally, our newer offices continue to mature and we are excited with their progress and development, all of which are reflected in our excellent results. With that I\u2019d like to provide some quick examples of notable client wins in the third quarter. We were pleased to bring the Board, one of the largest golf management companies in the world, despite an existing competitive provider landscape. This Company operates more than 90 premier private resort and public golf courses throughout the U.S. and employees over 5,500 individuals. The client was previously using outdated disparate systems for each of its HR and payroll processes. They appreciate the fact that Paycom allows them to streamline their workflows and eliminate the manual tasks they had to do with their previous providers. Another organization that shows our services in the third quarter was a large early chartered educator with over 120 private pre-schools and elementary schools across the country. With nearly 3,300 employees, this business chose Paycom due to our ability to significantly improve their HCM operations, allowing them to empower their employees to pursue their mission of serving their students. One challenge this company faced with the previous provider involved the software upgrade, during which the company lost access to all of their existing data and reports. In fact, with this incumbent provider, they experienced times when their system was completely offline, and they could not access the tools they needed to operate. Our solution has enabled this client to automate and standardize its payroll and HCM processes, with 24/7 access across all levels of the organization. To conclude, our momentum continued in the third quarter, and I\u2019m very proud of our entire team, as our combined efforts are essential to our current and future success. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Craig, for an update on our financials and our guidance. Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our third quarter results and also our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income or non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation and other non-recurring charges including transaction expenses relating to our initial public offering and our follow-on public offering. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release. Our sales momentum continued in the third quarter with total revenues of $55.3 million, representing year-over-year growth of 51% from the comparable prior-year period. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $54.2 million for the third quarter of 2015, representing 98% of total revenue for the quarter and growing 51% from the comparable prior-year period. ANRR was $31.8 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $14.9 million in the same period last year and representing 113% growth. As a reminder, ANRR is an estimate based on the annualized amount for the first full month of already onboarded new recurring revenue. Total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $46.5 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.1%. This compares to 82.4% in the third quarter of 2014. Turning to operating expenses. As a reminder, we pay commissions to our sales reps based solely on new sales at the time of the clients first monthly billing cycle. This is a one-time commission that we recoup over the life of the client relationship. When we experienced strong sales performance in a quarter, but this quarter being a timely example there is a potential for us to see increased expenses in that quarter depending on the timing of the client\u2019s onboard process. For the third quarter, total adjusted administrative expenses were $38.3 million. This compares to $25.4 million in the third quarter of 2014. R&D expense increased to 110% from the comparable prior-year period. As Chad detailed, we continue to investment in our solution to maintain our competitive advantage. Adjusted EBITDA was $10.8 million or 19.5% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $6.6 million or 18% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted primarily from the overachievement in ANRR, which resulted in increased commission expense. Due to this overachievement, at the end of the third quarter, we had approximately twice as many sales representatives qualified for the highest commission level compared to the same period last year. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2015 was $4.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $2.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share based on approximately 53 million shares a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $48.5 million and debt of $26.1 million. As a reminder, this debt represents the financing on our corporate headquarters. With that, let me turn to guidance for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect total revenue in the range of $59.5 million to $61.5 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of approximately 38% at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $9 million to $11 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 17% at the midpoint. For fiscal 2015, we are raising our revenue guidance from $210 million or $212 million up to a range of $219 million to $221 million or approximately 46% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2015 in the range of $46.5 million to $48.5 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22% at the midpoint. In summary, we had an excellent third quarter and look forward to continued momentum through 2015. With that, we will open the line up for questions. Operator? Q - Raimo Lenschow : Thanks and congratulations with an amazing quarter. Chad, could you talk a little bit about the strength in ANRR, that sort of growth we\u2019re looking for quite a while, and maybe just talk a little bit about, you mentioned already some of the drivers for the strength, have you hidden any true point whereas some things in Q3 was specific to this quarter right now. Thank you. Chad Richison : Yes, so with ANRR, thanks Raimo, with ANRR we had significant growth this quarter. I mean, to remind everybody ANRR is the amount of process to our onboarded revenue any \u2013 for the full month of any given quarter. And so, that\u2019s actually onboarded revenue, new business revenue annualized. And so, we had several deals that came in at the top end of our range, I\u2019ve highlighted a few of them on the call. We do have, our officers are starting to mature, and continuing to drive growth in those areas, and I mean, we\u2019ve got a substantial number of sales people that are really hit in record numbers these days. And so, we build out strategic organization to be able to produce these types of results. As far as, how we hidden an inflection report, an inflection point, we made the comment earlier this year, that about ANRR and now we\u2019ve seen it jump. And so, ANNR isn\u2019t something we can necessarily forecast as it is a metric itself that\u2019s established after onboarded revenue. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, and then one more question. On the reference customers that you mentioned but I know that they all sort of size temporarily sizable kind of more in the several thousands, now can you talk a little bit to what \u2013 just the in terms of customer base, that\u2019s involved in terms of you moving slightly high up the market and who the competitors are if you kind of \u2013 sort of deals coming through? Thank you. Chad Richison : Yes, and so we continue to stay focused on the market we serve, we have been pulled that market on a couple of occasions, more so now than in the past. I did highlight a few of the larger accounts, it is important to note that in any given quarter, we have accounts equal to those sizes, this is just, we\u2019re having more sales people, selling more the upper end of our target, we\u2019re running into more of those clients. Then I also do believe that larger companies maybe overtime, who have experienced, maybe some complications in patching together multiple systems are starting to embrace a single database architecture that has some ease of use. As far as the competitive landscape it is substantially as a same as what we\u2019ve experienced in the past. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Nemeroff from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Nemeroff : Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll echo those congratulations, these results are \u2013 the ANRR was kind of staggering, I have to do a double take on that number. Just to building on Raimo\u2019s questions about that growth and the strength in ANRR. Is anything changing with the speed of implementations that is allowing you to get, to get that first month of revenue in from the clients? Chad Richison : No, I would say the speed of our implementation that remains the same. We have put in processes to get better and implementation. So to the extent that there was a little bit of a speed up, it may have a little bit to do with that. But I can\u2019t point to any deal that started later or earlier due to that efficiency. Michael Nemeroff : So another question that were probably going to get asked and I\u2019m sure you were two \u2013 should we look at the ANRR growth this quarter as may be a pull forward of some deals that you are expecting to close later or you expecting to implement a little bit later, because it was just \u2013 yes, I mean it is more than double, what it was \u2013 year-end and last quarter? Chad Richison : No, I mean we\u2019ve really tend to unload the musket every quarter on these deals and so we continue to do that, we don\u2019t have a long drawn out onboarding process as far as someone making a conversion from a competitor to us, that\u2019s something we want to get them set up very quickly and efficiently and \u2013 that\u2019s just what we do and so. I wouldn\u2019t say that we pulled forward anything that was due to start later in the year or that anything necessarily pushed, anything out of the ordinary. Craig Boelte : You always been have those deals? Chad Richison : Okay, I\u2019m sorry go ahead. Craig Boelte : I\u2019m sorry, you always going to have some of those, the push forward or back or whatever. But there wasn\u2019t anything I can point to this, say okay, well \u2013 this is the situation this quarter. Michael Nemeroff : So we could see typical seasonality year-over-year and sequentially or year-over-year, let\u2019s say from in Q4. Chad Richison : I\u2019m trying to think through what you\u2019re asking there. Ask that again? Michael Nemeroff : I\u2019m just trying to well \u2013 should we continue to think that the Q4 bookings or billings number is should look similar to what we have previously modeled, were not for this aberrantly large Q3 ANNR number? Chad Richison : Well, I \u2013 we\u2019re trying to sell as much as we can sell. And we don\u2019t intend on letting up the gas, I mean, it took in our goal as not only a SaaS company in the payroll and HCM space, but also as a sales organization to onboard the most new business revenue onto our platform over any other that are in our industry. Michael Nemeroff : Okay. Chad Richison : And I mean \u2013 this quarter, you had some very ADP increased from Q2 to Q3 increased their revenue about, I think it was $20 million, something like that ultimate increased their revenue about $8 million and we\u2019ve increased us almost $6.5 million and so that remains our goal and so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next quarter. But what is true is our reps are out there, they\u2019re doing their job and we\u2019re going to be continuing to drive for those results. Michael Nemeroff : Just one for Craig, on the ANRR growth, given how strong it\u2019s been or it\u2019s going to be regardless of what you put up in Q4. The delta on the next year\u2019s revenue is as pretty slight from the ANRR growth, the previous year and in fact this year it\u2019s accelerated. Just want to \u2013 given where consensus is which is relatively low compared to what is probably possible for you to do in 2016. Could you give us any indication of where you\u2019d like estimates to shakeout for growth in 2016 without giving specific guidance? Craig Boelte : No. As we\u2019re looking to 2016, what we\u2019ve done in the past is given 2016 guidance in the fourth quarter as we\u2019re reporting fourth quarter results. And as Chad, mentioned I mean we set up you know to be a growth organization and I feel good about our sales organization and kind of how they\u2019re set up to do that for the rest of the year. Michael Nemeroff : Okay. Thanks guys. Well done. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Albert Chi : Hi, this is actually Albert Chi on for Mark. Congratulations on a great quarter, if you guys, really impressed results. But I just want to dig a little bit deeper into the strength this past quarter. Are you seeing a big tailwind from ACA compliance and if though, are you able to quantify that for us. And secondly, do you think that next quarter there would be \u2013 even greater sort of scramble towards year-end or do you think customers are mostly gotten reduction in a row for this quarter. Thanks. Chad Richison : I think customers are continuously interested in the ACA offering, I think it\u2019s going to continue to be a popular topic, definitely through first quarter of next year as companies move from implementing into actually having to submit the forms. And so I see that happening, as far as ACA, I mean ACA is one of the many products that we sell here, it\u2019s not a metric that I want to give out on a continual basis. But what I will say is that of the $159 million in revenue we\u2019ve done so far this year, less than $791,000, \u2013 $790,000 was done in ACA. So again, of our total revenue ACA at this point represents a smaller portion and again, I don\u2019t see it being anymore significant in the future than other products that we\u2019ve brought to market underneath the same platform. Albert Chi : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from John DiFucci from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. John DiFucci : Thank you. Hey, Chad and Craig, I sort of have a follow-up to some of the questions here on ANRR, because we are all looking at this, and some companies have done pretty well this quarter, so that\u2019s a great and this is actually sort of at the high end of that range, way at the high end. So when we look at, I\u2019m going to go back to Mike\u2019s question, was asking about seasonality, because this quarter, ANRR was off to, post difficult for the highest growth quarter from last year. So it was most people would look at it, as we did as the most difficult comp you have, relative to last year. Can you put up the number there, I think is, maybe shocking or at least certainly very impressive? I\u2019m curious, is there something in the third quarter, maybe that\u2019s changing in your business, were you seeing more seasonality here, or is it just everything seems to be clicking along and so we all know you have a very disciplined sales process and that build out that appears to be we working here. What are \u2013 it does sound like you\u2019re selling some larger deals on average. Maybe if there\u2019s anything you can quantify for us and you gave some examples, which is like just even percentage growth in those ASP or average seat size or number of seats anything like that you can give us to \u2013 and we can, it\u2019s obviously the business is working here, and working very well, but anything more you can give us that help us quantify as we move forward? Chad Richison : Well, I mean I can\u2019t tell you that, I mean the number of sales reps we have that are going to reach over $1 million in new business sales has continued to increase, as I think back a couple of years ago, the largest person to sell, the largest amount someone may have sold may have been 750 and now we have so many people that sell over a million, I think, back to two or three years ago in the largest office sold, $3 million, $3.5 million and now we have offices that could do over $8 million in a year. And again, that\u2019s accelerated from $6 million the previous year, and so what\u2019s happening, is that our \u2013 the sales reps that we hire, that we bring in here go through our program, go through our training, and then they come out and several of them are extremely successful. Most of them are successful. And so that\u2019s really what it\u2019s happening, we\u2019ve strategically on purpose build the sales organization to be able to deliver results, we have a very good product for them to sell and those two things coupled together has produced the results we have this quarter. I cannot point to anything in third quarter, that\u2019s significantly well, I mean anything at all really that has driven the new business that\u2019s been brought on. I do think the fact that we do have an ACA product that we\u2019re talking about it, that were onboarding companies as we\u2019re out closing new business. I do think that\u2019s a conversation starter, but most of the business \u2013 again most of the businesses that we have brought on again July through September. But those conversations were being had before July and so it\u2019s something we had in our bag for a while. John DiFucci : Thanks and it\u2019s like \u2013 would it be safe for us to be thinking a little bit differently perhaps. So I think we used to think okay, you sign on, you open these new offices, you want it sort of a wash not much production, year two you get some production, after year three \u2013 and year three you start to think of in that mature offices but you just went through some numbers $8 million, $6 million, up from $6 million from some offices. That term mature office sound like it sort of a misnomer, we shouldn\u2019t really be thinking in that way, we should \u2013 that have sort of implies relative stagnation at a high level, but it sounds like that\u2019s interesting more out of those \u2013 those people as they continue to improve and as you expand your offering. Is that? Chad Richison : You\u2019re correct, you\u2019re correct. You should not be setting a limit on what a mature office can sell in any given year. John DiFucci : Okay, okay great. Thanks a lot and congrats guys. Chad Richison : Thank you. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking my question. This is [indiscernible] for Brendan. To follow-up on your comments on ACA\u2019s year-to-date impact on revenue. Can you maybe give more color on the impact of ACA and ANNR or wins in the quarter? Chad Richison : Well, it\u2019s hard to say exactly how much ACA would have impacted any given win, I mean I\u2019m sure we did get business because someone looked at our ACA offering or maybe someone else wasn\u2019t able to convert it to theirs. But again most of the business that we\u2019re having converted in July, many of those discussions were already taken place earlier in the year, I think we came out with our full service ACA offering earlier this summer, maybe. So it\u2019s just really hard to point to that, again ACA is a part of our overall system, there\u2019s definitely no one that came onto our software just to use ACA. And so, it\u2019s the total value proposition that we deliver, that does include ACA and whether or not those same companies would have come on without using our time and attendance or talent management or HR software pieces would have also been a question. And so, it\u2019s really hard to quantify exactly why customer chooses to use us, if you want to point out any one very specific piece of software functionality. But, I definitely think it\u2019s a door opener and it\u2019s a conversation starter. But again, most of our competitors have an offering, I mean, it would be very rare, this late in a year, to be talking into a competitive situation where we are competing against someone that also doesn\u2019t have some type of offering for ACA as we sit here in third and fourth quarter of 2015. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Chad Richison : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Brad Reback : Great, thanks so much. So Chad, did you think about the strength of the business right now, does it change how you think about new office \u2013 the rate of new office openings in 2016? Chad Richison : No, I think we have a strategy for the offices we open and we have a certain focus on how and when we open up an office, it\u2019s really has to do with a personnel development, it is true that the more offices we have, the more opportunities for relo, we have for current managers, as well as the more backfill strength we have as well. We\u2019re focused on both continuing to grow our footprint as well as expanding our footprint in current geographies and I don\u2019t see that that changing into 2016. Brad Reback : Great, thanks very much. Chad Richison : All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Corey Greendale from First Analysis. Please go ahead with your question. Corey Greendale : Hey, good afternoon and congratulations on a very nice quarter. Couple of quick things, are stalling up on the ACA point, and some other is that \u2013 we\u2019ve heard some other is that they expect it to be higher cost associated with getting clients ready for ACA, do you expect any of that in Q4, going into the new year? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, there is definitely a push to move data into the system, I think to the extent there is higher a cost on REN [ph] it\u2019s really the education act of the sale, and working with the client to make sure that that data is in, and it\u2019s being measured correctly. I don\u2019t know that we can point necessarily to say, it\u2019s going to impact our numbers significantly as far as cost \u2013 is associated with cost, Craig, I\u2019ll let you expand on that. But I mean I can\u2019t put if anything\u2026 Craig Boelte : Not like that\u2026 Chad Richison : Yes, there is no third-party software that we\u2019re buying or anything outside of it. So really the cost would be labor related to the people we have right now, maybe providing some additional service to clients that are doing this for the first time and then to some extent clients are just finding their data and they are having the full data from multiple systems, maybe some they\u2019ve tracked, maybe some they haven\u2019t tracked to the extent they should have. And convert that into the system and so I would say there is going to be some cost associated with that. But no more cost and what would be associated with looking at someone\u2019s talent management system or the software system or time and labor management or talent acquisition. And there is a cost that we incur to servicing clients, we do definitely report that. And so I don\u2019t see this being an additional cost item necessarily. No more stuff in anything else, the revenue \u2013 any revenue that\u2019s achieved through that product once it\u2019s really starts building, I think will make out for that. Corey Greendale : Okay, that\u2019s helpful and I appreciate you\u2019re showing that $790,000 number. Is that based on what your pricing is that a meaningful number to extrapolate far more because that number be meaningfully higher in next year just based on kind of the forms and other things being initiated? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, I gave that number to show kind of where we\u2019re at in the process. I don\u2019t see ACA and that\u2019s one thing that I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get into ACA, I mean I think we talked \u2013 we talking a lot about ACA and we have so many other products that also have a lot of traction and have revenue opportunities associated with them as well. Yes. I would say as we move into next year, as we continue to onboard more clients especially as they\u2019re becomes a Q1 forms filing side to this. You\u2019re going to see ACA revenue increased, I just want to increase at a rate larger than some of our other items, I mean I don\u2019t know. But you definitely will see it go up from 791. Corey Greendale : Okay. And \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Chad Richison : Well I just say it again 791 is an annualized, is a year-to-date number. Corey Greendale : Yes. I understand, and just one quick one on the Q4 guidance. If you look at where the ANRR number was in Q3 and kind of really impressive. I realized the math have been quite worth \u2013 if you take one quarter of that and added to where your revenue was this quarter, looks like the revenue guidance for Q4 is pretty conservative, like I put it under methodology that exactly sound. But directionally, can you just comment on that? Chad Richison : Some of the ANRR would have been, would have already rolled into the Q3 numbers as well, so as Chad mentioned those are clients that are already billing in on the system. The Q4 guidance from that end, we feel good about that, the one thing to mention is, the Q4 is a tough comp from last year. So, we got at the Q4 and the calendar as well. Corey Greendale : Great, I\u2019ll turn it over. Thank you. Craig Boelte : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from David Hynes from Canaccord. Please go ahead with your question. David Hynes : Hey, thanks. Chad, at the timing of your IPO, I think we talked about, the approximate bookings and mix like 5% was coming from 2000 plus employee organizations. Is there any way you can update that metric, give us a sense of how that\u2019s growing? Chad Richison : You know, I don\u2019t have that information on me. And it would be, I mean, it\u2019s not something I could comment right now, without having those numbers. I mean, I do think that we are selling more at the top end of our range, I mean, if you draw on the line at 2,000 how many did we sell at 1,900 to 1,700 and how many if we sold from 2,100 to 4,000. I know we\u2019ve sold more, but we\u2019ve also sold more in both of those ranges. And so, it would be hard for me to really at this point, you know draw any percentage for now. David Hynes : Yes, okay. And then help us think about kind of that the cadence of new office openings, the past two years, they\u2019ve been \u2013 since live in Q1, they\u2019ve been pretty consolidated, I mean, do you think 2016 kind of fall at the similar pattern or could they be shrinkable throughout the year, how are you thinking about growth on that front? Chad Richison : With that we are very focused on development of the personnel that actually relos, again to remind everybody the way we open up a new territory which you might be a new geography or it could be more geography in a current territory. As we take a current manager, that\u2019s established with us, we relocate them to a new geography. And then we backfill them with up and coming sales manager, currently a sales rep and wants to lead. And so, again, the more offices opportunity \u2013 and more offices that we have and more managers we have, the more people we have that we are able to relocate. And really that \u2013 what we make our decision on, we make our decision based on where we at as a company, who do we have that\u2019s ready to go, who do we have that\u2019s ready to backfill, because the fact is, I mean with a number of city and geography we\u2019re in right now, there is just a lot more opportunity out there than what we have people ready to relo at this time. And so we will continue to update that, again we do announce those openings after they\u2019ve happened, and I wouldn\u2019t draw any line in the sand on exactly when we would have another office opening whether that\u2019s early late in the middle or consistently throughout next year. Those are decisions that will be making as we continue on in subsequent quarters. David Hynes : Okay, understood. Thanks for the color. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Chad Richison for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right, thanks again to everyone joining us for the call. As a quick note, we will be presenting at the Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference in Scottsdale on December 1, and at the Barclays Global TMT Conference in San Francisco on December 8. I\u2019ll look forward to meeting with some of you at these events and in the coming months. So thank you, all. Bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

A reconciliation showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today, which is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig and thank you everyone joining us on today\u2019s call. I am very pleased to welcome everyone today for our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings call. We had an excellent fourth quarter, which capped an outstanding year. 2015 was our first full-year, as a public company and Paycom enjoyed continued success with our full-year revenue growth accelerating over 2014. Before I begin the discussion of our results, I want to take a moment to express how proud I am of our team. Our success is a direct result of their hard work and efforts. Additionally, I would like to thank our clients for allowing us to serve them. We are committed to providing the very best payroll and human capital management services to our clients and we are honored every day that they have selected Paycom to help them meet the needs of their business. We will look forward to continued success. Now I\u2019ll turn to our results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2015. As we announced in our press release earlier today, Paycom enjoyed continued momentum in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $65.1 million, representing growth of 48%, compared to the comparable prior year period. As a reminder, the fourth quarter was our best quarter in 2014 and therefore was our toughest comparable for the year. So I am particularly proud of this performance. Revenue for the full-year of 2015 was $224.7 million, which represents growth of 49% over 2014. Our retention rate was at least 91% for the fifth year in a row. This milestone underscores our high level of client satisfaction. Craig will go through our financials in detail, later on the call. But I wanted to take a moment to highlight our adjusted EBITDA, which was 21% of total revenue for the full-year of 2015, up from 18% for the full-year 2014. Paycom has been able to post impressive growth for several years, while also achieving significant profitability. This result is a testament to our efficient business model, as well as our focus on disciplined growth. It also indicates that we are bringing on profitable revenue, as we grow. We believe that we are one of the few public technology companies that has achieved multiple consecutive years of high growth, while also demonstrating consistent and increasing profitability. As another indication of our continued growth, we recently announced our next slate of new office openings. As you may have read in our recent press release in January, we opened six new sales offices, bringing the total number of sales teams to 42 nationwide. Our new sales offices are located in Chicago, Cleveland, Pasadena, Sacramento, San Antonio and Stanford, Connecticut. This will be our second office in Chicago, while the remaining five offices will represent new territories for Paycom. We believe that large metropolitan areas like Chicago have the potential to host several sales teams. We are excited about our prospects in these new regions and our ongoing sales office expansion. As a reminder, we open new offices with proven sales managers from an existing territory and then backfill those managers with high performing sales representatives that demonstrated strong leadership skills. It typically takes a new sales team, 24 months to reach maturity. So while we expect these new offices will make minimum contributions this year, we believe they are poised to drive growth in 2017, 2018 and beyond. I met recently with the sales managers that will be leading these new teams. I\u2019m pleased to report that they are all extremely energized to take on their new roles and to capitalize on the opportunity of introducing the Paycom solution to these markets. Our team was on a roll in 2015 receiving several awards. Paycom received national recognition as a best place to work among large-sized U.S. companies by winning a 2016 Glassdoor Employees\u2019 Choice Award. For the past two years, Paycom ranked within the top 20 of Glassdoor\u2019s best places to work for list. Making this the third straight year Paycom has earned a workplace accolade from the popular career website. Additionally for the third consecutive year, Paycom was named one of Oklahoma's top workplaces after being ranked the second-best place to work on the Oklahoman's top workplaces list. The Top Workplaces lists are based solely on the results of employee feedback and we feel the award is a validation of the effort we put into making Paycom a great place to build a career. Our total headcount at the close of 2015 was 1,461, up from 1,021 employees at the end of 2014. I\u2019ve spoken on prior calls about how our single database platform allows us to enhance our solution and develop new functionality very rapidly and cost effectively. We believe this is a competitive advantage and we are excited to continue delivering innovation for our clients in 2016 and beyond. 2015 was a very productive year for Paycom from a product perspective. In February, we introduced our learning-management system, Paycom Learning, this application formalizes company\u2019s training processes and seamlessly updates through other pertinent applications allowing companies to develop their talent quickly and most effectively. In June, we launched GL Concierge which offers organizations more control and transparency into their general ledger. GL Concierge is one of the few software applications in the human capital management space to operate based on payroll and gives financial professionals intuitive reporting, enriched audit trails, customizable file layouts and real-time alerts, all through Paycom\u2019s single-database technology. Following the release of our Affordable Care Act dashboard in 2014, we introduced our comprehensive Affordable Care Act compliance offering enhanced ACA in September of 2015. This application provides clients with continued access to an ACA dashboard and also filing of the required IRS forms plus additional real-time compliance related data reports and alerts. In addition to these three new offerings, we also rolled out numerous updates and enhancements to our platform. We are committed to ongoing improvement of our system and providing enhancements to our clients, so that they can benefit from the result of our R&D efforts. The strength of our platform has allowed us to become what we believe to be one of the fastest growing profitable public companies in our industry. And we will continue to invest in our R&D group, so that we are able to maintain this position. This is a good time to share some examples of notable client wins during the fourth quarter. First we signed a rehabilitation center with nearly 8,000 employees. This client came to us from a large legacy provider. We estimate their saving over $700,000 annually from a combination of eliminating separate systems in the manual processes and unproductive labor that their previous system required. Next we brought on board a casino organization with approximately 2,300 employees. This company had been managing its payroll in-house and also using several point solutions from a variety of vendors that resulted in delays and frustrations from manual paper based processes. I\u2019m pleased to report that this client loves the functionality, automation and ease-of-use offered by the Paycom solution. Finally, we signed a retail services company that provides solutions to large grocery chains. This client has approximately 2,000 employees and also had been using a large legacy provider. This organization operates across 48 states, so compliance was a key concern, as well as the need for automating its benefit process and having a central database, where all crucial HR information could be stored. Each of these three clients enabled multiple Paycom applications, continuing the trend of new clients taking greater and greater portions of our solutions suite. To conclude 2015 was a year of substantial progress for Paycom. We executed against our goals, adding sales teams, expanding our offering and continuing to capture market share in the outsourced payroll and HCM industry. We look forward to continued success in 2016. I will now turn the call over to Craig for an update on our financials and our guidance. Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our fourth quarter results and also our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2016, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income or non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation and other non-recurring charges including transaction expenses relating to our initial public offering and our follow-on public offering. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release. Our fourth quarter was robust with total revenues of $65.1 million representing year-over-year growth of 48% from the comparable prior year period. For the full year 2015, total revenue was $224.7 million, representing growth of 49% over 2014. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $63.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 47% from the comparable prior year period. For the full year 2015, total recurring revenue was $220 million, representing growth of 48% over the comparable prior year period. ANRR was $40.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $20.6 million in the same period last year representing growth of 97%. Because of the demand for our ACA solution, we had a substantial number of clients implement our solution in the fourth quarter that we believe would normally have launched our solution in January of this year. Therefore, we estimate approximately 25% or $10 million of our fourth quarter ANRR was pull-forward into the fourth quarter with the majority of these transactions occurring during December. Without this contribution, we estimate ANRR would have been approximately $30.6 million and would have represented nearly 48% growth over the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $55 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.4%. This compares to 82.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014. For 2016, we anticipate that adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 82% to 84%. Turning to operating expenses. As a reminder, we pay commissions to our sales representatives based solely on new sales at the time of the clients first monthly billing cycle. This is a one-time commission that we recoup over the life of the client relationship. When we experienced strong sales performance in a quarter, as we did in the fourth quarter of 2015, there is the potential for us to see increased expenses in that quarter depending on the timing of the client\u2019s onboard process. Driven by our strong sales performance in the fourth quarter, adjusted sales and marketing was $30.5 million. For the fourth quarter, total adjusted administrative expenses were $47.4 million. This compares to $30.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted R&D expense for the full year 2015 increased 98% from the comparable prior-year period. As Chad detailed, we will continue to investment in our solution to maintain our competitive advantage. Adjusted EBITDA was $10.5 million or 16.1% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $7.8 million or 17.6% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted primarily from the commission expense due to the strong sale performance I mentioned earlier. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2015 was $48.1 million or 21.4% of total revenue, compared to 17.9% in 2014, an increase of 350 basis points. This improvement was driven by scale and ongoing efficiency enhancements across the organization. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $6 million or $0.10 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $3.1 million or $0.06 per diluted share based on approximately 54 million shares a year ago. For the full year 2015, non-GAAP net income was $23.4 million. For the full year 2015, earnings per share were $0.40 based on approximately 58 million diluted shares. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015 was positively impacted by the extension of the R&D tax credit in late 2015. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $50.7 million and debt of $25.9 million. As a reminder, this debt represents the financing of our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $9 million for the fourth quarter and $43 million for the full year 2015, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. With that, let me turn to guidance for the first quarter and for fiscal 2016. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect total revenues in the range of $82 million to $84 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of approximately 50% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $21 million to $23 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2016, we expect revenue in a range of $309 million to $311 million or approximately 38% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2016 in the range of $63 million to $65 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 21% at the midpoint of the range. For 2016, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 38%, primarily due to the extension of the R&D tax credit and also the Section 199 deduction. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Nemeroff at Credit Suisse. Michael Nemeroff : Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Chad Richison : Yes. Michael Nemeroff : Nice quarter. Unfortunately your stock is, one of the many that aren\u2019t probably full reflecting the \u2013 the really strong prospects of the next couple of years but hopefully that will work itself out over time. Just a question, because based on the number of new offices that you\u2019re opening. Because you\u2019re not significantly increasing the number of new offices in 2016, six over five. I\u2019m just trying to figure out what kind of productivity increases that you\u2019re building into your forecast to keep the growth rate pretty high over the next couple of years and in 2017 when the new offices in 2016 start to really effect the numbers? Chad Richison : Yes. And so thanks, Mike. So we have continued to increase the amount that anyone executive sales rep can sell as well as sales team. I don\u2019t know that we hit a ceiling yet on how much a team can sell, I mean, I\u2019ve talked about this in the past time. We continue to increase from $3 million to $6 million and we continue on for anyone sitting. So, we\u2019re definitely increasing the productivity and how we\u2019re doing that is by selling more deals, selling larger deals and then of course selling more modules into each client. Michael Nemeroff : And then also, Chad, on the ANRR, I know it\u2019s not a perfect proxy for bookings in the quarter and if you look at what you did in the second half of 2015, I mean that is truly remarkable over 100% in Q3 and over 90% in Q4. Just trying to level set, because we\u2019re going to build the models and investors can have some expectations for 2016. Where would you think, where would you like the expectation to be for the ANRR growth, given the phenomenal growth in that number, and that figure in the back half of 2015 and 2016? Craig Boelte : Well, as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, I mean would you not give guidance as to the ANRR number, we are providing revenue guidance. ANRR as you know does turn into revenue. So we do expect the ANRR to be a strong moving forward. So I will probably stop with that. Michael Nemeroff : And just lastly for Chad, the EBITDA guidance \u2013 implied EBITDA guidance for Q1, the strongest it\u2019s ever been. I\u2019m just curious where we \u2013 which line items we see the most leverage in Q1? Chad Richison : Well, we are heading into Q1 off of a strong year and as everyone is aware, I mean our revenues recurring, I mean 98% of our revenues recurring, so we bring that in to the year with us and into first quarter. So we are expecting a first quarter, Craig you can talk more to the leverage on that. Craig E. Boelte: Yes, in the first quarter we will see a slight amount more of the seasonality than we have in the past, because of the 1094 and 1095 filings. And then also the sales and marketing the way we ourselves marketing year starts over on February 1, we see that ramp up throughout the year, those commission expenses. Chad Richison : And so we do commission sales people more based on how much they sell and our year starts over beginning February 1. So naturally commission rates are going to be lower in the back half of the first quarter. Michael Nemeroff : Got it. Thanks guys. Congratulations on a great quarter and a fantastic year. Chad Richison : Thanks Michael. Craig E. Boelte: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from John DiFucci at Jefferies. John DiFucci : Thank you. Chad, I know you don\u2019t forecast ANRR, you probably you do \u2013 you don't tell us that provide guidance for it. But you did say or Craig said that there were some ANRR that was pulled forward and that was part of the reason why it was so strong this quarter and it was strong really strong the quarter before. Craig can you remind us or Chad \u2013 I didn't catch as to why that pull forward happened this quarter. And I guess, more could be implied is that next quarter we\u2019d see a significant moderation in the growth rate of ANRR, because of that. Should that be our conclusion with that and without giving us guidance on ANRR? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean obviously we are still in the middle of the quarter and ANRR is a calculated commission amount based on starts, which is why it\u2019s really and not something that we guide on, because it\u2019s based on when a deal starts. Back to your original question on the reason why we saw the pull forward, ACA obviously is something that it\u2019s real and it\u2019s here this year. And so in order for us to perform the task for a client that\u2019s needed, for them to be compliant with ACA, they had to onboard with us in 2015. It\u2019s been our business that we bring clients on and we will actually provide them year-end services, provided that they are with us for the month of December. And so that require deals that would have most likely started in January as indicated by what would be normal for us in past years. Those deals started early and they started at the end of December, as we went through and we estimated that amount we came up with approximately 25% of the ANRR that we had our deals that pulled into fourth quarter as it relates to ANRR. John DiFucci : Okay. And then well, I guess we\u2019ll just wait till the next quarter to get a little more on ANRR. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean John we\u2019re going to have the pull forward. I mean we definitely had the pull forward, I mean those are deals that would have normally started in January. John DiFucci : Great. Chad Richison : In our business it is \u2013 it isn\u2019t necessarily common for companies to onboard in December. It doesn\u2019t mean that, it doesn\u2019t happen and there are reasons why a company would look to onboard in December based on their confidence and their year-end, current year-end process that they are going to undertake. ACA added another level to that obviously and so this is revenue we were going to experience anyway but it just so happened we did have that pull forward into December. John DiFucci : Okay, great, Chad. And if I may follow-up because I know these are kind of the questions we\u2019re going to get tomorrow and you\u2019ll get them too along the way. So really strong business right, ANRR last the couple of quarters I mean strong before that but even stronger now and you have little pull forward here but that\u2019s okay. Even without that it was just strong, it was really strong quarter and ANRR as you pointed out and we know turns into revenue in the future and that\u2019s evidence by your guidance especially for the first quarter. But what it implies is that the guidance for the year which again is significantly above where the street is but it implies the growth rate throughout the year will in revenue will actually \u2013 or decline or decelerate how is that in the back half. I guess I just want to make sure that like what does that mean? I guess that first you're giving guidance for the year and at the beginning of the year. So I just wondered if there is some conservatism in there or is there something in that guidance of a deceleration of growth into the back half, that there is something we are not thinking about. Is there something that we should be thinking about of how the business may develop over the year? Chad Richison : No, I mean we traditionally had a strong first quarter due to annual tax form filings that again continue to recur. And so we are going have a little bit more of that this year with the Form 1094 and Form 1095 with ACA which will file first quarter of every year for clients that have their service. And so we are going to receive a little bit of uplift on that. John DiFucci : Okay. Okay, great. Thanks a lot Chad. Nice job. Chad Richison : You bet. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Raimo Lenschow at Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats. Can I stay on John\u2019s point a little bit Chad, remember the quarter before, when we talked about ACA you kind of kept mentioning that it is kind of a small revenue item for you. And at the end of the day people are going often go stayed with their provider, because the ADP will give you an ACA module. And the $10 million that you point out now is that ACA revenue or is that customer going on the payroll and ACA will be a small module of that, just wanted to clarify that. Chad Richison : That is correct, the latter. Raimo Lenschow : Good. Chad Richison : Those are customers that started early with everything, including ACA, I mean with everything they are going to start with including ACA. So those are clients that on boarded early with ACA. I do not believe that clients choose us for ACA alone. These are deals I think we would have gotten anyway, regardless of ACA. I mean as an HR leader of a mid-sized company, you are not going to make the decision or you should not make the decision to make a change to a payroll service and it's also going to be doing time and labor, talent acquisition, HR, and talent management. You're not going to make that decision based on one piece of the functionality. And so it is something that clients have to have ACA, I believe you should use somebody, who is an expert in complexity, which we are. And I believe that clients need to find someone to do that. But I\u2019m unfamiliar with the competitor of ours that doesn\u2019t have an ACA offering. So whether ours is better or what have you, there just \u2013 there has to be a strong business case or value proposition for someone to change their culture, move all their data and learn new systems. And you just \u2013 it is not something we\u2019ve seen happened based on one module piece. And so this is pulled forward and deals that would have normally started in January, because there wasn\u2019t a great reason for them to start in December. But due to ACA, we now had a better reason for them to start in December and we on boarded them. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect, very clear thanks, Chad. And on the sales office opening, you mentioned six already in January. As we think about a year, is that kind of the number for the year as far as the \u2013 we are very front end-loaded for the year and then maybe had like a couple of \u2013 in February, March. Is six the number or is that just the January number? Craig Boelte : Six is the number that we have opened this year. It\u2019s the best year we\u2019ve ever had in opening up offices as far as six. We open them up much more efficiently this year than we have in years past. We had more people to choose from, on our bench and what have you. And so we're comfortable absorbing the six that we've opened and then as the year moves on, I mean, we\u2019ll review at that time. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Perfect. And then one last question. How do you think about the whole balance between gross and EBITDA and the EBITDA levels? So if I look this year, you achieved EBITDA around 21% I think guidance midpoint is around 21%. Is that kind of for you, a healthy probability is much better than the competition. So with rest of the money are reinvest or how do you think about leverage as you run the company? Craig Boelte : Well, I mean, I believe it\u2019s important. We\u2019ve been doing this for 18 years now. So I mean I believe it\u2019s important to, at some point be able to have some leverage in the model. We thought that we are a high-growth company and we focused on that. But we are also out there selling profitable business. And so we in the perfect world, we would expect to continue to grow at a high level while also having some leverage in the model on a go-forward basis. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, lovely. Thank you. Well done. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mark Murphy at JP Morgan. Mark Murphy : Yes, thank you very much for taking my question and I will add my congratulations on the strong results. Chad, you had mentioned closing a rehabilitation center and I believe you said it has 8,000 employees. So I wanted to ask you first of all, did I hear that correctly what issues were they encountering? In particular with their legacy provider, and then also I\u2019m curious where does that customer ranks now within your customer base in terms of size. And what I\u2019m trying to get at is whether you think that\u2019s a one-off or if you see other prospects of that size in the pipeline? Chad Richison : Yes. So size doesn\u2019t necessarily dictate complexity in the system, I mean sometimes it can. But, 8,000, I mean it\u2019s not going to rank small for us. We\u2019ve kind of reported these numbers in the past. So that is \u2013 we definitely at the larger end of clients that we\u2019ve on boarded. And so, as far as what exactly they were experiencing, I don\u2019t know if all the very specific issues that they were experiencing. But it\u2019s not uncommon for us we go through and work our value proposition and then deliver in ROI it\u2019s not uncommon for us to look at both the soft cost and hard cost savings. And there\u2019s a number of techniques that we go through to do that. I don\u2019t necessarily want to telegraph that on today\u2019s call but we\u2019re able to come up with a number as we have collaborative meetings with the client. Mark Murphy : Thank you. And then I also want to follow-up on some of the other questions about, this concept of the ANRR pull forward and really I have a very simple question. Do you think that that could recur in Q1 or even in Q2 or is that a one-time event due to sort of unusual year-end characteristics tied to this ACA phenomenon? Chad Richison : I will answer that this way, if you\u2019re not currently on our system, and having been on our system since the first of December, we will not be providing ACA services and filings with those companies for 2016. And so the other piece to your question I guess is yes, we will onboard clients this year who are looking to get complaint with ACA as it relates for 2016 to be filed in 2017 and we will onboard those clients throughout the year. But as I explained earlier they are taking the payroll at the time and attendance and other areas. And so ACA is a piece of that and not the driving force behind why someone makes a decision. Mark Murphy : Okay. Craig I wanted to ask you as well. In terms of the Q1 revenue guidance I think you mentioned or you were speaking to this in terms of the EBITDA guidance but the sequential increment is nearly $20 million at the high end of the range and its seems unusually strong. I think you eluded to part of this in terms of some of the 1099s or 1095 the processing of year-end payroll links tax forms and all that. Is there a way you could dig a little bit deeper into that because I think we\u2019re going to try to be gauging for our model with the underlying dynamic is there and just perhaps how much of that is seasonal versus what will recur? Craig Boelte : Well, it should all recur. It will just recur in the first quarter of subsequent years. I mean these aren\u2019t one-off charges, these are recurring annual charges. Mark Murphy : Yes, understood, but I think we\u2019re, so we\u2019re trying to understand from a modeling perspective that you have business that recurs once per year annually and you have business that recurs all four quarters throughout the year. So I think we\u2019re just trying to understand what portion of that is related to those forms and therefore what kind of a sequential drop off to model in Q2. And I\u2019m just trying to understand if it\u2019s any different than what we\u2019ve seen in prior years. Because, again that \u2013 the revenue guidance is just so unusually strong for Q1? Craig Boelte : Yes, Mark. So as you\u2019re looking at the out quarters, we\u2019ve given the full year guidance as well as the first quarter. So the balance of that would be spread over the remaining three quarters. And as you\u2019ve seen in the past, the second quarter is typically stronger than \u2013 the third quarter is stronger than the second and then the fourth steps up as well. So we would expect from a modeling perspective to be very similar to what you\u2019ve seen in the past. And then, that additional step-up in first quarter would be primarily related to those forms filings. And as Chad mentioned, that will be a recurring revenue item that we\u2019ll file every year. Mark Murphy : Okay. Thank you very much. Craig Boelte : Thanks Mark. Operator : The next question is from Brendan Barnicle at Pacific Crest Securities. Brendan Barnicle : Thanks so much. Craig, in your prepared comments you called out the large sales and marketing expense related to the upside and commissions. If you hadn\u2019t had this big benefit to ANRR, the one-time, I think related to ACA. What would that, do you have any sense of what that sales and marketing expense might have come in at? Chad Richison : Really, I haven\u2019t looked at that specifically but I mean obviously it would have made an impact on \u2013 adjusted EBITDA for the year. Brendan Barnicle : And Chad\u2026 Chad Richison : No, sorry\u2026 Craig Boelte : While just to add on that. I mean we did, what we did mentioned there was $10 million and pull forward into December. So the commission rate associated with the $10 million, you could probably expect to get some of that. Brendan Barnicle : Got it. And then Chad, we\u2019ve seen strong results across a number of your competitors have already reported it as well. So we\u2019ve seen this general upswell part of that you talked about some of the ACA component of it, are there other factors, other than that \u2013 that are driving some of the folks to look at \u2013 reengaging around there, their payroll and then other parts of the HR platform? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, again, I\u2019ll go back to ACA is a component of our overall value proposition and the product we sell. And again I\u2019m unfamiliar with any client that would go to us just for ACA alone. And so what we\u2019ve developed throughout the years and what we continue to sell as an overall product, that\u2019s being better at selling product having more mature sales staff, then being able to sell more. I really do believe that\u2019s what\u2019s been driving our growth, ACA has been a timely conversation. I mean anytime you get an opportunity to talk to a client about additional complexity, coming down the pipe, that\u2019s a positive for us, and whether it\u2019s reciprocity law lived in, worked in, states changing labor laws, overtime laws or what have you, that gives us an opportunity and so ACA has done that. It\u2019s provided us an opportunity. We do expect there to be \u2013 that there has been some uplift. I mean we are not going to ignore the fact that, that ACA is a revenue generating item for us just like direct deposit and some of the other items that we charge for and so. We expect the ACA to be a good product for us as far as on a moving forward basis. We don't expect ACA revenue in 2016 to be any higher than low-single digits of our overall revenue. And so again, it\u2019s timely for us to be able to have these discussions with people. It does help us get someone that might have on boarded a month from now to onboard now especially, if you're sitting in 2015 because there's still a lot of complexity to it and a lot of its knowledge-based what does someone really know about it. I do expect in 2016, 2017 and in subsequent years for the buzz surrounding ACA to dissipate somewhat as it relates to the filing piece of it, because people are going to understand it and we've seen this happen over and over again. As a leaders in Washington make changes to complexity on either tax codes and other areas and we benefit from that because part of what we do is educate ourselves and to become experts in complexity. Brendan Barnicle : Chad we spent a lot of time talking about the ACA but you've got two other products that came that got released last year with the GL Concierge as well as your LMS solutions. Give us any sense of what percent of revenues those ends up representing? Chad Richison : No, we\u2019re not going to breakout the addition of those or any of our other products. I just wanted to point that out on the ACA. But Paycom Learning is doing very well as is the first year for that product as well as GL Concierge. We take a methodical approach to us developing products based on need and how we're going to sell it as well as client usage. And so everything we develop is on purpose and we expect those products to continue to be strong for us as well. Brendan Barnicle : And then lastly, Chad, obviously markets been very worried about macro weakness in the economy the prospect of recession. Anything that you're seeing with all the different businesses that you work and suggest any real slowing that's going on? Chad Richison : I mean obviously, anything that hurts the overall economy, I think can have an impact on all businesses and the things that impact our clients can have an impact on us. Now, I mean we provided the numbers, we provided the guidance. So as far as do we feel like it's going to have a specific negative impact on us. I mean we feel like we weathered through what it is and I do believe the HCM industry is different. We\u2019re not just a technology company, we are providing a very valuable service and no one should be doing the payroll by themselves, no one. You never converted a payroll if someone doing it in-house that it was correct, ever and I have been doing this a long time. So I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s going away, we have solved the problem with technology but the fact is the service itself extremely valuable and I don\u2019t see companies going backwards and starting to do their own taxes and everything else based on maybe they lost a few employees or what have you. And that said we haven\u2019t necessarily seen any impact \u2013 major impact on our business at this point. Brendan Barnicle : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Brad Reback at Stifel. Brad Reback : Great, thanks very much. Maybe just building on Brendan\u2019s question that beyond there in the economy a little more. Chad if you think back to 2009 can you give us a sense of what if any impact employment levels or changes in employment levels you saw in the install base? Chad Richison : I mean 2009, we were a high grower in 2009 sometimes these types of pull backs in the economy create opportunities for us, because we\u2019re looking to go and create additional efficiencies and for companies that are looking to streamline processes and times like this in order to become a more efficient organization, we\u2019re a better solution. And so often times pull backs led this allow us to go and be much more competitive. Because people are looking at it right, I mean when the things are good people aren\u2019t necessarily looking to streamline efficiencies maybe the way they should, when you have pull back people are forced to do that we\u2019re a better option and answer to your question I mean it was a good year for us in 2008 and 2009 you more had the mortgage companies you had to really look like at that time, look for that time. And we made some changes on our business at that time to make sure we\u2019re handling guaranteed funds properly and other items that have survived us throughout the years. So like again, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not an expert on the economy we\u2019ve been doing this for 18 years. This is going to be a year for us, next year is going to be a year and we\u2019re going to continue on I mean we\u2019re in our own lane here and we\u2019re going to continue to do our business. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Chad Richison : All right, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Jim MacDonald : Good quarter guys. Just going off the last question, you say you\u2019re in your own lane but can you give us an update on competition, are you seeing anything different out there? Chad Richison : Not from \u2013 well let me say this, the competitions ever changing as far as what competitors provide and that\u2019s been the case from the beginning. And then we\u2019ve had a very strong competitive market. There are few of us that do it. I think from a full service perspective. I\u2019m unfamiliar of anybody of any size since we came into the picture in 1998. So I mean, as far as the players, I mean, I think the players are substantially the same depending on where you\u2019re at. And the flavor of what they provide is \u2013 it changes here and there and so do we. Jim MacDonald : Just a couple of clarifying questions on the ACA. You provide, some of it on a perform basis. But do you provide any of it on a monthly basis and if so what is the split between the two? Chad Richison : So we provide an ACA dashboard which clients are able to use as a standalone product. We also have enhanced ACA which is an ongoing monthly service that we provide which has additional service pieces embedded in it. And then, at the end of each year we also provide the Form 1095 and then as well as 1094 and so. Those are the components that make up our ACA revenue or any revenue associated with ACA. Jim MacDonald : Can you give us a clue as to how much is one time \u2013 is for the form and how much is recurring? Chad Richison : We do not provide that break-out. But as I did say it earlier, we do not expect all of ACA revenue combined, to be more than the low single-digits of our revenue next year. Jim MacDonald : And just for interest, what percent of your clients use you for ACA, if you can approximately? Chad Richison : Most of the clients that are required to be compliant this year, have implemented ACA with us. But I don\u2019t have an exact number as to those that are using another option for that. Jim MacDonald : Great. Congratulations, again. Chad Richison : All right, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mark Marcon at Baird. Mark Marcon : I\u2019d like to add my congratulations on the 17 years that I\u2019ve followed all the public payroll companies. This is one of the best quarters I\u2019ve ever seen from anybody. So congrats on the great year. Chad Richison : Thank you. Mark Marcon : With regards to one of the questions that have been getting is \u2013 just with regards to your more mature offices, I know they\u2019re all growing. But particularly those in Oklahoma and Houston, what are you seeing there just in terms of the growth rates? Craig Boelte : We don\u2019t disclose any one office. But, I mean, those offices you named specifically are doing very well. I mean, they\u2019re mature offices, they can open for a while, they\u2019ve had the same managers in them for a little while and so any place where we\u2019ve had a manager in there for some period of time that\u2019s going to be a strong office for us. Mark Marcon : Yes. But I mean no degradation in terms of the opportunities that you are seeing out of those offices, just because of what\u2019s happening in the oil patch? Craig Boelte : No absolutely not, I mean again, I think it has to do with our size and the overall TAM that we still have left to capture I mean we\u2019re still 1.5%, 2% of our overall TAM. So there is still a lot of room for us out there and I think that\u2019s really more factor. We get to choose who we sell, we\u2019re sometimes we pick up the phone and there is someone saying they want to convert. But often times we choose who we\u2019re going to sell, whether we\u2019re working with a referral source or going to our targeted prospecting methods or some other techniques that we use. So we\u2019re going to continue to sell into those markets and we haven\u2019t seen any type of the pull back. Mark Marcon : Great. And then with regards to the ACA revenue that you recognized here in December, I mean you pulled forward $10 million but it sounds like even for this quarter, you gave us the 2016 ACA kind of contribution, for this quarter was even less than that right as a percentage? Craig Boelte : Well, what I will say just to kind of tweak that a little bit, we pulled forward $10 million in ANRR. Mark Marcon : Right. Craig Boelte : Not necessarily revenue, right. So $10 million in ANRR. Mark Marcon : Clearly understood. Craig Boelte : Businesses started early. Okay, I\u2019m sorry, maybe I miss the question. Mark Marcon : I was just saying that the ACA contribution for this last quarter was fairly de minimis was it not? Chad Richison : We do not \u2013 I haven\u2019t gone through that number we did a calculation based on next year but I mean you wouldn\u2019t \u2013 from an overall year perspective yes. I mean it would have to be a much smaller number. Mark Marcon : You gave us that number last quarter Chad, that\u2019s a reason why I was asking is \u2013 because it kind of size things so that people could get a perspective in terms of what we haven\u2019t seen that yet. Just switching over to the EBITDA guidance for the full year given the revenue growth if you \u2013 the guidance basically implies no EBITDA margin expansion for 2016. If that\u2019s the case would that basically be a function of we\u2019re going to continue to invest behind technology in R&D that will continue to grow at a fairly rapid rate. And then an addition to that there is a possibility that we\u2019re going to continue the strong sales performance and so we want to leave some room in terms of sales and marketing for increased commissions if that comes through? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean I would say the \u2013 I mean obviously we\u2019re going to continue to invest in R&D as we have but it seems like the largest impact we have on a successful quarter are sales commissions and we start to see that as you head throughout the year. Mark Marcon : Enough. And just to remind people your commissions basically are being paid on the ANRR during the time period when the ANRR is disclosed. Chad Richison : That is correct, that is correct. Mark Marcon : Great. Thank you very much and congrats. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you. Chad Richison : All right. Well, I think that\u2019s it. So thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. I\u2019d like to extend thanks again to the team here at Paycom. We had a terrific year and we\u2019re all looking forward to another successful year here in 2016. So thanks for joining us, we\u2019ll see everybody later. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Craig Boelte. Mr. Boelte, please go ahead. Craig Boelte : Thank you and good afternoon. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical fact including those regarding our future plans, objectives and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

A reconciliation showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today which is available on our website at Investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks Craig. As we announced in our press release earlier today. Paycom enjoyed continued success in the first quarter of 2016. Our revenue for the first quarter was $90.1 million representing growth of 63% compared to the comparable prior-year period. This was driven both by our ongoing sales success and also by strong performance in the tax form filing portion of our business, which we experience every first quarter. As many of you know, our form filing business to date has consisted of Paycom filing IRS forms W-2 and W-3 and forms 1099 and 1096 on behalf of our clients. This year for the first time we also filed forms 1094 and 1095 as required by the Affordable Care Act on behalf of certain clients. These factors combined to generate our revenue out performance. Craig will provide more detail on our financial performance later on the call but I'd like to highlight that the strong top line performance flowed through our income statement to generate very strong adjusted EBITDA of $33 million or 37% of revenue. This is a record level for Paycom both on a dollar and percentage basis. I'd like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and incredible performance, they put in as part of our effort surrounding the ACA development and implementation. ACA compliance is very important to our clients and our team handled every implementation and question with great skill and care. With that I would like to provide some more color regarding our first-quarter performance and also some comments on our view of the marketplace and expectations for 2016. Our momentum continued in the first quarter as our powerful single database payroll and human capital management solution continue to resonate in the marketplace. As a reminder our target segment consists of companies with 50 to 2000 employees for what we term the mid market. We believe they were remains substantial runway for continued sales growth in the segment as in our view companies in this range, are not tip really leveraging the potential of software technology, particularly within the human capital management or HCM. As we speak with current and prospective clients we continually encounter companies that can derive substantial value and benefits from our solution. These benefits can take many forms. Some firms can reduce expense significantly by utilizing the Paycom system to evaluate and hire candidates that could potentially generate a valuable work opportunity tax credit. Other companies that deploy the workforce and shifts can use our system to avoid paying costly overtime. Firms looking to both develop their talent and also reduced turnover also use our learning and survey capabilities to train and engage the workforce. The key differentiator in these scenarios is that by utilizing Paycom's single database employee data flows seamlessly throughout all its applications, streamlining many HCM functions. We believe our software solution is best-in- class and we are committed to maintaining our competitive advantage by continuing to improve our solution. And the first quarter of 2016 we once again more than doubled our adjusted R&D spend growing it 105% year-over-year to 4.2% of revenue. Though we do not provide formal guidance in this area, we're on pace to more than double our adjusted R&D expense again in 2016 and in the second quarter of 2016 we expect it to be close to 6% of revenues. This amount of R&D spending would be double the level of R&D spending from when we went public in 2014. We are excited that the spend is reflected in our software offering and I am pleased that the spend did not prevent us from experiencing expansion within the margin. The low penetration of advanced cloud-based HCM and payroll solutions in the mid market is a key driver to our momentum. We anticipate that it will persist for several years as our market share even today remains small relative to the opportunity. As we measure it and as verified by third-party research firm such as international data Corporation, the addressable market for our services in the United States is approximately $25 billion. Another key driver for Paycom, as well as, the entire outsourced HCM industry is the environment of increasing regulatory complexity. As we observed with the Affordable Care Act and more recently with the proposed overtime expansion, the trend of lawmakers and regulatory agencies has been to continue to increase the compliance burden on virtually all companies across the US. This hits the mid market particularly hard. These companies typically do not have the internal resources or the time to navigate these requirements. Additionally, it rarely makes sense for mid market firms to hire staff and build departments to obtain these capabilities. As the return on this investment usually pales when contrasted with investing in the core business. It is the combination of Paycom's expertise in HR regulation and tax laws, along with our proprietary single database system that allows our clients to not just achieve compliance but obtain significant organizational inefficiencies that in turn drive very compelling ROIs. The comp, this combination also allows Paycom to react quickly to changes in regulation and provide thought leadership and tools to our current and prospective clients. A great example of this is our overtime expansion tool, that we recently introduced and is proving to be very popular. As many of you know the Department of Labor is expected to expand overtime protections in 2016. Our tool allows executives to quickly determine how much the proposed the changes are likely to cost the organization and also provides employers with inflection point salary levels at which they would economically be better off raising compensation rather than paying overtime. I want to underscore that it is the combination of our regulatory knowledge, software development capabilities and also the flexible nature of our single database platform that allowed us to react so rapidly. The synergy between regulatory knowledge and software development is a key competitive differentiator for Paycom and something we built and refined for many years. Another key differentiator we enjoy a Paycom is our highly effective and organically built sales organization. Our sales force is trained to identify areas where solution can be most effective for prospective clients and work collaboratively with those prospects to help them obtain the most valuable outcomes during deployment. As I detailed on our last call, we launched six new sales teams in January bringing our total number to 42. These teams are progressing in line with our expectations and should reach maturity at the 24 month mark. These teams followed the five new teams we launched in 2015, which are also progressing closer to becoming fully mature teens. I recently had the opportunity to spend time with our sales force that our annual Presidents club gathering, to celebrate their achievements. The mood among the sales organization remained extremely positive as our recent successes spurring the teams to reach even higher and to keep our momentum rolling through 2016 and beyond. Now I'd like to highlight of new client wins that we one in the first quarter. These highlights are just a selection of the many new clients that joined the Paycom family and I use them as examples to illustrate the broad appeal of our solution across industries. First, we signed a large event securities event staffing company this client has just over 3000 employees and was using a national Paycom competitor. This client loved our high touch customer service model along with the ease-of-use of our system for their employees in the ability to access actionable analytics. Next, we brought on a transportation company with over 8000 employees. This company provides shuttle services to consumers across a large metropolitan area and was also using a large national Paycom competitor. In addition, to needing to consolidate multiple systems this client also wanted to automate and standardized on boarding process which they have been doing manually prior to using Paycom. Finally, we welcomed a fast-growing building products company with over 2000 employees. This client was also using a national Paycom competitor and was facing challenges obtaining the service they needed to support their growth. With the Paycom system the client now has the ability to produce analytics and real-time, that allow them to make critical decisions on labor and cut down on unnecessary labor expenses. Our solution empowers their managers to better control labor cost on a daily basis. Because of our robust and user-friendly analytics tool. Now before I hand the call over to Craig, I want to take a moment to highlight that the journal record recently recognized him with a 2016 financial stewardship award in the public company category. Craig, is been Paycom's CFO for over a decade. He has been an invaluable leader within Paycom for years and has been instrumental in helping guide and grow the company to where it is today. With that I will now turn the call over to Craig for an update, on our financials and our guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks Chad. Before I review our first-quarter results and also our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2016, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation and other nonrecurring charges including transaction expenses related to our follow-on public offering. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release. We experienced a strong first quarter with total revenues of $90.1 million representing year-over-year growth of 63% from the comparable prior-year period. As Chad mentioned, revenue out performance was driven by a combination of continued strong sales growth better than expected growth in our tax form filings business and also performance from forms filings related to the ACA. Within total revenue, recurring revenue was $88.9 million for the first quarter of 2016, representing 99% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 64% from the comparable prior-year period. I would like to now comment on the A&RR. We have decided to discontinue providing A&RR because of the limitations of this metric. A&RR is a measure of one business is onboard, not when it is sold. This means that investors who attempt to forecast A&RR are effectively creating an estimate for a very brief period of time because of our short sale cycle, which is typically 4 to 6 weeks and our onboard cycle, which is a similar period of time. Based on client choice and need, this creates variable start dates, which in turn leads to variability in A&RR. We saw an example of this just last quarter when we experience the pull forward of approximately $10 million in A&RR due to the ACA reporting deadlines. With respect to the first quarter of 2016, bookings in A&RR were consistent with our expectations. Our anticipated future A&RR is reflected in both our second quarter and full year revenue guidance. Both of which are the largest we have ever provided on the growth and of course absolute dollar basis. Total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $78.3 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 87%. This compares to 85% in the first quarter of 2015. Strengthen our adjusted gross margin line was driven in part by the out performance of our forms filing business, as well as ongoing improved efficiencies across our organization. For the full year 2016, we anticipate that adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 82% to 84%. Turning to operating expenses as a reminder we pay commission to our sales representatives, based solely on new sales at the conclusion of the client's first monthly billing cycle. This is a one-time commission that we recoup over the life of the client relationship. When we experience strong sales performance in the quarter, there is a potential for us to see increased expenses in the quarter, depending on the timing of the clients on boarding process. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2016 was $28.4 million. This amount represents approximately a $2 million sequential decline from the prior quarter. This was driven by strong commissions in Q4 2015, due in part to the pull forward of certain deals into the fourth quarter of 2015 by the Affordable Care Act that we have discussed in last quarter's call. For the first quarter total adjusted administrative expenses were $48.2 million, this compares to $35.5 million in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted R&D expense of $3.8 million increased 105% from the comparable prior-year period as we continue to invest in our solution. Adjusted EBITDA was $33 million or 37% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2016, compared to $13.6 million or 25% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the commission expense trend, I mentioned earlier, as well as, the strong forms filing revenue. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2016 was $19.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share based on approximately 58.4 million shares versus $6.7 million or $0.12 per diluted share based on approximately 56.6 million shares a year ago. The effective tax rate was 35% compared to 41% in the comparable prior-year quarter, primarily due to the ability of the section 199 deduction and the R&D tax credit. Turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents a $72.1 million and debt of $25.6 million. As a reminder this debt represents the financing of our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $29.9 million for the first quarter reflecting our strong revenue performance and profitability of our business model. With that let me turn to guidance for the second quarter and for fiscal year 2016. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect total revenues in the range of $69 million-$71 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of approximately 43% at the mid-point of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in the range of $14 million-$16 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 21% at the mid-point of the range. For fiscal year 2016, we are increasing our guidance for revenue to a range of $320 million-$322 million or approximately 43% year-over-year growth at the mid-point of the range. We are also increasing our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal year 2016 to a range of $73 million-$75 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23% at the mid-point of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Raimo Lenschow : Hey. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations for a great quarter. Going back to Greg and Chad for the A&RR, I totally get the logic it's a volatile, as we saw in Q4. Is there any other way you think we should look at the business in terms of going forward? And then, that's the first question. And the second question is can you help us understand how much of the special effect you get from ACA and the tax filing. Was there anything special that will not be there next year, or is it like you are doing more now, which basically is showing up until next year? You will have a very similar situation? Thank you Chad Richison : Thanks Raimo. This is Chad and I'll go ahead and take the last question first. As far as ACA everything we bill a client for as it relates to ACA is either recurring on a monthly basis, or it is recurring on an annual basis. But all the revenue is recurring. And so we would expect to experience similar forms filings at the same type of view next quarter. As next year for the same quarter in 2017, so those will recur. As it relates to A&RR this was a metric that, really, we almost last quarter were thinking about not providing it due to the volatility that we experience. Last quarter was going to be anywhere from 48% to 97%, depending on the Pull Forward starts, which we indicated was $10 million at the time. That anomaly, due to the earlier starts in the fourth quarter, not only impacted our fourth-quarter comp, which we did talk about. It impacts first quarter of this year, depending on that Pull Forward. And then it impacts fourth quarter of this year as we head into that. And it will also impact 2017. And so, as we looked at that, we looked at A&RR becoming really less useful. Because we were either going to have to explain more and more clients starts and how that changes throughout the year or are we going to have to start breaking out how much of it is one thing versus another. Another piece of our A&RR as we look forward, it is a commission number. So there are those items that we commission on. Over time there might be additional revenue items that we add within our platform, that we don't necessarily commission on. And that would be another area. I will remind as I know you know Raimo, A&RR is also included in the guidance. And as far as modeling I do think were as far as what I would direct people to, and what we see as being important. Sales office openings and those that are both ramping to maturity, as well as, those mature offices. We've been very consistent in how those offices have grown over time and how those offices have become mature. And we look forward to continuing in that strategy. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Well done. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John DiFucci from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. John DiFucci : Thank you and I'm sorry. I'm going to ask follow up to both of Raimo's questions. Can you tell us what the impact of the ACA related tax form filing was this year, so we can look at the year-over-year impact it had for this year relative to next year, so we can size that? And then I have a follow-up. Chad Richison : We haven't broken out specifically the ACA forms filings. Obviously we have done less ACA form filings than what we do our normal forms filings. So there would be some type of percentage of that. We do believe that most of the clients that are with us that are eligible for ACA or should be required to file ACA are on that platform right now. And so I wouldn't expect we would necessarily see huge growth relative specific to just ACA next year, as being proportionally different than forms filings that we have. But we haven't broken that out separately. John DiFucci : Okay. Because we could estimate what that is and we have. But you can't just give us - because I'm thinking the year-over-year growth was significant. I do want anybody, I don't anticipate modeling this going forward in the year because it's a big impact in this quarter\u2026 Chad Richison : So one thing I did say previously on the call last quarter, which I wouldn't - from where I sit today, I wouldn't make any changes to this comment - and that as we would expect ACA-related Billings for this year to equal low single digits, as a percent of our overall revenue for 2016, if that helps. John DiFucci : Okay. Thank you. And if I could on the A&RR Chad, I understand why you are doing this. I think we all do. But to abruptly stop giving us the metric raises a lot of questions. Especially - and you give some good reasons why sales and marketing expense was down this quarter, and certainly down as a percentage of total revenue. But you can also come to other conclusions, too, as you might have given that, as sales and marketing expense is tied to commissions. And perhaps - can you give us any kind of subjective information even around A&RR in this current quarter to bridge us instead of stopping it unexpectedly? Chad Richison : I do think if you were able to look at our guidance to second quarter that would suggest a level of A&RR. I can answer it this way. We still are selling the same way we have always sold. Our salespeople woke up today and they are selling as much and more than what they have sold in the past. We have more mature sales teams than we've had in the past. Our pipeline is a strong as it's ever been. Our value proposition is very strong. We put a lot into R&D. We expect next quarter R&D's going to be close to 6% of revenue, and as you know on the call we started off as a company IPO of 3%. So we've done a lot to really impact everything. I understand that what some people might see as an elimination of a metric that we felt that over time has become, I think, somewhat less informative. And then with the anomalies we have had come in become more difficult over time to explain and make sure that everything is in the right quarter. Because, again, with A&RR you can have a client start on March 8 and because they are a biweekly client, they go into second-quarter A&RR, and then you can have the same client start on March 8, and because they are a semimonthly client they go into first quarter A&RR. So there's a lot of anomalies that come up with that. And we feel like we've got a strong future here and we want to focus on what's important. And we believe that is sales office openings. We believe that's sales teams that continue to mature much further past what we had anticipated in the past - and we're looking forward to continuing that strategy. John DiFucci : Okay can you tell us if A&RR grew this quarter? We know there's a Pull Forward last quarter of $10 million into the fourth quarter from the first quarter. So I anticipate you didn't get the kind of growth you had seen anywhere near that - Chad Richison : I don't mind sharing with you that A&RR grew without the Pull Forward. John DiFucci : Okay. Without the Pull Forward. I'm sorry does that mean - Chad Richison : I am saying, even if we do not include the $10 million Paul Forward A&RR grew, as reflected in our second-quarter guidance. John DiFucci : Okay, cool. Thank you very much\u2026 Chad Richison : Now with a $10 million pull forward, it would have been another record piece. But again we're trying to move away from that metric John DiFucci : I totally understand, Chad, but those last comments are very helpful. Thank you very much. Chad Richison : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Murphy : Yes, thank you very much and I will add my congratulations. Chad, I wanted to ask you when you look at your recent new client wins, on average can you help us understand how many disparate systems is the customer unplugging when they go to install the take home system. I think I'm trying to understand how often are you seeing really a one for one swapout of the payroll system versus, I think, more frequently you are displacing payroll, maybe also talent management, may be some expense management or a cobra product or something else. And so, on average, what is that you are seeing there recently? Chad Richison : No. I obviously couldn't update an average to be accurate without going through all of the data of those clients that we have recently onboarded. But it would be extremely uncommon, and as a matter of fact, I don't know of the situation where we didn't at least replace three or more. Now weather that is another product that someone actually bought, or potentially in the midmarket you can have clients that have deployed an access database with other information in it that they use. Maybe they have hooked Crystal reporting, or another type of Cognos, or reporting tool within their database, as well. So, when you were talking about replacing multiple systems, there's a lot there we could look at. Mark Murphy : Okay, great. And I wanted to ask you, as well, what are you experiencing in terms of what I think sometimes people refer to as the acclamation and the usage of the products. The dynamics that keep clients engaged and keep them sticky and driving the retention rates. So for instance, are you seeing greater adoption of the new products, like learning or the GL Concierge are some of the newer products at the time a contract is being signed? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, we definitely - let me answer it this way. We've gotten a lot better at onboarding clients to increase usage from the beginning. We find that often a client buys for the full value proposition and that might not have, even though they might have everything, they might not have used everything in the beginning. And I think it's important that clients get what they pay for, and they are using everything. And obviously a usage increase retention, as well as it just makes it easier for everyone else to use the product; specifically their employees. And so that's the way we look at it, and we have experienced a greater client usage, and greater competence, client competence in the product recently, and as we move forward. But that's a strategy, a very specific strategy for us that we've undertaken, as something that's being very important. Mark Murphy : Okay great. I wanted to also go back to an earlier comment. You did say briefly a moment ago that the pipeline is a strong as it's ever been. So I just wanted to drill into that. Can you provide any more color or any more texture in terms of what you are seeing? Are the sales teams maturing more rapidly than in the past? I'm curious based on that. Like you said, I think we can back into a feel for ANRR, even bookings, by looking at the Q2 guidance, which is quite strong. But is your gut feel that the new bookings trajectory would be pretty healthy here going forward? Chad Richison : Obviously, we do not guide bookings. We are not guiding to A&RR. But my comments are more geared toward this. We now have 42 cities open. We had five more mature in first quarter this year, because we had five that we had opened in 2014. Those are mature. We have more executive sales reps that we've ever had in the past. Our sales teams are selling more than they've ever sold in the past. Our reps are selling more than they've ever sold in the past. In the past, we had a couple reps do a million, and then we had three or four do a million, and now we just got back several doing a million and several did over $1.5 million. We are just seeing them sell more and more and more. And so when I'm talking about our pipeline remains strong I'm looking at each sales team. I'm seeing we have a number of sales teams. And also the growing success within each sales team continues. So, yes, our pipeline for new clients remains very strong. Mark Murphy : Great thank you very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Nemeroff from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, this Alex on for Michael. Thanks for taking my question and I will echo the congratulations. Just one if I may can you provide a general update on your strategy for new sales office openings? Should we still expect the timing to remain consistent with prior years, where you typically launch all of them in the first quarter of each year? And also as your bench of regional sales managers continues to grow, is there any chance you would step on the accelerator and open more than say six new offices next year? Chad Richison : So this year was the most offices we've ever opened to date at six. Obviously there's a lot of the year left, and as we continue throughout the year we will make the decision on what we may or may not open, based on both opportunity, as well as backfill. It's important any time we do deploy a new sales team strategy that we have great success and we've had that in the past and we look forward to continuing that. Is a general overall and what we've been consistent with is not talking about those cities that we are going to open, or how many. But it is true this was our first year to open up six. What's also true, something you pointed out, is for the last three years we've opened them up in the first quarter. Now in years past that hasn't always been the case, and we're going to look at the opportunity as we move throughout the year and make those decisions we think will best impact us for both this year, as well as into the future. Because as everyone knows by now, those of you who have followed us closely, it takes an office 24 months to mature. And the office openings that we have this year are going to have a substantial impact for us as they mature into 2018. As we have had five more mature from 2014 into this quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect thank you for taking my questions, and congratulations again. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is Trevor on for Brendan. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple quick ones regarding ACA-related buildings being low single digits for the year. Should most of that be in Q1? Craig Boelte : You know we haven't broken that out specifically, as far as that goes. That's a good question, but we haven't broken that out. Definitely Q1, well it depends on growth throughout the year of our ACA-related monthly item. So it's hard to exactly say that. But as we sit here today, when you take into account that Q1 does have ACA forms filings. I would think it would be a quarter that would rival out quarters, if not be better than out quarters in regards to ACA revenue. Unidentified Analyst : Okay thanks and then the non-ACA forms filings, was there any unexpected strength in the quarter? Craig Boelte : I would say no. That's been business as usual for us. There were no changes in what we did this year with tax form filings, any other than - now, obviously the more new clients we added on last year, we're going to produce more form W-2s and W-3s, as well as your 1099s. And so you would have an uptick to the extent that your client base grew, or client growth grew, and employee count, as ours did throughout the year. But it wouldn't be it wouldn't have different characteristics than what it's had in the past. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Craig Boelte : Other than the ACA piece Unidentified Analyst : Right. Understood. And then lastly for me, did EBITDA guidance suggests second half costs a little bit higher than we were expecting? You mentioned the R&D expenses. Is there anything else we should think about? Craig Boelte : No. As we look at the out quarters for the adjusted EBITDA guidance, it would primarily be in the R& D, as well as sales and marketing. Chad Richison : The sales and marketing expense, as well. Unidentified Analyst : And then, anything unusual there just based on revenue? Chad Richison : No. Just as we are ramping offices and they continue to sell at high levels. On those out quarters, as we mentioned on previous calls, those sales reps hit certain gates, so the commission expense goes up throughout the year. Craig Boelte : There other accelerators throughout the sales year, which for us starts in February and ends in January. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Thank you. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks a lot. Just a quick financial statement question. If I look at the cash flow statement, client funds held increased by $429 million in the quarter. Anything other than timing going on there? Craig Boelte : No. Typically on the client funds held, that first-quarter is a strong quarter, primarily because you have [few that ensued] those bills that first quarter, and people will hit those limits. But as you look at the last year, every quarter tends to increase. After that first quarter, it will drop off a little after the first quarter and then build back up. And this was our strongest quarter we had over $1 billion in [Franklin sales]. Chad Richison : Which would reflect the onboarded clients that we have done throughout the year last year. Brad Reback : Got it. Thanks very much. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Corey Greendale from First Analysis. Please go ahead with your question. Corey Greendale : Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong quarter. I wanted to ask about the Q1 guidance. As a public company you have a strong track record of doing at least a little better than your guidance. I think this is a new standard. So can you address a little more specifically what went better than you expected on revenue in Q1? Craig Boelte : Well, I mean, we had definitely strong onboarding for new business, as you look at it. Some of it even onboarded in December which we discussed which means you are getting billing for all those at the beginning of the quarter throughout the quarter, instead of those that may have come in through the middle of the quarter, and you get less of the billing for that specific quarter. So that had an impact. Obviously there was some impact for ACA forms filing, and really it's the project that combined gave us a strong first quarter. Corey Greendale : Okay and then on the EBITDA line, I think you beat the high end of that by $10 million, which is more than you beat the high end of the revenue guidance by. So what was on the cost side that you outperformed by $4 million, or something like that? Chad Richison : We continue to look for and gain efficiencies in every line item. So that's a strategy of ours and that continued into the first quarter. Corey Greendale : Okay and then last one for me, I just want to clarify, your comments on the R&D, you are talking about the R&D expense on the income statement? Chad Richison : That is correct and there's about a third, around 30%, that we capitalized. But that is correct on those. Corey Greendale : We should assume the 30% ratio will hold going forward? Chad Richison : It depends on the projects we are working on. We capitalized certain projects. But it's been historically between 30% and 33%. Corey Greendale : Okay. Great. Thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Marcon : Thank you. Let me add my congratulations. With regards to the ACA can you just talk a little bit about how satisfied you were with the actual execution of the program with the forms? And what are you seeing in terms of client retention with regards to some of your longer standing clients? Craig Boelte : So we've given our client retention metric each year. Last year once again it was 91%, which it has been the same every year for the last three or four years. So we think that remains good. Obviously we always want to increase retention and those are strategies that we definitely work on. As far as ACA, I couldn't be happier with the group. It's not just writing code and deploying it you also have to understand what it's going to do, and be willing to make the changes throughout the year as things change. And this is the very first year, not only how was calculated and everything else, but it is the first year it's ever been filed. And there were a lot of changes happening throughout the year. So I'm very happy with what we have been able to put out there and we will still continue to update items within the ACA module as clients look to become more strategic and how they comply with ACA. Mark Marcon : Great so it sounds like client satisfaction with how everything went for the ACA thus far has been pretty good? Chad Richison : Yes our client satisfaction - I can't speak for every client. There our clients out there. But from my perspective I'm very proud of the group that we had. I'm unfamiliar with issues related specifically to ACA, and I am happy with the way we performed this year. Mark Marcon : Great I wasn't suggesting that there were any issues by asking the question. There have been some other players in the space that have had some issues, and so was just checking. With regards to the sales pipeline is that pretty uniform across - when you take a look at your offices that have been open for 2 or more years are you seeing a uniform level of uptick in terms of the pipeline, or are there any regional differences that are developing? Craig Boelte : To the extent it's regional it's not really about the region, it's about the leader for the office. To the extent that one office is doing better than another office, I would typically point to the leader in that scenario. Usually they have developed reps. They have more executive reps who have been in their territory longer. And those cities that we've had for a while. And sometimes you will have a city that's mature, but we plucked people out of it. We have plucked executive reps out of it in order to backfill other opportunities. In some cases you can have an office that's mature, that we pulled a manager out to open another city. So you have some of those factors that come into play. But we have always to date been able to increase the amount that any one office or sales manager can sell, or is responsible for selling through their people. And we have also been able to increase the amount that any one executive rep can sell. And these numbers are getting large for us, and we are excited about that, and we don't know where that ends as far as a cap. But we are looking forward to continue to grow as we have in the past. Mark Marcon : It sounds like you haven't run into a cap on any one office yet is that fair? Craig Boelte : We represent such a small percentage of the overall TAM. We're out there. Time in the territory dictate success in most cases. And we've had a lot of time in a lot of these territories. Mark Marcon : And bookings, just on the A&RR comments, bookings are up materially this Q1 relative to Q1 a year ago correct? Craig Boelte : We haven't given a bookings number from that standpoint. Again I would point you to our guidance and how we work through the first quarter and the strength we had in that. I would also point to previous comments I have made about sales teams, how they mature, how they continue to mature more, as well as having more executive sales reps. And then, what it takes to become an executive sales rep, and how much success you had to have to get to that level. New reps that, and they don't become executive sales reps right away. They have to sell a certain amount. It normally takes 12 to 14 months. And we're seeing some acceleration in that number, as far as the length of time it takes someone to become an executive sales rep. That is one metric that does seem to be increasing in a good way for us, as far as shortening the length of time to majority for an executive sales rep. Mark Marcon : Okay great. Thanks and congratulations. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Byne from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. John Byne : Hello. Thank you. Actually, my first question was related to your last one. But in terms of the sales offices, the product to ramp of 24 months, are you seeing any shortening of the ramp period, as you incorporate best practices? Craig Boelte : As far as new office openings, we aren't seeing any material shortening of that to maturity, because they have to ramp up. They are not going to go in and hire 7 to 9 sales reps right away. You are going to start off with a couple, and you will have a couple more, and a couple more. And, again, you are building a pipeline and a reputation within a new market, typically, for us. Whether it's a new territory in an existing city or not, you are building that. So over time you build that. And so, I can't say we have seen cities where office openings mature at a rate faster than what they have done in the past, which is 24 months. John Byne : Okay, that's very helpful and then looking at your Q1 numbers and the Q2 guidance, if you look at the difference, would most of the different sequentially be related to the forms business from ACA W-2s, and so on, or would there be any other reason for the seasonal difference? Craig Boelte : The seasonal difference is the ACA forms filing, to the extent it is seasonal. Not all of the uptick we had in the first quarter I would call seasonal. We had client adds as well that impact that, especially as they come in at the beginning of a quarter. So I would say those contributed also. From a seasonality perspective, we're going to have the same type of seasonality on an ongoing basis every first quarter. John Byne : Okay great. And just for housekeeping, is there a new tax rate guidance that you have for the year? What should we expect? Craig Boelte : In terms of the tax rate we had the first quarter, we would expect the full year to be a similar rate in that 35% rate. We factored in the R&D and the 199 deduction, based on an annual basis. So unless something changes, and it can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but that should be in the range. John Byne : Okay thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan McDonald from Wunderlich Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Ryan McDonald : Thanks. Congratulations on the quarter once again. Just wanted to start, again, on the sales ramp strategy. Can you talk about cities where you have now added a second sales team in those cities? Are you seeing any change or different dynamics to that second sales team ramping? Is it something that is maybe taking a bit longer, since you are already established with it certain client base within there, or has it been a fairly smooth transition with the first sales team? Craig Boelte : No. You are really not. I would go back again to the manager. The territories are substantially the same, as in more than we can call on because of the number - the percentage of the overall TAM that we represent. And also the cadence at which we bring reps on in a new office opening has remained the same. So we need to secure success. We need to make sure that city is not only mature, but solid after maturity. And there's a very specific way we go about growing that. That's been maintained regardless of geography that we have opened up. Ryan McDonald : Okay. And then just shifting to some of the deals you mentioned, a few large deals in the quarter. Can you talk about what kind of shift you are seeing in terms of - or what kind of growth you are seeing as you are closing deals North of the 2000 employee range? I know you mentioned that the target market there is 50 to 2000. But obviously it sounds like there's a few large deals you called out in the quarter. Is that still high single digits, low double digits, or are you even seeing more than that on a quarterly basis in terms of deal sizes? Craig Boelte : It depends on the quarter. I think typically again we have been selling at the upper end of our range now for a while, as far as reps have had success and clients have had success with the product. So we've sold at the upper end of our range for a while. I wouldn't necessarily say we have gone dramatically over our range. We do have some outliers and I have given you some information on some of those on the call. But we're still staying very consistent with what our target market is. Ryan McDonald : Okay and then just one final question for me. You talked about the introduction of the overtime expansion tool and that being a key differentiator for Paycom. Can you talk about what type of early success you are seeing with that tool? And from a compliance burden standpoint, do you see it is having a similar, if not greater, impact to Paycom's business as ACA has over the past year? Craig Boelte : I can answer that question from what I see here right now. It's a no. ACA has very specific filing requirements. The overtime laws are more of a labor piece to it. But they will have fines. And so, it will be important for people to do it correctly. But I'm unaware of a forms filing piece to it. So from that standpoint I would say it's a little bit different. Here is how I think we differentiate ourselves, and it's the same way with ACA. You get ahead of it by educating clients on what it is, whether or not they even want to comply, or how they are going to comply in the case sometimes with ACA, to pay or play. And then from this perspective it's basically a new change where employees that make less than $50,440 and my understanding it's going to go lower to $47,000, but we don't have all the detail on that yet. But you're going to have to pay overtime for salaried employees that make less than that amount, and that's going to impact client\u2019s labor. In some cases they may choose to make someone salary a little bit larger to match that, and another cases they might choose to pay the overtime. Either way it will require that you have both payroll history, as well as time and attendance data, so that someone can go through and work those analytics to make the decision of how it's going to impact their business from a labor piece. And foremost companies labor is their largest expense. So being able to manage that early and make those decisions early versus a quarter later, once it's actually already impacted your labor, is something we want to get ahead of. Nothing has been rolled out specifically at exactly what the numbers is going to be, but we do think it's going to be changed. This isn't a new threshold or a new law. The current threshold is $23,660. It's just a massive change in the threshold, which is going to impact many companies out there. Especially in the mid market. Ryan McDonald : Excellent thanks for the clarity congratulations again. Craig Boelte : All right. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen with that we will conclude today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : I would like to thank everybody for joining us on the call. We appreciate your time and interest in Paycom. We will be presenting at the Jefferies Technology Conference in Miami on May 11, and also on the JPMorgan TNT conference in Boston on May 24. We hope to potentially see all you either there or on the road in the coming months, and thanks to everybody or being on the call. Have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your telephone lines.",

Baird Jim MacDonald - First Analysis John Byun - UBS Ryan MacDonald - Wunderlich Securities Operator : Hello. My name is Dan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Paycom Software Inc. Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Craig Boelte, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Craig Boelte : Thank you and good afternoon. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts including those regarding our future plans, objectives and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call.

These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. You should refer to and consider these factors when we rely on such forward-looking information. Any forward-looking statements speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by applicable law. Also during the course of today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today which is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks Craig. Our momentum continued through the second quarter of 2016. We had excellent results with revenue of $74 million representing growth of 51% over the comparable prior year period. We are pleased with our performance and believe ourselves success is due to the growing recognition of the benefits that can be gained from Paycom's single database architecture. Our organically built and internally trained sales force is focused solely on the U.S. market which we believe holds ample opportunity to fuel our growth for many years to come. In fact we believe that we are still in the early stages of a multiyear mission to gain market share and grow into one of the largest providers of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software. To further illustrate what drives our confidence, I would like to share some insight into some of the ways that Paycom solution helps clients to improve their workforce processes and succeed. When client select Paycom they are not just buying the product, they are also improving their processes and unlocking ways to engage their workforce by aligning with the strategic and knowledgeable business partner. At Paycom we developed our payroll and HCM software to work seamlessly with each other leveraging the true power of our single database system to enable executives to run their businesses more efficiently. When we engage with a new client the Paycom system represents an opportunity for them to not only enhance their existing processes but also institute new processes to enable the C-Suite to better manage their workforce. Since it is frequently the first time they have had all of their HCM data available in a single place. So in addition to implementing the Paycom system for new clients, we are often helping them to put best practices in place that are enabled by our system. These improved practices drive even greater efficiencies and also increase client engagement with the Paycom solution across the entire organization from front-line employees to the C-suite. Finally, leveraging both our talented development teams and also our internal analytics, we gain insight into client usage across the entire system application-by-application, employee-by-employee. Using this data we identify best practices for each aspect of the Paycom solution and bring those findings to our clients. We are now using our internally developed learning management system to teach our clients and their employees how to best use the Paycom system .Our clients have enjoyed this new radiant -- media rich learning platform known as Paycom University and this is been a great introduction to the power of our LMS offering. The constant improvements to our system in helping clients to optimize how they can use it for having a positive impact on sales, we are seeing productivity improvements across the entire sales organization. These improvements are evident in our results and guidance. Turning to the market I will now provide some comments regarding the upcoming changes to the FLSA overtime regulations. As many of you know in December the rules regarding overtime pay will change dramatically. The annual salary threshold for employees overtime exemption will increase from approximately 24,000 to over 47,000 per year. Similar to the ACA this will have a broad and significant impact on many American businesses. From our perspective ACA compliance initiatives were effectively tasked to the HR departments particularly within the mid-market where most employers were already providing appropriate health insurance to their employees. In contrast the proposed changes to the overtime law will demand attention from the C-suite as business leaders looked to accurately measure and potentially adjust their employee compensation strategies to ensure compliance with the law in the most efficient manner. We believe the FLSA potentially will have significantly greater financial impact to clients in the midmarket than the ACA. As with the lead up to the ACA compliance deadline, we are seeing a wide range of knowledge and preparedness among current and prospective clients. Many companies have not yet acknowledged let alone embraced the impending changes. This is where Paycom serves as a knowledge resource to future and existing clients. We provide a substantial amount of information in the form of white papers, webinars and of course they are highly trained sales force. The proposed FLSA changes are providing useful conversation starters for our sales reps as we believe that the Paycom solution offers the best option for employers to adapt to the potential upcoming changes in the most strategic and efficient way. And with that I'm pleased to highlight our recent announcement of the FLSA toolkit which is part of our government compliance application. This FLSA analytics tool is simple yet powerful and uses employee data to perform the cost analysis of workforce restructuring strategy and can help executives to determine the best course of action when looking to navigate the changes to the FLSA law. This tool is yet another example of the ability of our R&D organization to comprehensively develop products that serve the needs of our clients. We continue to invest in our R&D in the second quarter growing our adjusted R&D expense 114% year-over-year. As with prior earnings calls I will now provide a few examples of notable client wins within the quarter. I will remind everyone that our target client range remains companies with 50 to 2,000 employees. However larger clients above this range continue to see increased efficiencies and value by implementing the Paycom system as they look to abandon silo technology that no longer meets their needs. First, we on boarded an assisted living company with multiple locations and over 3,000 employees. They had been using a competing vendor for payroll and relied on several other HCM vendors while also performing manual processes for many key functions. After transitioning from a large number of providers this client really values having a single completely integrated system additionally a greatly appreciated our on-site implementation and training which was tailored to the client's needs and schedule. Next we converted a restaurant chain with over 40 locations and nearly 4,000 employees that also had been using a competing vendor. In addition to the benefits gained from a completely integrated system this client was attracted to Paycom because of our learning management system. The prior elements provider was not fully integrated with the payroll system and because of this they were not achieving the results they needed. Of course this client is also enjoying the benefits now of having all of their HCM functions in one application including talent acquisition, onboarding, background checks and many others. Lastly, we welcomed an entertainment company with over 5,500 employees across several states. They had been using an in-house system prior to Paycom and we're searching for a solution that would be robust yet easy-to-use across their entire employee base. They also wanted to standardize hiring practices and communicate better with their workforce. With Paycom they were able to accomplish these objectives through a combination of surveys and personal action forms. Finally, with several locations in different states they experienced challenges in the past organizing their data and maintaining compliance with multiple tax jurisdictions. With Paycom their tax compliant processes are now automated. To close I would like to highlight that we were recognized as one of the achievers 50 most engaged workplaces for 2016.This accolade is a testament to our culture and also the use of our own technology. Having an engaged workforce helps us attract and retain top talent which allows us to effectively compete in the marketplace. And finally as many of you know earlier this year Welsh, Carson and its affiliated entities distributed their remaining Paycom shares to their limited partners and general partners. After yesterday's board meeting Rob Minicucci and Sanjay Swani step down from our board. Both were formally nominees of Welsh, Carson who served on our board for several years and we would like to thank them for their service. With that I will now turn the call over to Craig for an update on our financials and our guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I begin I am pleased to announce that our Founder and CEO Chad Richison has been elected as Chairman of our Board and will succeed Rob Minicucci. And before I review our second quarter results and also our outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2016, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations. Non-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measures that also reflects adjustments for non-cash stock-based compensation expense and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations which are further adjusted for the effect of income taxes. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures discussed today is included in our press. We experienced a strong second quarter with total revenues of $73.9 million representing year-over-year growth of 51% from the comparable prior year period. As Chad mentioned we experienced ongoing success of our sales teams as our solutions continue to gain traction in the marketplace. Within total revenues recurring revenue was $72.5 million for the second quarter of 2016 representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 52% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter were $62.3 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.3%. This compares to 83.6% in the second quarter of 2015. For the full 2016 we anticipate adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 82% to 84%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $43 million for the quarter. This amount compares to $30.1 million in the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2016 was $24 million. Adjusted R&D expense of $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2016 represented an increase of 114% from the comparable prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $22.6 million or 30.6% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $13.1 million or 26.8% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2015. We experienced a strong increase in adjusted EBITDA due impart to sales out performance and also increased cost efficiencies across our organization. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $12.4 million or $0.21 per diluted share based on approximately 58.7 million shares versus $6 million or $0.10 per diluted share based on approximately 58.4 million shares a year ago. The effective tax rate was 35% for the three months ended June 30, 2016. We expect the fully diluted share count in the third quarter to increase by approximately 725,000 shares less the numbers of shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations due to the vesting of restricted stock with market based vesting conditions and also less any share we may repurchase pursuant to our previously announced repurchase program. Turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents $80.9 million and debt of $29.3 million. As a reminder this debt represents the financing of our corporate headquarters. We were proud to recently complete the third building at our campus which help accommodate our growth. We recently entered into a new loan agreement in connection with construction of a fourth building and are excited to commence the early phases of design and development. Cash from operations was $24.6 million for the second quarter reflecting our strong revenue performance and profitability of our business model. The year-to-date average daily flow balance for funds held for clients was approximately $660 million. With that let me turn to guidance for the third quarter and for fiscal 2016. For the third quarter of 2016 we expect total revenues in the range of $75 million to $77 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 37% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $13 million to $15 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 18% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2016 we\u2019re increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $325 million to $327 million or approximately 45% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We\u2019re also increasing our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2016 to a range of $83 million to $85 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 26% at the midpoint of the range. With that we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. A couple of questions if I may. Chad I know you don\u2019t give ANRR numbers anymore and you will not answer me on this one but if you could talk qualitatively about like how was business activity in the quarter, obviously the numbers look really good but we are looking at revenue which is kind of more backwards looking. How does the quarter feel for you in terms of when compared to kind of what you saw previously Chad Richison : Well I kind of thought you answered the question in the first part of your question but so I mean obviously like you said it\u2019s not a metric that we talk about anymore. Obviously we have had continued experience strong growth as it relates to onboarding of new clients. We\u2019re very focused on that and we look to continue to do that into the future. Raimo Lenschow : Okay perfect. It was worth trying. And if you look about the FLSA Act like how do we have to think about it in terms of all these different we had the ACA now we have this one. For us in terms of modeling purposes how do we, I mean is this kind of an ongoing every year thing that kind of new stuff will be coming out and in terms of magnitude how should we think about this. Chad Richison : Yes, and so the FLSA is actually going to update for the first time in 12 years beginning December 1 of this year and it\u2019s going to go from a $455 per week threshold to $913 per week threshold which means employees that are paid salary that make less than $913 a week which is roughly $47,000 a year will be subject to over time. In that you can only account for 10% of bonus and commissions basically nondiscretionary income, you can only account for 10% of it and so if you have a person that is making $40,000 in salary and they are making another $30,000 in commission and bonus they are actually subject to the overtime rules and so you would actually have to start tacking hours on that individual and paying them over time even though their gross amount is much more than the $47,000 but it\u2019s how you are paying it. So our tool allows them to go through the analytics of both those people who are salaried employees close to the range that may not have enough over time where they keep them at that range to again efficient in their payment, as well as identify those employees who are going to make above $47,000 when you include the 10% bonus and commission and potentially these employers would chose as I believe we would to make that, to restructure that employee's commission and bonus compensation and actually put more into salary so that they do not have to pay them over time and therefore track hours. Now as far as the change beginning in 2020 they actually because this was the first time they had made the change in 12 years, in 2020 they\u2019re actually going to start increasing it every three years keeping in line with the economy. And so we don\u2019t - this isn\u2019t going to go away. It\u2019s going to kick off on December 1 and like everything else people are going to have to continuously manage it and I believe it\u2019s going to have a great impact on companies that do not manage it successfully. Raimo Lenschow : But you it\u2019s basically just another add on model basically, a module like you have, like obviously 2020 or more? Chad Richison : Correct. This actually, this toolkit it actually now embedded in our government and compliance module which we already have and so we do intend on providing clients with this module. We also are using it for discussion purposes because clients just now both clients as well as new prospects are just now deciding what exactly are they going to do, who are they move where and what is the impact. So they can actually run if then scenarios. If I change their salary to this and their bonus is this what\u2019s the count for me and what does that mean in my business. And also this has been reconciled every quarter by the employer and any under payment has to be remitted at that time to each employee. This is a DoL, Department of Labor type thing and so unlike ACA compliance where you are filing returns directly with the IRS at the end of the year, this is something where employees if they were underpaid not unlike if they were underpaid right now through not having the correct minimum wage or what have, they would file a claim with the Department of Labor. And so that\u2019s really how this is managed at this time. I have heard that somehow that DoL and IRS could be working together in certain areas on this but I haven\u2019t seen any regs come out on that yet. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at today. Like anything every year it\u2019s more and more regulation, more and more changes and more and more the businesses have to deal with and that\u2019s something we do. We\u2019re good at making it easier for them to handle what's often times forced on them. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. That\u2019s very helpful. Well done. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Michael Nemeroff : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and a nice quarter. Just looking at the EBITDA guide for the rest of the year and looking where it started, I\u2019m just in terms of really impressive and I'm curious for Craig what has changed on the expense side, where you\u2019re getting so much leverage? And then as it relates to new office openings Chad given that you're seeing so much success on the profitability side, could you maybe give us a glimpse into how you\u2019re thinking about the number of new office openings in 2017 and whether we could see a sharp increase from where we've been for the last couple of years? Craig Boelte : Okay. Michael with respect to the adjusted EBITDA and then the guidance for the rest of year, for the first half of the year obviously the forms filings was very strong at the beginning of the year. And so that had a - that additional revenue flows through to the adjusted EBITDA. And the costs associated with that aren\u2019t all that significant. And then as we look through the second quarter you kind of look up and down there the lines of the income statement and we saw some margin expansion go up and down. And we had some in the gross margin as well as G&A and sales and marketing. So as we continue to outperform on the revenue line a lot that is falling through to the bottom line. Chad Richison : And as far as the office openings we have opened the most offices that we've ever opened this year and that combined with last year I believe puts us at about 10 or 11 that have actually been opened in the last - yes, 11 opened in the last 19 months. And so we're still absorbing all of those openings and all those moves and at the appropriate time where it makes sense for us to expand even further we\u2019re going to look to do that. Michael Nemeroff : Is there any limitation on increasing the number of office openings, do you have enough experienced managers that you could open more offices if you choose to? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, I'm not going to really guide to exactly what we\u2019re going to do next year at this time. What I can tell you is that for sure the longer someone is in a territory with us the more experienced they gain and they\u2019re more qualified that they have. And just a little of numbers over time the more offices you have with the more maturity amongst each office, the more candidates you're going to have as well. But for right now, we're very focused on continuing to absorb what we've done and really experience the benefits that we are experiencing from those offices that have been opened longer than 24 months. Michael Nemeroff : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. John DiFucci : Thank you. Chad and Craig the results are impressive but revenue as you know given the SaaS models as far as backward looking, the cash flow is really strong so that that's good it sort of helps us look forward a little bit. But Chad could you give us any color at all even subjective on the momentum of the business in this quarter relative to the last couple of quarters? Chad Richison : I think the revenue in the guidance speak for itself. I know that as far as closest for us I mean, we\u2019ve continued to have a very strong closes on our deals and that is as far as onboarding clients. We continue to be pulled up to the top end of the range, I mean, each quarter seems like now I have highlighted those companies that are actually exist above our range. And that I mean our executive reps we continue to have more executive reps mature as many of you know it takes about 14 months, once a rep starts with us for us to them to achieve executive rep status. And that group represents the overwhelming majority of everything we sell. And so we continue to have more executive reps added each month as we continue on and we just continue to get stronger and stronger. John DiFucci : That's helpful. And into that - to that last point maybe if you can talk a little bit about not necessarily the new offices and the new how they open and we know that that's there some time that it takes for them to take hold. But offices that are in transition from new disorder mature and how these offices - and then that the term mature I know isn't necessarily mature and that it's not going to grow anymore. But those with more tenure how they've progressed in regards to their contribution to the results, is it - have things continued similar to what they've done in the past, recently you talked about what you're talking about here where you are getting from other customers, has that trend continued at all or any changes in regards to any of that? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean it\u2019s all increased. I mean the top office we\u2019re going to have this year is going to outsell the top office we had last year. Maybe we had some significant top rep sales last year but already we have people on pace at pace to beat that. And so we continue on. And then as far as the success of moving up market and selling it at the top end of our range and not that we at all want to ignore the lower midmarket because we have had great success there as well. But we do have more product to sell. The product we continue our R&D efforts so it gets better and better. I mean we just talked about our FLSA toolkit that we are now embedding into our government compliance tool to help people be able to navigate the new regulation. And so for us we wake up every day and really try to get better than what we were the day before. I think using our own training modules make it as made it easier for us and we\u2019re going to continue to do the same as we move forward. John DiFucci : Great, thanks Chad. Nice job. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Albert Chi : Hi, Chad and Craig, this is Albert Chi on for Mark Murphy and I\u2019ll add my congrats on the great quarter. So I want to ask kind of it\u2019s a follow-up to Raimo\u2019s question on the \u2013 thanks for providing the details around the FLSA. But just wanted to get a better sense of how we should size the relative impact of the overtime changes versus ACA? And I know you had talked about how ACA related billings as a percent of revenue would be around the low single digits in 2016. Do you have any sense of how that\u2019s going to shake out for the overtime? Chad Richison : Well I think the impact to our clients and prospects as it relates to overtime is really going to be at the expense on their. And most companies the largest impact that they had at with the ACA expense was what they paid either us or one of the competitive vendors or really is about maintaining compliance. Most of the companies in the midmarket were offering affordable healthcare. And so to a large extent the expense associated with ACA was what they were paying their vendor or what they're using themselves to stay compliant and make those ongoing decisions. Not that it's all one to one in that every bit of their expenses what they would pay a vendor but I mean it\u2019s a substantial portion. As it relates to this it really just depends on companies make-up coming, if they have employees that are salaried at $40,000 salary and these employees are working 60 hours a week they\u2019re going to have to convert that $40,000 employee into an hourly employee and they\u2019re going to have to pay them over time, time and an half on those 20 hours each week. And so it's a significant change and so companies who are good at analyzing and predicting both what has happened, what they have currently and what they expect to happen in the future based on what has happened in the past. Those companies who are good at that are going to save themselves a lot of money. Those companies who aren\u2019t or either going to spend a lot or potentially have DOL cases opened up. And so that was really my statement and that this is much more impactful I believe for an organization when you\u2019re talking about pay and salary and, kind of what you have to pay. There's \u2013 there aren\u2019t really many choices for workarounds on it. You just have to really be good and know your dad and that's where having a single database comes in when you have the payroll time and attendance data and other \u2013 and the exact same assistant compensation data, non-description and compensation data and everything in the same system it\u2019s easy to gather. And you have history tables that have this information. And so I believe it\u2019s going to have a significant impact and I still believe we\u2019re at the very early stages of it being something that clients even want to an exercise that they really want to go through. Albert Chi : Got it. That\u2019s interesting. So do you think I guess broadly do you think that these changes could weigh on company\u2019s earnings in any particular way? Chad Richison : I think it depends on the company I don't see how it has -- I don't say on any midsized company how it has zero impact on their expense. I just -- I couldn\u2019t see really a situation and unless they already were paying everybody that had a salary over $47,000.Then potentially that could be the case and when you get into companies that have 600, 700, 800 employees or 400 employees you typically have more diversity then just to add. And so I think it\u2019s going to have an impact on businesses for sure. Albert Chi : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Trevor Upton : Hi, this is Trevor Upton for Brendan. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on the FSLA question. I am assuming that Paycom would benefit through increasing adoption of the government compliance application is that correct? Chad Richison : That is correct. Trevor Upton : And can you guys talk about kind of where the penetration of that currently is. Chad Richison : We don\u2019t talk about adoption rates for our products but I do believe that we do have some bandwidth in government compliance to go out there and be able to push this product and to the client can then leverage it to manage this highly sensitive cost area for them and then I also believe it\u2019s a major conversation starter that we have with prospects. I do believe we were like ACA we were very quick to this and when we developed something we developed a comprehensive system that not only helps them out of the gate but helps them on an ongoing basis. And even there is a lot of the thinking for them as far as being able to predict data points based on prior data points over the same period. And so I think that we\u2019re going to get some bets with this, we\u2019re going to having conversations with this and like everything else we\u2019re going to see it move forward. Trevor Upton : That makes sense. One of the incumbent service providers decided ACA as a change event that\u2019s increased churn for them, it sounds like FLSA should have a similar impact? Chad Richison : I don\u2019t know what necessarily impacts other company\u2019s churn but we do have a very good product. We had a good ACA product and I believe that our FSLA product we have at the gate is a very strong product and like any of our products we\u2019re very committed to make the necessary changes along the way as regulations change. Trevor Upton : Okay, thanks and then lastly can you talk about the impetus for the share buyback and how you weight that versus other uses of cash? Chad Richison : Well I think it\u2019s our goal. We started off with our share buyback last quarter. It is out goal over time to reduce the overall share count. We looked at our cash and what we\u2019re really able to do at this time and we felt like it was an appropriate amount to start that now. Trevor Upton : Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is now open. Brad Reback : Great, thanks very much. Craig just real quickly on the gross margin guide for the year that\u2019s 82% to 84%, it would imply somewhat of a tick up in cogs in the back half. Are there any specific guidance causing that? Craig Boelte : No, as we look at our gross margin guidance we kind of kept it at that 82% and 84% and then if we over achieve it tends to be closer to that 84% in terms of our over achievement on revenue. Now one that we\u2019ve pointed out is we have to hire in front of the revenue growth. So as we look quarter-to-quarter we want to make sure that we have the people in the bench to service that growth and those cline clients that come on board. So that\u2019s kind of it fluctuates potentially from quarter-to-quarter. It\u2019s really on a headcount basis. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Do we still have an operator. Operator : Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Good afternoon thanks for taking may question and congratulations. Just wondering if you could talk just about the sales teams just in terms of like what the latest count is in terms of total and how many you would consider to be mature right now. And then as a follow-up to that if you could describe what sort of activity the mature ones are currently seeing particularly in some of the older market just in terms of pipeline, level of growth prospects going forward. Thank you. Craig Boelte : So we have 42 offices right now, 11 are still in the process of maturing so that leaves us with 31 that are currently mature being that we\u2019re now in August. And I would say that as far as how one looks different than the other, the substantial difference outside of the first maybe six months opening is really going to be the staffing in each office. I mean, a newer office is going to have a couple of sales reps in it maybe two or three and a mature office is going to have in between seven and nine sales reps at full staff. A new office is going have zero executive reps and the mature office - four, five, six or more and so it just makes a difference and that\u2019s why it takes a little bit of time for these to mature. As far as the activity and the expected quota for new reps and everything else those remain the same and so it really what changes is just the progression and maturity stage that they are out of that time. Mark Marcon : Great. And then can you just talk a little bit more about pipeline that you are currently seeing just in terms of new opportunity, there are fees that are out there, the hits that you are getting. What sort of impact is the success that you\u2019ve seen thus far helping with regards to potential client recognition acceptance et cetera? Craig Boelte : It\u2019s always really been strong that we\u2019re really in an industry where people really like tenderness as they continue to engage their workforce. I mean, it hasn\u2019t been that long that there has really been technology that where you could really even engage a workforce. I mean if we think back 15, 20 years ago it wasn\u2019t that often that people were leveraging this type of technology in the cloud to communicate with employees in a meaningful way as well as the rest of their management staff to be able to collaborate on important items that can impact cost, HR and what have you and so we\u2019re continuing to see that. So I\u2019ve never really seen a time where it\u2019s been down. I think that anytime you have a great solution you are going to get your at best out there. I think the longer in the business the more popular you get. The more references you have at different levels the more references you are able to create and so we\u2019re just continuing our momentum as have in the past and I would say it\u2019s been all similar and that it\u2019s been very strong demand there for a long time I think for our entire industry. Mark Marcon : Great and then one last one just any other comments with regards to this client retention rates what you are seeing there? Craig Boelte : I mean, as far as our client retention rates that\u2019s a metric that we actually disclose each year and as all of you know it\u2019s been flat the same for the last four years and it is something we definitely focus on at Paycom how you continue to set a company up, make sure they are good from the get go and then continue to increase usage along the way. You definitely want to have your clients using the technology they are purchasing and so that\u2019s something that we\u2019re very focused on for us from a retention standpoint to always. Mark Marcon : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Your line is now open. Jim MacDonald : Good afternoon guys and Chad congrats on becoming Chairman. Could you tell your thoughts on are you going to replace the two Welsh, Carson directors that resigned? Chad Richison : Yes, it is our expectation that we would be replacing that. We\u2019re in the process right now of conducting those interviews and we\u2019ll be announcing those in the future. Jim MacDonald : Great and as a follow to Mark\u2019s question as you grow so rapidly how do you think about maintaining your service quality and really making sure your clients have a seamless experience? Chad Richison : Well luckily I\u2019ve had years and years of practice. From our standpoint we\u2019ve continued to grow, I think we\u2019ve got a 40% CAGR over the last five years and so you have to continue to do that. Really it\u2019s about the processes you put in place. I\u2019ve said it before that a substantial number of employees anywhere would fail at a company if it weren\u2019t for the processes that they put in place to help them succeed and so we\u2019re very focused on our processes. We\u2019re very focused on updating our processes. We\u2019re very focused on client feedback that revolves around our process because likewise with new technology we also have to make sure you are providing a new type of service. You don\u2019t want to have a 2016 technology and your service model in stuck in 2001 and so you really or you are onboarding a piece and so you have to continue to innovate across the board. It\u2019s not just the software, it\u2019s the process, it\u2019s the setup, it\u2019s R&D it\u2019s everything. You have to continue to innovate across the board and we\u2019ve really gotten a lot of experience in continuing to do that, be good at recruiting. And a lot of that comes from leveraging our own tools internally to be able to make those things happen. Jim MacDonald : And just a quick follow-up to that, do you try to maintain a client contact so that people aren\u2019t seeing new faces all the time? Chad Richison : Well, definitely. You want to give the client the best experience that, that client can have. And I believe that starts off with a great technology. I can remember when I used to do first sales calls myself, I actually sold our first 400 deals here at Paycom where I was teaching people what the Internet was, and kind of plug it in for them. And so even from back then, you go in with your plan and you want to have very good, you want a very good technology solution. And we\u2019ve just continue to innovate that along the way. So it\u2019s something we\u2019ve experienced in the past as far as continuing to grow these departments overtime and I see as just continuing that. Jim MacDonald : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Byun with UBS. Your line is now open. John Byun : Hi, thank you. Just wanted to kind of go back to the FLSA little bit. In terms of the government and compliance module, given that you\u2019ve added more functionality; would you be increasing the price for that? And is there any way to get a sense for how that's price relative to other core modules? Chad Richison : At this time the functionality is within the government compliance tool. We did put in there. So clients of ours that have current government compliance, they have it available for them today, and we are working with them. We do have a large number of clients that aren't set up on government compliance, we're looking at bringing that to them as well as adding it to each prospect that comes in. I mean, this is almost a have to have now for companies to start with us moving forward.  That\u2019s not to say that they absolutely have to buy it from us, but it wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense I wouldn\u2019t think for a product with this type of impact for a client to actually on board our service without it. And so but it\u2019s still optional for them. John Byun : Okay. And then in terms of the potential impact, is there any way to think about the seasonality or timing? I mean, should there be some market increase in the Q4 or would you really more spread out? Chad Richison : I mean, you do have a mandate right now, December 1. So that is something that\u2019s out there, that all companies need to be compliant by then. And then you\u2019re going to have the ongoing aspect of management continuing on. And so I mean, if there is a point where people want to jump on, it\u2019s that, you might have some people jump on after they get their first DoL compliant. It just really depends. John Byun : Okay, that's helpful. One last question. You're getting increasing success of market and just wondering if you are seeing work in ultimate more often as you move up and in what situations do you do notably better than them when you do see them? Chad Richison : Well, we see them more often because we have more reps and more - in more cities. We\u2019re going to see them more often because we have more at-bats and obviously, they\u2019re in that market. But I would say, we\u2019ve been hearing of where day in especially ultimate on a continual basis for a long time, across the board, whether we\u2019re above the 2,000 employees range, or whether we\u2019re in mid-market. So I think that we\u2019ve all kind of existed and we all kind of have our focus, but we all really exist in similar markets as far as and ultimate we do have crossover. And so we\u2019re going to see them quite a bit. I think we\u2019ve been very successful with onboarding and converting businesses from all of our competitors. John Byun : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question and last question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Wunderlich Securities. Your line is now open. Ryan Macdonald : Hi, guys, congrats on the great quarter. Just kind of piggybacking off of the last question there. As we're talking about this new FLSA toolkit, last year you saw, I think in the fourth quarter, you saw kind of an early pull through of revenues or new customers adopting the solution based on ACA. Do you think given the December 1 deadline or cutoff date for the FLSA or the new regulations, is there a potential for that? Or at least what are you seeing in the pipeline as we're going to the third quarter here? How is that reflected, if at all, in guidance for the third quarter? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, I would say this. One, as far as guidance even though deals that would start December 1, you\u2019re going to get that 1/12 of the total annualized value for that on this - for December. So a major impact in the very last month, I don\u2019t know, but as far as on boards, we are trying our best to make sure we have several people. And let people know that December 1 go live date for this. And it\u2019s very important for them to have this information and be able to be utilizing these tools. Whether or not, that means a lot of companies convert very quickly to something. It is a little different than ACA and that standpoint, just because ACA did have the Forms filing piece to it where you\u2019re going to get caught quick. This might be a situation where you might actually make a decision just give everybody the $47,000 salary. So, that you've abided by the rules but then you go back and realize that had you used good analytics and made some of them hourly, because their overtime would've put them over that, you find that - you make the decision save yourself $280,000 just by managing it. And so someone wants to get compliant, they just raise everybody to $47,000 and make everybody hourly. But I believe in the mid-market especially, and definitely upper mid-market people that are lot more strategic than one comes to their cost and so. We\u2019re going to be doing everything we can to educate both clients and prospects alike on what\u2019s coming and how we can make substantial impact on mitigating their exposure, as well as reducing their operating costs. Ryan Macdonald : Okay. And then shifting to hiring trends, when you look at what you're hiring plan was for this year and what you've done thus far and looking to the back half of the year, can you talk about, would you say you are on plan, ahead of plan, maybe a little bit behind in terms of your ideas for what you are going to add in terms of sales headcount. As we look at the back half of the year here, can you talk about what your additional hiring plans are and maybe potential mix between, say, outside sales and client relations? Chad Richison : Sure. We give employee count updates once a year. I can\u2019t tell you just having been here for now 19 years that from a hiring perspective, you\u2019re up, you\u2019re down, you\u2019re up, you\u2019re down, you\u2019re up, you\u2019re down and then you always end up where you need to be. So for us, we continue that throughout the year and really being methodical on when we bring people on, we\u2019re fortunate in a couple of ways in that as we sailed deals they start. We have a pretty quick start dates. And so as we sell deals we start and so we had a little bit of notice but often times we don\u2019t have enough notice in the pipeline necessarily to just run out and hire people and get them trained. And so, often times you have to train those people, which Craig was talking about ahead of, which can inflate sometimes our gross margin. You've to hire and train those people ahead of then being able to catch the business and the revenue follows later. Sometimes when the revenues follows quicker than what you have actually added employees, sometimes you can get upside down a little bit where you need to take staff and get them trained and going quickly. And so it's kind of something in our business, at least, that you\u2019re always managing. But we\u2019re also fortunate and that, the business comes an incremental overtime and stays with us. And so it allows us to be able to do that. Ryan Macdonald : All right, thanks a lot. Congrats again. Operator : And there are no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Paycom's CEO, Chad Richison. Chad Richison : I'd like to thanks, everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s call. We had an excellent second quarter and we\u2019re energized for the second half of the year. I want to remind everybody, we\u2019ll be presenting at the Pacific Crest Technology Conference in Vail on Monday - Tuesday August, 9 and also at the Canaccord Conference in Boston on August 10. Thank you all and we\u2019ll be speaking with you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks Craig.  The third quarter marked yet another success for our organization as we grew revenue, added new clients across the country and further extended our product development. The Paycom solution continues to gain traction in a wide range of industries. Revenue of $77.3 million represented growth of 40% over the comparable prior-year period. Our profitable cash generative business model continues to deliver results with third quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $18.2 million as compared to $10.8 million in the third quarter of 2015. In addition to our business success in the third quarter, we continue to drive value for our stockholders. And financing our repurchase plan on May 26, 2016 we have repurchased over 525,000 shares within the last five months. Our unified single database payroll and human capital management or HCM solution is designed to help companies and their employees realize their full potential. With our solution, companies can become more efficient and strategic allowing them to spin their valuable time focusing on the business rather than navigating the ever-changing tax code and HR regulations. Within our target market segment of core midmarket and upper midmarket, we believe that our value proposition is increasing. Companies in this segment typically choose not to deploy the resources necessary to manage and continually integrate multiple vendors and products to meet all of their HCM needs. At the same time they're becoming increasingly aware that it is vital to use technology to attract, train, retain and manage their employees in order to remain competitive. We believe that adoption of our solution will continue to be driven by the trend of growing technology sophistication among the C-Suite and HR Executives and also the increasing complexity of tax codes in HR regulation. At Paycom we are experts in navigating this complexity and this capability is core to our value proposition. What makes our solution even more attractive is the accurate and reliable data that the Paycom solution delivers as a result of our foresight to build our solution on the foundation of a single database. Our single database foundation not only provides precise actionable data but also allows us to comprehensively enhance our offering with those features we believe will best help our clients. A great example of our ability to develop and deploy crucial functionality that can have an immediate and significant impact is our Fair Labor Standards Act or FLSA toolkit. In August we introduced the FLSA toolkit as a preemptive response to the new Department of Labor rules regarding overtime pay that will go into effect on December 1. We believe that this change will have a broad impact on the many companies as it provides certain employees whose annual salaries are less than $47,476 are eligible for overtime pay. We believe that our FLSA toolkit is the best option for company seeking to minimize both the impact of increased compensation cost and the cultural challenges that may arise in the workforce and the compensation gap between entry-level and senior employees becomes compressed as a result of the new rule. The rule will potentially have a much broader financial impact to companies than the Affordable Care Act or ACA. The ACA call for employers to prove they were offering affordable healthcare coverage to their employees. For most companies in our target segment, the impact of ACA was primarily a data management compliance and reporting issue since companies with 100 employees or greater were typically already offering affordable healthcare to their workforce. The new FLSA role in contrast will likely change core compensation structures for many companies. While it will probably impact almost every company to some degree, for certain industries it may have a dramatic impact on the bottom line. For example, companies with salaried managers who work long hours and make a salary below the $47,000 threshold or companies that have workers who received a significant portion of their compensation in a form of bonuses and commissions could be substantially impacted. In our view this rule change will require CFOs and CEOs to take a very strategic approach to minimizing cost while achieving compliance. I will emphasize that we do not anticipate a large impact to our revenue from our FLSA toolkit since it is included within our government and compliance module. However, we do see the new FLSA rule as an extremely effective conversation starter for our sales representatives seeking to engage with prospective clients. Our by monthly webinars on this topic are the most popular webinars we've had to-date indicating that awareness of this potential issue among the executive is likely trending at least as strong as it was for the ACA. I'd like to note that an important part of our development process is derived from feedback from our sales and service organizations. We have strong and open lines of communication between our sales service and development groups. This creates a positive feedback loop whereby our R&D organization receives direct feedback from our sales team regarding real-time customer needs and then is able to develop features and products based on this information. This in turn - are our sales force to go to market with the best solution that can drive customer success. Our FLSA toolkit is a great example of this. This entertain communication is just one example of the cohesive and energetic culture at Paycom where team members are passionate about doing their jobs well and helping our clients succeed. I believe that our unique culture at Paycom is our most important attribute and that is the foundation has allowed us to grow into one of the largest payroll and HCM providers in the United States. With that I would like to provide some highlights of clients we brought into the Paycom family in the third quarter. First we signed a staffing company with over 2,000 employees. When we first engaged with the company they had been processing their payroll and HCM functions with an antiquated in-house system. This client initially chose one of our largest competitors based on price but in the middle of implementation which the Paycom due to our strong service model and robust functionality. Next we welcomed the media production company with nearly 5000 employees. This company had been using a competing vendor for payroll, as well as separate systems for time and attendance and HR management. Lack of integration among the separate products led to poor analytics. They wanted to partner with a company that allowed them to avoid integration issues and gain actionable intelligence in order to meet the compliance needs of multiple jurisdictions and a diverse employee base. In addition to much of our core product, they are also using our pre-hire background checks on boarding and tax credit application. Finally we welcomed the nonprofit organization with 2500 employees. They were previously using a large competitor in selected Paycom due to our robust and easy to use reporting features, as well as our ability to categorize workers at a granular level down to a specific project or grand. Additionally our GL Concierge tool has proven to be very helpful to this point. Their controllers using this tool that easily allocate funds where needed all before processing payroll. This ability has increased reporting accuracy and helps put this client in a position well suited to pursue opportunities to raise additional funds in the future. To conclude we had a very productive quarter and are optimistic for a strong close to the year. I will now turn the call back over to Craig for an update on our financials and our guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks Chad. Before I review our third quarter results and also our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purpose. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations. Non-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that also reflects adjustments for non-cash stock-based compensation expense and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations which are further adjusted for the effect of income taxes. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures discussed today is included in our press release. We experienced a strong third quarter with total revenues of $77.3 million representing year-over-year growth of 40% from the comparable prior-year period. As a reminder during the third quarter of 2016 we anniversaried the initial ACA related revenues that we experienced in the third quarter of 2015. Within total revenues recurring revenue was $75.9 million for the third quarter of 2016 representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 40% from the comparable prior-year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $63.9 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 83%. For the full fiscal year 2016, we anticipate adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 83% to 84%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $49.1 million for the quarter as compared to $38.3 million in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $27.6 million. Adjusted R&D expense was $5.7 million in the third quarter of 2016 representing growth of over 158% over the comparable prior-year period. As part of our initiative to maintain our world class solution, we have continued to invest in R&D. As a reminder, a portion of our R&D expense is capitalized. Our total adjusted R&D costs for the third quarter of 2016 including the capitalized portion was $7.6 million or 9.8% of total revenue. Total adjusted R&D costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 including the capitalized portion were $18.8 million or 7.8% of total revenues. As everyone may note this is a significant increase from past years. Adjusted EBITDA was $18.2 million or 23.5% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $10.8 million 19.5% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2015. Our strong adjusted EBITDA performance was driven in part by sales outperformance and also achievement of the cost efficiencies across our organization. Additionally we are pleased to announce that we are updating our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target to 30% to 33% and we are able to target this level while still enjoying robust growth and also making substantial investments in R&D underscores the strength of our business model. Our GAAP net income for the third quarter was $6.2 million. During the third quarter of 2016 we adopted accounting standard update 2016-09 or ASU 2016-09 which simplify the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. We recognized a discrete benefit to income tax expense of $6.8 million for excess tax benefits due to the vesting of certain share-based payment awards for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. As a result our effective income tax rate decreased to 20.87% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $9 million or $0.15 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares versus $4.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share based on approximately 58.4 million shares a year ago. ASU 2016-09 had no impact on non-GAAP net income or non-GAAP earnings per share. As Chad mentioned we remain focused on returning value to our stockholders. We repurchased 402,626 shares during the third quarter under our $50 million stock repurchase plan. As of today we have repurchased 525,040 shares under our stock repurchase plan. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 74.5 million and debt of $30.1 million. As a reminder this debt represents the financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. Construction of our fourth building is commenced and is proceeding well. Cash from operations was $19.9 million for the third quarter reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. With that let me turn to guidance for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016 we expect total revenues in the range of $85 million to $87 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior period of approximately 32% at the midpoint of the range. As a reminder we will be anniversarying our ACA related revenues that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as the Pull Forward of starts that we mentioned in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to declines that began early in order to gain ACA compliance that normally would have started in the first quarter of 2016. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $14 million to $16 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 17% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2016 we are increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $326.5 million to $328.5 million while approximately 46% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We are also increasing our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2016 to a range of $88 million to $90 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is open. John DiFucci : Thank you. Craig you said that the third quarter anniversary, the benefit of the ACA - the ACA benefit from last year. But you never really quantified that last year. I mean - I think you and Chad had talked about some very minor revenue contribution. But we know the third quarter was really strong last year. Was there any - have you ever quantified any pull-forward vis-\u00e0-vis like you did for the fourth quarter - for the third quarter of last year. Is there some way we can start to think about that? I guess that\u2019s the question. Chad Richison : Yes John, this is Chad. Third quarter of last year was actually the very first quarter that we started began bailing for ACA. We did call out a number in the third quarter of last year of how much that represented - not necessarily new business that we brought on due to ACA as far as bringing the client on in its entirety. But as far as current clients that had adopted ACA, as well as new onboarded clients that had the ACA module. I forget the exact number but I want to say it was around $800,000 maybe for third quarter, that's well down, fourth quarter obviously was a lot stronger and we did apply a percentage to that which I would have to check with to give you that exact number. John DiFucci : Okay. And did you see - do you think you saw any Pull Forward in the third quarter of last year. I'm just trying to look at year-over-year comps and listen looks good but it doesn't - it's not the kind of I guess the kind of beat that I think the people have come to expect from you. Chad Richison : I mean we\u2019ve had - we obviously last year we had some \u2013 what I\u2019m going to say are positive surprises. I mean anytime you're bringing a half to half product which I believe ACA was our enhanced version. Anytime you bring a half to half product to market especially to a current client base, there is not a long backlog on that, I mean you're able to sell the clients and set them up and began bailing within two or three days versus the pipeline and backlog you get from selling new business. So we didn't have a lot of insight into exactly how much of that business we would be onboarding and what exactly the uptake would be and how immediate it would make an impact. And so the first thing I would say about that revenue over achievement about maybe what have been our guide last year, so we've some positive surprises that began bailing immediately. The second I would say is so much of our new business onboarding it does depend on when a client starts within the quarter something that we've explained before the client starts at the beginning of the quarter, we\u2019re going to receive 100% of total revenue opportunity for that client and if that client starts in the last month or last two weeks of a month in which obviously we've received a proportionately smaller portion. John DiFucci : I'm sorry Chad so you think in this particular quarter was it more backend loaded as far as when you started? Chad Richison : I saw this quarter as a great quarter obviously we're tracking new business sales week-to-week here and I really didn't see anything that would cause me to want to go in and look to see exactly when a deal started when, I\u2019m just more explaining that from the standpoint of guidance over achievement. We had a lot of positive surprises, I mean 98% of our revenues recurring so we do have pretty get insight into subsequent quarters. Often times the outperformance especially some of that that we achieved last year in the fourth quarters where we had just began to initially build for ACA. Those were positive surprises and they were positive to the extent that not only they were sold but they began bailing immediately. John DiFucci : Okay. And I'll just - I guess - I can help but try - I know you don't give that anymore but did it grow this quarter or it could decline given how strong the compared with last year? Chad Richison : It's not something that we measured. I mean we kind of shot that and buried it. But it is something that we definitely - we track book sales every week, we've sales organization of weekly quote, as weekly achievement and we've continued to drive that. John DiFucci : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Again Mr. Lenschow, your line is open. The next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Albert Chi : Hi, congrats on the quarter. Chad and Craig it's actually Albert Chi on for Mark. Just wanted to ask, we're over at HR Tech earlier this month and the topic of legislation came up and ACA and FLSA have been well covered but do you see any other drivers on the horizon. And I know some of your peers recent within the ecosystem have been talking that maybe the equal employment compliance could be a driver next year, is that something that you're seeing on your end? Chad Richison : Every year we do continue to see different legislation - legislative changes. It often times people focus on at the federal level and we do have a lot of those at the federal level but it is well as once people start rolling or once the Fed starts rolling new minimum out, you'll often times see states adopt different rates than what that Fed adopt. So I wouldn't be surprised if certain states increase the FLSA salary limit, as we've seen certain states increase the minimum wage, the federal minimum wage as parts for their state. So I think we'll see some of that. A year has never gone by that we haven't seen an incredible amount of legislation which would include not only the payroll tax calculation but also our labor law pieces which are included in your comment there. Albert Chi : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And actually just a quick one on R&D which looks like it came up pretty nicely in the quarter. Are you able to talk or give us a little bit more insight into where those dollars are currently being spent and where you see them going maybe in the future. I know some themes that come up with newer, smaller module tend to be around predictive analytics and maybe addressing the millennial workforce, is that something that's on the roadmap? Thanks. Craig Boelte : Well just kind of sticking with what we've done in the past, I definitely don't like to telegraph the things that we're working on primarily because we want sales reps out there talking about the products that we have today. We did point out that we did increase R&D this quarter quite a bit, 150% plus over the same prior year period. We've kind of be in low man on R&D spending even though we've had significant output but we want to continue to drive output. We have very lofty initiatives for our R&D Group, as well as outside of just innovation that we also have a lot of compliance that we definitely have to keep up with and we want to stay ahead of that. One specific is FLSA I think that companies that do are very good at working through with the FLSA toolkit are going to save them some money. Someone I think FLSA is easy to comply with is going to overpay their employees and so by managing that ongoing with the toolkit that's important, that's one of the items. And once you put out a product it is important to note, anytime we put out a product that's the beginning and you're going to continue based on user experience and feedback, you're going to continue to update those products and make them even stronger as well as expand. So I guess if I put it in three buckets up for you it would be at the continual ongoing compliance in both labor and tax. You\u2019re going to have innovation of creating new products and then also you're going to have solidifying and going even deeper into the product sets that we have today and the R&D expense is all used towards that. Albert Chi : Great. Thanks a lot. Congrats again. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Nemeroff : Hi guys, nice quarter, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple ones, Chad can you just maybe comment on the sales office productivity this quarter was it in line with your expectations, and how were the newer offices ramping in terms of productivity? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean definitely - the mature offices were definitely in line, I mean the new offices as we\u2019ve talked in the past, they do continue to ramp. We've been a very consistent in how we announce new office openings and how we actually open them and we\u2019re still very confident. We can get to 120 sales teams as we discussed across the U.S. The earliest we've ever opened up an office is February, and the latest is October. And right now our new business sales performance capacity with the current offices we\u2019ve opened is greater than $260 million. So by new business performance capacity what I mean is the amount of new business of our - that our total sales teams could sell today if they were achieving top performance level. Now this doesn\u2019t include any sales to current clients as far as up sells to current clients and it also excludes inside sales of small deals. I'm only talking about our outside sales force, which does represent the overwhelming majority of all of our sales. Now how we calculate the sales performance capacity. And how we calculated the $260 million is by reconciling our top performing office with the average sales performance of our top reps they went to President\u2019s Club and then we multiply that by the number of territories that a team has. And so to that end we believe a top performing office can sell roughly $6.5 million in new business at performance capacity. So we\u2019re working very hard on bridging the gap there and that is capturing the unachieved new business sales that exist in the space between actual sales achievement and a new business sales performance capacity. And so I guess the answer to your question is, yes. Our mature offices are doing well. We do believe that they could be doing better because we would like everyone to get to the top level. And we\u2019ve still got new reps and new teams that we\u2019re continuing to build up and improve that skill and we\u2019re going to also increase capacity three ways, one is by product development, the others by sales skills and then of course opening new offices. Michael Nemeroff : That\u2019s helpful, Chad and that\u2019s a perfect segue into my next question about the plan for new offices. What do you expect to end the year with and maybe if you can give us a little preview of how many do you plan to accelerate the number of office openings in 2017? Chad Richison : Well, I mean just as we\u2019ve done in the past, I mean when we want to make sure that we don\u2019t have sales people thinking they\u2019re relocating or managers thinking they\u2019re relocating until the time of relocation. So we\u2019ve never announced offices before we have signed leases and managers and reps ready to move to those locations. But what I will say is that anybody that would take my prior comments that lead them to believe that we\u2019re not opening up offices next year, they would be wrong. We will be opening up offices next year. But I also wanted to point out, we have a significant amount of new business sales performance capacity right now that exists within our current group and we look forward to capturing that as well. Michael Nemeroff : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great, thanks guys. Just a really quick question from the balance sheet, client funds held seem to decrease sequentially, almost about $400 million or so? Any seasonal issues there or what caused that? Craig Boelte : Typically on client funds, at the end of a quarter depending on what day that quarter ends, it could be that we\u2019re holding a significant amount or at the end of the quarter is on a date that we\u2019re not holding quite as much because typically those funds have to be remitted as early as a couple of days and as late as a couple of months. So you can have some seasonality just looking at the balance sheet. One thing we didn\u2019t put in the prepared remarks, but we had around $660 million average daily balance on those funds sales. So we\u2019re still holding a significant amount of client funds and we obviously look forward today where maybe we\u2019re getting a little bit more on the interest side on those. Brad Reback : Perfect. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Thanks for taking my call. I\u2019m wondering when you think about the sales performance across the various regions were there any areas that really stood out that you could denote? Chad Richison : No, I would not say that. I think you have your usual suspects and then you continue to have new offices that are maturing. I would say often times the measurement of how an offices is going to do is really dependent upon the person that\u2019s leading that office or the manager, not necessarily the geography. I think I pointed out last year our top reps sell $1.7 million and she was here in the Oklahoma City. We had two other reps sell $1.6 million. And again when I am talking about new business sales performance capacity we\u2019re choosing numbers below that because if you take 1.7 or 1.6 multiplied by eight you\u2019re going to get up to $13 million and that\u2019s not what we believe our current sales performance capacities is at. Mark Marcon : Great and then Chad, you\u2019ve always talked about you\u2019re not to open up sales offices until people are ready. How would you judge the ability to open up additional sales offices and perhaps it\u2019s helpful also to discuss like, okay, well you open up more offices having it impact more than just the office that\u2019s opening, you\u2019re also impacting the old office as well? Chad Richison : Yes, that\u2019s correct and so just as a reminder, we take a successful manager that\u2019s currently with us, we relocate to a new geography or an existing geography where we\u2019re creating a new territory and then we backfill them with a sales rep who is now ready to lead and be a manager. The more offices you have, the more opportunity you have not only to move managers who are ready, but also the backfill of those and we continue to grow the skill set of that. As we\u2019ve done, I mean we\u2019ve opened up I think 16 offices in the last 30 months, last 31 months so which has been significant. But also there is a gap there. You don\u2019t want your sales performance capacity as far as what they are able to sell and what they\u2019re actually achieving, you don\u2019t want a major gap in that and not saying our gap is major, but we do see a gap. And when we do a good job of closing that gap as we\u2019ve been doing this since 2005, I mean this isn\u2019t a new way that we manage sales. But as we close that gap we actually increase the performance of the overall sales organization. And so we\u2019re not going to do anything that\u2019s going to negatively impact our current trajectory. So to that end we will be opening up offices and we\u2019re also going to be focusing on increasing the skill set as well as the performance of the reps we have hired right now. Mark Marcon : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Your line is open. Jim MacDonald : Yes, good afternoon guys. Chad what are you seeing out in the market and the economy or any uncertainty around the elections that changed at all? Chad Richison : I can\u2019t really comment to that. I think I said this in the last call. I mean we either going to have more legislative changes or a lot more legislative changes. I mean every year that goes by, we had something and every time they try to fix something, it gets two or three times worse or there is something else we have to deal with. And so anytime something that\u2019s new, there are changes. And so I see changes regardless. It\u2019s not our job to say whether or not we agree with the changes one way or the other. It\u2019s our job to develop them to able to put them out for the client so that they\u2019re able to utilize them to make minimal impact on their overall cost, and we\u2019re geared up to do that. Jim MacDonald : Okay, and then I saw the sales and marketing expense grew 23.1% I believe in the quarter, which is lower than it has been. Is there any particular reason for that? Chad Richison : The sales and marketing it\u2019s going to grow, but we\u2019re going to see efficiencies kind of throughout the organization both in the sales and marketing as well as in the G&A figure. You got to remember the sales and marketing includes, it has several components. It has salaries, commissions, marketing, it has office space, and other things. So if look at the offices that we opened this year, some of those fixed costs are lower than what we\u2019ve had in some of the other where we were going into New York or LA or San Francisco. So you\u2019ll see some there. As well as in the marketing area for example we attended the HR Tech conference this year and that\u2019s the same conference we attended last year. But we didn\u2019t attend 40% more conferences in the third quarter. So we\u2019re going to see some efficiency there. And then just on the G&A line, we\u2019re going also see some in terms of the last year was a first year being SOX compliant. So back half of the year, we had some costs associated with that and now we\u2019re more on a kind of on a maintenance level on that so. Craig Boelte : I might also ducktail off of that that one thing that we are also seeing with the new rep influx that we brought in with opening out the new offices. The new reps are selling the new rep sell and when they receive a commission, it is half the amount of an executive rep. Additionally, we did increase the amount that a new rep has to sell to become an executive rep and so we do have reps that stay at the lower commission longer. I think all of that might contribute somewhat to the number you\u2019re talking about. Jim MacDonald : Okay. Great, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from John Byun with UBS. Your line is open. John Byun : Hi, thanks very much. The first question I had was regarding the FLSA. Did you see any increasing activity around the government compliance module or the time and attendance in terms of maybe more employees being applied to their product? Chad Richison : Yes, so from a government compliance piece as we bring on new clients that\u2019s a very popular product for us already. And so FLSA was folded into government compliance and so clients already receive that. I would point I guess what we\u2019re getting the most activity as it relates to FLSA is really the webinars. I mean the webinars we\u2019re putting on for FLSA are doubling those same webinars that we put on for ACA. So I do think there are people still somewhat late to the party on gaining compliance with FLSA up until about I think a month about, maybe three weeks ago. They really felt like they were going to be able to kick the can down the road a little bit into next year and maybe stay off compliance for a little bit. It doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s happening. It looks like it\u2019s go forward now December 1. So we\u2019re continuing to have those conversations and go through both the education side as well as the analytical side to be able to determine what exactly our clients going to do in the offset and then how they\u2019re going to manage it on an ongoing basis, because that\u2019s extremely important that they do manage it on an ongoing basis to make sure that they\u2019re paying the minimum amount that they need to pay. John Byun : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then second question, obviously a lot of confusion among investors with ANRR. Is there anything you can talk about in terms of the pace of new deals or new business in the quarter? Chad Richison : Only to say that I haven\u2019t seen any change in characteristic as far as what a client would buy this quarter versus last quarter or the one prior to that. John Byun : Okay great. And then last one for Craig. So the stock-based comp was little larger this quarter and I think it may be related to some RSUs vesting, but could maybe just give us a quick estimation since it was a pretty big jump? Thanks. Craig Boelte : Sure. We had some performance RSUs that vested this year and as I mentioned under the new rules on the tax side we were able to gain some benefit to add on that on our GAAP earnings per share. It had no impact no impact on non-GAAP earnings per share. So that\u2019s really what happened. Moving forward our stock-based comp, I think for fourth quarter, we\u2019re estimating it around 3.5 assuming, but we still have some performance RSUs out there. So that\u2019s kind of the level it\u2019s expected to go to. John Byun : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Thanks for that earlier, I had a technical problem. Chad, can you talk a little bit about on the sales force productivity side and main driver for the group we\u2019ve seen is basically the existing officers seem to be selling better. We hear stories about some of your sales guys kind of making some really big number or selling some really big number. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that evolving over time? And then also has there been an impact for you since you are a public company terms of the hiring and the quality of the people that you are getting? Thanks you. Chad Richison : Yes, so definitely one leads to the other. I mean if you\u2019re hiring quality people that are ready to go to work and learn, we\u2019re going to have a great success with that. I\u2019ve pointed out before that you know our executive reps we\u2019ve very, very strong retention rate with them, better than 90% and then I've also pointed out before that you know when we lose people we're losing them before they achieve executive reps status and we've identified that it's extremely important to get those people to executive reps status as quickly as we can were very focused on that. By doing that, that does increase what an office can sell because you have more reps selling it at larger numbers versus the traditional sales model where your top reps can be carrying a larger load of proportionately than the others. And so, again this is something that in different patterns of our sales career. We go through with being able to increase ourselves capacity by gaining efficiencies through those new reps by implementing skills that allows them to get there quicker we\u2019re very focused on that right now. But you're right we have been continuing to increase our number based on the success of the mature offices and that's not different today and it was indifferent to this quarter but we definitely do see an opportunity to ramp up these newer offices. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan MacDonald with Wunderlich Securities. Your line is open. Ryan MacDonald : Hi guys, congrats on a great quarter. First of you talked about in your remarks that, that obviously the FLSA does not have any I guess impact in terms of - from revenue perspective as its bundled - governance and compliance but I guess can you talk about if in terms of the conversations or the pace of business, can you talk about if you\u2019re seeing any or have seen or are seeing any Pull Forwards and new customers signing on as a result of trying to get onto the platform so they can ahead of the time, ahead of the December 1 date so, they can take advantage of the FLSA toolkit. Chad Richison : I haven\u2019t and I would say similar to ACA, I definitely don't think and I said this about ACA too, I definitely don't think someone chooses Paycom just for the FLSA toolkit or just for ACA it's for the overall value proposition that we put out there that needs to resonate as far as what they're going to do with turning data and information. And so yes, I wouldn't be able to comment say we\u2019ve seen Pull Forward in starts. I think the one comment I made last year based on Pull Forward was those people that would've started in January of 2016 that Pull Forward in December for the sole purpose of gaining compliance for the 2015 but that was really a but again those clients didn't necessarily use us for the ACA alone. Ryan MacDonald : Got it. And then when you talked about I think one of the client example that, I think was the staffing company was over 2000 employees and they were using initially an in-house systems and switched over to Paycom. Is this sort of - are we seeing at all a shift and sort of sales strategy and I know typically Paycom is focused on customers that are already outsourcing the solution or as was this more of just one off circumstance there? Chad Richison : Well, we are definitely having more prospects at the upper end, reach out to us. We really target companies that are acclimated to the process through using one of our competitors and is our goal to get out there and get them to shift to us. It is often times that people research out there who would be a company to use for their employee size we pop up and they give us a call and so, that does happen more and more but still from a proportionate level I would definitely say that, our business was coming from companies that currently use one of our vendors and still half of that comes from companies that use the largest vendors out there so. Ryan MacDonald : All right, thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Thanks very much. I have two questions and just one first for Craig on the gross margin. It was down year-over-year and I think the guidance for the full year implies it's going to take down a little more in Q4. I was just curious as to what the puts and takes on higher cogs are relative to revenue. Craig Boelte : Sure. Our gross margin for the quarter was slightly lower than last year like 1% but typically when we mentioned this on previous calls, we have to hire ahead of the revenues. So we have some people on the bench, ready to take on that revenue so, we see the margins getting too high it may be that our staffing levels on of the level that we need them to be but we really in the past we\u2019ve said, some at 82% to 84% and that's really what were looking out for the full year and I really were this quarter ended. Ross MacMillan : Great. And just on - I\u2019m just thinking through the shape of the next couple of quarters where you had - your record bookings in Q4 last year and then you had a really big Q1 revenue of '16 in part driven by those bookings which obviously include about one time boost from ACA filing. So, just as we think forward would it make sense that, that sort of March comp is the kind of toughest comp and that will probably be a - I know you're not going to make sure that will probably be like a revenue trough that we could start to build off. Just trying to get a sense for the shape of the next couple of quarters. Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean past fourth quarter we haven't provided any guidance, what I can tell you is that the revenue profile as far as what we build for first quarter of next year and how we build forms and what have you will be the exact same as how we\u2019re going to do it this next time so, the revenue would react the same but as far as the other questions we haven't guided anything for 2017 yet. Keeping in, but what we've done in the past, we've always given that guidance with the - with fourth quarter results. Ross MacMillan : Understood. Thanks so much Chad, thanks Craig. Operator : There no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the presenters. Chad Richison : I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. We will be representing at the UBS Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on November 15. Then the Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference in Scottsdale on November 29 and the Barclays Global TMT Conference in San Francisco on December 7. We hope to see many of you at these events over the next couple of months and thank you for your interest in Paycom. Bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig. I would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. On this call I will begin with some highlights of our results for both the fourth quarter and the full year. I will then provide some comments regarding our view into the marketplace for cloud-based payroll and human capital management or HCM, and then follow that with some examples of key client wins during the quarter. Craig will review our financials and then we will open up the line for questions. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to thank our incredible team of Paycom employees. With such robust growth, it becomes all the more important to sustain a culture that makes Paycom a great place to work and thrive. I am grateful to all of our team members who give their all to provide unparalleled service to our clients and also help keep our unique culture alive and strong. Due to our passionate and engaged workforce we were awarded the title of top workplace in Oklahoma. This marked our fourth consecutive year on the list and this year we were also awarded the Direction award. This additional award comes as a result of feedback from employees who believe the company is going in the right direction. We also celebrated our second year on Deloitte's Fast Technology 500 list, which was a further indication of our success and leadership. We had an excellent year in 2016 and I am extremely proud of all that we have accomplished. Our sales momentum continues with full year revenue of $329.1 million, representing 46.5% growth over the comparable prior year period. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we achieved revenue of $87.8 million, representing 35% growth over the comparable prior year period. I would like to take a moment to highlight our fourth quarter performance. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we lapped our first full quarter of ACA revenue from current clients. As a reminder, in Q4 of 2015 we also experienced a pull forward of clients that started early on our system to gain ACA compliance. As such, we were very pleased with our ability to post a 35% growth rate over this very hefty comp. Craig will review our guidance in more detail later on the call, but I am pleased to share that we are starting this year off strong. With positive indications from our sales team and the market that make us optimistic for 2017. Additionally, I am pleased to share that our retention rate for 2016 was once again 91%, indicating ongoing client satisfaction with Paycom. 2016 was our second full year as a public company. As we celebrate this milestone, we combine the perspective of what we have accomplished with what is possible for us to achieve. As I survey the market place, I believe our strategic advantage is more significant than ever. We believe that the trend of companies replacing multi single function payroll and HR software solutions with a easy to use yet extremely powerful Paycom system, is set to continue for several years. This trend will be both driven by executives seeking the value creating ROI offered by the Paycom system and also by younger workers who have lived their entire lives with mobile devices and user-friendly interfaces, and who will increasingly demand modern HCM software experiences from their employers. Feedback from our sales organization validates that this trend continues to gain momentum and I will highlight some examples of this later in my prepared remarks. In 2016, we continued to build the foundation that we believe will allow us to remain at the forefront of this trend and capture the resulting growth opportunity. We significantly expanded our Oklahoma City corporate campus completing and moving employees into our new third building. We commenced construction on building four, which will provide as much space as our first three buildings combined as well as a parking garage. Additionally, we bolstered our board of directors adding seasoned executives, Ric Duques and J.C. Watts. We welcome both of them to Paycom and look forward to their contributions. Along with our physical expansion we continue to grow our team, making the required investments in our workforce to support our anticipated growth. In 2016, we added personnel across every department, growing our headcount to 2075 as of December 31, 2016. Notably, we expanded our R&D group, growing adjusted R&D cost to 8% of revenue for the full year ended 2016. We have always been very efficient with our R&D spend. Our high productivity has been enabled by the fact that our solution was built with a single data base. As we have matured over the years, we have continually strived to improve our software development process and even today we continue to make adjustments to become more streamlined and efficient. We had the opportunity to host several investors at our corporate headquarters in 2016. A highlight of every visit is touring our R&D area where investors can see firsthand not just the size and scope of our R&D team, but also the unique culture that allows our team to develop top quality software at such an impressive pace. Because our goal is to potentially replace several different vendors when we win a new client, we have to ensure that our offerings provide greater value to our client than those of our competitors. As a reminder, we compete in several HCM areas and with many companies whose sole focus is one specific area. The culture of efficiency goes beyond our R&D organization and permeates throughout our entire company. While we are making the required investments to secure our growth, we are also focused on leveraging the profitability inherent in our model. Now I will provide some brief comments regarding the Affordable Care Act. At this time we are assisting our clients with complying with the current law. When and if ACA is eliminated, we will react appropriately and promptly. If responsibility goes to the individual states, we could have separate state laws and regs with sub-regs for several states while other states may have none. The ACA could also be repealed and replaced with something still requiring the annual reporting of employee information. Another option is that the current law could be repealed so that there is no longer a requirement for businesses to report employee information. With that scenario in mind, if this was the last month for ACA billing and next month it is gone, we estimate that we would need to replace approximately 3% of our revenue for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we don\u2019t just assist our clients with tax and regulatory compliance, we provide a comprehensive set of software solutions including recruiting, compensation, training, HR, benefits administration and many others. Our system are used to help clients navigate each of these areas and much more. So while the immediate elimination of ACA would have a minor impact on our revenue from a certain number of our current clients, we do not believe it would impact our overall value proposition or our new business on-boarding pace. Now we will provide some examples of notable new client wins from the quarter. First, we signed a trucking company with 3200 employees. The client had been processing their payroll inhouse and were doing many things manually including, on-boarding new employees, benefits enrollment and several other key processes. This client chose Paycom because they wanted at true hire to retire system that would service their entire organization and with our platform they were able to eliminate five point solution providers as well several other manual processes. They are very excited about the positive impact they expect our solution to have on their firm. Additionally, they really valued our hands-on implementation process and the caring attention we brought to the table. Next, we welcomed a retail services company with 3500 employees to the Paycom family. They had been previously using a large competitor for payroll and also point solution providers for applicant tracking, background checks and performance management as well as a home grown internal system for employee on-boarding. This client wanted to consolidate these disparate systems and eliminate manual entry and the associated exposure. Finally, we are very pleased to bring on a health services company with over 8000 employees. They evaluated several vendors as part of their transition. With Paycom this client was able to eliminate seven point solution provides. In addition to gaining these efficiencies, this company chose Paycom because they believe that our solution is the right platform to help them achieve their growth targets. We are honored to partner with them and excited to provide a foundation for their future growth. To conclude, we had an excellent fourth quarter and a tremendous year and I will now turn the call over to Craig for an update on our financials and guidance. Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our fourth quarter results and also our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2017, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations. Non-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that also reflects adjustments for non-cash stock-based compensation expense and certain transaction expenses that are not core to our operations which are further adjusted for the effect of income taxes. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures discussed today are included in our press release. As Chad mentioned, we experienced a strong fourth quarter with total revenues of $87.8 million representing year-over-year growth of 35% from the comparable prior-year period. Our full year 2016 revenues were $329.1 million, representing growth of 46.5% from the comparable prior year period. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $86.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 36% from the comparable prior-year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $72.8 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 83%. For the full year 2017, we anticipate that our gross margin will be within a range of 82% to 84%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $56.5 million for the quarter as compared to $47.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $35.6 million. Adjusted R&D expense was $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, representing growth of 157% over the comparable prior-year period. As Chad detailed, we have continued to invest in R&D to maintain and expand the competitiveness of our solution. As a reminder, a portion of our R&D expense is capitalized. Our total adjusted R&D costs for the fourth quarter of 2016 including the capitalized portion were $8.4 million or 10% of total revenues. Total adjusted R&D costs for the full year of 2016 including the capitalized portion were $27.2 million or 8% of total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was $20.7 million or 24% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $10.5 million or 16% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $8.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share, based on approximately 59 million shares versus $5.2 million or $0.09 per diluted share a year ago. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 32% and the rate for the full year was 23%. For modeling purposes, for 2017 we estimate that our combined federal and state tax rate will be 35%. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $10.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares versus $6 million or $0.10 per diluted share a year ago. We repurchased 634,506 shares during the fourth quarter completing our initial $50 million stock repurchase plan. As of today, we have repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares in total. Our board of directors has extended our plan, authorizing the rate purchases of up to an additional $50 million worth of common stock and we look forward to continuing to return cash to our stockholders via these repurchases. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $60.2 million and total debt of $29.8 million. As a reminder, this debt represents the financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. Construction of our fourth building and parking garage are proceeding well. Cash from operations was $24.5 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. With that, let me turn to guidance for the first quarter and full year for fiscal 2017. I want to emphasize that because of the current uncertainty surrounding which of the various provisions of the ACA will be affected by Congressional action, as well as the timing of any such action, this guidance assumes that the ACA would remain in place for the remainder of 2017 without any modifications. For the first quarter of 2017, we expect total revenues in the range of $114.5 million to $116.5 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $42 million to $44 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 37% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2017, we are introducing revenue guidance to a range of $422 million to $424 million or approximately 29% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. For the full year 2017, our adjusted EBITDA guidance is a range of $113 million to $115 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : A couple of questions if I may. First of all, Chad, in the past you talked about kind of office openings and I know like investors paid a lot of attention but we probably shouldn\u2019t be because it takes an office two years to kind of get fully up and running. Do you want to make any comments in terms of how you think about '17 or should we just kind of ignore that for the time being. Then the second question that I had was on, if I look your strength in the last year, a lot of that was driven by the existing offices selling a lot better. What is your assumptions for '17 in terms of the momentum you saw in '16. Do you think you can carry that all the way into '17? And then I had a quick one for Craig. If you look at the guidance, what's your assumptions on interest rates for this year? Because obviously interest rate increases will help you on the carry that you have. What's your base assumption for the guidance? Thank you. Chad Richison : All right. Well, thanks, Raimo. I will take the first two. First on office openings. I mean we haven't changed our strategy on that. As I had said in the past, we will be opening up offices this year. It's rare that we have ever had offices open too much before this date, February 8. I do know at one year we did announce office openings, I think with our very year-end earnings announcements. Some others have been actually announced in the second quarter. So as we get those office opened, we will be announcing it. But our strategy on that hasn\u2019t changed. That also falls into your second part of your question, as a company we have always matured, are maturing offices, and that is where we experience a lot of our growth. I have talked about it in the past that office openings due to the way we do it, does produce somewhat of a drain on our current talent which we get all back in subsequent years. So we are very focused on our current strategy. Nothing has changed on our end. We will be continuing to open up offices this year as well as maturing as I have talked about in the past. Maturing our current group to bridge the gap in between our new business sales capacity that exists as an opportunity and what we are actually achieving. As far as the interest rates, I will turn that over to Craig. Craig Boelte : Raimo, on the interest rates, you know our guidance basically assumes rates are where they are today. You know there is talk about two, possibly even three interest rate increases during the year of 25 basis points. I think it's somewhat dangerous to include those because you just never know if they are going to happen. One thing I would though remind you is we are holding a significant amount of client funds. During the fourth quarter our average daily balance was around $680 million, on a pretax basis that\u2019s about $1.7 million. So that really falls to the bottom line. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Nemeroff : Chad, I just want to follow up on Raimo's question about office openings and I heard the commentary that you just made. But could you give us a sense of how many offices that you plan to open, I mean without knowing the exact locations, I don\u2019t necessarily know if that would be competitive information. And then the second question is around the ACA. It's helpful on the ACA commentary and that\u2019s been helpful from your competitors as well to get that specific information and understanding that it is variable. If we take out all of the noise around ACA and all of the contribution that it's given us, given you over the last couple of years, I am curious, is your expectation on growth for the next couple of years north or south of 30% on a normalized basis. And then I just have one follow up on the 8000 [CTL] [ph] please. Chad Richison : Yes. So you first question is office openings. I mean we have never guided to the number of offices that we are opening. As far as releasing it to the competition, that\u2019s really secondary as far as my apprehension to continue to talk about what we are doing next, it's my own people. We tap people on the shoulder when they are ready, as we know they have raised their hands and as they have hit certain goals to where we are ready and that process hasn\u2019t changed for us. And so the very first people who will know what's going on are our current people. So as we continue to have those discussion internally and identify the many different markets that we can get into and as that\u2019s been done, then of course we would be talking about that in the future. So, again, I would point back to -- and I am not 100% for sure, but I think with the exception of maybe once and then maybe a couple of other offices early, it would have been odd for us to have opened up any offices before February 8. So we still do have the remaining of the year and we are very focused on that. As far as the ACA contribution, I think was your second question... Michael Nemeroff : Yes. It's around the long-term growth, the sustainability of the long-term growth rate. Chad Richison : Yes. I mean there isn't a product that we have that we use as a crutch to support future growth. It's every product in aggregate. So it's never one product and that would be the truth of ACA. ACA was a very popular product. We were very forthcoming with that and it came about and everybody had to get complaint. Most products that have a compliance piece to it are fairly popular and so it was. We have called out that it does represent a smaller portion of our overall revenue. We are not giving 2018 guidance today but I can tell you that we are set up to be a very good grower over the next several years and I think the way that we have worked our business even overcoming pretty strong growth comps last year, we are heading into Q1 with our largest comps, 63% growth from Q1. And I think that we are going to be coming out the gate strong on that. Michael Nemeroff : That\u2019s helpful, Chad. Then on the large 8000 [CTL] [ph] that you signed in the quarter. Congrats on that. How long do you expect implementations for something of that size to stretch on and do you see more of those types of size of deals in your pipeline currently or is this more of a one off situation. Chad Richison : Yes. I mean it would be uncommon for anything that we sell to stretch on longer than three months from a conversion standpoint. Typically they are much earlier than that. I have always taken the position that the longer you allow a conversion to take data, your data worse and worse over time, and the longer you are stuck in conversion, the harder conversion gets. So we are set up to onboard companies very efficiently and that company would follow the same on-boarding process as our other companies. Operator : Your next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is open. John DiFucci : Chad and Craig, your implied EBITDA margins for 2017 is for flat to down a little bit after a couple of years of significant expansion. I am just kind of wondering what is the thinking there. Like why is that the case given you are still going to -- you are not going to have as much growth for your guidance next year but still very robust growth on the top line. Craig Boelte : Yes. On our adjusted EBITDA guidance, this is really our starting point for the year and as we look out throughout the year, we are still set up to be a high growth company and part of that comes with increased commissions and selling and marketing expenses. So as we sit here today that\u2019s really our beginning point on guidance and what we know sitting here today. Chad Richison : And we also, I mean we do hire ahead of the revenue that we catch and I don\u2019t know to what extent that would be, of course some of that in there. I mean we have guided to 27%, we feel like as we sit here today, that\u2019s a good guide for us and we will be updating that as we have more information and we move along. John DiFucci : Okay. Thanks. That sounds like a good starting point. And I guess have you adjusted your 2017 guidance relative to your expectation prior to the new FLSA over time [rules] [ph] being blocked, I think you had implied at least in earlier indications for 2017 that you see some benefit from that and now that looks less certain. Chad Richison : Yes. Well, I did talk about FLSA and how it is, if it were to have not had the injunction. If it were to have continued on, it would have a very large impact on American businesses and I came out and said that and it would have. Any time you are doubling the minimum wage for salaried employees, it's going to impact many industries. So I also said that it's not something we are charging for, it's included in our government compliant module which it is. But I will also say this, I mean we have companies right now that are using our FLSA tool. There are 31 -- there are different minimum wage [caps] [ph] in 31 states. Several of them have a different minimum wage [count] [ph] based on occupation. So a company -- like Oregon has a state law or state minimum wage based on where you are located, urban or rural. Minnesota has different wages based on employer revenue. Nevada has different ones based on whether the employer offers health coverage or not. So the FLSA in staying compliant with the minimum wage count definitely is at the federal level but also you can use our tool to impact state as well. And so I do feel like it's, well, we know it's a product that\u2019s out there. It is being used right now. It does not have an associated revenue piece to it but a lot of our products don\u2019t. And again, it's the full solution that delivers the value proposition to our client base. John DiFucci : Great. Chad, at least the way I understand it, and correct me if I am wrong, that it was a little unclear to me but I thought you had implied that you would sell more the [government] [ph] compliance tool realizing that this is a functionality that\u2019s included in that and people buy it for a lot of different reasons. But is there anything in guidance that implies the sale of that tool. Was it going to increase because of the FLSA currently, in current guidance. Chad Richison : Our guidance was not changed base on FLSA, based off of any FLSA expectations. Does that answer the question? John DiFucci : I think so. I just want to be clear though. Did you have originally in your guidance, your previous indications for 2017, any uplift in sales of the compliance tool because of the... Chad Richison : No, no. John DiFucci : Okay. That\u2019s the answer I was looking for. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Mark Murphy : So, Chad, you had mentioned in your script that you had some good success in replacing a number of point products in some of your recent wins. And, so I am wondering at this point, just how diversified is the revenue stream if you compare it to a couple of years ago. For instance, in terms of how diversified the revenue stream is outside of that core payroll piece. Chad Richison : Yes. I mean that\u2019s not something that we have updated. We had talked about and which is true, we sell one total product and then it's modules that clients choose to take. The longer we have had a product, the higher the adoption. And so time and attendance as a product, we have had for quite a long time. Obviously, it's going to have a higher adoption rate than a product we may have come out with a year or two ago. But it's the products as a whole that when we go in there is what we are selling. One product that has the many different modules associated. Okay. In answer to your question, all I can tell you is that it is going to be more diversified over time just because we have more products and the adoption rates of these products also increases over time. And we start off with 100% of all of our clients have the payroll module and so over time that\u2019s obviously going to be as a percentage to be somewhat diluted in to the overall product mix. Mark Murphy : Okay. Makes sense. And then as well, any comment on the linearity of starts or go live during Q4. Is it possible that, just the timing there is always an ebb and flow. Is it possible they were a little more backend loaded in Q3 and then a bit more liner in Q4? Chad Richison : No. I would say that this year end would be similar to past year ends with the exception of the pull forward that we had due to the ACA phenomenon and companies wanting to get compliant for that next year. So outside of that, our starts have been somewhat consistent based on how they followed when the deal was booked originally. Mark Murphy : Okay. Got it. And then the last one I wanted to ask you and with the understanding that obviously the guidance that you are giving us now as you said is the starting point. And we are aware of your track record with that over the years. I was looking at -- if you look back on 2016, the company grew just absolute dollar terms revenue grew by $104 million. And then the 2017 guidance, it has you growing by a smaller increment of about $94 million. And so I think mathematically I know there is some moving pieces but it seems to have imply that new bookings are running kind of around the same level or relatively flat year-over-year because the bookings drive the incremental growth. And I was thinking that it's against the a backdrop where EDP is guiding to flattish bookings growth going forward where they had kind of surprised negatively on that. I guess, I am just curious, and not that there is anything wrong with flat bookings for a little while but just how are you looking at that? And then is there a point where you kind of get through this, the tough comps relating to ACA, where you think that would start growing pretty nicely again. Craig Boelte : Yes. Mark, one thing to keep in mind in last year, that was the first year that we had the ACA forms filing. So in that first quarter we had a pretty significant lift both to form filings as well as we had the full year of some of that ACA. But that was one of the phenomenon that we had first quarter of 2016. Chad Richison : Yes. And as far as, I mean the guide this year, I am unaware of any company that had a higher growth rate in our industry then us last year. I am also unaware of any company that\u2019s guiding to a higher growth rate then us this year. So I think we are coming off the toughest comp out there and we are pretty proud about what's going on and we are -- all indications from our sales staff which I stay close to, is that we are in really good shape as we head into this year. Operator : Your next question comes from David Hynes with Canaccord. Your line is open. David Hynes : Craig, wondering if you could update us on what you are seeing in terms of sales retention, maybe senior level, mid-level and then hiring environment. Any changes there we should be aware of? Chad Richison : Yes. We have had basically the same retention rate amongst our executive reps. This group sells the overwhelming majority of our new business and we have maintained a 90% or better retention rate with that group. I had mentioned in the past to everybody that we do have some turnover amongst our newer reps but also that we had really focused on that. And as of January, we just promoted 37 executive rep or 37 people just became executive reps. And so as I had mentioned, I believe a couple of earnings calls ago we were very focused on developing our current younger group of people that are coming up and we are having success with that. So from what I see, early indications are that our turnover rate amongst new reps is down. We are having a greater success keeping our newer reps and again with executive reps its remained roughly the same. David Hynes : Got it. Thanks, Chad. And then maybe as you think about kind of the product development roadmap, talk about some areas where you are focusing there. I think a lot of recent investments have been in response to regulatory changes. So I guess with kind of an uncertain backdrop these days on that front, I am curious if that changes kind of your R&D focus at all. Chad Richison : Well, compliance is always number one when it comes to R&D. It's a have to whether it's on the tax side, I mean there might be some changes whether it's ACA or others but at the end of the day we are constantly updating tax tables, new tax [counts] [ph] new filings and everything else along with whatever is thrown in to the mix, sometimes retro. So that\u2019s always a main focus of ours as we go through prioritization, that\u2019s always top. And then the things that follow that or really go along side with that because it's a different group that work on both. Is the continual expansion of our value proposition so that our clients can experience a better interface and a better experience by using Paycom and really eliminate waste within their organization. Operator : Your next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : The ACA 3% commentary that you gave, does that exclude the forms filing business from the month of January? Craig Boelte : Everything that\u2019s been build both in January and February. My commentary was if it were to end after this month, we would expect all billing for forms to be completed by the end of February. Brad Reback : Okay. So just to be clear. So the 3% would be starting from March 1 onwards and then... Craig Boelte : That\u2019s correct. You are correct. Brad Reback : And then add the forms? Craig Boelte : That is correct. Now there might be some forms still that we had done that may not been built based on certain clients wishes at different times but, yes, 99 point whatever percent of that 3% is going to be the recurring fee not forms. Brad Reback : Great. And then just one follow-up, Chad, on the commentary with your newer sales reps. I know on last quarter you talked about changing some of the quota goals to make executive rep. Obviously that\u2019s not impacting the tension at all, in fact is improving it? Chad Richison : Well, it's not the changing of the goals that\u2019s improving. Yes, we did change the level or the amount that someone needs to onboard because before they are able to become an executive rep. And we have done that just because people were reaching it quicker than what we had anticipated. But it's really a focus on those people that weren't getting there. And meanwhile we have a program to get people there, which is something that we needed to really focus on and make that a top priority for our sales management organization which we have done. And so it's really that. The on purpose strategic development of our new people and not allowing them to get a cut as we focus on our higher growth group. It's really the strategic focus on that group that is making the change. Again, I mean I have got about a couple of quarters information but those couple of quarters are telling me the efforts that we have made to increase retention amongst our new reps is working. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Joe Reptin] [ph] on for Brent. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One on office openings, if I could. You open new offices when, do you have reps that are ready to step into that new role and also when you've identified attractive markets. Has there been a change in identifying either of those? Craig Boelte : There has not. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then ACA, the 3% left in the air. Is the total still looking around 5% of revenue? Craig Boelte : Yes. We don\u2019t -- we said approximately 5% and we have not changed amount since we initially gave it out in what I believe was fourth quarter 2015. I would have to look at that. But those are the same approximate numbers we have today. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Then just one final one. FLSA obviously got pushed out, but we had heard that a discussion of it was maybe increasing some customer interest. Can you maybe talk about the pace of client growth through Q4, if the election changed anything and how that's continued through Q1? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean I haven't seen any difference. So I mean now this is my fifth President, I guess that I have been through, let me count those. Four, this will be my fourth President, I guess, that I have been through with the election cycle. So I mean there is always something different. I mean in the midmarket, they are out there working their business and they are looking to eliminate waste or create efficiencies. And so that really doesn\u2019t change -- now we haven't seen any slowdown in people's willingness to onboard on to our product based on the election results. I mean as far as FLSA goes, we are not an FLSA company. We have a product that can help with the over time count based on the new salary increases to the minimum wage which might not happen at the federal level. It could very well happen on state levels and already has as far as the actual hourly minimum wage. And so our value proposition as it relates to our government compliance, again, FLSA it's not just FLSA, it's everything that we sell in that area and we are not seeing any slowdown of government compliance tool due to the FLSA injunction. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Marcon with RW Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : With regards to the EBITDA guidance, when we take a look at sales and marketing, R&D, G&A, which elements would you expect to see grow the fastest on a year-over-year basis and which one would you expect to grow the slowest? Chad Richison : Throughout this year? Mark Marcon : Yes. In 2017. Chad Richison : I mean some of that is based on timing of when deals come in and what the commission rates are at sales and marketing. I mean it's easy to point to R&D as being a place that we are continuing to spend. But then we will see that -- some of that comes down to timing on when the sales is on-boarding as far as what the corresponding commission rate to that is. Mark Marcon : Sure. I just meant, as it relates to the guidance that you gave, what a midpoint would be? The G&A should be relatively easy to, shouldn\u2019t vary that much. Craig Boelte : That\u2019s correct. I mean you would efficiencies in the G&A. Sales and marketing as a whole should continue to grow and then as well as R&D. We will continue to increase our pace on the R&D side as well. And in our gross margin, what Chad mentioned, we have to hire ahead of the business. So you know there is going to be times where the gross margin fluctuates and that\u2019s why we gave the range of 82 to 84 just because we have to hire ahead of the business coming in. Mark Marcon : I appreciate that. And then with regard to the tone of business across your various offices. When we take a look at some of your more mature offices, how have those been trending? Chad Richison : Yes. The mature offices that we have not relocated a manager from, meaning it's a mature office but they don\u2019t have a new manager. They have also the mature manager that\u2019s been in there. I mean those are our best offices. You know the second would be those offices that are mature in which we have relocated a manager and then backfilled them with the manager. Those would be second. And the final piece would be those new offices that are not yet mature. So always the offices where we have maintained our current managers, do the best. Mark Marcon : Great. With regards to some of the bigger sales that you ended up getting and closing this past quarter. When you were going through and replacing some single point solutions, what was that process like from the standpoint of buying across various departments that -- and how your solutions for, say, applicant tracking or time in attendance, compared to some of the better-of-breed solutions that may have been put in, that may have been in place? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean it's really a mixed bag of what we are going to run into. We are always typically running into a competitor from the payroll side and then time and attendance. And then when it comes to the different point solution providers, whether it's on the talent side or comp side or surveys or benefits administration or what have you, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. But what is very common with all of them is this, at our client base, as far as the midmarket, they often buy point solutions to solve a problem. They want to solve a problem. It's not necessarily that they have an overall strategy for how -- or that they are necessarily implementing an overall strategy often times of what do they want everything to look like. And so when we are coming in, it's not just, hey, you have got applicant tracking, we do applicant tracking. You have tax credits, we do tax credits. It's helping them implement an overall strategy for what they want their employee use cases to be. And it's through that that we are able to deliver, not just help them deliver and complete a strategy but also a product that automates that strategy. And so in doing that you are going to replace everything that the client might be using because that supports the overall strategy that the client is now implementing when they choose to Paycom. So implement Paycom. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Your line is open. Jim MacDonald : Quick question and then some follow ups. Could you give an update to your current philosophy on up-selling existing customers with more modules? Chad Richison : Well, yes. I mean you definitely want to be able to provide clients with those products that meet their needs. And so we are definitely focused on continuing to bring current products that we have, that our client might not have implemented yet. I will say, as I have been saying, most of our clients implement the majority of our products, over half of our products at the time of their initial conversion. So it really depends on when that client was onboarded of whether or not they have a lot of our products of if we are still needing to go back into the client base. But we do continue to sell into our current client base as we have in the past as well as adding and onboarding new clients. It's important to know that our executive sales group, which again represents a overwhelming majority of all of our business, sales business, they are unable to go out and sell something into the current client base after their clients have been onboarded with us for greater than 30 days. We have separate group that then works with the client on that and also helps the client not just sell them but helps the client with usage and can even provide additional training. So they are not just a sales resource but there are some other things that they can do as well. Jim MacDonald : Great. Two technical questions about the quarter. Is there any way to quantify the impact of the pull forward last year on your growth rate this year? And then also, can you comment on your G&A was, seemed like a relatively small increase versus last year in the quarter. Anything unusual that happened in this quarter? Chad Richison : As far as your first question, I think we called out the exact number and that number based on whether or not it started at the end of November, the first of December, you divide by either 12 to take one twelfth of it or you might take two-twelfths of it. But that might give you a little bit of information on the exact impact that any pull forward from Q1 2016 in the start of Q4 2015 may have impacted that quarter. Craig, I will let you take the second. Craig Boelte : Yes. And on the G&A, 2015 was our first year of SOX compliance so we have quite a bit of G&A in that fourth quarter, getting ready for that. This year was more of a maintenance feature. So that\u2019s kind of what I would point out. You know there's several things that go into that but that would probably be the main. Operator : Your next question comes from John Byun with UBS. Your line is open. John Byun : I wanted to see if you can maybe give an update on the total number of modules you have today, let's say versus one or two years ago and where did the PPY shake out as well? Craig Boelte : Yes. So the last updated module we talked about was 26 and then we have not updated the annualized opportunity per employee. It still remains at $400, or more than $400 is what we have said. John Byun : And in the 26 number, is there a way to kind of reference versus one or two years ago, in terms of how you are expanding your portfolio? Craig Boelte : Well, it's been 26, I think we updated, we had 18 at the IPO which was in April of 2014. And so since then we have added on eight additional. John Byun : Okay. Great. Then one more question. In terms of where you are gaining share, the pockets of share gains or companies onboarding to you. Has there been any change in terms of those sources and let's say between legacy, regionals, in-house or out of card vendors? Is there any trend that you can point to there? Chad Richison : No. We are in a very competitive industry. Almost all deals are competitive. Typically we are going up against the incumbent and often times that plus and another vendor. So it's been very competitive and I can't speak to there being any difference in competition last year from the previous year, from even the previous year in the market that we are focused on. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan MacDonald with Wunderlich. Your line is open. Ryan MacDonald : In a previous question, or one of the previous questions, you talked about replacing point solution providers with some of the new deals and that being as a part of an overall strategy. When you are replacing these vendors, are these legacy on-prem vendors and you are replacing based on an overall shift or strategy towards moving towards the cloud, or are you replacing other cloud vendors at these customers? Chad Richison : Yes. It would be rare that we are replacing something that\u2019s not in the cloud in the midmarket. You just really don\u2019t run into installed products very much anymore. So when we are out there replacing what I will point though is you can have different point solution providers where there is crossover. Where you can track candidates in three of them but you might choose one because it's better than the others and then you might use another for comp. So there is crossover amongst point solution providers as far as there functionality. And so we could go into a client, they have chosen one point solution provider for one thing very specific and they have another for something separate then that. Then we go to another company that\u2019s using the same products and they are using all functionality in one of the point solution providers. So really it's just dependent upon how the point solution providers sold it, integrated it, and then through the reporting from there. And so for us we are going in with an overall strategy to replace all with one system. Ryan MacDonald : Got it. And last quarter you talked about a bit, or you introduced a new metric. It was business sales performance capacity and talking about what the new businesses offices could achieve at full maturity and new sales. Any update to that metric at all or could you at least talk about how that's trended from third quarter to fourth quarter, if any change at all? Chad Richison : Well, I will say that anything we focus we impact and we are very very focused on bridging the gap in this. It is, as I mentioned, our new business sales capacity, a metric number was $260 million and as far as from a capacity standpoint, again, that\u2019s new business onboard. And as far as from a capacity standpoint, I wouldn\u2019t update that number to day. It's still the $260 million. As far as our gap, closing gap on that, we are definitely closing gap on that as we continue to work our strategy in that area. Now I believe I just introduced this about three months ago. So it would be a little early for me to give too much of an update on that other than to say that we are definitely bridging that gap, which is what we have done before. It's not a new metric for us. It's just something we shared last quarter with the general public. Ryan MacDonald : Got it. And then finally just last question. Have you seen -- as you're continuing to ramp sales offices to full maturity, have you seen any impact or change in that time to maturity in instances where you've opened, say, a second or third sales office within the same city or same geography there? Chad Richison : You know to total maturity it still takes 24 months. But we are seeing newer offices sell more to maturity. So I would say that they are doing better selling early on and they are selling more towards maturity but at the end of the day it still takes 24 months for you to have 8 sales people of carrying full quota trained and backlog in pipeline. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Chad, just two questions. Just on the new business sales capacity metric that you just talked about. Is there a way for us to think about when you need to start, like what the ratio, if you will, of what you are able to -- or what's comfortable, if you will, from a sales capacity being realized versus that sales capacity target, if you will, or cap. Is there way to think about that ratio and when it gets to a certain ratio you'd definitely want to hire or definitely open more offices, or definitely lean on that? I'm just curious as to how you think about that ratio realized to potential. Chad Richison : Yes. I mean definitely that\u2019s something we manage internally. And one kind of gets the other. I mean as you bridge that gap, you are bridging it through more developed sales people and that produces a larger bench for you to back fill the relocating, the current mature relocating managers that are going in, to opening up new offices. So this is, again, as I said in the past. This isn't a new number for us. We constantly measure and manage this number. As far as where we are at and being able to achieve that number, it's not a metric that we are going to disclose from that standpoint. But it is a number that we manage and as that number grows, you know should 260 grow, which I mean achievement would make that grow. But that what's would make it grow, it wouldn\u2019t be something where we are just taking a guess. It would be based on actual numbers achieved and again, it's a work through that process. So for us, it's something we are focused on. We do measure it and it is something that somewhat tells us, are we ready. And we feel good about where we are at right now. Just to be quite honest with you. Ross MacMillan : That's great. And maybe just one follow-up. ADP had made mention that in terms of new signings in the last, say 90 days, they'd seen a change in the attach of the ACA reporting module. It sounds like you have not seen that, but I just wanted to confirm that point because we've had a few different views on this from industry players. Chad Richison : No, we have not seen any change in the attach rate for ACA. And from our standpoint, it is still, for anyone client it is still a nominal fee that carries substantial penalties. And if I were a client in the mid-market, I wouldn\u2019t be quick to turn this off. If they wanted to turn something off, there might be some other things that they could turn off that wouldn\u2019t have the negative impact that this would should it stay. And we could be talking about ACA in 2028. I don\u2019t know. But it is the current law today and we are going to continue to help clients put themselves in the best situation to be able comply with the current laws, all current laws as they exist today. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the presenters. Chad Richison : All right. Well, I would like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your interest in Paycom and we look forward to our continued success in 2017. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig. I would like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. As with prior earnings calls I will begin with some highlights of our results, provide some comments on the marketplace and then conclude with some examples of notable client wins during the quarter. Craig will review our financials and then we\u2019ll open up the lines for question and answer. We had a great start to the year and I\u2019m pleased with our results. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $119.5 million representing growth of 33% over the comparable prior year period. This performance is especially impressive considering the very strong growth we achieved in the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, this is the first time our quarterly revenue has exceeded $100 million. This is a notable achievement for our company and I\u2019d like to extend thanks and congratulations to our entire team for their dedication and energy in helping us reach this milestone. Craig will provide more detail on our financials in a few minutes, but I\u2019ll quickly note that our strong revenue performance in the first quarter flowed through our bottom line driving adjusted EBITDA $47 million representing 39% of revenue. These results underscore profitable business model. Our strong results were driven by broad based sales outperformance as well as strengthen our tax form filing business. We continue to see robust demand for our solution across a wide range of industries and regions. Our sales representatives are finding that our single database application which spans both payroll and human capital management or HCM continues to resonate with prospective clients. Companies are attracted to the significant ROI they can achieve by deploying our solution. With our intuitive user interface that can be easily navigated by every employee type. Our comprehensive suite that covers employees from hire to retire, Paycom presents a compelling alternative for mid market companies looking to replace disparate point solution providers. When you combine this broad HCM functionality with our sophisticated payroll offering, clients can have peace of mind knowing that Paycom is in their corner handling crucial responsibility such as accurate tax withholding and labor law compliance and also helping to manage their vital talent. This support allows our client to fully focus on their core objectives and run their business for growth and success. Now I\u2019ll provide some examples of notable client wins from the first quarter. First, we signed a workforce solution company with over 6,500 employees. This client had been using another provider for payroll, several other HCM vendors and even paper based processes in certain areas. With Paycom they were able to eliminate all these systems and create a single workflow for their employees. We were also able to assist them with compliance and substantially improve their reporting. Next we signed a document management company with approximately 2,000 employees. This client has been using another payroll provider for payroll and several other HCM functions. They were drawn to our ability to improve their employee experience and create a linear system to manage employee workflow. This client also appreciated our ability to help them mitigate risk exposure as well as our extensive talent development capabilities. Finally, we bought in a hospitality company with over 6,700 employees. They decided to shift away from their former HCM provider and were evaluating several companies including Paycom. I\u2019m pleased to say we won this client due to our single database platform and the ease of use of our system. Our one-to-one customer service model as well as our commitment to a rapid implementation with a strong onsite presence were also important to this client. Overall, we saw excellent sales traction this quarter and are optimistic for ongoing success this year and beyond. Additionally, we continue to expand our sales organization with our recently announced Milwaukee office. We are excited to bring the power of the Paycom solution to clients in the Milwaukee area. As with all of our newly launched sales team, we selected an experienced sales manager from an established office to relocate to Milwaukee and lead our new team. This approach ensures that the Paycom culture and sales strategy remains intact as we expand. We intend to announce additional new offices through the year, when the timing is appropriate for our business. To conclude, we kicked off 2017 with excellent results and I look forward to maintaining our momentum through the year. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Craig for an update on our financials and our guidance. Craig Boelte : Thanks Chad. Before I review our first quarter results and also our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2017, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash stock based compensation expense. Non-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that also reflects adjustments for non-cash stock based compensation expense which is further adjusted for the effective income taxes. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures discussed today are included in the earning\u2019s press release issued earlier this afternoon. As Chad mentioned, we experienced a strong first quarter with total revenues of $119.5 million representing year-over-year growth of 33% from a comparable prior year period. Our revenue performance was driven by combination of excellent new business growth and also contribution from our forms filing business. Our forms business generates revenue every first quarter and consist to both tax forms and forms related to the Affordable Care Act that we file on behalf of our clients. As a reminder, this is our second year of ACA forms so the results we released today are really in apples-to-apples comparison against last year and we\u2019re encouraged by our strong performance in light of the tough comps that we posted in the first quarter of 2016. Within total revenues recurring revenue was $118 million for the first quarter of 2017 representing 99% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 33% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $103 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 86% reflecting our strong revenue performance. For the full year 2017, we continue to anticipate that our adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 82% to 84%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $61 million for the quarter as compared to $48 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter 2017 was $36 million. Adjusted R&D was $7 million in the first quarter of 2017. We\u2019ve made substantial progress in billing out our R&D organization over the past several quarters. Going forward, we will continue to invest in R&D to maintain a competitiveness of our solution. For modeling purposes, we would expect adjusted R&D expense at a percent of revenue to be consistent with the levels we saw in the third and fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $47 million or 39% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $33 million or 37% of total revenue in the first quarter, 2016. We expect higher expenses in the second quarter 2017 in both sales and marketing and in our research and development spend. These anticipated increased expenses will be reflected in the guidance that I will provide in a few moments. Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was $26 million or $0.43 per diluted share based on approximately 58.5 million shares versus $19 million or $0.31 per diluted share based on approximately 58.4 million shares a year ago. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 was 33.5%. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $28 million or $0.47 per diluted share based on approximately 58.5 million shares versus $19.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share a year ago. For modeling purposes, we expect stock based comp to increase by approximately $4 million per quarter for 2017 due to our recent issuance of additional restricted shares under our long-term incentive plan. In the first quarter, our Board of Directors extended our initial $50 million stock repurchase plan and authorized the repurchase from additional $50 million worth of common stock. We look forward to continuing to return cash to our stockholders opportunistically via these repurchases. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $93 million and total debt of $32 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. We recently completed construction of our new parking garage and open it for use for our employees. Construction of our fourth building [ph] is proceeding and we look forward to creating additional space to accommodate our growth. Cash from operations was $40 million for the first quarter reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $840 million in the first quarter of 2017. Now let me turn the guidance for the second quarter and full year for fiscal 2017. For the second quarter of 2017, we expect total revenues in the range of $94.5 million to $96.5 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 29% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in the range of $22 million to $24 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 24% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2017 we are raising our revenue guidance to a range of $426 million to $428 million where approximately 30% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We\u2019re also increasing our full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance to range of $117 million to $119 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we\u2019ll open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] your first question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Can you talk a little bit about sales compensation this new upcoming year, I remember last you changed with the level that junior sales person had to get - made to senior, is there any change that you could think about [indiscernible] upcoming year. And then you\u2019ve gone obviously deeper in industry like in the prior quarters you talked about ACA and the changes and FSLA and the change, is there anything on the horizon that we should be aware of. Thank you. Chad Richison : Yes, Raimo. First on the sales compensation there have been no changes that we\u2019ve made other than to announce what we did last year in which we changed the amount that someone needs to sell in order to hit the executive rep status and we moved that up 500 at the time and so that states consistent. As far as your second question as it relates to ACA or FLSA and what else we have out there. There are still a lot of movement in the ACA and we\u2019re kind of waiting to see what happens with that, but there is a lot of legislation that we track on the continue basis. We are still tracking ACA as well as FLSA and then also H1B. Raimo Lenschow : All right, thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Nemeroff from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Alex Toone : This is Alex Toone on for Michael, congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking our questions. Chad just wanted to touch on the sales offices timeline this year. Can you give us a little preview on these numbers of expecting reopening this year? Chad Richison : Yes, so we opened up Milwaukee so far this year. I did announce at least fourth quarter maybe third quarter of last year that we were very focused on improving the gap in between what we actually sell and what our total new business sales capacity is, we\u2019re very focused on that, that said. We did open up Milwaukee we do expect to announce more office openings this year and we\u2019ll do that when it makes sales force. Alex Toone : Great and could you comment on the sales office productivity on the per-rep basis this quarter, at both you and existing sales offices and how they\u2019ve been trending? Was it sort of inline or above your expectations? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean I think that our sales groups have been doing very well. I think that\u2019s evident by the numbers that are reflected in the first quarter and so, we\u2019re off to a very good start. We have continued to increase sales productivity especially within the matured office and the strategies continue to work for us. Alex Toone : Great and lastly, just one for Craig. I\u2019m looking at your sort of adjusted EBITDA guide implied for Q2. I think still down year-over-year I know you mentioned higher sales and marketing and R&D expense but are there any sort of other one-time expenses that we should we aware of? Craig Boelte : Not, as it relates to Q2. No, we just call those two items out the sales and marketing and R&D. Alex Toone : Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks guys, congrats. Operator : Your next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is open. John DiFucci : Thank you. I\u2019d like to ask question Craig on the adjusted EBITDA guidance for the quarter two, it\u2019s a lower margin then it has been in the last couple of years in the second quarter and you mentioned R&D and sales and marketing, but maybe you can just a little bit especially in the R&D side. What is that you\u2019re going to be investing incrementally and what I looked at it too, when you give the guidance for the year it actually looks like you did increase the adjusted EBITDA for the year and you also, I think increased the margin a little bit too. So I assume we\u2019re just going to see increased leverage going forward even though you have this upfront investment. Chad Richison : I mean, there\u2019s definitely some timing to it John. I would say sales and marketing, anytime we have increased sales and marketing I mean that corresponds to sales performance because as a reminder we do pay commissions in the month that a deal starts. Even though we may not have received full billing for that quarter and so we do pay out full commissions and I\u2019ll also remind that I mean with this guidance that we put out there. I mean we\u2019re 30% revenue growth and 20% adjusted EBITDA. If we were to go back and adjust the pull forward that we experienced in 2015 that we are very open about, the $10 million in the ANRR pull forward and the associated commission rate on that, which we pegged at about $3.5 million to $3.6 million. Our adjusted EBITDA from last year, we\u2019re actually guiding ahead of our adjusted EBITDA finish for all of last year and so, I do think there is some of this it\u2019s a timing issue as it falls into second quarter with our expectations for both sales and R&D, but as with our guidance would suggest we\u2019re setting up for a strong both growth year [ph] as well as some adjusted EBITDA expansion. John DiFucci : Okay, Chad, thank you for that clarification. And as far as on the R&D side though, increased R&D should we expect to see perhaps more modules on the, is that what we\u2019re - you\u2019re talking about here? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean if you\u2019re one of our clients, you\u2019re definitely going to see more product coming out. I mean, we do continue to go deep into the current products as well as expand them. We do publish the software updates monthly as far as what we\u2019re specifically working on, I mean like in the past. I mean we operate in a very competitive environment and we don\u2019t want to provide a roadmap to our competitors as far as what we\u2019re focusing on, but we also believe that our R&D efforts drove our top line results and we feel like this quarter was a good example of that. John DiFucci : Okay, great and if I might, Chad on the office opening I know you get that question a lot. I get a lot too. But I guess can you tell us the about how long it takes for an office to sort of let it stride and become I\u2019ll say, full capacity because I don\u2019t like the term mature. Is it about what it used to be a couple of years or is it taking a little longer or how\u2019s that thing developing? Chad Richison : It is still 24 months for an office to reach you say capacity, we\u2019ve been using the term mature but you\u2019re right they continue to mature past that. That\u2019s a must entry point to which they are fully staffed and maybe that\u2019s a better term. But within 24-month period you would expect an office to be fully staffed. They can\u2019t start off with the full staff with the way we bring people on and develop them. It takes time and so that is still the same timeline and that it takes 24 months. John DiFucci : Okay great and thanks for all the clarifications and really nice job. Thanks. Chad Richison : Thanks, john. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Trevor Upton : This is Trevor Upton for Brent. Thanks so much for taking our questions. Just another follow-up on the EBITDA guide. On sales and marketing, can you help us walk us through how much of that is kind of sales on performance you\u2019ve seen so far in the quarter versus increased marketing efforts or if there is something else driving that higher for Q2? Chad Richison : Well for Q2 I would say the largest impact that we have on our expense lines going to sales commission, when you look at the sales and marketing line that\u2019s the most I would volatile piece of it and as a reminder, I mean on something that comes in that we might billed $10,000 on, in the last month of Q2 we might add corresponding three times that in order to get that business and so, now that would be probably be reflected in Q2 as well. And then we also, we\u2019re continuing to hire in our R&D staff as well. Trevor Upton : Okay, great. Thank you and then quick one on the competitive landscape, one of our mid-market periods announced kind of they moved out market little bit more aggressively. Just sort of high level, have you seen any change in the competitive environment or your win rates in the quarter? That\u2019s all I have. Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes, we don\u2019t talk about win rates, but what I will say is that the competitive landscape as we see it, has remainder substantially the same for a long period of time for us in the mid market. As far as the players that we see. Trevor Upton : Good. Thank you. Chad Richison : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Hynes with Canaccord. David Hynes : Just two quick question around the go-to-market strategy or I guess tactics. Craig, can you give us a color on kind of what level of quota you have in terms of coverage of your internal bookings targets? And then I guess my second it relates to the office starts. I think in your 10-K, you alluded a goal of 10 to 14 new offices over the course of \u201817 and \u201818 any changes to that plan or is that still feel like pretty realistic expectation? Chad Richison : I\u2019ll take the latter question. I might have to, have you repeat the first one because I\u2019m not so sure I tracked you on that. David Hynes : Sure. Chad Richison : As far as the latter, we\u2019re not making any changes to the goal that we established last year and what we would see in office openings over the same period of time. Your first question almost felt like it was, what\u2019s our quota and how close are we to achieving it? Did it hit that? David Hynes : It was more around kind of capacity, in other words quota to bookings targets. What level of achievement do you need to get to for you to hit kind of bookings targets that would then roll forward into \u201818 growth? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean it\u2019s important for us to continue to bridge that gap and then the more we bridge the gap we would expect the new business sales capacity to grow as well as you have maturing offices that also impacts that. And so we\u2019re very focused on catching that up and again I\u2019ll just point to the first quarter numbers as well as our guidance. I feel like we\u2019re having success in bridging that gap. David Hynes : Yes, no doubt. Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Marcon from RW Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon your line is open. Your next question comes from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Your line is open. Ken Wang : This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Thanks for taking my questions. So just first off, just wondering are you seeing any change in the hiring environment for sales people. Any color on whether it\u2019s becoming more challenging, less challenging? Chad Richison : Well as a reminder, we look for people that don\u2019t necessarily have sales experience and we do not hire people that have sales experience from within our industry. So we are still a hire and development group from a sales organization that being the case. Often times, this is somebody\u2019s first sales job when they come to Paycom and so for us, we haven\u2019t seen any changes in that. Ken Wang : Thanks and any update in the annualized revenue opportunity for employee at a customer and can you comment on any change in thinking about your long-term target for that figure. Chad Richison : Yes and so we\u2019ve continued to talk about it as an amount in excess of $400 annualized per employee and we have not given any updates to that since we last updated that number and what I\u2019m going to say, end of 2014 potentially. Ken Wang : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Craig I think it was on the last call, you talked about the potential contribution from higher interest rates. You can maybe walk us through what the opportunity is here, over the course of the year. Craig Boelte : Sure. We gave the average daily balance for the first quarter at about $840 million obviously if they continue to raise rates, the contribution would be somewhere around $2 million annualized and that\u2019s a pre-tax number so and I\u2019d like to point out, if they do raise rates by 25 basis points, we obviously don\u2019t achieve that first day it\u2019s kind of factored in overtime and as I move that closer to that 25 basis points, most of ours is you know invested in overnight time investments. Brad Reback : And just to be clear, I\u2019m assuming that your guidance doesn\u2019t include that, so that would be potential upside. Craig Boelte : Yes, that would be potential upside. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Marcon with RW Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Can you talk a little bit about what you ended up seeing in terms of the impact from the filings in this quarter\u2019s results, just was it up materially relative to a year ago. Chad Richison : I mean, I would say the filings followed what we expected them to follow. It\u2019s the number of employees you have at the end of the year that we\u2019ve done or the number of clients and corresponded the number of employees that we have done the ACA4, Advanced ACA service for the entire year and then the forms that we file in the first quarter and so I would say those were about what we had expected. Mark Marcon : Okay, was there any uptick Chad in terms of the percentage of clients that were using you for the ACA this year relative to last year? Hello? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen. This is the operator. I apologize, but there will be a slight delay in today\u2019s conference. Please hold and the conference will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience. [Operator Instructions] you have a question from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan : Well thank you very much and congratulations from me as well. two questions just on the margins as you talk about Q2, Chad I think you said something about the timing of sales could impact the called the sales and marketing cost relative to revenue and I wondered if you were trying to suggest, there was any different linearity in the second quarter, in your mind? Chad Richison : Yes, so it\u2019s the timing of starts that impact that\u2019s the largest impact. So sell those throughout the year and then when they start and after they\u2019ve run a full month, then we commission those. We do actually recognize the commission within the first full month, that a deal starts as well and so that\u2019s the largest impact that we have on the sales and marketing line as far as the volatility in that number, is the achievement of sales starts during that quarter. Ross MacMillan : Okay, so is there something implied in Q2 in terms of start dates or I guess what I\u2019m really asking you is that [technical difficulty]? Chad Richison : No we weren\u2019t trying to imply anything in Q2 start dates. Ross MacMillan : Okay and then related to the - yes, thank you. And related to this just on the full year margin guidance when I look at incremental margins, I think you\u2019re still guiding to a lower incremental margin on a revenue dollar than we\u2019ve seen in either of last two years. And I just wondered if there was anything in particular that you thought might drive that this year in terms of investment areas or different revenue composition or anything else. Thank you. Chad Richison : Well I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re talking about incremental from Q1 to Q2. I mean are you talking about incremental margin, are you talking about from Q1 to Q2. Ross MacMillan : No more about full year 2017 versus what we saw in terms of incremental margins full year 2016 and full year 2015. Craig Boelte : No Ross. It\u2019s really nothing that we haven\u2019t really already pointed to. The R&D on the full year as we mentioned in the prepared remarks are going to track closer to those levels, that we\u2019re in Q3 and Q4 and then also you know the sales and marketing, we would expect hire as well. Ross MacMillan : Thank you very much congratulations. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan MacDonald with Wunderlich Securities. Ryan MacDonald : Just starting one more question, I guess on the sort of sales of this. When you look at sort of the decision of opening in Milwaukee it seems like and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it seems like this is sort of your new region that you\u2019re entering with that expansion. Is there any shift and focus towards going forward towards moving into new regions or versus expanding again into existing cities that you\u2019re already active in? Chad Richison : No, I mean we do both I believe over the last couple of years. We focused on Ohio that was a place that we really didn\u2019t have an office and we have opened up both in Cleveland and Cincinnati over the two-year period of time, we do not have an office in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is a fairly large state, you have quite a few employers in that state and so we thought it was time to focus on Wisconsin as well as that\u2019s what the Milwaukee move was. Ryan MacDonald : Got it and then just touching on sort of initial customer adoption. I think the last time you gave us an update in terms of adoption of modules at the point of sale, I think you were saying that new customers adopting roughly half of the available 26 modules. Any update to that number or any sort of increased progress there. Chad Richison : Yes and so, you know from as new clients come on, we have stated that they do continue to adopt greater than half of the products that we have at the time and that is still the case today and we haven\u2019t updated that number to be more specific than that. Ryan MacDonald : Got it, all right thanks congrats again on the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Marcon with RW Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Got cut off last time. Chad Richison : Well I\u2019m sorry about that. Mark Marcon : It\u2019s okay, I didn\u2019t hear. Whether or not the penetration of ACA was a little bit greater this time relative to last year? Chad Richison : It would have been consistent. Most every deal that we sell that we onboard that is eligible or required to track ACA, takes our ACA module. I think it would be extremely rare to see someone that didn\u2019t and so of course in 2015 about the last two quarters or especially the very last quarter, we had a huge surge in those clients that very quickly onboarded onto our ACA module as well as those clients that started early, we mentioned $10 million go forward and the associated commissions associated with that into the fourth quarter of 2015. Then throughout 2016 as people onboarded onto our system as new clients, the ACA module they definitely adopted with that and we saw the same in 2017 thus far. Mark Marcon : Great and then, can you just talk about the strength that you experienced this past quarter with regards to the areas that kind of outperformed in terms of your sales expectations. Where there any specific regions, verticals and anything that really stood out or is it just really broad based? Chad Richison : I mean it was broad based, we\u2019re very focused on our message to both our clients and our perspective clients. I think we\u2019ve gotten better at that and I think that continues to be reflected in our numbers. Mark Marcon : Great and then lastly, can you just talk about the strength that you mentioned or one of the reasons for selection would that last large client that you mentioned in your prepared remarks specifically the aspects that ended up winning the deal for you and you mentioned having some onsite service, can you talk a little bit more about that? Chad Richison : I can\u2019t with any great detail, not that I\u2019m unwilling but I\u2019m not as close to that very specific situation as far as the strong onset presence. What I will explain though, as in Paycom\u2019s implementation process not only are our sales people held responsible by being out onsite of the client, we also have a very strong transition rec [ph] group, which does a lot [ph] and not only help clients onboard onto our systems but it\u2019s also there to help train other clients as well as foster the usage at the employee level, the client employee level and so I would imagine all of that would have been good reason for this client to choose us or one of them, one of the reasons for this clients to choose us. Mark Marcon : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Abhey Lamba : So if you look at the upside in this quarter, was it all from the annual forms that was filed in the quarter was there upside from the monthly recurring revenue as well, can you quantify that? Chad Richison : No I mean I would say we had, I mean we definitely had a strong new business onboard in the first quarter and I think that\u2019s reflected as you\u2019ve gone throughout, as you see the numbers that we\u2019ve adjusted when we look at our guidance for full year guidance. Our ACA forms did what we expected them to do, I mean our forms business does what we expect it to do. This was our second year to have the ACA forms business include again and so it made for a little bit tougher comp because last year was our first full ACA forms filing quarter for the year prior. And so but I just think it was a healthy quarter for us. Abhey Lamba : Got it and then you [indiscernible] to ACA related forms 5% of revenue or is there any change since last time? Chad Richison : Yes, we\u2019ve not made any update to that and that approximate amount of 5%, would be still treat today. Abhey Lamba : All right, thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to CEO, Chad Richison. Chad Richison : All right, thank you to everyone joining us for the call today. We appreciate the time and interest in Paycom. We look forward to meeting with you guys at the Jefferies Technology Group Investor Conference on May 9 in Miami as well as the JP Morgan Technology Media and Teleconference on May 23rd in Boston.",

A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today, which is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig. Welcome to everyone joining us on the call today. I\u2019ll start with some comments on the quarter and our view into the industry, and then Craig will speak to our financials and guidance, then we\u2019ll take some questions. Our second quarter results reflect ongoing momentum. Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $98.2 million, representing growth of 33% over the comparable prior year period. This performance is particularly impressive when you consider that we grew 51% in the comparable prior year quarter. We are proud of our first half results as we continue to post very healthy growth, even in the face of challenging prior year comps. As the guidance provided in our press release implies, we anticipate we will continue to deliver robust growth throughout the year, even as we will be lapping our first full year of ACA related revenue. HR leaders and executive management within every industry across the country are becoming increasingly aware of how to utilize technology-driven human capital management or HCM solutions to solve problems and gain efficiencies in their business. At the same time, workers are becoming more reliant upon technology and increasingly expect their employers to keep pace by offering powerful yet easy to use software for their HR needs. Executives are continuing to turn to advanced HCM functionality to gain a competitive advantage and also attract and retain talent. This trend is demonstrated by our growth. Additionally, we believe that Paycom is well-positioned to benefit from these trends. We believe our single database solution that allows employees to input and manage their own data is the best option for companies looking to streamline processes and realize the benefits of having their HCM functionality reside within a single database. We recently conducted a survey of HR professionals in conjunction with HR.com, that provides insight into how companies are utilizing HCM technology across their organizations. Our finding showed that approximately 87% of HR executives agreed that self-service technology is the most efficient way to provide employees with HR information. For companies with over 500 employees, this figure was 94%. Additionally, easy to use and single log on capability were amongst the most important aspects of HCM technology. Even with this growing focus on HCM technology, our survey found that in nearly half of the organizations with self-service capabilities, HR departments still manually enter on average 38% of their employees\u2019 data, indicating significant room for improvement. These survey results echo what we hear from our prospective clients. We believe that we\u2019re still in the early stages of a multiyear secular trend of companies, turning to HR technology to help them succeed and that Paycom is in a favorable position to benefit from this shift and achieve sustainable growth for many years to come. To support this growth, we continue to execute on our strategy to expand our sales organization. In June, we opened our Richmond office and in July, we announced our new office in Long Island. These offices along with our Milwaukee office, which launched in April, increased our total number of sales teams to 45. All of our newer offices are developing in line with our plans, and we\u2019re pleased with their progress. This more staggered cadence of office openings in 2017 is allowing us to focus more on developing our talent and minimize the disruption that occurs when we open new offices. At Paycom, growth is a key goal. With our market share still in the low single digits, we believe there remains a significant opportunity to win substantial new business, and we\u2019re hyper-focused on achieving this goal. While we remain committed to growth, we\u2019re also mindful of continuing to improve our profitability along the way. Our current full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $122.5 million to a $124.5 million or 29% at the midpoint, exhibits continued improvement over the guidance we provided last quarter and also at the beginning of the year. This performance underscores our ability to both leverage our topline growth and also improve our own internal processes to drive efficiencies. Our profitable cash generative business model also allows us to return capital to stockholders. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 460,000 shares as part of our $50 million share repurchase plan, including 235,000 shares in the open market purchases. As a reminder, this is our second $50 million repurchase plan in the past 13 months as we completed our first $50 million share repurchase plan in December. Before I turn the call over to Craig for an update on our financials and guidance, I want to highlight our recent sponsorship of the Jim Thorpe Award which is presented annually at the defensive back in college football, and will be named the Paycom Jim Thorpe Award, going forward. For those not familiar with Jim Thorpe, he was born and raised here in Oklahoma and was named the greatest athlete of the 20th century by ABC Sports. He played professional baseball, basketball and football and also won Olympic gold in the decathlon and pentathlon. Jim Thorpe exhibited many of the qualities we value highly at Paycom such as grit, versatility, perseverance and team work; and we\u2019re proud to have the Paycom name associated with such a prestigious award. Now, I\u2019ll let Craig comment on our financial performance for the quarter. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our second quarter results and also our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2017, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that also reflects the adjustment for non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is further adjusted for the effective income taxes. Reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures discussed today are included in the earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. As Chad mentioned, we experienced a strong second quarter with total revenues of $98.2 million, representing year-over-year growth of 33% from the comparable prior year period. Our revenue was primarily driven by strong new business wins, and we are pleased with our performance in light of the tough comps from 2016. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $96.4 million for the second quarter of 2017, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 33% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $81.6 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 83%. For the full year 2017, we continue to anticipate that our adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 82% to 84%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $58.6 million for the quarter as compared to $43 million in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2017 was $32.5 million. Adjusted R&D was $7.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. We made substantial progress in building out our R&D organization over the past several quarters. We will continue to invest in R&D. We anticipate adjusted R&D expense in the third quarter of 2017 will increase by approximately 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue as compared to the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $27.8 million or 28% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $22.6 million or 31% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2016. Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $14.2 million or $0.24 per diluted share, based on approximately 59 million shares versus 410.4 million or $0.18 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares a year ago. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter year-to-date 2017 was 16.1%. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2017 was $15.2 million or $0.26 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares versus $12.4 million or $0.21 per diluted share a year ago. Absent vesting events [ph] of performance shares, we expect stock-based comp to be approximately $7 million in both the third and fourth quarters of 2017. In the second quarter, we repurchased the total of approximately 30.2 million of stock under our $50 million share repurchase program including 15 million for share net downs [ph] as a result of stock awards vesting and 15.2 million in open market purchases. We look forward to continuing to return cash to our stockholders opportunistically via these open market purchases. For modeling purposes, we anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 59 million in the third quarter. Additionally, we expect our full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 22% to 24%. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $68.1 million and total debt of $34.6 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. Construction of our fourth building continues to go well and according to schedule. Cash from operations was $15.1 million for the second quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $802 million in the second quarter of 2017 which increased approximately 27% compared to the prior year period. Now, let me turn to guidance for the third quarter and full year for fiscal 2017. For the third quarter of 2017, we expect total revenues in the range of $99 million to $101 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 29% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $21 million to $23 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2017, we are raising our revenue guidance to a range of $429.5 million to $431.5 million or approximately 31% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We\u2019re also increasing our full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of a $122.5 million to a $124.5 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 29% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first questioner today is going to be Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Alex Hu : Guys, this is Alex Hu on for Michael. Thank you for taking our questions, and congrats on the strong quarter. My first question is, given the new cadence on office openings with three announced year-to-date and more to come, can you comment on how the new staggered timeline has impacted your business thus far compared to prior years, whether it\u2019s better sales productivity you\u2019re seeing in existing offices, employee retention, higher quality sales hires, et cetera? Chad Richison : So, our goal in opening the offices in a more staggered -- taking a more staggered approach, was to reduce the disruption that happens to those teams that we disrupt, anytime we open up an office. Just as a reminder, we always open up an office with current sales reps who are ready and prepared -- or excuse me, current sales managers who are ready and prepared to open up an office, and then we backfill them with sales reps who are ready to be in management from another office and then we backfill that sales rep with a sales rep, a new sales rep who\u2019s come onboard. And so, in the past that\u2019s been disruptive. And so by spreading out this disruption, over a period of time versus taking it all and often times the same week, I believe we opened up last year\u2019s offices all within the same 10-day period of time. We felt like by staggering them out we\u2019ve -- we\u2019re still able to accomplish our goal in the outer years, because these offices take 24 months for them to reach maturity. So, we feel good about that and also it\u2019s caused less disruption. We believe that\u2019s been reflected in the numbers we\u2019ve been able to onboard this quarter and in our future guidance. Alex Hu : And then, just from a sales capacity perspective. I understand that it takes about 24 months before an office is matured, but many offices do continue to ramp well past that. Just curious can you quantify or share the performance of some of the top offices currently? Specifically, how much new recurring revenue did at point typically, for let\u2019s say the top five performing offices on average, just so that we could get a flavor on what could transpire for your newer offices? Chad Richison : Sure. So, I gave out this sales capacity number of $260 million, I believe, I gave that out about this time last year. I\u2019m not going to update that today. That number was given out when we had -- would have been 42 offices, 42 sales teams. And so, you could -- somewhat for your averaging, you could have somewhat divided those 42 into the 260 to get, again what we believe our capacity was. But we\u2019re continuing to eat away of that. I\u2019m not ready to change that number yet. Something I can sure with you anecdotally is that in the past 30 days we\u2019ve achieved our highest sales week that we\u2019ve had here at Paycom, as far as new revenue that was recently sold. And so not that I\u2019m going to share every quarter, but I do think it\u2019s reflective of the decisions that we\u2019ve been making to increase ourselves productivity. And I\u2019m proud of the group and what they\u2019ve been able to accomplish in achieving this in a month that traditionally for our industry is not one of our strongest new business signings month, because it\u2019s in the summer. But again, we had our highest week and from both sales perspective and we\u2019re very proud of that accomplishment. So, I think our group\u2019s done a great job in taking the strategy and running with it. And I think, I know what we\u2019re saying is the benefit to that through these results. Alex Hu : And just one last question for Craig. Looking at your R&D guide for Q3, it suggests to us that you\u2019re continuing to invest heavily on the product side. Just curious, can you comment on some of the near-term initiatives working on specifically where are those investments going towards? Chad Richison : We don\u2019t -- and this Chad again. We haven\u2019t, I mean to your form, we haven\u2019t ever discussed items that we\u2019re working on until they\u2019ve actually been released. One other thing I will mention is, we were the top trending app on the iOS Apple Store for our employee self-service app that we put out again in earlier the month of July. So, obviously, increased R&D made an impact on that app. We do continue to work on our other products. As you guys are aware, we have a very broad product set and the more clients you have using that, the more specs you get. We do want to continue to increase the value proposition for these clients. And so, our R&D spend is directed toward that. And we are increasing R&D but we\u2019ve also been able to increase our margin as well. I mean, we\u2019ve increased our R&D anywhere from 80% to 100% each quarter of a prior year quarter. And we\u2019ve also been able to expand the margin. And that\u2019s because the R&D expenses are turning into revenue generating products that the clients are able to use. So, we\u2019re not going to be turning around here being market- high on R&D expense as it relates to a percent of overall revenue. But that\u2019s due to also strong revenue growth. But, we are going to continue to focus our efforts in our R&D department as well. Operator : And our next questioner today is going to be John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John DiFucci : I have a question for Craig first and then a follow-up for Chad. Craig, the results -- congrats, strong results, both top, bottom-lines here. But cash flow was below what we were modeling. And it looks like there was couple of things happening here. But the one that stands out is $20 million use of cash and the accrued expenses line, accrued in expenses and other liability. So, can you please explain a little bit what\u2019s happening there and should we expect this to reverse or was this quarter the reverse of a previous benefit? And I guess is that related to the big incentive compensation contribution of cash in the quarter? And you talked a little bit about in your prepared remarks that was $14 million. Craig Boelte : In terms of the cash flow and kind of what was going on in the quarter, some of that\u2019s just timing, quarter-to-quarter. We also had some tax payments that were made this quarter. We kind of do -- we had a catch-up second quarter based on the first quarter\u2019s results, so we had some additional tax payments as well in the quarter. And we\u2019ll see some benefits kind of moving forward. You saw our tax rate for the second quarter decline some as well because of the deduction related to some of that stock comp. John DiFucci : And then, Chad, great to hear the largest ever new sales week in this past month. I mean that is great to hear. And I\u2019m just trying to think big picture and that helps, but, when I look at this market and we\u2019ve realized a lot of your competitive wins are against what I\u2019ll call the incumbent HRO vendors. But it seems that part of those deals could also be, I guess Greenfield, so to speak. In other words customers, maybe are doing just payroll with the likes of ADP and then they come to Paycom, they realize, you know what, it\u2019s easy to consume this other stuff too. And I don\u2019t know if you guys break that out or if you think that way. But can you even roughly quantify how much of a new deal on average might be incremental functionality for the customer? Because we\u2019re just trying to get our arms around the addressable market, what is the real opportunity here? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, I\u2019ll try to answer that. Our value proposition, we believe is an expanded value proposition, past the competition. So, would hope that any client that comes on to our offering having less as a competitor, would experience a greater usage and have a more robust product. So, we would expect that would be the case that people that we onboard use more product. But also the late work, we\u2019re starting to see the way that there\u2019s somewhat becoming a change in a way that companies use HCM technology, and I\u2019ve said it before. Companies for employees, for 2,000-employee companies are using more technology when they buy their coffee than what they do when they\u2019re interacting with their HR department and people that work for different-size companies know that, but that\u2019s shifting. The HR departments are becoming more strategic, they\u2019re leveraging technology, they\u2019re leveraging what\u2019s in the hand of the employees. And so, I still believe we\u2019re in the early innings of that shift happening but I think we\u2019re well-positioned for that. As far as how many of our deals are Greenfield versus not. I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, greater than half of our business comes from legacy providers and everything else is a dogfight by. So, whether we\u2019re competing against a traditional provider or SaaS type provider, every deal is competitive, and we also do convert those companies that are doing it themselves. But even those situations are competitive. So, we\u2019re in a very competitive industry and I think that drives innovation that ultimately benefits all clients out there where people looking to buy this type of technology. John DiFucci : Okay. Keep that attitude, it\u2019s a dogfight. I appreciate it. thank you. Operator : And the next questioner to today is going to be Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Albert Chi : Hey, guys. This is actually Albert Chi on for Mark. Great job in the quarter, Chad and Craig, and thanks for taking my question. Chad, on previous earnings calls, you normally highlight some of the larger, notable wins that you sign in the quarter. Can you talk about some of the trends that you might be seeing at the upper end? And are there any changes that you detected in the competitive environment? And I know we ask that every quarter, but it\u2019s worth asking. Thank you. Chad Richison : Yes. No, thank Albert. I mean, I appreciate your point now that historically we\u2019ve be provided a few example -- actually not historically, I think for the first year or so after being public company, we did not provide client wins and started layering them in. And we provided those specific once, we highlighted some that we had won above our range. And we primarily did this to provide the proof points that our solution can scale and handle the needs of larger clients. We believe, we\u2019ve established that at this point. To kind of answer the next question, we did have clients both above our stated range and below our stated range. And we say this is also reflected in the numbers. But, at some point, when we keep calling out the name or the industry that a company is in and the sizing, a 5,200-employee trucking company that we took from a legacy provider, at some point, it\u2019s not that difficult for people to somewhat triangulate or for lack of a better word, reverse engineer the company that we\u2019re talking about and definitely for the person it just happened. And so, I feel like, we\u2019re kind of giving out more information than what\u2019s really valuable. And so, moving forward, we don\u2019t really feel a need to share that, other than to say that this quarter when you look at a client make-up, or the make-up of profile, client profile, the profile of the clients that we on-boarded in this quarter, we\u2019re in line with the clients that we\u2019ve on-boarded in any other quarter. Albert Chi : Just one more follow-up is, I kind of want to ask you about the acceleration of revenue growth in the quarter, especially absent tough comps. And I think we saw some of that in services. But revenue or recurring revenue also accelerated. And you also mentioned that there are decisions that you\u2019ve made to increase sales productivity. Could you kind of walk us through a little bit of about what those are and maybe what drove the strength in the quarter? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes. I don\u2019t want to get too specific on -- we do get very specific when we start talking about sales metrics and our sales strategy and how we drive productivity internally. I don\u2019t necessarily want to telegraph all that, but I will say this. We on purpose focus on reducing disruption as we open up offices. And I think our cadence in the last three years has been opening up all the offices in the first quarter. So, when you take a strategy of causing less disruption and it works, you are going to produce, you are going to produce. And so that\u2019s really what\u2019s happening for us is we\u2019re producing. And the new offices that we\u2019ve opened are doing very well as well. But, so we\u2019re proud of that and it\u2019s something we really needed to do to continue to be the type of growth company that we are. And so, I\u2019m very happy with what\u2019s going on there with the sales group. Operator : And our next questioner today is going to be Mark Marcon with Robert W Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : Wondering, if you can talk a little bit about some of your internal efforts just in terms of what you\u2019re seeing from a recruiting, training perspective, what are you seeing in terms of customer satisfaction metrics. How do you think that client retention trends over the next two to three years relative to historical levels? Chad Richison : Well, we update our client retention every year. We just updated it, was it in the February? Craig Boelte : February. Chad Richison : Okay, in the February earnings call. It has remained unchanged I believe for the last four or five years that we\u2019ve done it at 91% and so there\u2019s that -- from that standpoint. As far as retention of our own staff, I have to say it\u2019s probably been in line. I don\u2019t -- even on the sales side, I mean we\u2019ve made significant efforts over there to continue to improve productivity. We\u2019ve done that, I can\u2019t say we\u2019ve made a great impact on attrition of the new reps, and we haven\u2019t experienced more attrition from the single [ph] reps, from the executive reps data. So, as far as the training and development, I mean we\u2019re at training and development staff, I think we get speed up for hiring people with recent college graduates and over the course of 20 years, those are -- they\u2019re no longer recent college graduates, when they\u2019re out there running the different levels. And so, I don\u2019t know. I mean, we just continue to develop and train; we continue to identify areas of improvement for us whether it be through client training, client on-boarding or even our own employees and on-boarding, and we remain very focused on that. Mark Marcon : Great. I just meant with regards to the success that you\u2019ve had. I was wondering if it\u2019s changing all the profile or the types of people that are looking to join Paycom, and whether or not that\u2019s having some impact. And then, lastly, can you talk a little bit about just the capacity to implement new clients as you continue to grow rapidly anything that\u2019s occurring from that perspective that next few quarters, great, but where things may lengthen or do we think we can stick on the same metrics? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, first, I\u2019ll take the first one. I mean, I do believe it\u2019s easier for us to find people now than what it was three or four years ago, and I think that\u2019s just due to the profile and the momentum we have and that type of thing. And so, but again, the type of person that we look for and the training that we put them through, although that\u2019s all continued to expand, it falls within our current strategy. As far as on-boarding clients, I mean that\u2019s something we do. There\u2019s no such thing as an easy client transition. They\u2019re all -- they all have their complexities to it. But, it\u2019s something we wake up and do every day, so we do a lot of them. So, just like anything you do a lot of, you get better and better at it. And we continue to improve our on-boarding process. And really the key there is driving usage. At the end of the day, clients -- it\u2019s easier to get clients to buy products than to use them. And you definitely want clients to experience their overall value proposition and there\u2019re a lot of cross [ph] justifications that they have for making the purchase and really that\u2019s about using the product. And so, a lot of the initiatives that we\u2019ve that we\u2019re working on today is to get clients to use the technology that\u2019s available to them today. Operator : And our next questioner today is going to be David Hynes with Canaccord. Please go ahead. Mark Belcarz : Thanks, it\u2019s actually Mark Belcarz on for David today. Just one more on the competitive landscape. Obviously, sales execution for you guys has been going well. But, when you\u2019re out there in new deals, is there any one that you\u2019re seeing more or less of maybe this quarter than you\u2019ve seen in the past? Chad Richison : No, it\u2019s been substantially the same. Mark Belcarz : And then, just quickly on -- maybe on the numbers, cash flow, it was brought up earlier, was also little lower than what we had, and you called out the facilities build out. So, I was just wondering on CapEx, what can we expect in the back half of the year relative either to as a percent of revenue or relative to the first half? How should we think about that? Craig Boelte : Our CapEx for really the first and second quarter of this year have been very consistent on a dollar basis. We\u2019re continuing to complete the construction of the fourth building. We would expect those levels to be fairly similar on a dollar basis. And then, as we get closer to the completion of the billing, you would see CapEx increase a little. So, I mean, as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, we based those tax payments on the first quarters based on prior year. And then, when you have a strong first quarter, like we did this first quarter, you have some catch-up on that. So, in terms of the cash flow that was part of that ad I mentioned that on the earlier question. Operator : And the next questioner today is going to be Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale : So, Chad, not to get too hung up on the point that you had a record week in July, that\u2019s great, congratulations. Is there anything you would point to suggest like in terms of process or something that\u2019s actually going to be repeatable and you would be disappointed, if you don\u2019t have another record set in August or September or do you think it\u2019s more kind of great week, but let\u2019s [indiscernible] expect that\u2019s going to happen again and let\u2019s see what happens? Chad Richison : I mean, I can imagine a situation where as we continue on as a company, we\u2019re not having additional record weeks. I just think that this was somewhat timing. And the fact that it was in the summer month, I thought it was something I wanted to point out. And again, it really comes down to us being less disruptive within our model and continuing to increase productivity. I mean it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been talking about that was going to be our focus. When I talked about the $260 million new business sales capacity metric that we put out there, I said, we\u2019re going to be very focused on bridging the gap in this, so that we can expand it, but we need to have the achievement. That was our focus, that\u2019s been our focus. I think we\u2019re seeing signs of that coming to fruition. But we\u2019re not done. I mean, we\u2019re continuing to focus on that heads down, and again, continue to get a value proposition out there with as many potential clients as we can. Corey Greendale : Great. And then, just on the regulatory environment. Do you see the stop and start on ACA, has any of that filtered through to your discussions with customers effects conversations at all or is it sort of who cares, we\u2019re looking at our HCM system for different reason and we\u2019ll see what happens? Chad Richison : To your prospects, you have to have an AC, you have to go to a company that has an ACA option. If you are a client, you already have ACA option. It\u2019s for a while today, we\u2019ve talked about in the past, it\u2019s a nominal fee from our clients, it is. And when you take into consideration everything, there is the year-end homes filing. But it\u2019s an ongoing fee that they pay, I believe it\u2019s somewhat nominal. We\u2019ve talked about the overall percentage, approximate percentage of our revenue that it impacts. And so, no, I don\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on with ACA. I mean every time it comes up, I think, it\u2019s going to happen and it has. I don\u2019t think anything is going to happen overnight. I think we\u2019re going to have plenty of warning as it relates to, if there is a wind down, I think there will be a wind down. I don\u2019t think it just automatically stops right away. But I don\u2019t know, we\u2019re going to wait and see what happens. Once we get the reds, our clients can rest assured we\u2019re going to do the work that needs to be done to make sure, they stay in compliance and with whatever that might be. Corey Greendale : And then, one last quick one. Can you remind me or if you haven\u2019t disclosed, can you tell us if we look at your revenue growth that roughly the split, how much of the growth is coming from number of new customers and how much from a higher ARPU per customer? Chad Richison : No, we don\u2019t break that out, but I\u2019ve said it in the past and I wouldn\u2019t mind repeating it now. I mean, the overwhelming majority of our revenue growth comes from new client adds. Now, then those new client adds might be adding additional products to that as they come into the fold. But, I mean that\u2019s where the overwhelming majority of our revenue growth comes from. Corey Greendale : Yes. And that\u2019s growth from the fact that -- I\u2019m guessing new clients today are paying more than new clients last year just because your suite is larger now? Chad Richison : I can\u2019t confirm that that would be a -- I would have to -- no, I mean, I can\u2019t confirm that. I think that our suite\u2019s been pretty built out last year as well. Now, I\u2019ll tell you, the longer you have a product, I mean the more popular it becomes with usage. And so, I think someone might be able to surmise that there could be some of that but I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving revenue. Operator : And the next questioner of today is going to be Siti Panigrahi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Ankit [ph] for Siti Panigrahi. Could you talk about your general investment plan in R&D and if you\u2019re coming up with any new modules to drive PETY [ph] higher? Chad Richison : So, we don\u2019t -- we haven\u2019t ever disclosed any modules that we\u2019re working on or any -- that be new modules or any current modules that we\u2019re expanding usage cases for. And so, but I mean, we\u2019re investing in R&D. I mean, like I said, we\u2019ve had 80% to 100% of growth in R&D each quarter over prior year quarter, depending upon what you look at. I doubt very seriously, we\u2019ll be talking too much time from now and people are still probably saying that our R&D is low compared to others. And so, from an overall percentage of revenue, I really don\u2019t see us moving away from bottom of the pack anytime soon. But, we do have initiatives that want to continue in R&D group. That does take resources to do that. Anytime you see us adding to R&D, that\u2019s headcount. I mean, we\u2019re hiring individuals and bringing them in there, into Paycom. And we expect them to perform and produce the type of software that we\u2019re able to turn into revenue, and so which then continues to keep the R&D as an expense of revenue, somewhat in line with the trajectory we\u2019ve shown in the past. And so I would expect that to be somewhat the same but we\u2019re not going to be market high R&D as a percent of revenue compared to any of our closest SaaS peers, primarily just because it\u2019d be natural for us to make that type of investment. It\u2019s unnecessary for us with where we\u2019re sitting today. Operator : And the next questioner today is going to be Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Parthiv Varadarajan : Hi, guys. Thanks, this is Parthiv in for Abhey, congrats for the results. Can you comment on attainment during the quarter and how attainment relative to plan? And then, any directional color on quotas during the quarter would be very helpful. Chad Richison : I\u2019m sorry, comment on achievement during the quarter and how it came relative to plan? Parthiv Varadarajan : Attainment? Chad Richison : Yes, as it relates to quota? Parthiv Varadarajan : Yes. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, we don\u2019t really ever talk about what percent of quota our staff is. But I think it was a good quarter for us. When we talk about quota achievement, we\u2019d be talking about how somebody booked sales last quarter, its last quarter\u2019s book sales that returns into this quarter\u2019s new business revenue, to kind of keep that in mind. But I\u2019m very happy with what\u2019s going on with the organization. I mean, sales group does continue to increase their level of not only knowledge, but production and activity. And we\u2019re really happy with what\u2019s going on there as we sit today. Parthiv Varadarajan : And then for your current sales office base. I guess, could you give us a sense of how many of close 45 or either mid ramped or fully ramped or any high level commentary on where you expect to end up by the end of the year? Chad Richison : Yes. So let me see here. You\u2019re going to have 14 of them that are either, almost to maturity or maybe have just having hit maturity, either brand new or mid-ramp. So, I\u2019m probably going to say maybe 10 in that area you\u2019re talking about, 9 to 10 in that area you\u2019re talking about. They are still in the ramping -- either brand new or ramping phase. Operator : And the next questioner is going to be Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead. Brad Reback : Chad, building on the sales force question, how is the hiring environment out there right now? Chad Richison : I mean, I think it\u2019s been a good hiring environment. I mean, if you\u2019re looking for top talent, you\u2019re going to have to have a good strategy to get it. We go through several interviews to find the right people. But, I mean, I would say, it\u2019s been in line with the way it\u2019s been in the past. Again, I think, our profile of being a public company on the margins helped us attract certain people. And we get a lot of -- especially from the sales side, a lot of our talent comes from referrals, from our own sales people. And they\u2019re pretty good proof sources of what\u2019s possible. So, we get some there as well. So, hopefully that answers your question. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s getting any bit more difficult to find people. Brad Reback : And one other unrelated question. Last week, ADP talked about better retention, as they sort of finish up the workforce now migration. Have you seen any of that in the field or is that really that no impact? Chad Richison : No, I think, I mean ADP is the 300-pound gorilla. I mean, I think we continue to gain the business that we look to gain. And I still see that momentum continuing. I don\u2019t -- I would be close enough to their overall retention numbers to be able to comment on that. Operator : This will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Chad Richison for his closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. And we appreciate your time and interest in Paycom. We look forward to meeting with investors at the Canaccord conference on August 9th in Boston and also on the road this quarter. Thanks to all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded. Thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. And you may now disconnect your lines.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig Boelte, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Craig Boelte : Thank you and good afternoon. Before we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts including those regarding our future plans, objectives and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. While we believe any forward-looking statements we have made are reasonable, actual results could differ materially because the statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. You should refer to and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking information. Any forward-looking statement speak only as of the date on which it was made and we do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by applicable law. Also during the course of today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today, which is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks Craig and thank you to everyone joining our call to review our third quarter 2017 results. As with the prior calls, I will start with a brief review of our results and then provide some comments on the payroll and human capital management or HCM market and recent developments. Craig will speak to our financials and guidance, and then we\u2019ll open up the line for Q&A. Our third quarter results were solid with revenue coming in at $101.3 million representing growth of 31% over the comparable prior year period. Our commitment to client success continues to fuel our progress at Paycom. This drive combined with our powerful single-database solution allows us to attract new clients as our reputation for providing the best option for business continues to grow. Our success was recognized in September when we placed second on the Fortune Magazine\u2019s 100 fastest-growing companies list of publicly traded companies for 2017. Each companies ranked on the list was determined based on three areas of performance over a three year period; average revenue growth, average increase in earnings per share and total stock return. We believe this recognition underscores the fact that Paycom is one of a very small number of public companies that is achieving not just the role of 40 but the role of 60. When you look at the combination of our revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin, we are very proud of this achievement. Our profitable business model continues to allow us to return value to our shareholders. We recently completed our second $50 million stock repurchase plan. And today I\u2019m pleased to announce that our board has reloaded and increased our plan to allow us to repurchase an additional $75 million of common stock. We are able to achieve these results by remaining focused on providing the best possible user experience. With this goal in mind, we continue to enhance our value proposition in October by creating our own content and releasing 10 learning courses to clients who have our Learning Management System or LMS module. These courses were designed and built internally at Paycom and the feedback we have received from clients regarding our proprietary content has been tremendous. These courses are built into our LMS module enabling employers to educate their managers and employees quickly, easily and consistently on topics like workplace violence, preventing discrimination and harassment, workplace ethics, hiring practices, lawful separations and more. We look forward to delivering even more content to our LMS clients and believe offering these courses will help drive further adoption of this module. Additionally, with Paycom\u2019s November release, our mileage tracker capability will now be available in our native mobile app. This significant upgrade to our expense management module allows our clients\u2019 employees to easily calculate mileage reimbursement for work related activities. That then automatically populate Paycom\u2019s expense management module. Employers can now track mileage more accurately, which will help them eliminate profit leaks within their organization. For instance, without this functionality an employee might travel 22.1 miles, but actually fill out an expense report reflecting 25 miles. With mileage trackers specific miles are tracked accurately. On a trip of one current employee where 2.9 miles were rounded up, the Company will now save over a $1.50 on that one trip for just that one employee. This is based on the federal reimbursement rate of $0.535 per mile. As this is extrapolated out to include all reimbursable travel mileage for employees, the savings can be into the tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars for any one company. On the marketing side, I\u2019m pleased to highlight that toward the end of the third quarter we launched our first national television advertising campaign within accompanying digital strategy. The ad supports our overall value proposition of using one system with a very simple tagline. Paycom does more. We have been monitoring several indicators of brand awareness growth to evaluate to success of this campaign and are pleased with the early returns we are seeing. You can view the ad at our website paycom.com. I want to make a brief mention of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. We have a significant presence in the affected areas with two offices in Florida and five in Texas. We evacuated both our Florida offices and even asked our personnel to evacuate the state during the storm. Our offices in Texas experienced disruption as well with two complete evacuations in Houston and Austin. We had all of our offices back up and running as quickly as possible. And I want to thank people on the ground in those areas as well as our teams in Oklahoma City for making sure the impact was as minimal as possible both for our employees and for our clients. As of today, all of the Paycom sales offices are fully operational. Our final point to be understood is that while we experience some disruption to our prospecting and conversion efforts in the affected areas at no time where any clients payrolls impacted by these events. This wasn't our first hurricane experience and that was evident in our preparations before and service during these events. Before I turn the call over to Craig for an update on our financials and our guidance, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank William Kerber, our long time CIO for his many years of service and invaluable contributions to helping Paycom grow and to the success it is today. I have known William for many years and we continue our friendship even as this chapter working together is closed. Regarding our software development and IT efforts, we have a very solid team with the deep bench in place that will continue to ensure that we remain on the cutting edge of HCM and are able to provide the best solution to our clients and perspective clients. Now, I\u2019ll let Craig comment on our financial performance for the quarter. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our third quarter results and also our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that also reflects adjustment for non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is further adjusted for the effective income taxes. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures discussed today are included in the earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. As Chad mentioned, we had good results in the third quarter with total revenues of 101.3 million, representing year-over-year growth of 31% from the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins, and we are pleased with our continued performance over the comparable growth we saw in 2016. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was 99.5 million for the third quarter of 2017, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 31% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was 85 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84%. For the full year 2017, we anticipate that our adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 83% to 84%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were 59.3 million for the quarter as compared to 49.1 million in the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2017 was 33.5 million. Adjusted R&D was 7.4 million in the third quarter of 2017 or 7.3% of total revenues. Although, we capitalized a higher percentage of total R&D costs this quarter, we anticipate going forward our capitalize R&D costs will be in line with our historical capitalization rate of approximately 29% to 32% that we may see fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. Total adjusted R&D costs including the capitalize portion were 10.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, compared to 7.6 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was 30.7 million or 30.3% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2017, compared to 18.2 million or 23.5% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2016. Our GAAP net income for the third quarter was $14.1 million or $0.24 per diluted share, based on approximately 59 million shares versus 6.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares a year ago. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter year-to-date 2017 was 8.3%. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2017 was $17 million or $0.29 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares versus $9 million or $0.15 per diluted share a year ago. We expect stock-based comp to be approximately $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the second quarter, we repurchased a total of approximately $17.3 million of stock under our $50 million share repurchase plan. As Chad mentioned, we are pleased to announce our $75 million repurchase plan and look forward to continuing to return cash to our stockholders opportunistically via open market purchases. For modeling purposes, we anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 59 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $66.6 million and total debt of $34.4 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. Construction of our fourth building continues to go well and according to schedule. Cash from operations was $37.1 million for the third quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $740 million in the third quarter of 2017. Now, let me turn to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year for fiscal 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect total revenues in the range of $111.5 million to $113.5 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $26 million to $28 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 24% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2017, we are increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $430.5 million to $432.5 million or approximately 31% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We\u2019re increasing our full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of a $131 million to a $133 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 31% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Just quick questions from me. Chad, the impact on the hurricane does that -- I mean I know it will disrupt some of the sales cycles. Could that impact some of the revenue as well as you see in Q3 Q4? Or is it just really like a week or two on the sales cycles that you are missing? Chad Richison : It depends on the office. We had some offices that were inaccessible for a longer period of time. Other offices won't necessarily as inaccessible. We just had to get people back into the areas where there wasn't a lot of gasoline and different things. And so -- and then even had other places where potentially -- not potentially, but you actually had prospective clients that where in other areas where they weren't specifically in the path of the hurricane, but they had assets in those areas. The people we sell to and the people we work with on conversion are the same people that work on asset protection when you talk about employees and what have you. And so, there was some minor disruption I would say. This is nothing that from a Paycom perspective. I believe it\u2019s just a period in time that it\u2019s impacted us. And again specifically as it relates to certain prospecting efforts and some conversions as well, but if we didn't -- I can't say that we had deals that were set to start and they're not going to start. Many of them are coming in already. So it's just a situational depending upon the client in their own situation of impact in those areas. Raimo Lenschow : And then Craig, you like on the beat on EBITDA this quarter a lot of that came from sales and marketing. Is there anything you can help us like look in as a devil's advocate, I would say like the new ARR sales force weak and hence there's no commission or lower commission payment, but maybe I'm kind of right or wrong there. Can you just help us understand what kind of drill that outside? Thank you. Chad Richison : So, this is Chad. We definitely did have some deals that pushed in out of that quarter that were ready to start and they pushed out of that quarter. You have the Houston piece and then the Florida. So, I mean there's some of that there, and there's also if you think back, last year we opened up six offices and we not only that we opened them all up in the beginning of the year, and we talked about how it takes 14 months for reps to become executive reps and productive, and it takes 24 months for an office to become mature. So last year, we had six offices with twice or more because again as you're heading into the third quarter, you would have had additional reps hired in those offices. So, we were carrying more reps last year that weren't selling as much because they're newer. This year, we opened up three offices and we didn't open them up at the 1st of the year, we actually opened them up later. And so, they actually have less non-productive reps. You have a little bit of that and then you have a little bit of some of the hurricane. And the other thing is our sales and marketing just doesn't include sales commissions and sales salaries. You also have marketing in there and we gained some efficiencies also in that area. Operator : And the next questioner will be Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Nemeroff : I want to piggyback on the hurricane as first of all I hope all of your employees are safe. But Chad can you maybe quantify the impact on revenues and the bookings in Q3? And maybe what you're -- if there is an impact in Q4, what if we could quantify that? And are you still seeing any lasting impact on new bookings in the affected areas? Craig Boelte : So, I'll take your last question first. I am sure there are still some prospects and clients they're dealing with the effects of the hurricane. And so, there would some of that now that a meaningful impact on us. As I say here today, I would not think so. And then, but when you're talking about, so that's for prospecting efforts as we sit here today. Now when you're talking about the week or week and half leading up to some of these and the time during and then getting people back into our office, and we evacuate an office, we evacuate the office, it\u2019s not just people. There\u2019s data, there\u2019s paper, there\u2019s file. I mean there\u2019s a lot to that. And then, you got to get everybody back in those locations and hurricane is something that you do rather quickly. And so, the other answer to your question is the specific analysis of that, I think for myself I feel like those deals are good and they are going to start and we are seeing them start and many of them have. So I do see this is more of an impact from a certain point. Obviously, if you had a prospecting impact that can last a little bit longer for you into the subsequent amount a bit, I mean I believe that we're -- we\u2019ve weathered this well. I don\u2019t feel like this is going to have any impact on 2018 at all, and I think as the time goes on throughout this quarter, it\u2019s going to have a less and less of an impact and\u2026 Michael Nemeroff : That\u2019s helpful, Chad. I mean asked another way. Do you think that your Q4 guidance on revenue was impacted by the hurricane? Chad Richison : Well, like I said I mean, there is definitely -- if you start deals in -- if deals are scheduled to start in September and/or scheduled to start even in mid August or even in the beginning of August and you push those past first quarter. That\u2019s going to impact first quarter because you could have potentially received a 100% of the revenue billing in fourth quarter. And you received -- and you might only receive two-thirds of the expectation there. But that\u2019s baked in -- those thoughts of ours are baked in to our Q4 guidance right now. Craig Boelte : And I think Chad said first quarter. I think he meant the first month\u2026 Chad Richison : Not the first quarter I meant\u2026 Craig Boelte : I meant the first month of the fourth quarter. Chad Richison : That\u2019s right. Michael Nemeroff : Right, alright. Just one for Craig, if I many. I am just piggybacking on Raimo's question. Your prior long-term target operating model has adjusted EBITDA at 30% to 33% and your guide this year already implies at the lower end of this range. So how should we view the margin profile in the medium to long-term going forward? Thanks. That\u2019s it. Craig Boelte : Yes, I mean we increased our adjusted EBITDA long-term model to the 30% to 33%, I think middle of last year and we\u2019re already starting to hit that moving forward. I think the one thing that will have some impact on that moving forward is going to be 606. We are still evaluating 606. And we don\u2019t foresee a big impact on the revenue side, but we do foresee an impact on the adjusted EBITDA side on there. So, we\u2019re really focused on being a high growth company. So not including 606 that\u2019s -- the adjusted EBITDA is not something we\u2019re necessarily super focused on. We are focused on the growth and we are going to spend accordingly and hope to have some margin expansion along the way. Operator : And the next questioner will be going to be John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John DiFucci : So I think you\u2019ve hit the natural disaster stuffs pretty well. But I guess one of the things we noticed in our model here, Chad and Craig, is that you\u2019ve shown significant sales and marketing leverage not only this year but in last year too. And you mentioned the national TV ad campaign. I guess should we start to see that not show as much leverage going forward? Or should we continue to see some of that? Chad Richison : Yes, leverage on the sales marketing side. I mean our advertising campaign was at the very -- I don't even know, much of that it was even in started. We have to look at that. But it was we launched toward the very end of third quarter. And I think if you look at us at quarter-to-quarter, it really just kind of depends on how many nonproductive -- it kind of ebbs and flows. And it depends on how many nonproductive reps we\u2019re carrying. It depends on whether or not a newer rep sold a deal when which they get half the commission of an executive rep, there\u2019s many factors that can go into any quarter. And that\u2019s just on the commission salary side for sales people. You know we also had -- we promoted more regional managers last than we did this year. I mean there\u2019s other factors that factor into that and then also you have the marketing expense, people made mention that we wanted HR tech this year, if you get HR tech, that\u2019s pretty expensive. I mean it costs us I think $80,000 just to ship our -- the ship and set up our -- much less everything else. And so we\u2019ve gained expenses in the sales and marketing in other areas. Is that going to continue? I mean, there\u2019s going to be months where, it\u2019s not specifically that way depending upon when deal start and work with somebody\u2019s commission rates are on that. Craig, I don\u2019t know if you add anything on that. Craig Boelte : No, I would agree with that. I mean, on the marketing side, there are certain events that we've attained one year and maybe not the next. So when -- we\u2019re probably not going to see in terms of like HR tech and those type of things. Those aren\u2019t going to increase to same level as our revenue rate. So you would know from quarter to quarter see some ups and downs in those. Operator : And our next questioner will be Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Mark Murphy : Yes, thank you very much. And I\u2019ll add my congrats on the results. Chad, so I wanted to ask you did anything in the Ackman slide deck regarding ADP standout to you, anything in there that you think further illustrates the industry backdrop? And just whether you think there assessment of the landscape and the technology in there is accurate or not? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean I don\u2019t really think it's fair for me to comment on that situation. I do think that there\u2019s a lot of information out there. I think a lot of the information that was pulled was information that was already out there and well known. And so, we don\u2019t really have a dog in that hunt. So, I'll let ADP enactment comment on that. Mark Murphy : Okay. So over the summer you conducted a survey based on our professionals, and I think you published some of those results. It kind of touched self-service trends like single log-in and data entry and so on and so forth. What do you think we should take away from the findings? Was there anything in there that surprised you? Chad Richison : Well, I think it\u2019s what surprises me. And I know that it surprised me, but it was very confirming and that is that people are still using businesses. They\u2019re still using HCM in all the way. I mean there\u2019s new technology available. There\u2019s new devices available, a perfect example of that is our mileage tracker. I mentioned that it\u2019s in our app. You push start, it tracks. It\u2019ll even tell you the best way to get to a location. It tracks the specific drive you take. And again that\u2019s recorded right back into the system. And it becomes part of the expense management or if your rep who are some in the travels and he don\u2019t receive direct reimbursement for the Company, but it\u2019s something that you track for tax purposes. It does that as well. And so that\u2019s something that wouldn\u2019t have been available in the past and today it is. And that\u2019s something that employees have access to, and we expect that to drive adoption and usage of our -- not just employees self-service that specifically that expense management module. And the same goes for LMS training. And so, I think that remain is what I notice most about it, it\u2019s confirming there still a huge opportunity to shift the way business is used HCM products and specifically their employees. Mark Murphy : Okay. The next one I wanted to touch on the course content. I think you mentioned you launched 10 courses. Can you just help us understand at a high level? Why did you decides to begin developing content and how material do you think that revenue steam could become for Paycom? Chad Richison : Well, this first group, the first step piece of content is included within our LMS module. And so if there is client using LMS today, they just receive 10 courses of value in their content which we do believe is going to increase usage and drive additional adoption of that. Training is not something new. People have been training people since the stone tablets. And so training is not anything that\u2019s new. But again that\u2019s another area where maybe people in the enterprise level have started training people this way. And now it\u2019s making, its way to the mid-market. And so, there is also a piece we have to train people on how to train and go through that process. And so, we created the distribution module of LMS that allows us to update LMS courses. And then, it\u2019s not just the courses that they\u2019re taking, it\u2019s also we measure retention of the information that the training that they enter. So for us, I do believe that something that can be learning management is a very important thing for any organization. We are a very large user of our own system and I think were thousands of courses in our own system that we used internally here at Paycom to manage our own business. And so I see that\u2019s been a future catalyst for LMS for sure. And potential revenue driver, it will be in the future a revenue driver as we release more courses. Operator : And the next questioner will be Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead. Brad Reback : Chad, as you sort of think about the expansion here on learning, beyond that, what type of growth do you think you can see in per employee, per month, pricing a couple of years from now on your percent basis? Chad Richison : That\u2019s hard, it\u2019s all about the value just because we come up with something it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it drives value for the client. For us, it\u2019s about the value and the ROI that we\u2019re driving for the client to be extent at least paying as a dollar. They need have an ROI of $2 plus. And so, and that\u2019s really the way we approach pricing of the products that we put out. We do have monthly releases. Here at Paycom, we're always updating the system. And 99% of that, we\u2019re not charging for. It's enhancements to our current system and sometimes we do. And that\u2019s just hard to forecast from here when we\u2019re talking to company years out. Operator : And the next questioner will be David Hynes with Canaccord. Please go ahead. David Hynes : I want to behold most questions on the LMS. Now that you guys have invested in the content, do you feel like you\u2019re going to put a more concerned effort to go back into the base with that product? Or is just really about improving a catch on new deals? Chad Richison : Well, for instance the 10 content courses we created, we created a library launching and 100% of every one of our LMS clients today now has those 10 courses in their LMS platform. And so that\u2019s already there today. Yes, it will allow us to go back in the clients and talk about how they use those courses and gain value. We have to have a focus group as we went during created these products. And we are very deliberate with this as we moved Stacy into our, that role of our Chief Learning Officer earlier this year to really go through that. And we just think that that\u2019s going to impact not just client training but also how they learn on our system and increase use of time as well. David Hynes : So, it sounds like a little of both. And I want to ask about stock-based comp as it pertains like it's a quality of earnings. I think you guys came in double where you had guided us it\u2019s a second quarter in a row what's ticked up. Just curious, if there is any change in philosophy there, if there is -- anything onetime in nature of we should be aware of? How are you thinking about that line as we build our model forward? Chad Richison : In terms of stock-based comp, what we saw in this quarter was we have certain market shares out there. And two of those hit the triggers on those and so we had some of that as well as in the second quarter. All of those have hit their triggers now and so moving forward to be some more those issued next year. We don\u2019t really guide on stock comp we did give some information that we expect fourth quarter to be in that $7 million range. David Hynes : Chad, try to give any thoughts about '18 high level framework for thinking about growth versus profits and the trade off there? Chad Richison : Well, I mean in the perfect world, there is not as much trade off on that. You can somewhat capture both and that\u2019s I think we have proven that as we continued to grow. As far as 2018 there is so much that we are doing right now, and we are going to know so much more as we turn the corner on that. So as with the years in the past we will update that with our fourth quarter announcement. Operator : And the next questioner will come from Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : I was wondering if you could just come back to some of the earlier questions. If we take a look at the Florida and Texas, what percentage of your revenue base is that? And how different are the commission runs that there or the new sales that they are seeing in those offices relative to areas that would be completely unaffected whether it's out in the Northeast or West Coast et cetera? Chad Richison : Well, I think we have 36 mature offices, we have 45, we have nine still in the maturing phase. We have 36 matured offices, this impacted four of those. It's hard to -- business doesn\u2019t all come in -- I guess it doesn\u2019t all flow, you can have a good month and the next month, it's not as well I'm talking about for anyone office that\u2019s maximize one month and then the next month they are doing more prospecting what have you. And so that\u2019s really hard to say, but these all our successful office of course they have been matured offices and a couple of have been finished consistently up in the top, one on specifically is always at the top in that area. So like I said before I think it's hard to quantify specifically all the areas of either missed opportunity or deals that might still be in conversion as well, but we had a plan for all of them, we feel really good about what's going on. Many of them are already converted and so it's just hard to quantify specifically and so. Go ahead sorry. Mark Marcon : No, no, no, you go ahead. Chad Richison : I was just going to say, it's not nothing. I mean there is an impact there. And again we're dealing with our own employee base too. We had our own employees that experienced loss during this as well and so there's kind of a time for everything and right now we've called the time to get back out there and be prospecting and get those businesses set up and I'm really happy with the people of how they handle this and I mean I feel really good and like I said before any disruption we would have expected happened to us in Q4, is provided within that guidance that we've given and we do not expect this to have any impact on our 2018. Mark Marcon : Great. And then just a follow-up. You obviously have you know a ton of different feelers out there in terms of the real economy, it seems like economic activity is picking up. How would you characterize in areas that are completely unaffected just kind of the level of you know buyer enthusiasm, the pipeline etc how would you characterize that. Mark Marcon : I would say it's been business as usual I can't point to anything that's changed there I mean it\u2019s been good, but we're a business that you know in a down market we look to drive efficiencies for our client and therefore we're a good fit for them and you know that doesn\u2019t really change when things are going well and so for us we have to be strong regardless of what's happening and again we still represent such a small portion of our overall opportunity there's still plenty out there. Mark Marcon : Great, and the new offices that are just opened. How are those progressing? Mark Marcon : They're progressing according to plan, and as a reminder that takes 24 months for a new office to become mature and so -- but they are progressing. Operator : And our next questioner will be Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale : Hi, good afternoon congratulations on the quarter. So also returning to a topic from earlier when talking about maybe the reasons for the beat, you mentioned a couple of things but the hurricanes going to affect the commissions. I'm not sure I got a full sense of you know beating EBITDA is not unusual, but it\u2019s a larger beat than usual. Can you just talk a little bit more about what drove the outperformance relative to your expectation? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean I think if you look at the overall beat, it came in a couple early. I think we probably talked about the sales and marketing. And R&D one of the things I pointed out was we capitalized at a little higher rate this quarter than what we had been seeing. That probably drove 80 basis points in the R&D from where it would have been, had we capitalized at a more normal rate. And we expect that to come back to more normal rates for our fourth quarter. In our G&A, we saw some efficiency there as well as in the gross margin and I think on the gross margin we were probably it was more of a headcount. We didn't have -- we didn't hire quite as many people as what we had expected for the quarter, but we're continuing to staff up and looking good going into fourth quarter on that. Corey Greendale : And you've been investing more in R&D whether it\u2019s expensed or capitalized. Are you happy with this, if you look at this run rate as a percent of revenue? Or do you expect that to still increase over time? Chad Richison : Well, I mean what we're happy about the output that's coming out of R&D and to the extent we need to spend more as a percent of revenue to get the specific output we\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re going to do that. I think I\u2019ve said it before. We\u2019re at where we\u2019re at as a percent of R&D. We\u2019ve continued to spend. We continue to increase that. I don\u2019t see us rivaling our competitors in that area of R&D spent. But I believe that we are doing a great job on the output side and that has to do with our process and the way we work. Corey Greendale : Great. And then just one last quick one. And I am taking this for the answer to another question, so maybe I am taking this too much out of context. But in answer to another question, I think maybe Craig said that the focus is on growth over margin. So as you think about that where are the places where you could spend more to kind of increase growth? What would you think about accelerating new office openings or -- and [aired] in the TV spend? Or how should we think about those opportunities? Craig Boelte : Yes, I mean the best way to increase growth for us is productivity. And then obviously in order to best leverage of productivity gains that you have within the sales force. You definitely want to continue to open up offices because that comes your future productivity model, so I would see us focusing on both of those. Operator : And our next questioner will be Ross MacMillan with RBC. Please go ahead. Ross MacMillan : Chad, you did a great job in highlighting the number of offices impacted and maybe the backdrop of the productive offices. I was just curious. Could you just -- is it right to think of this impact in terms of time being last two months of Q3 and maybe the first month of Q4 in terms of go-live -- that selling motion and then the go-live? So it\u2019s like a three month period weighted towards Q3. Is that a fair reflection of the situation from the hurricane? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean definitely that\u2019s and I don\u2019t want to talk about any one client that might still be out there suffering that we can\u2019t necessarily do a lot about based on their situation it might be waiting longer. But yes, I mean I wouldn\u2019t expect this to have much longer of a run than that. That\u2019s not the same, if we wouldn\u2019t have a few outliers with that that but I feel really good. We do -- we measure pushes every week. So I know when you deal pushes. And during this time I mean we had weeks of $900,000 in annualized pushes which is just unheard about our company. And so then the question is okay, when are those coming back? Well, some of them are already coming back. And we didn\u2019t lose them again. There were other focuses -- other points of focus for them as it relates their own assets in those areas. And so we did have pushes and -- but again I just want to stress this that any disruption we felt like there would be and fourth quarter is already baked into our guidance and we do not feel like this would any impact for 2018. Ross MacMillan : That\u2019s very clear. So that 900,000 probably come down but it\u2019s not quite at a normalized level yet? Chad Richison : That was just a one week. Yes, that\u2019s an annualized number. So that\u2019s an annualized number, that\u2019s 900,000 annualized. Ross MacMillan : I understand. Yes. And then just one for Craig. Just you mentioned 606 and I am just thinking this through -- I don\u2019t believe you capitalized commissions and you generally recognize within the first month of deal start. Is the way to think about this is that your EBIT to get a benefit, but then there\u2019s going to be a tail of amortization. So it might be short time -- short term beneficial for EBITDA? Or might not thinking about that the right way as there are some other pushes and pulls on EBITDA under 606? Chad Richison : No. I mean, I think you\u2019re kind of thinking about that right, but you know we\u2019re recognizing that over the lack of a client, which is 10 years. You know as we\u2019ve grown throughout the years you know those top of expenses and it\u2019s not just commissioned, it\u2019s also some salaries related to that. Those are continued to grow. So the amortization on that, you know on some of those earlier years is pretty small. So -- but, yes, we should see a benefit under 606 in that. You are right. Ross MacMillan : Yes. And then that\u2019s helpful. And then just on that I know you don\u2019t talk about office openings, but just on the productivity commentary. I just wondered you know is there a trigger point when you look at the productivity across the productive offices, and you say okay, now is the time to move forward with the new opening or maybe just any commentary about kind of where you are on that productivity curve? And when you get to a threshold where you want to start to maybe press on more openings that would be helpful? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean it\u2019s important for us to be opening up offices throughout 2018. I think that we took a more staggered approach this year to develop those sales people who are ready to be in management. They know who they are and we\u2019ve been working with that group, many of them, you know, better part of seven or eight months and so. As we trying to corner on the beginning of the year, we\u2019ll assessing that and making those decisions. But I mean in 2018, we\u2019ll be opening up offices. Operator : And the next questioner will be Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Brent Bracelin : Thanks for taking the question. Chad, I'll actually follow-up on our last question. And this is just from a high level perspective as you think about new offices, the mature offices. I think 80% of the offices are mature now. You have another six that looking like they\u2019ll turn that 24 month maturity in Q1 of next year. So many no additional offices that puts you at north of 90% of the offices that are kind of mature. How do you think about that balance, mature versus new? What\u2019s the right kind of balance as you think about kind of that mature versus new equation? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean I would like to sit here and say that our -- that it\u2019s very scientific, but I\u2019ll just be flat out straight as if we have the people ready to do it. We\u2019re doing it. And we did find that there were some areas we could get better that development of people who are ready and identifying the right people. And that\u2019s something that we very much improved on and have become stronger at. And so, this is a people development. The market is right. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity out there for us. We are gaining the productivity gains. If I was waiting for that, it\u2019s something that I would say okay, well, let\u2019s do more. And so this is really about people being ready to be able to backfill relocating managers. Brent Bracelin : Got it. And as you think about the target cities opportunity out there. Is there still some low hanging fruit and opportunities you like to pursue sooner than later and the people that is kind of slowing things down a little bit, but walk us through the opportunity for new city expansion? Chad Richison : I mean when it comes to any specific territory that we\u2019ve identified for opening, I am somewhat agnostic on which one. To some extent that depends on the relocating manager. I think I\u2019d said it before. We would necessarily take an Oklahoma City manager and relocate into Manhattan. You want to make sure you have a culture fit with the people that you are putting in an area and on our Manhattan people are doing quite well. And so, you have to look at that as well across the board. Operator : And our next questioner will be Siti Panigrahi with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Siti Panigrahi : I think a lot of the questions that I was going to ask have been answered. But could you kind of this talk about, if you see any changes in the competitive landscape specifically from ADP or any other competitors? Chad Richison : I mean it\u2019s been somewhat businesses usual for us. I mean I can\u2019t say it\u2019s harder to get business for sure. But it\u2019s been business as user for us. I think, I\u2019ve said it before. We\u2019re very focused on our own value proposition and what we do and we\u2019re really stayed in our own lane on that. So yes, I can\u2019t speak to any. And I\u2019d say that, I don\u2019t know if any new entrants that have made an impact. For us, it\u2019s been the usual suspects. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Abhey Lamba : Chad, you talk about the leverage from sales and marketing that we saw. Can you just break it down how much of it was personal versus commission versus scale-back in some marketing spend? Chad Richison : Well, that\u2019s definitely -- I mean we haven\u2019t done that in the past and we wouldn\u2019t do that on this call. Operator : And our next questioner will be Ryan MacDonald with Dougherty & Company. Please go ahead. Ryan MacDonald : I guess, maybe starting on maybe what you talked about with the new national brand campaign. I mean, to the extent that maybe you're starting to see results and benefits from that. Can you talk about how you're thinking about brand awareness? And maybe how that might factor in your potential office expansions? When you\u2019re looking at the data and trying to see certain regions or areas where you might not have much brand equity in that space, just try and look at that a new greenfield opportunity or perhaps scenarios where since you think you have some really great brand awareness, and that you want to even double down on that type of region? Chad Richison : Yes, first, I would say that the ads are pretty new. And so I wouldn\u2019t say that had impact on our -- well, they wouldn\u2019t be having an impact on our numbers right now. But driving brand awareness also maybe those deals we pitch two years ago that didn\u2019t go. You definitely want to be in one of them. And then also, if you watch our ads, we\u2019re not necessarily just advertising the prospects we have the client base as well. In there's base case usage for how someone uses our product. I\u2019ll make this last point. I didn\u2019t know the iPhone, did merge costs until I saw commercial on it. And I use it for a couple of years. So I think it\u2019s important for people to use our products the correct way as well. Ryan MacDonald : And I guess just one quick follow-up. When you talk about learning management, I think it\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve seen that\u2019s been penetrated sort of on the enterprise side of the business. But as you start to look in your target customer based and expanding there, I mean have you -- can you talk about what kind of penetration you\u2019ve already seen, maybe in that markets for learning management? Is it something that you\u2019re finding as new to your existing customer base? Chad Richison : Well, we sell a single system and so, we don\u2019t breakdown adoption for anyone modular. But like I said everyone in the mid market does training. There is not a client that doesn\u2019t do training and learning. They just might be doing it using a different type of model which could even be manually in many cases. We are not bringing the tool. We are not just bringing the content we are also bringing the process through which someone can set up training specific to their business and then they already have the tool to be able to or get it out to all the employees and then be able to actually assess comprehension of the information that was presented and trained on. And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the question-and-answer-session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Chad Richison for any closing remarks. End of Q&A: Chad Richison : I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your time and interest. We look forward to meeting with investors of the Credit Suisse TMT Conference on November 28, in Scottsdale; also the Wells Fargo Tech Summit in Park City on December 5; and the Barclays Global TMT Conference in San Francisco on December 6. I thank you and operator you may disconnect. Operator : Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig, and thank you to everyone joining our call to review our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results. 2017 was a great year, and we made substantial progress executing in pursuit of our goals. Before I review our results and provide comments on the quarter and the year, I want to thank all of our employees whose tireless efforts in both support of and growth of our client base allowed us to succeed in 2017. This year, we made significant enhancements to our service model, improving the client onboarding experience, usage patterns of the Paycom system, and other key processes. Thanks to the focused efforts of our employees through 2017, we have set ourselves up very well to achieve our 2018 goals. We had excellent results for our fourth quarter, with revenue coming in at $114 million, representing growth of 30% over the comparable prior-year period. For the full year, revenue was $433 million, representing growth of 32% over the prior year. The power of the Paycom solution continues to resonate with prospective clients, and this drove our traction in the marketplace in 2017. For the sixth year in a row, our revenue retention rate was once again 91%, underscoring that our clients continue to see the value in partnering with Paycom. I\u2019ll take a moment to quickly review some highlights of 2017. Paycom received external recognition from several notable sources, placing second on Fortune magazine's list of 100 fastest-growing publicly-traded companies, finishing fourth on Forbes Fast Tech 25 list of America's fastest-growing publicly-traded technology companies and being named one of Oklahoma's top places to work for a fifth consecutive year. Also, we were proud to honor the legendary athlete and Oklahoman Jim Thorpe by sponsoring the Paycom Jim Thorpe Award, an award given to college football's top defensive back. We also debuted our first national television ad campaign, and it has received very positive feedback. Finally, in 2017, we launched our mobile app in the Apple and Google Play stores and developed many enhancements to our current offering. We were able to achieve this impressive set of accomplishments and also our robust top-line growth while producing substantial margin and cash flow allowing us to return value to our stockholders in the form of over 1.2 million shares repurchased over the course of 2017. In the fourth quarter alone, we repurchased 538,000 shares. Since we initiated the repurchase program less than 24 months ago, we have repurchased 2.3 million shares. While we are proud of what we have achieved so far, we are even more excited about our future prospects which are driven by our vision for the future of our industry. We believe the trend of increasing user engagement with human capital management systems along with workers insistence on robust yet intuitive digital HR experiences is poised to continue. What we see in the marketplace makes us even more confident that we are in front of significant growth as these trends continue to gain traction, particularly across our target market of companies with 1,500 to 2,000 employees. Managers of these companies are becoming increasingly aware of cutting-edge HR technology and how it can help them produce efficiencies in their business. The broad functionality of the Paycom solution provides these organizations with best-in-class HR software functionality without the cost of third-party providers or integration. At the same time, our system is intuitive and easy to use, allowing it to be used by every employee often on a daily basis. This powerful functionality is why we believe Paycom is the best-positioned company in the industry to help clients achieve their potential by allowing them to unlock the value of their team members. Turning to our sales efforts, we opened three new sales offices in 2017, Milwaukee, Richmond and Long Island. They are continuing to grow and mature. Today after the market closed, we were pleased to announce the opening of an office in Salt Lake City. This brings our total number of sales teams to 46. Our 2017 sales offices are doing well and of the offices opened in 2016, some will be hitting their initial maturity date soon, but the offices will continue to hit their full stride as they become staffed with the majority of senior reps who have the best production capability. For our sales representatives, time in the field is extremely important. A rep that has worked in his or her territory for several years has developed deep relationships and a reputation for helping clients improve their company operations through deploying the Paycom solution. As a result, we continue to see very senior sales reps outperform and this drives our belief that we have the opportunity to continue to improve sales productivity. We believe that the market share that remains for us to capture is substantial and are building a sales organization that will allow us to leverage this opportunity. To sum up, 2017 was an excellent year for Paycom and we are excited about continuing our momentum through 2018. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks Chad. Before we review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2017 and also our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We used adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are non-GAAP financial measures that excludes noncash stock-based compensation expense and certain transaction and other expenses that are not cored to our operations. Non-GAAP net income also reflects adjustments for the effective income taxes. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures discussed today are included in the earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. Additionally, along with our earnings press release, we provided a presentation that outlines the impact to our financial statements of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606. This presentation is available to download on our Investor Relations website and was furnished as an exhibit to Form 8-K filed this afternoon. I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results on this call based on the historical revenue standard ASC 605 that will provide forward-looking guidance based on the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606. I'll also talk more a little bit later about the adoption of the new standard and the areas where it will have the most significant impact on Paycom\u2019s financials. As Chad mentioned, we had strong results in the fourth quarter, with total revenue of $114 million, representing year-over-year growth of 30% from the comparable prior-year period. Our full-year 2017 revenues were $433 million, representing growth of 32% over the comparable prior-year period. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins, and we are pleased with our continued performance. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $111.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 29% from the comparable prior-year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $95.6 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 83.8%. For the full year 2018, we anticipate that our adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 82% to 84%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $69.4 million for the quarter as compared to $56.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $42.5 million. Adjusted R&D expense was $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 or 6.2% of total revenue. Total adjusted R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, was $11.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $8.4 million in the prior-year period. Total adjusted R&D costs for the full year of 2017, including the capitalized portion, was $41.1 million or 9.5% of total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.8 million or 27.9% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $20.7 million or 23.6% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year of 2017 adjusted EBITDA was $137 million or 31.6% of total revenues compared to $94.5 million or 28.7% of total revenues in 2016. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $12.9 million $0.22 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares versus $8.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 27.7%. For the full year 2017, our GAAP net income was $66.8 million or $1.13 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $16.8 million or $0.29 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares versus $10.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the prior year period. For the full year of 2017, our non-GAAP net income was $76.7 million or $1.30 per diluted share. As Chad mentioned earlier, we have returned value to our stockholders in the form of over 1.2 million shares repurchased over the course of 2017, including over 770,000 shares purchased in the open market. In the fourth quarter alone, we repurchased over 538,000 shares. Since we initiated the repurchased program that some 24 months ago, we have repurchased over 2.3 million shares including nearly 1.6 million shares in the open market. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 59 million shares in the first quarter of 2018. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $46.1 million and total debt of $35.3 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. Construction of our fourth building continues to go well and according to schedule. Cash from operations was $38.2 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $820 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Now, we'll provide some comments regarding the impact on our financial statements that both the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and also ASC 606 accounting standard. As a reminder, Paycom historically has applied to 35% statutory corporate federal tax rate as part of its overall effective tax rate. In 2018, we anticipate that our GAAP tax rate will be within a range of 22% to 24%. This will be driven by the decline in the federal rate to 21% and offset by a variety of factors, including the elimination of the Section 199 deduction, the Section 162 (m) limitation, and handful of other smaller factors. Regarding the impact to our 2017 financials, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law in December, and this resulted in a $0.4 million or $0.01 per share reduction in net income for the fourth quarter of 2017. A decrease in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% required us to revalue and write down certain deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017. This onetime write-down was necessary in order to reflect the expected recovery of those assets under lower future tax rates. Regarding ASC 606, effective January 1, 2018, we have adopted and are using the new accounting standard. We adopted the standard using the full retrospective method and will begin reporting under this new method beginning in the first quarter of 2018. However, in order to provide early transparency into the impact on the 2016 and 2017 numbers, we have furnished a recast of our financial statements for the full year of 2016 and for each quarter end and the full year of 2017 as well as certain non-GAAP metrics. As mentioned earlier, these recast numbers can be found in the presentation that is available on our Investor Relations website site along with a brief description of the impact of the new standards on Paycom. In short, the new standard will not have any impact on how we recognize our revenues, only the timing of when we recognize certain expenses. This is primarily the result of the short-term nature of our contracts and the fact that we already have a practice of deferring and recognizing our implementation revenue over the life of the client which has been determined to be 10 years. Under the new standard, we will continue this practice. The primary impact on us will be a change in the timing of when we recognize certain expenses related to the costs to acquire new sales contracts, specifically commissions paid to our sales representatives as well as the implementation and setup costs associated with those contracts. When one of our reps sells a deal, we pay that rep his or her commission after the deal has been live for 30 days. Historically, we have recognized that commission expense in the quarter it was incurred. Now, under 606, we will be capitalizing the commissions and contract costs as an asset on our balance sheet and then subsequently recognizing those costs ratably over the period of benefit which has been determined to be the 10-year life of the client. This will have the impact of spreading out sales commission's expense. As such, it will reduce our sales and marketing expenses and, to a lesser degree, our general and administrative expenses and will increase our adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share. Looking ahead to 2018 operating expenses on a quarterly basis, we expect general and administrative expenses will be fairly similar as a percent of revenue to the recast 2017 figures, and both sales and marketing and R&D expenses as a percent of revenues will be slightly higher than the recast 2017 figures. We expect noncash stock-based compensation for the first quarter of 2018 to be approximately $10 million. Now let me turn to guidance for the first quarter and full year for fiscal 2018. As a reminder, this guidance takes into account the new ASC 606 standard, and growth rates are calculated using the recast numbers for the comparable 2017 periods. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect total revenues in the range of $150 million to $152 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 26% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $74 million to $76 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 50% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2018, our revenue guidance is a range of $541 million to $543 million or approximately 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. Our full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance has a range of $213 million to $215 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : First question is for Chad. Chad, in 2017, you opened three offices. That's kind of below your normal run rate of like five, six, and I know there's all different factors playing a role here. Can you talk a little bit about what impacted that year, is that kind of the new normal that we need to think about it? Just kind of give us the puts and takes there. Thank you. Chad Richison : And you're right. Last year, we did open up three. We staggered the amount last year. Matter of fact, I don't even know that we opened one as early as we did this year. And it's somewhat odd that we would open one early. I know that we've announced some before that we had opened early, and I don't see us going back to the type of program where we try to open four or five in the same 10-day period. We did a lot of work in our sales organization last year both preparing backfill and increasing the maturing numbers in our mature offices, and so we believe that set us up well to continue our staggered strategy throughout the year, and we will be announcing additional office openings as we move forward. Raimo Lenschow : So it's not - if you think about this, the three is not - it\u2019s not a demand location issue. It\u2019s more like you guys kind of internally finding the senior people to move and the backfill, et cetera. Chad Richison : That's really always been our gating factor. It is talent development on the back end. It's ready to both backfill, as well as having managers being ready to relocate. And I think we did a good job last year of changing our strategy in how we develop and enter a new market that way. It was successful, and I would see us continuing that strategy throughout this year. Raimo Lenschow : And a question for Craig. Craig, if I look at your new profitability guidance and I kind of see what we did last year in terms of EBITDA margin, it seems like it's ticking down a little bit in 2018 on the EBITDA margins. Can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes in terms of investment areas, you mentioned R&D, sales and marketing going little higher, a little bit higher, like what's driving it and what\u2019s the thinking behind then? Craig Boelte : The two that I mentioned on the prepared remarks were R&D, as well as some in the sales and marketing. Our gross margins we finished the year pretty high for the full year and I guided for 2018 in that 82% to 84%. That's really dependent on our hiring trends and making - certain times of the year we may be a little behind on the hiring and certain times a little ahead. So that's kind of where the puts and takes are. We'll continue to look for efficiencies in the model though. G&A is one area where we're going to definitely look as well. Raimo Lenschow : And then, have any idea in terms of like how - like if I think about cash that's kind of the number, the thing that doesn't really change so kind of do I think about the same level of cash conversion as I think about 2018 that you saw in 2016 and 2017? Craig Boelte : I mean, I would assume that it would be fairly similar to what you saw in 2016 and 2017. Some of the bigger items that impact the cash or the CapEx and so other than that, I would expect it to be very similar. Operator : Our next question comes from John DiFucci of Jefferies. Please go ahead. John DiFucci : Actually, I just have a follow-up to that last question there from Raimo, and I guess this is for Craig. The cash conversion really below the operating line, can you talk a little about the potential benefit to operating cash flow due to the lower tax rate? All your businesses are here in the States, so I assume - and you guys have been profitable for a long time unlike a lot of software companies. So I assume you\u2019d see some benefit there. And I assume that ASC 606 has little to no impact on cash flow even though you're moving some of the expenses out a little bit. Craig Boelte : On the ASC 606, as it relates to cash, yeah, it will have no impact on our cash position relative to 606. In terms of the tax rate, I called out the gap range of 22 to 24. We are full tax payers and have been for several years, so we would see some benefit from the lower taxes. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Albert Chi : This is Albert Chi on for Mark Murphy. Congrats on a great quarter, Chad and Craig, and thanks for taking my question. For the R&D, it looks like it declined a little bit sequentially and slowed down a lot year-over-year. And I know you guys have the capitalized software development outside of that but is there any change in direction or any points of leverage that you're seeing? Chad Richison : No. And as we mentioned, for 2018, we would expect that to continue to increase as a percent of revenue. Well, we did see a little higher capitalization in fourth quarter than what we had originally thought. Albert Chi : And then I guess one more point on the guidance. For the adjusted EBITDA numbers that you're talking about 39% guidance for the full year, are you able to give us a sense of what that would have looked like under the older ASC 605? Like is there a margin number that you can kind of give us? Chad Richison : I mean, we will not be - since we adopted the full retrospective, we will not be showing any ASC 605 numbers as we move into the first quarter. So, it's something that we really don't want to get into, showing a what-if under ASC 605 because there will be no area where we'll actually be reporting that. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : Let me add my congratulations, great year. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing just in terms of client retention trends, sales productivity in some of the older markets versus the new markets, any sort of change in color from a competitive perspective. And then, I've got an EBITDA margin question. Chad Richison : And so, our sales productivity remains strong. The initiatives that we've put into the group last year continue to produce for us. And so I'm very happy with that. We're starting off the year strong with our starts and what have you. So, we're focused on that. What was the second part of the question? No. Mark Marcon : Your client retention. Chad Richison : Yes, client retention. And so, Mark, our client retention has been 91%, that\u2019s a trailing revenue, I believe and measured like our competitors, and it's been 91% for the last six years. There are certain clients that we can't control loss on due to bought-sold, merged and/or cash flow. And there\u2019s a certain number that we can control, and we've been focused on that. I do think it's important to point out we've maintained a 91% retention rate, and we have not taken the 4% to 5% routine price increase which is somewhat standard for our industry. And so we continue to be focused on the client and produce pricing that allows the client and Paycom to experience the efficiencies that we drive through the ROI. And so we're focused on that. And we are hoping to continue to make improvements amongst our client base in both service and product to make an impact on that rate, but we have held the line at 91% for the last six years. Mark Marcon : And then, with regards to the EBITDA margin projection for 2018 relative to 2017. You mentioned both sales and marketing and R&D will be going up. Would you expect one to go up on a basis-point basis more than the other or are you proportional, how are you thinking about that in terms of heavier investment? Chad Richison : We think the investment is going to be fairly similar between the two. I mean, one quarter might be slightly higher than the other but overall fairly similar in terms of the increase. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Nemeroff of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Nemeroff : I just jumped off another call. Chad, if you can maybe just give us a sense how many office openings do you plan to do in 2018, and what's the average productivity improvement you're assuming in your initial 2018 growth outlook? And then also, can you maybe share any metrics or give us a sense of how much productivity has improved in 2017 as a result of the staggered office openings? Chad Richison : And so in 2017, I believe in 2016, actually, I'd put out toward the end the $260 million sales capacity number that we had and that we had that currently. Obviously, that number has grown some but I have not updated it. And we'll update that as we get closer to it. But we have had efficiency gains throughout the organization, so I should say productivity gains in the sales organization which we pretty much do every year as something that we focus on. Those gains have set us up well as we head into this year. We haven't ever really guided to office openings other than to say, we're going to continue the strategy. But we are set up better this year to open up offices than what we were even last year. Michael Nemeroff : In the past, I think you've said that the office openings do drive the business on a forward-looking basis. Are you changing that now? So is it both office openings and productivity gains? How should we think about the lower number in 2017 office openings and only one so far year-to-date in February? Chad Richison : So last year, at this time, I think we had opened zero through the year and so from that standpoint. But the office openings make an impact later on in their life cycle. I wouldn't say it's one of the other. I wouldn't say office openings drive our growth. It's a piece of our growth strategies opening up offices. And obviously when you're maturing mature offices, you don't really get to talk about those offices unless they're open. And so, it's important for us to continue to drive our office open strategy, as well as gain productivity throughout the year with those mature offices. Operator : Our next question comes from David Hynes of Canaccord. Please go ahead. David Hynes : Nice set of numbers here. Chad, I want to start maybe we could ask about the TV campaign. Curious why you felt like now is the right time, how is that working? Is that running in cities just to have mature offices? Is that running across all regions? How do you think about tracking effectiveness? That sort of stuff. Anything you could share on maybe how that's contributing to the business. Craig Boelte : Well, I mean, I have a certain view of advertising versus marketing and specifically as it relates to strategic selling. I think advertising allows for specific branding. We don't really put ads out there and expect our phones to start ringing. But advertising does provide branding. It was a national campaign that we embarked on, I want to say, middle part of last year that we ran primarily on the news and some sporting events as a brand awareness-type campaign. We haven't really talked about how much more of that or if we will continue that. But I think as we continue to grow, our branding is important. But it would be one piece of our strategic selling of model. David Hynes : And then, Craig, maybe on the numbers. We're going to bump up against 40% EBITDA margins almost here in 2018. How high is that up on that front as we contemplate an updated long-term model? Craig Boelte : We had a long-term model under ASC 605. We\u2019re still looking at our long-term model under ASC 606. We\u2019re going to continue to be a high-growth company, but also look to achieve some efficiencies along the way. So, as we get throughout the year, we may decide at some point to update that long-term model. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Brent Bracelin : First one for Chad, I mean at a macro level, the NFIB Small Business Index I think hit a 30-year high this year here on small business hiring on optimism. What kind of impact does that have on either the pipeline or your business as you just think about kind of macro factors? First question. Chad Richison : Well, I do think any time you have a good business environment that's good for our clients and that can't help but on the margins be somewhat favorable to us as well. We're definitely an ROI-driven type company where we go in and have collaborative meetings with the client to drive that. I mean, ROI-driven results really can work regardless of current market environments and we've seen that before. We've been a company that - it's our 20th year in business. So, we've lived through plenty. But I do think that any time you have a very positive index out there, it can't help but to provide again on the margin some level of a positive environment. Brent Bracelin : And then just one follow up here as you think about the number of new software features that you've added to the cloud payroll and HCM stack here over the last several years, what's your view around the value you\u2019re providing customers and in pricing? You mentioned you haven\u2019t raised pricing in a meaningful way in the past. What would change the scenario where you\u2019d consider doing that? Chad Richison : And so we haven't raised prices. We do produce additional software functionality that is for sale. But at that point, we're actually delivering additional value to the client for that. In answer to your question, I believe that we are fairly priced when we go in and we have meetings with the client. And we don't give prices where there's not in ROI that has been developed in conjunction within those client - in conjunction with the client in those meetings. And so we're very focused on that ROI and making sure our client base receives the ROI that was discussed in the sales call and then it's delivered through the transition process. And so we're focused on that. And you know, over time, it should get easier to handle the same client as they become acclimated to the software as well. And so we're definitely not the least expensive out there. But I believe when you include our ROI, we\u2019re still the low cost provider. Brent Bracelin : And then last one here for Craig, as you think about just cash flow impacts that we should think about in 2018 and 2019, can you remind us CapEx outlays again 2018 and 2019, what are some of the expectations there that we should think about in our cash flow assumptions? And then if you could also talk about sales commissions, are you going to continue to pay sales commissions the standard way from a cash payout perspective or as the ASC 606 accounting changes, are you also changing cash payout to sales commissions as well? Craig Boelte : I'll take the last one first. I mean, we really don't plan on changing the way we pay commissions and in the past, we've, after the client is ran for 30 days, we estimate the annual revenue the client will pay the sales rep commission based on that. And so ASC 606 will have no impact on the way we pay the commissions, only the way we recognize those expenses. In terms of CapEx, we don't guide the CapEx but you could probably look back historically at how we've spent on the CapEx line and you know as we've mentioned the fourth billing is coming online, sometime mid-year. And as we get close to that, we typically have a little bit of an elevated level of CapEx on some of those expenses. Brent Bracelin : And then after that mid-year elevated CapEx spend, you should start to normalize, is that the right way to think about it? Craig Boelte : We really haven't given any guidance past that. We might see a slight drop off once that billings is completed. Operator : Our next question comes from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead. Ken Wang : This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Congratulations on a strong year-end and thank you for taking my question. So just wondering if you can speak a little bit about your revenue growth split during 2017 just between new customers and upsell, just wondering if you saw any change during Q4 and whether or not your expectation is for the split to remain about the same in 2018. Chad Richison : I would expect, yes, the split to remain about the same. We\u2019ve always, even through the year where we - and I guess I\u2019m going to be the first one to say this, but even through the year where we had our ACA sales, our sales were always the overwhelming majority of all of our revenues delivered from new client wins primarily because the dollar revenue value for a new client win is so much larger than what any one product is that you can sell into your current client base. As well as with Paycom, our salespeople are incentivized to make sure that the client is using and receives the number of products they require at the time of the initial purchase. And so I wouldn't expect in 2018 to be any different than what it was in 2019 as far as the breakdown on that. Ken Wang : And then just one more for me, just wondering if you can comment, has the addition of your LMS course content, has that had any positive effect on sales of the module or the platform more broadly? Chad Richison : Well, we announced that LMS course in November, those LMS courses in November. They followed upon the LMS product that we actually developed probably two or three years prior, at least three years prior. And so we do expect that those courses would be able to produce greater adoption rates of that LMS module. We\u2019re still in the early stages of that. But I would expect that that would continue to aid in our value proposition as we're out there in the market. Operator : Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Ankit Kapoor : This is Ankit for Siti. Could you talk about what kind of penetration trends you're seeing in the market to the overall addressable market? Chad Richison : I think you're talking about new client wins penetration perhaps and\u2026 Ankit Kapoor : That's what I'm trying to figure out. Chad Richison : I would say that we do continue to achieve our goals in regards to that, our wins versus our add backs. That's not something that we talk about for competitive reasons. And we have some sales teams that are stronger than the others. I will say this. We still represent 2% to 3% of the overall TAM available to us and it's a growing TAM. And so, we're still very focused on those new business wins. Operator : Our next question comes from Shankar Subramanian of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Shankar Subramanian : My question is on - with the revenue growth rate projections for fiscal 2018. Can you talk about the visibility of that growth of the revenue for 2018? The reason I'm asking is if you had about 36 maturity and so in fiscal 2017 and this year should be a little bit more than that, and because of the higher revenue per customer that you can sell through this year, is your revenue growth including the upside and ARPU as well as the improved productivity or what are the upside opportunities that you're expecting in fiscal 2018 is what I'm looking at. Chad Richison : Well, so the greatest upside I think to any years\u2019 performance is new client wins, a number of new client wins that you\u2019re bringing on. That\u2019s really important. Our approach to our guidance this year didn\u2019t change from last year or the year before or really from quarter-to-quarter. I mean we focused on what we can see based on both our pipeline as well as those deals that have already hit the backlog and we'll be converting within an eight-week period on most of them. And so we're very focused on that. And then as we move throughout the year, we will update both the numbers and the guidance based on what we can see at that time. Operator : Our next question is from Brad Reback of Stifel. Please go ahead. Brad Reback : Did I think last year you\u2019ve talked about promoting 37 people to executive reps last January. Can you give us a sense of what the promotional look like this year? Chad Richison : You know I do not have those numbers specifically as far as that. We would have more information on that after the February commissions because someone either hits executive rep toward the end typically in December and January as those are often times can be strong starts for us. And so I don't have those numbers to update at this time. Brad Reback : And just really quickly with interest rate continuing to rise. How should we think about the sensitivity of flow balance and interest rates? Chad Richison : I mean our balances have increased, but our investment strategy has not changed. A lot of that most of that money spends very little time in our account. We are very conservative in the way that we invest that. Obviously as interest rates go up, we're going to receive some gain for that with the same investment strategy. But we haven't guided to what that is within our revenue and it would represent a very small portion of revenue and or gain for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Schwartz : Chad, I want to switch it up and ask an industry question here. Kind of building on one of your responses. You mentioned that the greatest upside potential for the business is the pace of the new client wins that they occur. The question I wanted to ask you about the industry and really the buyer preference. In the upper markets - so let's call it the upper and mid-markets, not in your market, we've seen a big shift here in the market over the last year and a half with the buyer preferences moving towards wanting to standardize on a strategic vendor. They want [your staff], and they want an HCM platform approach to the services and workflow. And so the question I just wanted to ask you is I'm just wondering if those trends have started to trickle down into your market and maybe creating a tailwind here within the market? And then the third question about this is, if those trends are starting to pop off in the deal engagement, is it possible to rank them in regards to which could be the biggest tailwind to the new customer acquisition trend moving forward? Thanks. Chad Richison : I'll try to answer the way I understand it. I think it really depends on where you draw that line between where, we'll call it, enterprise starts and mid-market stops or what have you. And we used to talk about client wins each quarter as we rolled them out, and it was obvious that we were gaining client wins above our target market. And I had even said in the past that those are typically a pool opportunity and that we're being pulled into those organizations and so I don't disagree with you that the large business market or enterprise market is realizing the benefits of having a relationship and one software package that could actually handle their needs and I think they're coming to that realization. In the mid-market, I will say that's pretty much been the case. I mean, I've said this before, I'm not 100% sure always, depending on the clients' unique situation that we're always 100% exactly right for a client, but they sure want us to be. Clients sure do want to use one system for everything. And we've had a lot of success with our value proposition which we stayed true to. And so, we'll continue to do that. If it gets easier, to move up market because we do have so much opportunity for us right now on the mid-market, we do have a good product fit for larger businesses as well. We just have a little bit lower tolerance for year-long type sales process and conversion. Operator : Our next question comes from Abhey Lamba of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Parthiv Varadarajan : This is Parthiv on for Abhey. Congrats on the results. Just a couple of quick ones. For the 46 offices that you currently have, just wanted to get an update on the on the split between those that are fully mature and those are ramping up toward full productivity. And then, maybe where you expect the mix to end up towards the end of 2018. Chad Richison : So, right now, we still have. How many is that maturing? Craig Boelte : Nine maturing. Chad Richison : We have nine maturing throughout this year and we have five that will come into maturity in the year. Is that right? Six that will come into maturity in the year. Craig Boelte : Six in this year. Chad Richison : And nine that are not mature at this point. Parthiv Varadarajan : Okay. Chad Richison : And it is important to note that what we call maturity is your initial staffing in the market and beginning of mature quota. In fact those offices continue to mature in our offices that have been opened five, six years will typically outsell even an office that's been opened a couple two or three to one. Parthiv Varadarajan : And then one more with respect to the restatements, we understand that change in sort of sales and marketing expense recognition with the $11 million G&A expense was written. What is the driver over there? Chad Richison : I mean, as we were going through the 606 recast numbers, you really look at the cost to obtain and fulfill and the ones that are in the G&A are more of the fulfilled costs. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Chad Richison for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : Well, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. And I also want to congratulate Minkah Fitzpatrick, the defensive back from the University of Alabama for winning the Paycom Jim Thorpe Award this year. Like Minkah, we're all excited for what 2018 has in store for us. Thank you and we'll be talking to you guys next quarter. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of market today which is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig, and thank you to everyone joining our call to review our first quarter 2018 results. I will start the call with some comments on our performance this quarter, provide an update on our perspective into payroll and human capital management or HCM software market, and then address some exciting developments at Paycom. Then Craig will speak to our financials before opening the line for question. We kicked off another new year with robust numbers. We recorded revenue of $153.9 million representing growth of 29% over the comparable prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA of $80.7 million represents a 52% margin. We were pleased with our performance and also that both metrics came in above the high end of our guidance range. Paycom continues to demonstrate leadership in the HCM sector. Earlier this year, one of the industry's most popular publications HR.com honored our organization at the 2018 Leadership Excellence & Development Awards. Our lead training and development program won the award for innovation and the deployment of leadership programs. This acknowledgement is a testament towards dedication towards training and developing our workforce which is one of Paycom's core values. I'm very proud of this recognition and look forward to continuing to foster a winning culture with a strong focus on leadership development. Additionally, our marketing initiatives continue to receive positive recognition. In addition to winning a number of American advertising awards for our branding and national television campaign, Paycom also earned a national recognition at the 2018 Killer Content Awards. We won the influencer marketing category which recognized our brand for successfully tapping influential industry leaders to help validate content campaigns, an increasing message credibility to our clients and prospects. These accolades, standards of testament to the strength of our culture and brand within the market and together with our service and software worked to power our growth. Our single database HCM solution continues to gain converts in the marketplace. Our perspective clients are typically large enough to have significant HCM needs to span multiple areas, including not just payroll but also recruiting, talent management, benefit administration and many others. With the Paycom solution, our clients receive a powerful yet flexible system that provides highly accurate employee data that allows HR executives to obtain actionable insights into their workforce. We believe the Paycom solution is the best option for companies looking to leverage the power of HCM Technology to improve their organizations. At Paycom we believe that today's workforce places increasing importance on an intuitive and easy to use HCM system; because of this preference, we are highly focused on providing the best possible user experience. We recently released our redesigned employee self-service desktop and mobile app and feedback from our clients and their employees has been stellar. We believe these enhancements to our employee software makes it even easier for employees to use the Paycom system to it's full potential. Having an easy-to-use HCM system can lead to higher employee engagement, increase productivity, drive job satisfaction and improve employee retention. Our product, especially our mobile app empowers our client's employees to take control of their HR functions. Today's generation is accustomed to using mobile apps for virtually every activity and our solution provides employees easy access to onboarding, training, enrolling in benefits and much more, when and where it's most convenient. In addition to this release, we also continue to maintain and improve every aspect of our solution to ensure that it remains best-in-class. We publish monthly system-wide updates to our client base and are constantly improving our offering in order to preserve our competitive lead. Some examples of enhancements we released at this quarter include improvements to our analytics dashboard. This tool now features improved chart and drilldown functionality and offers employers a clear view into the crucial data that can help drive operational decisions. Additionally, we debut taxes by geolocation; clients use this functionality to automatically suggest the appropriate tax jurisdiction for inclusion in an employee's tax profile. We also enhanced our current mileage tracker by introducing smart mileage costing; this allows employers to save money by creating customized reimbursement programs that used to make and model and year of an employee's vehicle combined with the cost of fuel in the employee's region along with other factors which allows the client to reimbursement mileage at a lower rate. These were just a few of the many enhancements that launched in the quarter as part of our relentless focus on driving value for our clients. Turning to our sales efforts; we've recently announced the opening of our new sales office in Rochester, New York. This office is in addition to our Salt Lake City office that we opened in February and brings our total sales teams count to 47. We are excited to bring our solution to perspective clients in the Rochester area. As many of you know, we take a very deliberate and unique approach to expanding our sales organization by moving a successful sales manager to a new city or region and then building a new team around that relocated manager. We believe this gives new teams the strongest foundation possible and the greatest chance at future success. While we are committed to continuing to expand our sales organization through 2018 and beyond, we will do so at a pace that is most appropriate for our business and that we believe will allow us to achieve the greatest revenue growth which is our first priority. I'd like to address some developments among our leadership team. In February, we added Janet Haugen the our Board of Directors. Janet brings a wealth of financial and operational experience to Paycom, most recently serving as CFO of the Unisys Corporation. Paycom will benefit from her insight and experience as we continue to grow. Next, we were very pleased to announce that we are promoting John Evans from Senior VP of Operations to Chief Operating Officer. John joined Paycom four years ago and has worked in both, our finance and operations departments. He has been instrumental in driving important operational improvements over the past few years and we look forward to his continued contributions. Additionally, we are promoting Brad Smith from Director of Software Development to Chief Information Officer. Brad has been leading our software developments for some time now, and we have benefited greatly from his vision and dedication. I'd like to also extend congratulations to both John and Brad for their promotions. Finally, I'd like to thank Stacey Pezold for her many years of service. Stacey is moving on from Paycom after several years in different roles and we are grateful for her contributions. We will wish her the best in her future endeavors. In conclusion, we had a very strong start to the year and I look forward to continued success through 2018. With that, I will turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our first quarter results for 2018 and also our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2018, I'd like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. As a reminder, we adopted a new accounting standard, ASC606 from January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective method of transition which required us to recast the prior period presented. Our comparisons discussed in today's call reflect those adjustments. We use adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude non-cash stock based compensation expense and certain transactions and other expenses that are not core to our operations. Non-GAAP net income also reflects adjustments for the effective income taxes, reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures discussed today are included in the earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. As Chad mentioned, we were pleased with our first quarter results with total revenues of $153.9 million representing growth of 29% over the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins and we are pleased with our continued excellent performance. Within total revenues recurring revenue was $151.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 representing 98.7% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 28.8% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $133.2 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 86.5%. For the full year 2018 we anticipate that our adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 82% to 84%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $58.7 million for the quarter as compared to $46.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter 2018 was $30.4 million. Adjusted R&D expense was $9 million in the first quarter of 2018 or 5.8% of total revenues. Total adjusted R&D cost including the capitalized portion was $13.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $9.2 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $80.7 million or 52.5% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $60.3 million or 50.5% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2017 as adjusted. Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was $41.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares versus $33.7 million or $0.57 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter 2018 was 21%, this lower effective income tax rate was primarily the result of the decrease in the federal corporate tax rate that went into effect in December 2017 with the enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017. In the first quarter our non-cash stock based compensation increased by $20 million over the prior year period due to the issuance and subsequent investing of restricted stock with market based conditions. For modeling purposes, we anticipate stock based compensation to be $5 million to $6 million per quarter for the remainder of 2018. This vesting of shares had an impact on our first quarter tax rate lowering at approximately 150 basis points. We anticipate our full year income tax rate to be 23% to 24% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 25% to 26%. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $55.8 million or $0.95 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares versus 35.5 million or $0.61 per diluted share in the prior year period. In the first quarter we returned value to our stakeholders by repurchasing nearly 170,000 shares including over 60,000 shares purchased in the open market. Since we initiated the repurchase program less than 24 months ago, we have repurchased over 2.5 million shares including nearly 1.7 million shares in the open market. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 59 million shares in the second quarter of 2018. Turning to the balance sheet; we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $68.1 million and total debt of $35.3 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. Construction of our fourth building is nearing completion. Cash from operations was $57.7 million for the first quarter reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of [indiscernible] behalf of clients was approximately $1 billion in the first quarter of 2018. Now let me turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year for fiscal 2018. For the second quarter of 2018 we expect total revenues in the range of $123 million to $125 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 26% at the midpoint in the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in the range of $43 million to $45 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2018, we are increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $545 million to $547 million or approximately 26% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We are increasing our full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $220 million to $222 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 40% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : First question for you Chad, if you look about the evolution of the industry, so you started doing cross-selling beyond take-home in terms of -- like the HR functionalities. To ask, normally, we probably saw like an IPO in the space where workforce management now became an other area. Can you just talk a little bit of how holistic you see that space evolving for you guys and where you're already at this point where you're kind of critical [ph]? Thank you. Chad Richison : We started adding additional products to payroll in 2004 and actually started out with workforce management from the time an attendance perspective. And then we've continued to add on and build additional modules onto that as we've stated on a single system so that to eliminate the need for integration for clients. And now since that we've really focused on our employee usage strategy to be able to roll that out so that employees can assume and help with the responsibility for both, the accuracy of data as well as information retrieval. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. And then can you talk a little bit about the progress that you do on the learning product titer that was focused on last couple of quarters? Chad Richison : Yes, we've been focused on continuing to develop content, I believe I announced last quarter that we did develop 10 pieces of content, unique pieces of content developed internally with Paycom that we have included into our LMS system to again drive greater usage amongst that employee base for each of our clients. We have since added content to that, I think we've added another 12 to 14 courses to that as well, and overtime we will be charging for those courses, the additional courses. Raimo Lenschow : And then a quick question for Craig; so if I think about the EBITDA evolution, where would be the focus areas for investment for the remainder of the year? I mean, obviously you beat kind of nicely in Q1 and what's the stuff that puts some takes and need to think about for the remainder of the year in terms of investment focused areas? Craig Boelte : In terms of the adjusted EBITDA, in the first quarter -- we did beat first quarter, part of that was the revenue beat that really closed through to the bottom line and then first quarter -- we kind of called our sales and marketing and R&D our sales and marketing, we look at the initiatives at the beginning of the year and some of those getting moved around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, as well as we take some and maybe add some and remove some on that. The R&D was actually up for the quarter and we had -- but we had a little bit higher percent capitalized, so we were probably 100 basis points higher as a percent of revenue on the total R&D but we capitalized at 31% rather than 27% where we were first quarter last year. And then we saw some efficiencies in the G&A line, so as we kind of move out throughout the rest of the year we're going to continue to spend on the R&D and you would hope to see some efficiencies in the G&A line. Operator : Our next question today comes from Michael Nemeroff of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Alex [ph] for Michael, thank you for taking our questions. Chad or Craig, can you give us a sense on the increase and the productivity gains you've seen year-to-date compared to the prior year period now that we've been on this sort of staggered office opening timeline for more than a year? And I believe it's been a while since you've provided an update on the new business sales performance capacity metric, curious if you had an update on that metric or any data points perhaps even new A&R growth that you would like to share for Q1. Chad Richison : Sure. And so the $260 million new business sales capacity number for an annualized number of new business that we add on, that number stands today. As far as your question of how have we increased those productivity gains, we have continued to increase those productivity gains and I would look forward to updating that number as we move throughout the year but right now it's $260 million; and again achievement is what drives that number, it's not something that we just make a decision on. And so -- but I believe what's reflected in the numbers both this quarter and what we are continuing to forecast. And again, we guide to what we can see but as we continue to achieve those productivity gains throughout the year I'll be looking to give an update to that number later. Unidentified Analyst : And then just one quick follow-up; I know you don't guide to -- you know the total number of expected office openings but could you just give us maybe a rough sense -- should we expect 2018 office openings to be up from three in 2017? Chad Richison : We're very focused on the offices that we've opened upto now, the staggered approach has produced results for us as well as our focus on continuing to look for new offices and so we've opened up two so far this year, we're very focused on both development of our backfill opportunities as well as the relocation strategies of mature managers. And as we move throughout the year and identify those opportunities that work best for us, we'll definitely be making those decisions. Operator : Our next question today comes from John DiFucci of Jefferies. Please go ahead. John DiFucci : Chad, does different levers for growth and your focus has primarily been to capture new customers and that makes sense given the market and it continues to make sense and you continue to go after that. However, I'm just curious about sort of add-ons and I know typically a customer, they end up using whatever they usually buy first. But is there -- it seems like there is some low hanging fruit, especially as you buildout your portfolio of modules that you can perhaps be a little more aggressive and trying to sell more into a customer, overtime. And I'm just curious; I know you have a team inside that tries to do that but can you give us an update on that and if there is any plan to try to do that more aggressively or maybe it's working, we just not heard more about it. Chad Richison : I would like to say that we haven't been trying to do that aggressively but I mean, I would say that we have continued to try to deliver the correct software modules to each client whether that's at the beginning or whether we've developed something after the fact that we've recognized a client that's needed. What we've been focusing on is proper usage of all the additional functionalities we've developed. Often times I can tell you it is easier to get a client to buy something than to use it and it's very important with our ROI strategy that we produce pricing -- that works for the client so that they can receive the ROI out of each item and so that's what we're focused on. I will tell you this, we are focused on usage strategy and the more a client uses a product, the more apt they are to buy additional products and so we are continuing to focus on that but it's really always been a focus for us. John DiFucci : I guess another sort of on the same line question; I know you'll sell to a customer and I believe the price a customer pays is pretty consistent. And I'm just curious if there is room here for overtime for you to raise prices? It's just minimally -- call that type raises overtime and I understand customer success is most important to you but at this point is there any room for something like that? Chad Richison : It is standard in our industry, in fact I'm unaware of a company that does not have routine price increases with the exception of us, it is standard for industry. Again, we go after -- when we go out and work with the client, we want to work collaboratively with them, we want to produce spare pricing that also generates the ROI, I believe we're doing that. Now to your point, we are developing an incredible amount of additional functionality that we do update for clients every month and so as far as is there an opportunity as time goes on, there is an opportunity but I will say that I believe that it's based off of the ROI we're delivering to our client. A price increase without an ROI, I don't think it's good business and so I think that we're going to continue to focus on our usage and drive that, and I believe that's an opportunity that you've earned overtime. And so for us, we're focused on our current strategy. John DiFucci : And just a quick one for Craig; CapEx was just a little bit higher than we anticipated. I'm just curious, can you give us a little bit of guidance on how we should be thinking about that for the rest of the year? Craig Boelte : Sure. As we -- I mentioned that we're kind of coming to the completion of the fourth building and as a reminder, that building is the size of all three of our others combined. So it was a pretty large endeavor. As you see us coming to the completion of the building, you'll see elevated levels of the CapEx and after we get that completed, we would see that maybe it would moderate some -- after second quarter. Operator : And our next question today comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Albert Chi : This is Albert Chi on for Mark, congrats on the quarter. Asking about the redesigned employee self-service product; and that's great that you've gotten some pretty stellar customer service so far and especially with the employee retention; but do you think on the Paycom side that ever moves the needle for the company beyond the 91% retention rate? Chad Richison : Definitely employee usage can help drive retention, as well as client usage drives retention. We've had similar -- I would say we've been in the similar retention rate for the last six years I believe, 91%; and so that's something we continuously work on, some of the times we lose a client, it's not controllable but often times it is and it typically revolves around usage. And it's very important that clients use our products correctly, because they are somewhat different than what's out there as far as our strategy goes. As far as the employee redesign, before we had a desktop version and we used responsive coding to reflect that on a mobile device. Now we have taken the mobile for first approach to where when you're on the desktop you receive a mobile view and then when you move to mobile, it's the same type view and so it makes it easier for navigation at the employee level but it's easy for them because for employees it's work and it's something that they're having to do and so we want to make it as easy as possible so that we generate greatest amount of usage. Albert Chi : And maybe one more on the promotions, particularly the COO role. I want to know if you expect any change in sales strategy? With the new appointment it's worked really well so far but is there a preview that you can give us in terms of how the field might look going forward? Chad Richison : So as far as our COO, John has been running operations I believe since about February of last year as our Executive Vice President of Operations. His promotion into that role of COO would not change our approach to sales. We have -- I believe made improvements to both how we onboard clients and generate usage early on our product and we're going to continue to focus on that and John's going to be and has been a key component of that. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Hynes of Canaccord. Please go ahead. David Hynes : Raimo alluded to the Ceridian [ph] IPO earlier and I thought it was interesting, one of the perspective growth drivers that they were talking about was an ability to address the GIG economy, right, freelance workers, it's all about same day onboarding and getting those folks up and paid quickly and it's something I really hadn't thought of before so I'm curious, do you think that that's a real opportunity? Is it something that Paycom could and would pursue? How do you think about that opportunity impacting the market? Chad Richison : I'll let -- Ceridian [ph] strategy, what I will say is this as that we create development that's going to be used by our clients and to the extent we see something that has a significant used case, it's something we would develop. The other part that I would say is, we're not a company that has talked about what we're going to be doing, we always wait until it's developed first. So, I guess I would just leave it with that. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brent Bracelin of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Brent Bracelin : Chad, let's start with new office expansions; we've seen a couple now opening this year, they are staggered. How should we kind of think about the pace, what have you learned by staggering kind of the open -- that the new office openings and is this the type of pace that you feel matches your growth aspirations? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean -- look, we have -- with the goal of staggered office openings for us to be able to develop our bench of sales managers and just as a reminder, we do take mature sales managers, relocate them to a new office for opening it and then we backfill those mature sales managers with a sales person who is now ready to be in management. So the staggered approach allowed us to focus on development of those managers, as well as -- as we opened up new cities, it allowed us to absorb those clients and those strategies. And so we do continue to work on that, and I'm excited we've already opened up two this year, I'm also excited that our productivity gains are going according to plan and we're going to continue to focus on both of those productivity gains, as well as the back bench development and as we look to the future. Brent Bracelin : So just shifting gears, Craig, perhaps on the EBITDA margin side, obviously you guided the 39% kind of EBITDA margin at the midpoint. Entering the year you had very strong EBITDA margins here in Q1 raising EBITDA, how should we think about the full year EBITDA margins as we lookout even further, how much room do you have to kind of improve the margin profile here? And the reason why I ask is, it sounded like there were some timing issues that drove some of the upside in Q1 and so I want to put together the perspective of kind of some of the timing issues that you benefited from this quarter versus what your kind of midterm aspirations are on the margin side? Thank you. Craig Boelte : I mean, I would say it wasn't necessarily the timing but more you know, the different types of marketing initiatives that we had as it related to the sales and marketing line. R&D, we're going to continue to focus there on our -- spending there to see some efficiencies in the G&A line and we've really -- for the year we've increased our guidance to the 40% at the midpoint and we'll continue to look through efficiencies throughout the year. Brent Bracelin : And any sort of update on aspirations, what the balance is as you think about sustaining a 20%, 25% plus growth rate in this market? Is 40% EBITDA the right balance to sustain investments, to sustain 25% growth or do you think there is room for EBITDA margins to be higher than that while sustaining kind of that type of growth rate? Craig Boelte : Under the new 606 I think we were asked are we going to update our long-term EBITDA margin guidance. We're really not prepared to quite at this point but we're continuing to look at that. So we'll probably be updating that in the future. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Please go ahead. Brad Reback : Chad, quick question. Can you give us any sense how the really strong economic backdrop is helping if at all on the growth side? It purely just -- you continued market share gains? Chad Richison : Definitely, anything that impacts our clients positively I think impacts us positively now. At our scale and the way we grow this, I can't say that it's necessarily new employee or employee adds to our current client base and we rarely would see much of that. Whether it's to the positive or negative, as we've been doing this close to 20 years in the type of growth environment, and so our additions are primarily coming from new logo ads that's been -- always been the overwhelming majority of all of our revenue growth and that remained so this quarter as well. Operator : And our next question today comes from Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the differences that you're seeing across the various regions and also in terms of client sizes where you're seeing the most success? And in addition of that if you could just talk a little bit about some of those clients that were impacted by the hurricane the day this get delayed and shifted into this quarter -- does that help at all during this quarter? Chad Richison : I guess I'll attack your first question on the hurricane side; all our clients -- I mean, we didn't have any lingering effect from the hurricane in first quarter, all clients that we had had were either set up at the beginning of fourth quarter, towards the end of fourth quarter and all were definitely set up by January or in January 1; so we wouldn't have had much of a negative impact from that. As far as different regions, I mean at this point our region that does the best has the best regional manager, our city that does the best has the best city manager, ourselves -- our city sales person that does the best has the best sales person. And so there is a lot of opportunity for us in there and we're often times driving those results through both, prospecting and collaborative sales and consulted of sales. And so the impact we're going to have on any one region since there is so much business out there is going to be based on the person running it. As far as client size which is one of your other questions; our client size have been very similar, we continue to sell in range as well as above our range. But I couldn't point out to anything that is different than what we've done in the past in regards to size of client range. Mark Marcon : And then just to go back on the markets; are you still seeing like uniform levels of growth across the entire country or is there a little bit more disparity and are some of the older offices continuing to grow at a decent rate? Chad Richison : Yes, for sure, especially if we had not disrupted them. If it's a mature offer that we did not pull a manager from and put a new manager in and then maybe even take a rep out of and remove them -- and relocate them to backfill. Yes, you would continue to see growth in mature offices that have their same manager that have their same manager that wasn't disrupted. On average, I mean it's not to say you couldn't have an office that might do something similar as has done in the past but for the most part, mature offices that remain undisruptive continue to have growth within those offices. Mark Marcon : And then just on the float balance; what sort of yield do you think you're going to be able to get with the way the systems are set up relative to what's happening in terms of shorter term interest rate? Chad Richison : I mean, the interest rates have continued to tick up. I would say those are things that we try to negotiate. I will say even though the rates have changed, our investment strategy remains the same, these are client funds, we're very safe with that and we're very conservative in how we do things. However, I mean, as interest rates tick up so do overnight sweep account rates and have [ph]. So we haven't disclosed that other than to say that it is a part of the revenue that's out there, we don't disclose the specific interest and/or yield that we receive but that is something that as rates tick up should be accretive for our revenue. Operator : And our next question comes from Corey Greenbill [ph], First Analysis. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Just a quick clarification, the interest you're getting is that running through revenue? I thought it was running through other income. Chad Richison : No, it runs through revenue. Unidentified Analyst : And then I just had two quick questions on sales. First of all, could you comment on kind of the overall sort of hiring environment, like it's getting tougher to find people, everything increases in turnover or wage pressure and/or commission pressure in particular, are you think about the salesforce? Chad Richison : So speaking directly to the salesforce. First of all, across the board at Paycom anytime you're looking to find the best you have to be good at recruiting, you have to have a good comp package, you have to have a good culture and that's all very important. Specifically to the sales staff, it's always important that you have a good culture but really for sales people, it's also important you have a great product to sell. You're not going to keep good sales people if they aren't able to go out and sell a product where clients are able to convert and experience value out of it where they are happy and referable, referencable so that they can provide you referrals so that you can continue to do that. And so I do think that it's important for us to maintain our competitive advantage if we want to continue to get -- recruit our sales people. Now I will also say this as is the Paycom model, we are not someone that recruits from within the industry, so we are not dependent upon our industry to turnover their best sales people to us, we're a development organization and a development sales organization, and so we do take intelligent people who are out there who have persuasive skills and are honest and want to learn consultative selling and we teach them that and help them build a career here. Unidentified Analyst : My other question -- my sense is that at least you don't talk as much about kind of a channel strategy as some others do but could you just give us like a quick summary of are you're doing much that some of us may not aware off -- are you looking at doing things more through channel partners? Chad Richison : I don't know the term channel specifically and how you are using -- I mean, I know what it means but I'm going to try to make it more relative to our industry and specifically, us. We do referral selling where -- this is a very high touch sale in the mid-market, I mean you're not going to -- not go out and work with the client in the mid-market, it's a very high touch sale, you have to have collaborative meetings, you have to do in-depth analysis; and so for us we are always going to be the lead on that. Now that said, we have many partners who refer us into business based on references they receive from their own client base whether or not that's brokers, whether or not that's health insurance 401(k), private equity, I mean I can go on and on, other software companies that won't have you [ph]. So within certain markets of Paycom it's the manager's responsibility as well as the regional manager's responsibility to develop those relationships that they think are going to be mutually beneficial for both, the referring organization as well as us, and the client. So we do continue to focus on referral sources as well. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Schwartz : First question, just wondering if you could just provide even if it's just qualitative, any commentary on how win rates are trending when you are able to assess the competition? Chad Richison : I mean, again, win rate is going to be based on the sales person that's out there. I mean we have some sales reps that -- they rarely lose. We have some that are improving as well, and so -- but overall, I mean I think that our win rate has continued to be strong, I haven't noticed any difference in it one way or the other but we are continuing to gain market share. I think that we've had a strong quarter, I think our guide both in the next quarter and the year -- I feel good about that and we'll continue to update that as we move throughout the year. Brian Schwartz : Chad, the follow-up question that I had is really just topical on the strategic plus [ph] but it's very much a follow-up with John DiFucci's question earlier. Just all around the opportunity as a new driver for the business, monetizing within the installed base, so John pointed out correctly that you don't raise prices; we've seen in our research that you don't charge for data services and we've certainly known the cloud world here, the API world -- there is only going to be more and more data services activities that's going to take place in the future. So I guess the question is, what is kind of that trigger or the indicator that you'd look for when maybe it would make sense to maybe tap on the accelerator and look to monetize greater on the installed base versus our new customer acquisition? Thanks. Chad Richison : I mean, I would say you're -- that they are somewhat connected. I mean the value you're driving for new customers flows over once they are a current client. I mean it's the same type of thing and so -- we're very -- I think your question was at what point in time would we have made the different pricing model. We're very, very focused right now on delivering value to the client, to the extent the value we are delivering is greater than the price that we're charging, that would make sense for us to increase that price and solve that problem. Right now we're focused on solving the problem for clients through a single product that they are able to roll out to their employees for a strong usage case and change in a way their clients are using this type of technology and that's what we're focused on. We are always going to be looking at ways to deliver more value to the client in a way that both, the client and Paycom can share that in that ROI as well. And so I'll just leave that with that. Operator : And our next question comes from Shankar Subramanian of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Shankar Subramanian : Just have a question on the mature teams; last quarter you said six mature teams will come onboard this year, is the -- as I think about the teams coming on -- going to mature this year, are they more like second half greater in terms of how they -- in terms of their experience or is it more staggered across the year? And I'm thinking about how you would think about the revenue growth in the second half versus first half, trying to get an understanding of how the team -- the sales team structure changes over the year? Chad Richison : So those offices that we're talking about that were opened up in 2016 those would have been first of the year offices, that was before we started our staggered office approach and so we would be counting those six offices opened up in 2016 as mature. It is very important to note that an initial maturing office -- and office that has been opened for 24 months and just hit maturity is going to sell one amount but an office that has been opened five years, I mean they continue to mature. And so an office that might have been opened five or six years because it's going to have to sell; that office it's only been opened a couple of years, often times 2x or 3x more they are going to sell. So it's a beginning stage of maturity where they are fully staffed, they will start off with two or three reps in the first six months and then a lot of couple of more reps and then you turn the year, they are adding a couple of more. It usually takes them 24 months before they are fully staffed with a pipeline of clients that we've been going out and talking to that we've built and then they continue to mature from that point as those reps that they've brought on continue to become executive reps for us. And so those six offices we would count for initial maturity in this first quarter, as I believe most of them were open first quarter 2016. Actually I think most of them were open within about 14 days of each other. Shankar Subramanian : So my second follow-up is in terms of the competition, the question is already asked. Could you add some color as to -- are you seeing anybody new relative to this year versus last year that you need to compete with or is it pretty much the same that you've seen last year? Chad Richison : I mean, I would say it's pretty much the same competitive environment but I also want to state that it's always been competitive which is good for clients, I mean the more products you have in a marketplace, the better pricing and the better products you're going to get, the better used cases you're going to get. So we've always had new entrants into the markets, some of them hang around, some of them are gone very quickly, that's always happened, I mean I can name all types of companies in the last 20 years, this is our 20th year in business but as far as where we are gaining our clients, I mean it's typically coming from the same companies we've been talking about which often times follows the market share that each company has, that's a proportion of what we're going to see. So I can't say that anything's changed from a competitive perspective other than to say it remains as competitive as it's been in the past. Shankar Subramanian : And last question for Craig; you've talked about EBITDA margins but on a free cash flow basis I think you did a 25% free cash flow margin this year. CapEx maybe trimming down in the second half, if I look at the free cash flow margin do you see that kind of going from the 25% range like maybe to 30%, mid-30% or the long run or is there any kind of guideline you can give us on that? Craig Boelte : We really haven't guided to the free cash flow margins in the past, so I would say you're really not on that, it really depends on the CapEx. Operator : And our next question comes from Amit Lamba [ph] of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Parthiv Varadarajan : Just a quick follow-up to the previous question around cash flows. I know you don't realize you don't guide the cash flows but it came just shy of where the street was despite the EBITDA, be it -- could you give us a sense of whether there were any special items in the quarter's cash flows or anything else we should be thinking about? Craig Boelte : Not really. I think as you saw the CapEx was probably slightly elevated because we're wrapping up that building. As you see that last couple of quarters on the building, the CapEx is obviously at the highest levels during that time. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks. Chad Richison : Alright, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. Over the next few months we'll be on the road meeting with investors at the following conferences; the Jefferies Global Technology Conference on May 9 in Beverly Hills; we'll be at the JPMorgan Technology Media & Communications Conference on May 15 in Boston; we will be at the Baird Consumer Technology & Services Conferences on June 5 in New York; and finally, we will be at the Stifel Cross Sector Inside Conference on June 12 in Boston. We appreciate your continued interest in Paycom and looking forward to meeting with many of you soon. Thank you, operator. Operator : Thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded. And we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of market today which is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig. And thanks to everyone joining our call today to review our second quarter 2018 results. As with prior calls, I\u2019ll start with some comments on our achievements in the second quarter, then speak to developments at the Company as well as in the payroll and human capital management or HCM software market. Craig will then provide an update on our financials and guidance. Following that, we will open up the line for questions. Paycom\u2019s powerful and intuitive solution continues to gain market share, powering our strong second quarter results with revenue of $128.8 million, representing growth of 31% over the comparable prior year period. Our profitable model delivered adjusted EBITDA of $53.5 million, representing a 41.5% adjusted EBITDA margin. Additionally, during the second quarter, we were pleased to return value to our stockholders by repurchasing over 400,000 shares. At Paycom, our goal is to help our clients achieve success by helping them hire, engage and better manage their workforces, using the power of our technology. In our conversations with prospective clients, we see that more and more companies are becoming excited about the potential efficiencies and improvements they can attain by deploying our advanced HCM software solution. Our solution offers a broad set of capabilities that spans the entire employee lifecycle, all of which have been built organically by our internal development team. We believe our offering remains the best option in the marketplace. We also believe that we are still at the beginning of an HCM transformation through which employers experience greater return on their investment by leveraging HCM technology for their employees. Today, HCM systems are still mostly used by system operators. Employee usage remains less than optimal. At Paycom, our vision is to see substantially greater usage of HCM software among our clients\u2019 employees. This vision is supported by our years of experience converting clients from our competitors and is further supported by the broad trend of people becoming accustomed to working with self service solutions and mobile software on a daily basis. Significant employee usage of HCM systems has the potential to both increase employee satisfaction and also provide useful, reliable data to employers. However, with people spending more and more time using mobile devices, this goal is only realistic if you have an application that has the capacity to handle a wide range of innovative HCM needs and is easy to log in to and use. Paycom\u2019s mobile app is meets those requirements, providing all the functionality offered by our employee self-service desktop application. We believe the work we\u2019ve put into developing and refining our mobile app and also our overall employee usage strategy, positions us well for continued growth. On our last quarter, I highlighted our redesigned employee self-service desktop and mobile apps and how they allow our clients, employees to access every part of our solution from any device at any time. I\u2019m pleased to report that our mobile app is gaining in popularity and usage with client employees. And we are optimistic that our success in driving this usage will grow. Additionally, we continue to improve our overall offering in the second quarter, introducing several enhancements as part of our monthly updates that we roll out to our entire client base. We will continue to introduce new functionality to maintain our competitive position. We are excited about our prospects for continuing to capture market share. In an effort to generate momentum as we head into 2019, we will be investing in certain marketing initiatives in the second half of this year including a targeted national campaign that we expect to start late in Q3. Additionally, we were excited to see the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame release the 2018 Paycom Jim Thorpe Award Preseason Watch List. This list includes 35 of the nation\u2019s best defensive backs, representing 11 conferences. The Paycom Jim Thorpe Award which we are honored to sponsor, annually recognizes the best defensive backs in college football and is awarded in December. Turning to our internal growth. We also expanded our sales reach in the second quarter, opening sales offices in Columbus and San Diego. We are excited to expand our sales footprint to offer our best-in-class HCM solution to businesses in these markets. These additions bring our total sales team count to 49. On our main campus here in Oklahoma City, we completed construction of our fourth building and started to move employees into it. This 250,000 square-foot building is as large as our first three buildings combined and offers many state-of-the-art features including studio space, where we can create our own content and also a data center that will complement our existing data centers in Oklahoma City and Dallas. Regarding our Texas operations, we recently announced our plans to relocate our Texas operation center to a new facility in Grapevine, Texas. We plan on commencing construction of this new facility in 2019 and are excited about expanding our presence in Texas. Finally, I would like to provide an update regarding our executive management. We have promoted Kathy Oden-Hall, our Chief Marketing Officer to our Executive Officer team. Kathy has been instrumental to our success at Paycom, leading our marketing and PR efforts for several years and recently taking on increased responsibilities. I\u2019d like to extend to extend thanks to Kathy for her service. We look forward to her continued contributions as we grow. To sum up, our momentum continued across all areas of our business in the second quarter, and we are optimistic for our prospects for the remainder of 2018. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our second quarter results for 2018 and also our outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2018, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Also, we adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition, which required us to recast the prior period presented. Our comparisons discussed in today\u2019s call reflect those adjustments. We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense and certain transaction and other expenses that are not core to our operations. Non-GAAP net income also reflects adjustments for the effective income taxes. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures discussed today are included in the earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. We are pleased with our second quarter results with total revenues of $128.8 million, representing growth of 31% over the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins, and we are pleased with our continued excellent performance. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $126.6 million for the second quarter of 2018, representing 98.3% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 31% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $108.3 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.1%. For the full-year 2018, we anticipate that our adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 83% to 84%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $61.7 million for the quarter as compared to $49.9 million in the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2018 was $30.2 million. Adjusted R&D expense was $10.5 million in the second quarter of 2018 or 8.1% of total revenues. Total adjusted R&D cost including the capitalized portion was $14.6 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $10 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $53.5 million or 41.5% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $36.6 million or 37.2% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2017. Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $35.7 million or $0.61 per diluted share, based on approximately 59 million shares versus $20 million or $0.34 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 17.9%. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2018 was $34.8 million or $0.59 per diluted share, based on approximately 59 million shares versus $20.5 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the prior year period. We anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be 22% to 23% on a GAAP basis. On an non-GAAP basis, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be 25% to 26%. In the second quarter, we returned value to our stockholders by repurchasing over 400,000 shares, including 350,000 shares purchased in the open market. Since we initiated the repurchase program, we have repurchased over 3.3 million shares, including over 2 million shares in the open market. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 59 million shares in the third quarter of 2018. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $54.6 million and total debt of $35.3 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. As Chad mentioned, construction of our fourth building is complete. In addition, we recently announced our planned expansion in Grapevine, Texas and expect to close on the land purchase in the second half of the year. Cash from operations was $42.7 million for the second quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $960 million in the second quarter of 2018. Now, let me turn to guidance for the third quarter and full-year for fiscal 2018. For the third quarter of 2018, we expect total revenues in the range of $129 million to $131 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $45.5 million to $47.5 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 36% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2018, we are increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $554 million to $556 million or approximately 28% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We are increasing our full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $231 million to $233 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 42% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Hey. Thanks for the question. And congrats on a quarter. Chad, can you talk -- you\u2019ve started to talk a lot more about usage as a kind of way to kind of get deeper into the client base and there is a bigger focus on employees as well. Can you talk a little bit about what are you seeing in terms of our guys that you\u2019re historically have been selling to, like in the 1,000 to 2,000 employees, are those guys ready to -- those are the commentaries that we historically have seen more in the kind of the enterprise base? Chad Richison : We\u2019ve been focused on usage because -- especially at the employee level because we think that that\u2019s one of the most significant ways that our clients can drive ROI for themselves as when the employees have a direct relationship with the database, and we see that happening everywhere else in society as the digital transformation takes shape. I believe, it\u2019s been a little bit a slower to do so in our industry just because everything is so important when you are dealing with the payroll and time and attendance and benefits and what have you. And so, I think it\u2019s been a little slower, but we\u2019ve been seeing that happen. We\u2019ve been the ones pushing for that. And I definitely see that that\u2019s the right strategy in the future. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. And then, if you look at your profitability, so far this year, you\u2019ve been actually ahead of last year, but your guidance assumes quite a bit of a ramp-up in the second half. Can you talk -- I mean, you gave us like what you want to do, can you talk a little bit about timing and how much you want to spend -- not necessarily if you can, but like how much you want to spend there, because it\u2019s quite a step-up in the second half? Craig Boelte : Sure. I mean, Chad called out that in the second half we\u2019re looking at really ramping up some of our sales and marketing initiatives. And so, we would see that in the second half as well as some on the R&D, we\u2019ve always seen a step-up as well from quarter to prior year quarter in the R&D area. Raimo Lenschow : And then, last question for me is like the CapEx, like what\u2019s this -- you do purchase in the second half in Texas which will be great. Like, what\u2019s the level you think for full-year. What are you comfortable with, Craig? Craig Boelte : Yes. On the CapEx, Raimo, you saw a step down from first quarter to second quarter as we were wrapping up this building. And we called out the purchase of the Grapevine land that will occur either third or fourth quarter. But, we would expect the full year 2018 -- and Raimo, remember, we don\u2019t give guidance on CapEx but we are kind of midway through. We would expect it to be on an absolute dollar basis, similar to 2017-2018, similar. Operator : And the next question comes from John DiFucci from Jefferies. Please go ahead. John DiFucci : So, Chad, I realize that typically you get very little contribution from new sales offices. But, this quarter was such a good one. I mean, you accelerated recurring revenue growth above that over the last three quarters. So, it sort of begs the question, if you got any -- if you got a windfall or any meaningful contribution from the three new offices you opened this quarter? And if the answer is no, which usually is, when people ask that question. What is it, what do you attribute the sort of acceleration this quarter to? Chad Richison : Yes. With any quarter, our record is as far as the revenue comes in, you\u2019re always going to have the overwhelming majority of our revenue, new business revenue that comes in, this one could be from new logo adds. Your question about new offices, our new offices continue to do well as expected, but they don\u2019t react differently than what our past offices have reacted as far as contribution. I think I\u2019d mentioned this before. A year before last, we opened up six offices, and I had two sales reps outsell that six offices we opened for that year. And so, new offices will make contributions, but they are really started making their contributions past month 24 of original open day. John DiFucci : And I guess, if you can just remind us, I know -- remind us about the impact of the sales, the new business, once you sign a deal, it usually takes 60 days before it gets up and running on average, and I know that varies. But you don\u2019t start recognizing the revenue until that happens. Is that correct? So, the strength this quarter really I guess would span last quarter too. Am I making the right assumption there? Craig Boelte : You are correct in that. We do not account for revenue until it\u2019s been built and actually in this case, would have hit our count. So, you are correct in that. And you are also correct in that -- in between six weeks -- between probably six weeks, sometimes it can take a little bit longer for us to get a client up. It somewhat depends on the motivation of a client and what kind of -- I mean, how sick the patient is from a data perspective, when we go in there what all we need to fix. So, you are right on the timing as well. I\u2019m not so sure about the correlation between this quarter and last quarter as it relates to your question. But what I will say is that our revenue and our revenue makeup and what have you, the profile of that hasn\u2019t changed from quarter to quarter. John DiFucci : And then, -- so, I guess all of my questions are really around why the quarter is so strong. And I guess, this business is as usual. And it is a very strong quarter as Raimo mentioned too. Chad Richison : We\u2019ve been talking about differentiation with the product. I believe that\u2019s resonating again as people look to adopt usage of HCM technology, similarly to how they do everywhere else in their lives. I mean, I think that we are in the beginning stage of people starting to use HCM technology to really work for the business and be able to drive their own ROI. And we\u2019ve been talking about this, we\u2019ve shifted our entire Company along that strategy and we\u2019re all very focused on it. And so, I do believe that\u2019s producing strong results for us at this time. Operator : And the next question comes from Mark Murphy from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] sitting in for Mark. Congrats from me as well. And thanks for taking my question. Hey, Chad, on the same topic that John was trying to figure out, I guess, I know you don\u2019t update on the retention, dollar retention but did a better dollar retention contribute to the upside in the quarter, at all? Chad Richison : We have -- we always work on retention. I\u2019ve been talking about our retention, the efforts now since we IPOed in 2014. In our industry typically, most of your losses or a lot of your losses are going to be coming at the beginning of the year, as certain clients look to start then. You can also have losses throughout the year. And so, you know with us, we\u2019re typically -- we start-off with the retention number, we work on it extremely hard to increase it throughout the year. So far, all of our efforts on retention have produced the same result and 91% retention rate I believe for the last seven or eight years. Some of that\u2019s not controlled, but a lot of it is. And so we\u2019ve been very focused on that. It would be early right now to talk about retention impacts as far as where we are going to finish the year, but we continue to focus on that as we have in the past. And we will see how that plays out as we report our fourth quarter and full-year results at the end of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. And so, if retention is more or less constant, I guess, I would assume that productivity for mature offices is picking-up towards your, the goal of 6.5 million, which was the top performing sales teams, I guess. I mean, is that fair to assume -- how should we think about the trajectory of productivity for mature offices for the second half? Chad Richison : Yes. We are continuing to get better on sales productivity that comes from both working very hard and actually our sales managers working very hard to improve their skills set for both themselves as well as reps that they have working for them, as well as product differentiation. I mean, we continue to work aggressively on our product in order to differentiate. We think that gives reps a better opportunity when they go into meet with prospective clients, it gives them an opportunity to go in and talk with prospects that maybe we didn\u2019t get the first time around, and so as well as you continue to improve and differentiate the product. And so, I would probably point to both of those that work hand in hand, being able to have a stronger product and then, again, working on sales skills to be able to go out and produce results that increase our overall capacity on the sales department. And so, those are the areas I would point to as generating some of the gains that we had this quarter Operator : And the next question comes from David Hynes from Canaccord. Please go ahead. David Hynes : Chad, if you look back over the last, I don\u2019t know, year or two, is there any way you can quantify what kind of growth you\u2019re seeing in that -- your per employee per month landing price? The reason I asked, you continues to expand the portfolio. I think you admitted that the focus really isn\u2019t on cross-sell, upsell, the, focus is on landing large. So, I\u2019d think if that metric would be a good measurement of the success you are seeing there. So, any way to help us quantify per employee per month landing price. Chad Richison : I guess, what I\u2019d say is we haven\u2019t updated that number since IPO and we\u2019ve chosen not to do that due to competitive reasons. I can\u2019t say and answer to your question, over the past year there has not been a significant increase in the PPM from that period of time. We\u2019ve been very focused on usage, again. It\u2019s easier to sell products to clients than to get them to use it appropriately. So, we\u2019ve been really focused on that in order to help clients actually deliver the ROI that we presented to them. And that\u2019s been our focus. So, as we continue to get greater usage, does that allow us to sell other products that they didn\u2019t have? Well, certainly it does. And can you really sell additional products to someone who isn\u2019t using a large percentage of the products that they currently have? I mean, well, you can, but it just doesn\u2019t help them meet the objective for the business. So, we want to be a partner in that. So, that\u2019s been our focus. It\u2019s been usage. And I think that\u2019s making a difference in both how our current clients use the product, as well as us being able to leverage them as references as we go out into the field and work with new prospect opportunities. David Hynes : And then, Craig, maybe one for you. Gross margins jumped out as pretty strong in the quarter, I think they were up almost 200 basis points year-over-year. I know it seems like you kicked maybe the range of guidance for the year a bit. Anything, onetime in nature that drove the gross margins frankly in Q2? And historically, we see gross margins pick up even more in Q3 and Q4. Why would that not be the case again this year? Craig Boelte : Yes. On the gross margin, we\u2019ve always been in the 82% to 84% range, and we did tick that up to 83% to 84%. The greatest impact on that gross margin is just the timing of when the hires come in. We bring people in and it takes them a while to ramp up and learn to be able to take on the clients and then they will take on a few and then ramp to full capacity. So, some of that\u2019s in timing. I don\u2019t know that I would read a lot into that moving towards the third and fourth quarter other than it kind of ranges between that 83% and 84%. And one thing I\u2019d call up kind of as a housekeeping matter, last quarter, we called out our stock comp at being in that 5 million to 6 million range. This quarter, it was slightly lower than that. So, just for modeling purposes, I wanted to keep that in that range, so. David Hynes : Keep it in the 5% to 6% range? Craig Boelte : Yes, in the 5% to 6%. We had some forfeitures true-up second quarter that caused it a little lower. Operator : And the next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : Chad, you\u2019ve always emphasized usage. I was wondering, can you dimensionalize some of the progress that you\u2019re making with regards to increased usage, like how should we think about it or how do you measure it, and how are you thinking about it in terms of how it should trend over the course of this year? Chad Richison : Yes. So, I think there\u2019s a huge opportunity for us in usage, I think from an industry as a whole, I would say usage amongst that employee base. And I\u2019m talking about what could employees use that they or not, I would say usage amongst the employee base from an industry as a whole has been low. I would say that until we really started focusing on our usage strategy, ours was also low to anemic. However, we focus very much on it. We\u2019ve continued to generate great usage out of it. But, we\u2019re not -- where we want to be with usage and having clients really leverage the software out there so that employees can have a direct relationship with the database that makes it easier for everybody. And so, we\u2019re still focused on that. So, we\u2019re still at the early innings of even usage strategy. And with greater usage, you create more product from that because once someone is using a full set of your product, you\u2019re able to identify other areas of our ROI that you can impact for that business. And I see usage in our product continuing to increase at the employee level as we move forward. Mark Marcon : Does that change at all, like who you are having the most success against in terms of gaining new clients from? Chad Richison : No, I wouldn\u2019t say. Well, I can go ahead and tell you that for us it\u2019s been the usual suspects as far as our business wins. We are -- I think some conversations are starting to change in both the C Suite and HR departments as they notice different types of technologies where -- that they can actually leverage for themselves. And a lot of this can be even task management. Some things in our industry, they are not like to do, they are have to do. You don\u2019t really have a choice. I mean, you might not want to do it, but you have to. They are mandated. And so, when we can put greater or better technology in someone\u2019s hand that allows for a greater accuracy, in those types of situations that is very beneficial to the client base. And so, I see, as we are able to move from even the have to, to the want tos, I think we will continue to see greater and greater increase in usage. But you\u2019ve got to start with those have tos. I mean people have to enroll in benefits. They have to collect time, they have to request time off, they have to get their COBRA benefits. I mean, I can go on and on. These are the things -- they have to do expense reports. I mean, these are the things that individuals have to do as part of working for a business. And so, we continue to stay focused on that. And I do see opportunities for us to continue to increase usage from here. And quite frankly, I\u2019d be very disappointed if we\u2019re not continuing to do that as we\u2019ve done in the past. Mark Marcon : And then, any dimension with regards to the additional marketing spend, how we should think about it? Chad Richison : We have a marketing strategy. The thing about marketing is you can waste a lot of money in marketing and advertising if you are not measuring it and you are not getting the return from it. So, we do have ambitious marketing objectives as we\u2019ve had every year here at Paycom. We are going to be embarking on another national strategy. We have one similar to this last year that we embarked on. We\u2019re doing that again, as we\u2019ve talked about, in the second and third quarter in an effort to get some momentum as we head into 2019 as well as differentiate the product and the new message. So, we look forward to getting out there in the coming quarters with that message. Operator : And the next question comes from Brent Bracelin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Clark on for Brent. Chad, I think something that we\u2019ve seen so far this year is that businesses are assuming kind of healthy and are interested in some modernization efforts. I was wondering if there is anything to call out in terms of customers that might be interested in the non-primary products, maybe the talent side and whether you\u2019ve seen an increased willingness or interest to kind of do the modernization all at once, if they had no talent system or a legacy system they might be looking to improve upon? Anything you could talk about that momentum. Chad Richison : Yes. I can tell you that I think it\u2019s been a trend that HCM has become more and more prevalent in what was primarily a payroll and labor management industry, payroll and time and labor management. You started to see the proliferation of HCM products start to move into the midmarket. These products were primarily reserved for the enterprise level market prior too. And so, I\u2019d say this is a trend that\u2019s really been happening for the last five plus years, the HCM continuing to increase. And that would include the talent management side as people develop processes to be able to implement talent management type procedures. Meaning that we can sell you the talent management product but if you don\u2019t have a strategy for managing talent or have not adopted a strategy that our product automates, you are not going to really have a lot of usage and it\u2019s not going to be part of what impacts your business. So, we are seeing -- it\u2019s an education -- it\u2019s both an education on why should people do background checks. You would be surprised how many businesses out there these days don\u2019t do a background checks, and if the ones that do, they might do it on 10% of their employee base. So, these best practices that were primarily reserved for larger companies, you are now starting to see work themselves through into the midmarket as a best practice, as it becomes attainable for them through the technology that\u2019s available today. And we believe that we are at the lead of that. Unidentified Analyst : And then, a question for Craig. Sales and marketing came in lower than we were estimating. Is there anything you could call out in terms of that line item? Was there any kind of the push out of the marketing campaign in terms of maybe expecting to starting this quarter and now for the second half or any color on that regard? Craig Boelte : I mean, no, nothing that we pushed the third quarter. Chad did mention, we are going to have some additional initiatives starting in fourth quarter of this year. Operator : And the next question comes from Brad Reback from Stifel. Please go ahead. Brad Reback : Chad, given mobile product seems to be becoming an increasingly meaningful point of differentiation in the market, first and foremost, do you see it helping you win deals? And then number two, down the road, do you see additional monetization opportunities with that? Chad Richison : Yes. I do believe it\u2019s helping us. Again, the mobile products is the reflection of our overall software. It\u2019s just an easier way for employees to access. We have the desktop version and then obviously we have the mobile. So, mobile devices have become prevalent in the world today. And so, we are able to leverage that. Are there opportunities that we\u2019ve identified that can allow us to not just increase usage but increase revenue opportunities for us, which also increases additional ROI for our clients? There sure are. But, again, we\u2019re very focused on delivering, not only that, but making sure that the clients are using the products that they have available to them today. Because we also believe as part of this process, clients can get greater returns on their investment in Paycom, if they will use the full system. And that\u2019s really what we want people to do, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been embarking on. And then, once people have done, that does generate additional opportunities. But I will say that right now we have some very significant mandated videos that\u2019s in our LMS content right now. If I cannot get a specific client to watch videos which are somewhat mandated and very timely, I really can\u2019t sell them anything else after that, as it relates to content. I\u2019ve got to get people to use the content that\u2019s there before you can create additional, that will be meaningful to them. Does that mean we\u2019re not creating content? No, we\u2019re continuing to create content. And answer to your question, I do believe that we will have a greater success in the future with all of our products as we increase usage at the employee level. Operator : And the next question comes from Ryan MacDonald from Needham and Company. Please go ahead. Ryan MacDonald : So, I guess, following up on a little bit of the answer from the last question. You are now a few quarters into this -- the learning content offering. Can you just talk about what you\u2019ve seen thus far and sort of usage and how that\u2019s been trending for the content you\u2019ve created, and perhaps to the extent that you can talk about the roadmap for that -- for creating additional content into the back half of this year and early 2019? Chad Richison : Yes. We\u2019re focused on content creation. I just brought that up as one product as an example of -- there are certain mandates that you definitely want employees to experience through their content as well as you want to test them on, certify them, make sure they\u2019ve completed the course as my comment earlier was. We\u2019re still at the early ages of getting people to do the mandated things, much less the additional items that people will want to train on that makes sense for them in their specific industries. And so, we do continue to develop content. I do believe that LMS, which is I would say one of the -- a newer areas definitely for our business and I believe -- of HCM definitely for our business and for the midmarket at large, I do think that being an area that will be able to be leveraged by not just us but definitely the client base, as well as even opportunities for other competitors out there, as the market shifts to a more knowledgeable workforce and the way people -- not just is at the way that the new generation comes up, not just is it different the way they use technology, they learn differently. You\u2019re not going to get a whole lot out of a two-hour course with the millennial. And so, there\u2019s other things that you learn along the way of how people learn and what\u2019s available to them. So, we\u2019ve been focused on all that as we go to market. Ryan MacDonald : And then, just a quick follow-up. I guess more broadly, as you look at the group of offices that are reaching full maturity this year and perhaps comparing them or looking back to the last year or the group two years ago. Anything anecdotally that you\u2019re seeing in terms of what some of the new offices might be doing better or maybe accelerating more quickly, again, versus looking in the past and sort of how those offices have ramped up or how they\u2019ve acted or performed at full maturity? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, consistent with what I\u2019ve described in the past, your best offices have your best managers. Your best new offices have your best new office managers. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a territory agnostic. There is so much opportunity for us in the territories that we are in. You are going to see that your best offices are managed by our best people. Operator : And the next question comes from Corey Greendale from First Analysis. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale : Just two questions on the ad campaign. Chad, I hear you loud and clear that there needs to be measurable outcomes. and I\u2019ve heard varying philosophies from folks in the space about the value of mass market advertising. Can you just give us a sense as to what you\u2019re hoping to accomplish? Is it just brand recognition? Is it driving leads or what other metrics? Chad Richison : Yes. Again, I think that what we are talking about -- and I don\u2019t want to give away too much on what we are doing on our marketing. I mean, it\u2019s a competitive situation. We are in a very competitive industry. Competition is good for the consumer. So, I don\u2019t want to give too much away other than to say that we are focused on not only branding Paycom but branding the message of -- there is a new digital transformation here for our industry. And it\u2019s time that everybody -- us included and clients and prospects and competitors, embrace that. There is a new way that people are going to be using these products in the future, we\u2019re seeing it another areas. And so, part of our advertising and marketing efforts support not only to Paycom brand but the change in what we believe will be the new future for how people use these types of technologies. Corey Greendale : And then, one for Craig. Could you give us a sense -- I\u2019m just wondering how much the change in interest on client balances might have affected the results in the quarter, just some sense of did that grow faster or slower than recurring revenue growth or is some -- however you can provide info on that? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, we gave the total number of the average daily balance outstanding for the quarter. There was a one rate increase during the quarter was towards the end of the quarter, June 15th. So, that was really the only a rate increase for the quarter. Other than that, we remain the way always have been. We are fairly conservative with our investment on those funds there, client funds. And so, there is really nothing to change in our strategy on investments. Corey Greendale : So, my interpretation [ph] that means it didn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t a meaningful driver of sequential acceleration in recurring revenue growth, is that accurate? Chad Richison : That would be accurate. Operator : And then, the next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Market. Please go ahead. Ross MacMillan : Actually I just wanted to follow up on that point, Craig. I look at like LIBOR rates, and they were up. I think you talked historically like a 25 basis points is just a little shy of annualized couple of million. So, I just wanted to make sure, is that still the right ballpark? And then what are the primary instruments in which you hold client funds? Craig Boelte : We are not going to go through and I think disclose or we are not going to disclose the instruments that we use other than our strategy hasn\u2019t changed. I will tell you, your numbers are little bit off now that our balance has increased that less than $2 million actually now or for 25 basis, we will be getting closer to $2.4 million, $2.5 million in annualized revenue from that Where it was previously lower was due to the balance being lower. But, our approach to how we invest those funds has been the same and very consistent. We haven\u2019t hidden the fact that an increase in interest rates are nothing but accretive to both our revenue, as well as our adjusted EBITDA. It didn\u2019t take us more effort to get 30 basis points than what it does to get 25 basis points. And so, we do continue to receive and have a positive impact and lift as interest rates increase. If you\u2019re trying to look at okay, exactly how much does that play into a quarter, I think you have to look at when is that layered in some banks? You don\u2019t necessarily get it right away. So, you can even negotiate it ahead of time, potentially if they know what\u2019s coming, And so, -- but for us, our approach to these and how we work with client funds has been one of not being aggressive. And we\u2019ve maintained that same position today as it relates to what we do with those client funds. Ross MacMillan : That\u2019s clear. Thanks for that Chad. Maybe just one follow-up Chad for you. I was just curious in terms of your net new wins, how you describe the size of those customers in terms of average employees. Are they staying pretty consistent with what you\u2019ve seen in recent quarters or any marginal shift one way or the other? Chad Richison : They\u2019ve been consistent with past quarters, which would include continuing to sell some at the upper end of our range as we\u2019ve used to disclose in the past. Operator : And the next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. This is Will on behalf of Siti. I just wanted -- from a product standpoint, you talked about your focus on employee usage, and then recently updated your UI and mobile apps. Could you share any feedback so far from customers on that? And then, just wondering if you expect this to drive more cross-selling of your products overall? Chad Richison : Yes. The feedback from the client base has been good, very good. We do monitor employee feedback as employees of our client base goes in and reviews and gives us feedback. So, we are definitely continuous -- what we are continuously making changes to that software to make it easier to navigate and easier to use at the employee level. Again, we do see opportunities for us to continue to add not just to the app but it\u2019s to the overall product. Again, the app is a device used to gain access to the overall solution. And so, as we go through and we add strategies and develop products for those strategies, it would be for the entire product. leverage through the employee app. Operator : The next question comes from Shankar Subramanian from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Shankar Subramanian : Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on a great quarter. I just want to touch upon the new office openings. So, can you update us on your thoughts on what should we expect for second half? And maybe even beyond that and in terms of where you have in terms of penetration of offices across the U.S. and how much more should we expect in the next two quarters and maybe beyond? Chad Richison : So, as we haven\u2019t done in the past, we haven\u2019t guided to when we are opening up offices, other than to say we\u2019re continuing to focus on our sales strategy, which does include opening up additional offices. But, we are also very focused on increasing sales capacity. We start with the problem, what problem are we looking to solve. And for us, we believe we have quite a bit of runway in front of us of collecting prospects that don\u2019t currently use us and making them current clients. We have certain geographies that we do not exist in and we have other geographies that we can continue to expand in even further as some of our larger cities. So, as we move throughout the year when it makes sense for us, that would be something we would look to do, would be to open up other offices if it makes sense for us at that time. But for us too, we are very focused on continuing to increase the capacity of our sales force. And so, we are definitely focused on that as well. Shankar Subramanian : This would be on the mobile side. Obviously, you are going to run more campaign in the second half and you are seeing better traction among your customer base within the same number of employees. But, do you see mobile kind of opening up your products to beyond the current customer segment to maybe more employees? Chad Richison : We are a business to business product, we\u2019re very much focused on delivering ROI for businesses that exist here in the U.S. And so, that\u2019s what we are focused on. To the extent we can do that in a way that benefits employees in other areas, we would definitely be looking to do that. But we are focused in making an impact on our clients\u2019 bottom line. And I believe that\u2019s what clients choose Paycom. And again, our effort is trying to increase that ROI that any client can achieve with Paycom. And if we identified something that allows a client to do that through employee usage, that would be something we would look to develop. Shankar Subramanian : And then, lastly, on the benefit side, it seems like they is an increasing trend for at least certain customers to go and use the third party benefit administration tool like planned source or business model and so on. How do you see from your customer base, what\u2019s your feedback been in terms of how to use the benefit solution? Do they feel comfortable with what they have seen? And maybe your thoughts on maybe partnering with third party providers on that front. Chad Richison : Yes. So, we have our own benefits administration module within the same software that we have. It\u2019s ours, we developed it, it\u2019s part of the same data base. We\u2019ve had clients on it for some time now. I don\u2019t know the number of years but I mean it\u2019s not a brand new product for us. We are probably four to five years in on benefits administration. As a reminder, we do not provide healthcare coverage or vision or dental to our clients. We help aid them in the choice that they make for those vendors and as part of that. You do have to send the files feeds to those third parties which would be your health insurance company, your dental insurance vision live and what have you. And so, we continue to do today and then after the fact note, where we are taking the clients our files and getting those to the appropriate vendor. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Schwartz : The one question I had was just around the context in terms of the revenue guide for Q3, the sequential growth rate. It\u2019s not much there. So, just wanted to double check with you to see if any business was pulled forward here into 2Q from 3Q. And then, the second question on the second half business, maybe just any overall comments that you can share with us Chad on how the pipeline momentum is trending and how the lead funnel is filling up for you as you look out into the second half of the year? Craig Boelte : On the first question, to the extent it pulled forward into Q2, it would still exist in Q3 from a starts perspective. I think, that may have been the question on that\u2026 Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, our outlook on guidance is similar to how we\u2019ve been in the past as well. Craig Boelte : We guide to what we can see, our approach hasn\u2019t changed. And then your second part of that\u2026 Chad Richison : It was on the pipeline. I like to see starts, I like to see pipelines turn into starts. If I see too large of a pipeline, and I\u2019m looking for the starts. And so, we continue to have strong momentum in our sales department. I\u2019ve been excited not just about sales but our conversion departments, our R&D department, our Paycom Specialist department. Everybody has been galvanized this year and actually started last year, really galvanized around the same message and what we\u2019re looking to accomplish. And I really think that\u2019s created an opportunity for us to really have a great year this year as we\u2019re seeing as we head to second quarter. Brian Schwartz : Just to be clear on that first question. So, I know I mentioned [Indiscernible], but just thinking about deals and how the deals were showing up from one quarter to the next. So, it sounds from your commentary, there was anything unusual in terms of where the deals were showing up this quarter? Chad Richison : I will say this. It matters when a deal starts, it does matter. I mean, if you start a deal in the beginning of a quarter, you get 100% of the revenue dollars for it. If you started the last month of the quarter, the most you are going to get is a third of those revenue dollars for that same deal. But it does matter but it\u2019s hard to forecast because we work with the client. We often times work with the client and it\u2019s their timeline, different things come up. And so, it\u2019s hard and really somewhat dangerous to try to get too myopic on it, something going to start May 1st versus June 12th. But that can impact your revenue for any one quarter. And so, we\u2019ve always -- in our guidance, we\u2019ve always guided to what we can see and what the expectations are. And then as we move through that quarter as things change, those are reflected in the final numbers. And so, our approach to third quarter is no different than it has been in the past. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Chad Richardson for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. And next month we\u2019ll be on the road meeting with investors at the following conferences. We\u2019ll be at the Oppenheimer Technology Internet and Communications Conference in Boston on August 7th. We will be at Canaccord Growth Conference in Boston on August 8th. We will be at the KeyBanc Capital Markets Global Technology Leadership Forum in Vail, Colorado on August 14th. I appreciate everyone\u2019s interest in Paycom. We look forward to meeting with many of you soon. Operator, you may disconnect. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of market today which is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks Craig. And thanks to everyone joining our call today to review our third quarter 2018 results. I\u2019ll start with some comments on the progress we achieved during the third quarter, along with some developments in our business and how we view the market for the payroll and human capital management or HCM software industry. Craig will then provide an update on our financials and guidance. Following that, we will open the line for questions. We had an excellent third quarter. Our momentum continued us companies across a wide range of industries and geographies turned the Paycom to help them achieve success. Third quarter revenue of $133.3 million represented growth of 32% over the comparable prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $49.2 million representing a 37% adjusted EBITDA margin. During the third quarter we returned value to our stockholders by repurchasing over 30,000 shares. Our success is being driven by the employee digital transformation that has come to the HCM industry. Employees of clients using the Paycom solution have a direct relationship with the database. This is the way it works with all consumer-based technology. So employees are already accustomed to it. This is the Paycom model today and is expected to be the model for all in the future. HCM products where employees do not have a direct relationship with the database will find it challenging to maximize ROI for business. We have been working on executing this vision for several quarters and it's really starting to drive results across the board both with new sales and also with helping existing clients leverage the Paycom system to enhance their operations. We believe the industry is at the beginning of this wholesale transition and that Paycom is leading the charge. As we continue our mission of helping clients improve their businesses with our best-in-class HCM solution, we are enjoying increasing traction with larger companies. Due to this, we are pleased to announce that we are expanding our proactive sales efforts from targeting firms with 50 to 2000 employees to targeting firms with 50 to 5000 employees. We have had great success selling to organizations above the 2000 employee level as word-of-mouth about the Paycom solution frequently pulls in larger company leads to our sales group. With this change we are announcing today empowers our sales representatives to proactively target companies in this expanded segment and we are excited by this incremental opportunity. We have many clients in this segment already and several clients larger than 5,000 employees. So we are confident that our solution will compete and serve these clients effectively. Our marketing team is working hard to enlarge your sales funnel. As many of you have seen, we launched an extensive marketing campaign in the third quarter highlighted by our national TV commercial and also featuring digital radio, digital video, and social media. In addition, we are covering major market airports and estimate our commercials and other campaign assets will be seen over 280 million times. In fact, the first week of the campaign delivered nearly 30 million impressions alone. We believe these marketing efforts will continue to elevate our brand. Importantly, this commercial doesn't just advertise the Paycom solution but demonstrates the way employees will interact with HCM technology of the future. Our growth continues to gain recognition. In August, Paycom was ranked fifth on Fortune Magazine's 2018 100 Fastest-Growing Companies list of domestic and foreign publicly traded companies based on revenue growth, profit, and stock returns over the past three years. This was the second consecutive year we've made the prestigious list. We were the only software as a service technology provider in the payroll and human capital management industry to place in the top 100 and landed on the list above company such as Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. We were excited to see the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame announced a list of semi finalist for the Paycom Jim Thorpe Award which is presented annually to the top defensive back in college football. The three finalists will be announced on November 19, and the winner will be announced live on December 6 on ESPN. Finally I would like to highlight that we recently celebrated our 20th year of business. I want to thank all of our dedicated employees and loyal clients for their support in this journey. I'm very proud of all that we have achieved over this period of significant growth. Today, I am more confident than ever that we have the right people, product and culture to continue our success. To sum up, Paycom is leading the digital transformation of the HCM industry and this leadership is reflected in our strong results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our third quarter results for 2018 and also our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, I would like to remind everyone in my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Also we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 utilizing the full retrospective method of transition which required us to recast the prior period presented. Our comparisons discussed in today's call reflect those adjustments. We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense and certain transaction and other expenses that are not core to our operations. Non-GAAP net income also reflects adjustments for the effects of income taxes. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures discussed today are included in the earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. We were pleased with our third quarter results with total revenue of the $133.3 million representing growth of 32% over the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins and we are pleased with our continued improvement in sales productivity. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $130.8 million for the third quarter of 2018 representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 31% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $111.5 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 84%. For the full-year 2018 we anticipate that our adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 84% to 85%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $70.7 million for the quarter as compared to $49.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2018 was $35.2 million. As Chad mentioned, sales and marketing expense was elevated this quarter and we expect that it will be elevated in the fourth quarter due to our national advertising campaign. Adjusted R&D expense was $11.3 million in the third quarter of 2018 or 8.5% of total revenues. Total adjusted R&D cost including the capitalized portion were $16.1 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $10.8 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $49.2 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $40.4 million in the third quarter of 2017. Our GAAP net income for the third quarter was $28.8 million or $0.49 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares versus 20.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter 2018 was 21%. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2018 was $30.6 million or $0.52 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares versus 23.2 million or $0.39 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares in the prior year period. We anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 21% to 22% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 25% to 26%. In the third quarter we returned value to our stockholders by repurchasing over 30,000 shares including over 11,000 shares purchased in the open market. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 59 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2018. Turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $85 million and total debt of $34.8 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $45.5 million for the third quarter reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $888 million in the third quarter of 2018. Now let me turn to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year for fiscal 2018. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect total revenues in the range of $142.5 million $144.5 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 26% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $49.5 million to $51.5 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2018 we're increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $558.5 million to $560.5 million or approximately 29% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We are increasing our full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $233 million to $235 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 42% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Chad can we talk a little bit about the changes you announced - you mentioned earlier in terms of where sales people can sell. Going up from the 2000 as this kind of the sealing up to 5000, obviously a big step for you can you just double click on that little bit like part of that reason why you were in 2000 is because there is more service model where as you go to 5000 it\u2019s more a software model and then also the other things like your concerns in the past were a little bit it seems you remember that you know it\u2019s kind of big elephant hunting and it\u2019s kind of difficult to get the sales velocity that you wanted. Can you talk a little bit what kind of drove your decision here? Chad Richison : Yes, and so thanks Raimo. I will point out that we use to highlight deals that we sold above our range of 2000 employees on the earnings calls. We continue to highlight them until about a year, a year and a half ago or so as we continue to bring them in. And so all that's to say that this is in a new territory for us, we continue to be driven up market through request. We've both sold and converted several above our range this past quarter. And so this is really our proactive sales efforts as I've spoken before our sales reps proactively target companies that have between 50 and 2000 employees as we are pulled up above that range we do sell them. Now we have as we continue to be pulled up range, as well as our products become easier to sell. We are now allowing reps to proactively target those companies from 2000 to 5000 as well. Raimo Lenschow : And then last quarter you talked a little bit about the focus on - slightly different sales motion and the focus on usage. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw this quarter in terms of the organization getting comfortable around that and success stories there? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean our product is - I guess I would say increasing - we\u2019re increasing the gap of differentiation between our product and what we believe is out there in the marketplace. It's making it easier to sell and honestly I'll be updating the sales capacity number next quarter. This year a record that was set a couple of years ago by a sales rep that have been here 10 years has already been broken by a rep that\u2019s been with us for 14 months and we\u2019ve still got months left in this year . And so our newer reps we\u2019re having lot more success with them as we made it easier for prospective clients to recognize the advantages they receive from using this type of technology. And so we\u2019re having some success with that as well. Operator : Next question will be from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John DiFucci : Chad my first question is more of a competition question and I think a lot in the investment community have been talking more about ADP. And ADP is talking about slightly better retention rates and that they pulled most of their midmarket customers to SaaS - their internal SaaS solutions now. And I'm just curious is that has that changed at all I mean ADP has been a source of customers not only for you but for others in the business. And I'm just curious if that's changed at all your go-to-market what you sense on a competitive front from ADP? Chad Richison : Yes, I\u2019m not going to get into each competitive or alternatives to us individually but what I would say is kind of go back to the prior statement I made. We have created further differentiation and we widened the gap between Paycom and other products. And how someone is going to use the Paycom product is going to be different than how they are using these other traditional providers. And so I wouldn't say that there is any change to that as far as how our value proposition is able to impact any of our competitor\u2019s clients. John DiFucci : And I guess let's sort of follow-up to Raimo question going after the 2 to 5K employee customers. Has there been a change in the customer base because one of the reasons I think you and others don't tend to go bigger is because bigger customers demand customization, more customization and I think lot of your and their customers when you do sign them has said, hey listen, we\u2019re going to go with your best practices, you do it you're the expert we\u2019re new there. Are you seeing more bigger customers accepting of SaaS solution that has best practices that perhaps doesn't want to go and customize and have a lot of services around it. Is that something - is that any change you are seeing in the market or you just - that's trying to get to again what Raimo said about like the reason that it makes sense to do that now? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean we continue to see a progressive attitude towards larger companies that believe that they can implement these types of solutions. And we\u2019ve seen that for a while. I have again I have continued to highlight since 2014 and talk about the fact that we continue to sell businesses at the top end and above our range. And so we\u2019ve had so much success with that we are now allowing sales reps to proactively target that. Do I think that's going to change the way our sales reps approach their territory, no, because you still have a limited number of prospects in your territory in the range from 2000 to 5000 as you look at any one sales reps, any one sales rep. And so, I believe that we stayed in this range, we've increased our value proposition. We continue to be hold further up market because one thing you have to realize is and some of these products we can go into a client and ask them to show us how their employees used the product, it can take them 20 minutes to pull everything up. And in Paycom's product its one solution, it\u2019s on the app and desktop. And so at some point you look at what's the difference between an employee that works at a 2000 employee company or an employee that works at a 4000 employee company. There is not a large difference there and so again we had success in the market and this is just us allowing our sales reps to proactively approach that market. John DiFucci : And thanks Chad, and just - I'm sorry I\u2019m going to ask one follow-up because I\u2019m a little perplexed with the stock action after [indiscernible] by the way. But going after this market this isn\u2019t that - is this have any - is it has anything to do with your existing business starting to show I mean that the numbers look good to me. But show any kind of weakness where you think you need to expand or is this like an incremental opportunity? Chad Richison : Absolutely not, this is an incremental opportunity and again I will say as I had highlighted in the past, we\u2019re already in this market, we\u2019re just making it official for our sales reps. Operator : Next question today will be from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Matt Coss : This is Matt Coss on behalf of Mark Murphy, thanks for taking my question. Craig you mentioned you\u2019re pleased with continued improvement in sales productivity. Are there any specific metrics you can point to that make you feel this way about sales productivity? And then you also mentioned your 880 million average daily float balance. Can you share with us the rate that you earned on that and any expectations for the rate you might earn on that going forward that\u2019s contemplated in your guidance? Chad Richison : Yes. So I\u2019ll kind of start with the first one metrics on sales productivity. I think one of the biggest metrics on sales productivity is revenue production which is reflected in our numbers that we reported this quarter. I've given you something a little bit anecdotal and talking about how our new reps are having so much success. As a reminder, last year our sales rep of the year was a rookie. This year as I pointed out a rep that\u2019s been with us 14 months is going to set a single record and maybe more of them by the way. We we\u2019re still a couple months away from year-end but one rep has already surpassed a record that was set by a 10-year rep a couple years ago. And so, we have made it easier to sell as we have been able to deliver stronger ROI that\u2019s easier to identify from the client. In regards to the float that we make of, that's not something that we\u2019ve disclosed specifically Craig I don\u2019t know if you want to provide any more color on that. Craig Boelte : Yes, I mean that\u2019s a rate that we have not disclosed in the past. As we mentioned in the past those are client funds and like typically are invested in a short duration. We don't - it would be dangerous to include in our guidance any future rate increases so we do not do that. Chad Richison : But I will also say this is that our approach to interest rate and how we manage that has not changed from one quarter to the last. Operator : Next question today will be from Mark Marcon with R. W. Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sales and marketing efforts. Just wondering how much is incremental as we look at just this past third quarter and looking to the guidance in terms of the fourth quarter, how much more are you spending for that relative to the sales? And within sales separately from that, are you adding any additional people to the teams to go after this new market opportunity in terms of the up market? Chad Richison : Okay. I'll answer your last question first. And the answer to that would be, no. Our sales teams are the same size as they've been in the past. The only change we've made is allow them to go up to 2,000 to 5,000. Craig Boelte : Yes, and in terms of the sales and marketing, we don't break up the marketing piece separately Mark, but we did see - we started running the ads towards the end of the third quarter so we had some cost in the third quarter but the majority of those are going to fall into the fourth quarter. I mean if you look at our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance, it's very similar to where we finished last year as a percent of revenue and yet we've been able to fit in this significant marketing effort. Mark Marcon : I guess the question is the margin will be about similar, should we - I mean, and they're obviously impressive margins. So should we think on a go-forward basis basically that the EBITDA growth is basically going to be more in line with revenue growth or is there further potential for scale or leverage? Chad Richison : You know, Mark, there's been quarters where we've spent millions of dollars on a national advertising campaign as we've talked about both third and fourth quarter of this year. And then there's been quarters where we've spent zero on this type of campaign. And so those are levers we pull. We pull those levers when we feel like we can gain market share and continue because we're growth Company and we're very focused on growth and we have great opportunity. And so, we're spending these dollars because we believe it's going to set us up very well for 2019. But it is a lever to the extent we spend the money we do expect the revenue. It is something we measure. If it works it's something we would do again. And early indications are things are going well. But it also should have a commensurate revenue achievement tied to it. So when you're talking about impact on margins, I think what we're really talking about as it relates to our fourth quarter guidance is, we're spending ahead of any revenue achieved. I mean the campaign's been going out on for a little bit now. I can't attribute one dollar in revenue to it, I can't attribute leaves and what have you. But you know our sales cycle and you know our conversion process. And so to think that we would start advertising toward sometime in third quarter and we would have already had revenue for that, obviously we wouldn't. And so this is about an opportunity that we believe we had, also it's an education piece. We are educating a new way to use HCM technology. And so that's what we're doing. Mark Marcon : The reason for the question, Chad, was just basically the guidance would imply lower margins for the fourth quarter of this year relative to a year ago, and it does seem to me that you are spending ahead of the revenue when you've always successfully converted it. But I was just trying to get an order of magnitude or just understand that a little bit better. Chad Richison : Yes, so I don't remember exactly the national advertising campaign. We had a smaller one last year. I don't know that it ran all the way through fourth quarter and it definitely wouldn't have been anywhere close to the type of the spend that we're doing on this type of advertising campaign. And again this is something that we talked about with our last earnings announcing. Mark Marcon : And then last one, just in terms of moving up, did the sales force request that that they could move up? Chad Richison : Yes, in 2008. Operator : Next question will be from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Unidentified Speaker : This is Kevin on for Brad. Thanks for taking the question. Just on your go-to-market with this expanded base, will there be any change in the sales strategy for going after these customers up market or perhaps different incentive structures? Chad Richison : No, there is not any change to the strategy now, when you're saying change to the strategy, there is an approach that you might take differently with a smaller business than what you are a larger business. When we're talking about a company that has 2000 employees or a company that has 4,000 employees, there is not much of a different approach on that. What can make a deal complex is not necessarily size, but oftentimes industry and certain portions of what they're trying to achieve on either the payroll labor, time and labor side and so I don't see any change to our model. And again this is something we've been doing anyway. So we're just making it official for the sales reps. Operator : Next question will be from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale : I wanted to ask about that topic as well with the - I just wanted to - I'm pretty sure you're saying no change in terms of how you're sort of bifurcating or splitting the sales force, in other words you don't add salespeople specifically going after the high end, just want to verify that that's true and is there any change in the profile of reps you're hiring or in the training or on-boarding process as you expand the addressable size? Chad Richison : No change to any of that. The only change here is permission, which was already granted should someone call us. Corey Greendale : So in terms of like managing sales cycle or how sales managers are working with reps, they say, hey, you should get like these quick hit victories with smaller customers and not totally focused on the high end, our only focus is anything like that happening in terms of tactics or coaching? Chad Richison : No, I mean again we convert - we sold several deals in this range last quarter. We converted, implemented in their current clients this quarter. And so - and you can go back quarter-upon-quarter in the past and it's been the same. And so whenever you're doing a conversion, it's important to focus on each client individually and that's what we do. When it comes to conversion every deal is a snow flake. I mean they look like they're the same, but they're not. Corey Greendale : And then just one quick one for Craig. The non-GAAP G&A increased more in Q3 than we ordinarily see, what drove that and what we should expect in Q4? Craig Boelte : The non-GAAP G&A - sure, the non-GAAP G&A, one thing in that line is we had some additional headcount, as well as we brought the new building online. So we had some elevated levels there in Q3 due to the new building, which as a reminder, it's the same size as our other three buildings combined. So we had some additional costs Q3 and G&A as it related to bringing that building online. Corey Greendale : I'm sorry, I mean, Craig, that we should expect, is that kind of a new run rate or was that more of one-time kind of stuff? Craig Boelte : I mean we had some one-time, but I mean they're going to be some of those costs that are going to carry on for a while. Operator : Next question today will be from Shankar Subramanian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Shankar Subramanian : Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. So just on the Q4 guide and how your business is trending in October. It seems like you had a pretty solid June quarter and obviously then a really good September quarter, but how should we think about your near-term business conditions to you. On a year-over-year basis, do you see the same kind of strength in the end market. Just to for us understand, is there any conservatism in the revenue guidance? Chad Richison : I mean I will say this, we haven't changed the way we guide and I think if you look at our guidance in the past, it would kind of reflect that as a matter of fact, I think for this quarter that we're in right now, our initial guidance was 28%. We continue to guide to what we can see, we don't always control when a client converts and the only way for us to record revenue for that new client is after they convert. And actually payers start paying us for the fees for our service and so. Craig Boelte : And I would say the other thing in terms of the fourth quarter guidance, the fourth quarter is typically a little bit seasonal for us and so what happens in fourth quarter November and December specifically, as you'll have companies run off cycle payrolls as it relates to bonuses and personal use of auto, those type of things. So as we're sitting here guiding, we have a good idea on what we think those off cycle payrolls will be, but you just never know as well as where we brought on a lot of new clients this year. So we don't have the history of how they run those payrolls yet. Shankar Subramanian : So the follow-up, so I did a survey in September for 200 Paycom, your customers and about 20% of them are in the 2,000 to like 5,000 employee range. And so it's not be a surprise that you are expanding the market, but could you help me understand kind of from a product perspective, is there any difference between the employee segment of 2,000, 5,000, what they buy and use versus the 50 to 2,000? Chad Richison : Now, 50 to 2,000 is a wide range. I think you can start seeing some difference in usage between - I mean, it's so much of it. I'll tell you - so much of it is really dependent upon industry and what someone is trying to achieve. I mean we're going to approach a 4,000 employee quick-service restaurant differently than we are a 600 employee hospital that has shift differentials and what have you which is going to be different than a 400 employee construction company that has a labor distribution, burden factors and everything else. And so again size does not necessarily dictate complexity. I will say it is most often that your larger companies have more complex situations, because everything applies. But as far as our approach to sales and what we're doing and as far as the readiness of our product, it's been ready for a long time. So this isn't something that we have to go develop anything different or retrain sales forces. We're not going to see any changes to our conversions. This is what we do. And so - and again we've been in this business a long time in this market. Shankar Subramanian : Just one last question. Any update around the new office openings? Are you going to be doing more toward the end of the year? Are you going to be like looking next year or two revisit the new office openings? Chad Richison : Yes. Just as in the past, we have not guided on exactly when we're opening up offices and where for competitive reasons and plus we want our own people know first. But we will continue to open up offices over the next 12 months. Operator : Next question will be from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Schwartz : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Chad, I've got a different question. It's a philosophical question around the up-selling motion and maybe opening up more skews in the future of the business that I want to ask you. The retention metrics of the business results in general. You're clearly having success adding a lots of new customers and you seem very pleased with the direction of promoting the self-service usage of the technology and having the direct access and direct relationship with the database. So the thought process is, if you're creating greater awareness of the usage of the platform technologies already within the installed base, then why not start considering creating new skews in an upselling motion? I would imagine there's a lot of need for HCM technologies that you could build and easily sell into the installed base as you push the usage there. Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes. One thing I would say is, we have, I believe, 26 modules right now. And so we started with payroll and we've continued to add to that. We've got a strong value proposition right now. Especially as it relates to the client's ability to maximize and - their ROI through their employee base. And so I'll give you one - a very small example. Five years ago, I was walking into a video store and getting it off the wall, handing it to the counter there, where I was getting - paying my fee, I was taking it home, watching it with the kids, returning it the next day. Today, I have a direct relationship with the database as a consumer. And I sit on my couch and do it. And that's better for me. And that's also better for that business that I mean we are facing with. That's the way people use technology everywhere in the consumer-based world. And then they go to work and we go back to the counter. And so we realize it to shift. It's different than what people are used to. We're having great success with it. And we're showing clients, how they can drive even further ROI with this type of usage and so we're very focused on it. Brian Schwartz : Yes, I guess I'll squeeze in a follow-up one to you, Chad. Just considering that your customer base is very broad and diverse, can you just share from a big picture view if you see any tailwinds or headwinds from mid-market HCM technology spending in 2019 just based on the pipeline momentum and the conversation that you are having with the customers? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes, I would say if someone's going to - it's just going to be a spend for companies, they probably won't do it and shouldn't do it regardless of what the other economic environment looks like. For Paycom, we drive ROI. So what someone spends with us, we're looking to give them back through use cases throughout the software. If you're asking me what's the demand out there, I'm not noticing anything that shows a decreasing demand for this type of technology or really automation anywhere within business. Operator : Next question will be from Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Ryan MacDonald : Congrats on the nice quarters here. I guess you mentioned earlier in your comments about this move upmarket that you've been pulled through by request typically. Can you just talk about, I guess, in those certain situations sort of how the demand for maybe breath or depth of product has changed when you're pulled into those situations and maybe how that impacts? I don't know if it's investments in implementation headcount or customer success headcount going forward as well. Chad Richison : Yes, so you can be pulled into a deal, because a person that used to at one company, got a job at another company and now they are running that company's department and they are very familiar with your product that they used at the prior company and they bring you in. You can be pulled into a market by an employee that uses the product and has influenced with that company and brings you in that way. In all cases though, these clients are looking at our current product and offering. It's not that we are offering them something different than what we are offering the others. It's just we've always had a very robust suite of products. I'm not just going to be honest with you that the usage on a lot of these products oftentimes has been lower and I believe that's across the industry, that's not a Paycom phenomenon, but oftentimes it's easier to sell someone the brochure, then to get them to actually use the product that's there that drives ROI. We've been working on that now for - as you guys know, I've been talking about it now for several years and we're continuing to drive that. And I don't see any area in which it would require different implementation needs except for the fact that it's more of the same that we're doing. Ryan MacDonald : And then just a quick follow-up. I'll squeeze in my quarterly question around learning management and sort of what you're seeing from increased usage trends on the content that you've developed and perhaps how that's guiding your strategic vision there as we look out to next year for additional content as well? Chad Richison : Yes, learning management, so much of it is dependent on the client and what they're looking to achieve, sometimes you get a little help as we just saw with the State of New York, I believe, now has a mandate for employees on going through both diversification or anti-discrimination as well as sexual harassment training, that becomes helpful to us as things become mandated, specific trainings become mandated. So far learning management is really about those clients that want to achieve these types of training initiatives among our group. We do see a lot in the upmarket. That is a product that you're going to see a lot in the upmarket, because it is difficult to train people in decentralized environment if you do not have some type of learning management system. And so we are continuing to look through our LMS system and what else we can offer with that, but we're also having success with what we're offering today. Operator : Next question will be from Ross MacMillan with RBC. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Alan] for Ross. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. Chad, just wanted to clarify a comment you made earlier on building pipeline as a result of this ad campaign. I'm not super familiar with effectiveness of national ad campaigns, but you've run smaller ones in the past. Is there any kind of a rule of thumb you think about for a multiplier effect like X amount of dollars goes into ad spend and just spit out why dollars in revenue, call it, six months out or a year out or is it more of a brand and impression thing and it's not quite as quantify both. Chad Richison : Well, I would say, it's what you mentioned plus adds both drive results from you from a leads perspective. They oftentimes soften the beach for the calls you're going to be making also, as well. As well as deals that you're in currently, branding can help move them along. And so you've got to really look at it in all areas. But look, traditionally, we have been a company that's focused on an advertising spend. I believe this is an area where it's going to be positive for our results because again we're advertising. I've never seen an HCM product for our type of industry, including the payroll side that really focuses on the employees experience with the product. I'm not saying one doesn't exist. I'm saying I've never seen one. And so this is the first of its kind. And so we are also advertising a new way. There is a shift here. We are advertising it. We've been focused on it. I have been saying now for about nine months that we might be early with this strategy, but we're not wrong. I'm going to be able to eliminate we're early with it at some point. So we've been focused and we're going to see how it does. Early indications are, it's doing what we expect it to do. Unidentified Analyst : That's great. And I guess just wanted to squeeze another one in on this move of market. You mentioned obviously many different ways that you can get a larger customers into the pipeline. But one thing I'm curious about, do you get pulled in as, call it, larger customers open up RFPs? And all I'm trying to get here is, does it change the nature of the competitors that you're facing, right? And just thinking out loud ultimate or base for us tends to play more in that upper 2k to 5k range. And I'm wondering if competitive sale process is different from being pulled up market organically. Just anything you can speak to on that font would be helpful. Chad Richison : Yes. First, I'll say that we continue to be pulled up market for companies that have above 5,000 employees as well, and we still do sell in that market. As far as - are we going to see competitors more, I mean I would expect we are going to be seeing their client base more as we go in and talk to them about our solution in the 2,000 to 5,000 employee market, because we're going to be proactively targeting it. And so, yes, I mean I would expect we're going to definitely be seeing more of their installed base. Operator : Our next question will be from Nandan Amladi with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Nandan Amladi : Thanks for taking my question. So, Chad, you talked about your new marketing campaign. Today, what share of your leads come through, any sort of digital channels versus just sort of hit on the street type degeneration? And what\u2026 Chad Richison : Yes. well I mean if I could figure that out, specifically you never really know - you can be pitching someone for a while and then they haven't talked to you for a year and then they come in as a lead. Well, where did that lead start by the person that actually call them. You can be sending someone marketing material and then a lead comes in. And so oftentimes, you got to hit these all over these businesses in order to advertise what you're doing. And we've often done that through, I would say very light on advertising, to be honest with you. Ours is more of a direct marketing campaign efforts, which we've always done, as well as this is a high-tech sell that we have to go in and do analysis and what have you. And so we are still a direct sales model and this advertising campaign is there to support that model, not to replace it. Nandan Amladi : And from an R&D perspective, as you look out, but you said you have 26 modules in the portfolio already. How much more is left to build, you think, particularly as you go after the 5,000 segment now more resolutely? Chad Richison : I think the more you get companies to use these products, the more use cases develop, which increases opportunity for you to deliver more value to businesses by developing additional product sets. Craig Boelte : And I would say, our R&D has continued to increase. And like Chad says, we continue to build out more products, we're going to continue to spend on R&D. And one thing too kind of as a housekeeping matter that haven't been able to jump on the call to take clearup is, stock comp for the third quarter was around $4.5 million, want to make sure kind of as we're doing modeling for fourth quarter that we keep that around that same level. Operator : At this time, this will conclude today's question-and-answer session. And with that I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Chad Richison for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : Alright. Well, thank you to everyone joining us on the call today. Over the next two months, we'll be on the road meeting with investors at the following conferences. We will be at the Credit Suisse Technology Media and Telecom Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona on November 27. And then we'll be at the Barclays Global Technology Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on December 5. We appreciate your continued interest in Paycom and I look forward to meeting with all of you soon. Operator, you may disconnect. Operator : The conference is now concluded. I want to thank everyone for attending today's presentation. And at this time, you may now disconnect.",

A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today, which is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I would now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, Craig and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter 2018 results, review some of our notable achievements in 2018, and also discuss our goals for 2019. Following that, Craig will review our financials and then we will take questions. 2018 was a stellar year for Paycom with many achievements as we enhanced our offering, grew our team and continued to fulfill our mission to be the premier human capital management software provider to companies across the U.S. We are making major shifts to drive innovation in our industry. I want to thank all of our employees who have become pioneers in this initiative. I believe we will look back on 2018 and realize that this year was just the beginning of a new way businesses and their employees leverage HCM technology to drive efficiencies and create deeper relationships with their staff. We finished the year with very impressive results. Our 2018 fourth quarter revenue of $150.3 million represented growth of 32% over the comparable prior year period. Our full year 2018 revenue of $566.3 million grew 31% compared to 2017. Our full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA was $240.9 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43%. Our success allowed us to return value to our stockholders by repurchasing over 500,000 shares in the fourth quarter of 2018. With this combination of revenue growth and margin, we achieved the rule of 70, and this places Paycom in a very small group of companies with this profile. We believe this strong performance is due at least, in part, to our strategy of working to promote employee usage of the Paycom system. We are educating our current and prospective clients about the benefits they can obtain when their employees have a direct relationship with the HR database. This is a powerful message that resonates across every industry and within an entire organization from the C-suite to entry-level employees. We will continue to pursue this strategy in 2019, and are excited about the value we are helping create for our clients. As we continue to drive employee usage of our software, we are providing our clients not only world-class technology but also, strategies to help their employees fully realize the value of our application. We have found that when an organizations employees have a direct relationship with the database, it creates significant efficiencies, which can result in a direct impact to our client's bottom line. In fact, a recent study by Ernst & Young shows, on average, a single HR task or data entry point without self-service, costs an organization $4.39 to complete. If you think about that across the entire employment life cycle, the opportunities for cost savings for employers are substantial. This study examined tasks across the entire HR spectrum and identified many potential areas for cost savings that can be obtained with self-service technology. These findings underscore our value proposition and imply that companies will continue to embrace HR technology to create efficiencies and drive enterprise value. We believe that Paycom solution is the best option to enable companies to achieve this goal. I'm also pleased to share that our retention rate for 2018 increased to 92%. This rate had been steady at 91% for the prior six years. We believe this improvement was also helped at the margin by our employee-usage strategy. We're excited and gratified by this progress. Looking at other areas of achievement in 2018, we opened four new sales offices, Salt Lake City, Rochester, Columbus and San Diego. This brings us to 49 [ph] teams. Our newer offices have been performing well per our expectations. As we look to 2019, we plan to open additional sales offices and look forward to sharing that news with you soon. As of December 31, 2018, our headcount stood at 3,050 employees, as we have hired people across our organization to help build the foundation for our future growth. Recently, we welcome new personnel to bolster our existing management team in areas of learning and development, finance, marketing and core operations. These individuals bring years of valuable experience and have worked for companies like Ernst & Young consulting, Procter & Gamble, ConAgra brands, PepsiCo, IBM and PricewaterhouseCoopers, just to name a few. We are eager to utilize their talents to help further our momentum. Turning to other areas of expansion, we are excited to announce that we will soon break ground on our Texas operation center in Grapevine, Texas. Late last year, we finalized our agreement with the city of Grapevine, which includes a $5 million tax incentive. We anticipate we will break ground on this new project in the first half of 2019, and that it should take 18 to 24 months to complete. We expect this 14-acre campus will eventually house 1,000 jobs. Paycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2018. In the fourth quarter, we earned three additional accolades. For the sixth consecutive year, we earned Top Workplace in Oklahoma Honors, and Glassdoor recognized us as one of the best places to work among large-sized U.S. companies in 2019. Both of these top workplace awards are extremely rewarding and a testament to the culture we continue to develop and grow. Additionally, Paycom made Deloitte & Touche Technology Fast 500 list, a list of 500 fastest-growing technology, media telecommunication, life science and energy tech companies in North America. Lastly, I want to congratulate the 2018 Paycom Jim Thorpe Award winner, Deandre Baker, from the University of Georgia. This award recognizes the most outstanding [indiscernible] back in college football and memorializes one of the greatest athletes in Jim Thorpe, who also happens to be an Oklahoman. Deandre showed true grit and determination throughout his collegiate career, and we're proud that we are able to honor his achievement. To sum up, 2018 was a banner year for Paycom, and we're excited to make 2019 another year of success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our fourth quarter results for 2018 and also our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2019, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Also, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition, which required us to recast the prior periods presented. Our comparisons discussed in today's call reflect those adjustments. We use adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and certain adjusted expenses as supplemental measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income or non-GAAP financial measures that exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense and certain other expenses that are not core to our operations. Non-GAAP net income also reflects adjustments for the effective income taxes. Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit plus applicable of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and adjusted gross margin reflects adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenues. The adjusted expenses we discussed reflect the GAAP expense amounts, less non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures discussed today are included in the earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. As Chad mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results with total revenues of $150.3 million, representing accelerated growth of 32% over the comparable prior year period. Our full year 2018 revenue was $566.3 million, representing growth of 31% compared to 2017. Our growth - revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $147.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 32% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $126.7 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84%. For the full year 2018, our adjusted gross margin was 85%. For 2019, we are increasing our target adjusted gross margin range to 83% to 85%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $78.3 million for the quarter as compared to $52.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $40.5 million. Adjusted R&D expense was $12.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 or 8% of total revenues. Total adjusted R&D cost, including the capitalized portion, were $17.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $11.1 million in the prior year period. Total adjusted R&D costs for the full year 2018, including the capitalized portion were $61.5 million or 10.9% of total revenues. Adjusted EBIT double $57.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $48.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year 2018, adjusted EBITDA was $240.9 million or 43% of total revenues compared to $185.7 million or 43% of total revenues in 2017. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $31.4 million or $0.54 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $48.9 million or $0.83 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 26.4%. For the full year 2018, our GAAP net income was $137.1 million or $2.34 per diluted share. I will highlight that due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities associated with the Tax Act in December 2017, we recognized a benefit to our provision in the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately $24.9 million or $0.42 per diluted share after the effect of adjustments for ASC 606. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $35.4 million or $0.61 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $53.2 million or $0.90 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares in the prior year period. We expect non-cash stock-based compensation for the first quarter of 2019 to be approximately $21 million. For the full year, we anticipate non-cash stock-based compensation would be approximately $47 million. For 2019, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 23% to 25% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 25% to 27%. We have returned value to our stockholders in the form of over 1.1 million shares repurchased over the course of 2018, including over 900,000 shares purchased in the open market. In the fourth quarter, we purchased - we repurchased over 500,000 shares. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 59 million shares in the first quarter of 2019. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $45.7 million, and total debt of $34.4 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $39 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. Now let me turn to guidance for the first quarter and full year for fiscal 2019. For the first quarter of 2019, we expect total revenues in the range of $194 million to $196 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 27% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $97 million to $99 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 50% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $710 million to $712 million, or approximately 26% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $288 million to $290 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 41% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Hey. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on a great finished to the year, guys. Can I start with the retention rate? So you moved up to 92, which is kind of like a big move for you. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers? Is it a new strategy already to focus on usage? Is it kind of you moving up a little bit higher in the market and you have better retention there? Can you talk to that, Chad? Chad Richison : Sure. So Raimo, HR has been in the middle of the data transfer process between the employee and the database, out of necessity, due to lack of technology. And no, it's no longer necessary for HR to be in the middle of the data collection process. And we've been focused on driving that change in the industry and demonstrating meaningful returns and value for our clients. And so the focus that we had on that last year also coincided with the release of our app, as we redeveloped our desktop version to have a mobile first-view. And we focused on not only usage but usage mandates. We believe that like Paycom, when our clients mandate usage to the employee, it drives the return on that investment. And so I do believe that as we've seen employee usage increase and we've been able to deliver more value to our clients, they have stayed with us. Raimo Lenschow : And then, the follow-up like, so if I look at the Grapevine expansion that's come pretty meaningful, it's like, if you think of 1,000 people versus 3,000 you have so far. Can you talk a little bit about what you want to do there and why it is so important? Chad Richison : Well, Raimo, I mean, we've always had a presence in the Dallas area. We have an operation center where we actually process out of that center. We also have a group of developers in Dallas as well. So the main thing is we're consolidating those facilities as well as continuing to expand in the Grapevine area, and there is a great pool of talent in the Dallas area. Raimo Lenschow : Yes, okay. And the last question is, in the last quarter, you talked a little bit about that you now kind of allowing your salespeople to maybe kind of go high up the market from the 3,000 that you have kind of as your natural limit before. Can you talk a little bit about what you see there so far? Is that - is my question a little bit too early? Or can you see any kind of changes there already? Thank you. Chad Richison : Well, what I would answer that is, we were already seeing great success in that market. And as you know, reps had already been allowed to market to those clients. It's just that Paycom's marketing efforts weren't directed to those clients. We've had a lot of success in that market and actually, we're having success above that market right now. And so I would see us continuing to deliver solutions to that market as well as we move throughout 2019. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you, congrats. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Anu [ph] on for Samad. A couple of questions, if I may. First of all, the outperformance we saw this quarter and in the guide, how much of that do you think is based on the upmarket business versus the SMBs? Is one doing better than - versus the other, what's your expectations? Chad Richison : That's fairly granular to be able to get into that specifically. I would tell you that our quarter hasn't reacted differently from quarter to quarter as far as the mix of business that we bring in. We have continued to creep up into the upper market, not disclosed that every quarter. So I would say that the overachievement that we had in fourth quarter was really attributed to the new client wins that we were able to onboard throughout the quarter, which would include deals and some above our stated range. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And I guess, the second one was around your new marketing campaign that you did. Your 1Q guide was strong. It was strong in margins too. So how much of the impact do you think has carried over from that campaign into your 1Q guide? Then, I just have one follow-up after that. Chad Richison : We're still evaluating the impact of that campaign. I mean, in general, we're happy with it. I can't - I don't know that I can even point to one revenue dollar that was achieved in 2018 that was generated through that campaign. But I do believe it's provided us some help, as again, we're marketing a new way to do something and transforming the way employees use HCM technology. And so I do believe, it's going to provide us some help as we move throughout this year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And just to follow up on that, so I guess, depending on what you kind of discover about these campaigns, should we expect like similar campaigns of similar size in 2019? And have you just built such campaigns into your forecast? And that's it for me. Chad Richison : To the extent, we have planned campaigns, which we have planned campaigns throughout 2019, they're currently baked into our guidance. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks for answering the questions. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : Hey, good afternoon. And congratulations, its great year. Can you talk a little bit about - the revenue growth is primarily a source of new wins. Can you give us a little bit of a sense in terms of like client count or should - do we have to wait for the 10-K for that? And then, average client size, how is that trending? And did I hear you right, Chad, in terms of the - you had some wins in the fourth quarter that are above the stated range, and I'm assuming you mean, the stated new range or the stated old range? Chad Richison : Yes, that's correct. We continue to sell both in the stated new range as well as above the stated new range. I mean, I went to our sales meeting a week ago last Friday, and they had sold two deals about 5,000 employees. So we've made it easier for these businesses to buy as our products become easier to both implement and use all the way up to the employee. And so I don't know. Hopefully, that answers that question. As far as the client count, Craig's got those numbers right now. Craig Boelte : Yes, Mark, so the client count based on fed ID is 23,533. And then, based on parent company group is 12,754. Mark Marcon : Great. And then, can you talk a little bit about module sales, average client sale now in terms of how many additional modules you're selling and how we should think about pricing? Chad Richison : Yes, we haven't made any changes to our pricing structure. As far as module selling, I mean, I've said it continuously on past calls that we've always been good at selling modules. It's getting clients to use the modules we're selling to help drive value and return on investment to themselves that I would say, like the rest of our industry, we were a little light on. And so we've really focused on getting the clients to use the products that we've already sold them. And then, of course, as we bring on new clients, usages are focused from the beginning. And so last year, we really made a shift in that. I would say, 2017, as I talked before, was a year that I'm not going to use the term necessarily struggling, but we were shifting our entire organization toward a specific strategy. And 2018, we got to reap the benefits of that strategy in being right. I've said before, we might be early, but we're not wrong with the strategy. And I do believe that right now, that as we look two years out, one year out, what have you, I don't believe you're going to have a lot of employees e-mailing, making phone calls and what have you, so the data can be input into the database. And so we're going to continue focus on bringing that to the market. Mark Marcon : That's great. And one last one, if I could. Just with regards to the margin guidance, the EBITDA margin guidance for this year, how should we think about longer term under 606, how the margin structure should flow? Obviously, you're doing best-in-class already, but how should we think about that longer term? Chad Richison : Yes, I would tell you, right now, that we're very focused on growth. But as a person that started the company with an SBA loan and 13 credit cards, I mean, I've said before that old habits die hard, and we're not looking - I don't feel like we have a burning need to spend cash that we're able to generate. But if something does make sense for us - in the future for us to do something in order to goose the revenue growth, then I think those are things that we would look at. I can tell you as we've planned out 2019, I feel really good about what our strategy is for that, and that's why guidance is where it's at right now. Mark Marcon : That's great. Congrats. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. It's Bhavin [ph] and on for Brad. Chad, can you just quickly give us an update on what's driving some of the improved productivity within your existing offices? Has there been any meaningful change in go-to-market strategy or changes in the competitive landscape? Chad Richison : We've continued to work on driving sales the enhancements and being able to generate greater returns off of both of our sales staff, as well as for any one team. I can tell you what I believe is driving our results right now is product strategy. If you guys have been following me for a while, I've, kind of, always said the best salesperson wins the deal, that doesn't necessarily mean the best solution does. I believe there is a shift in that right now. I think if somebody is interested in our strategy, what I'm going to tell you is a 100% employee usage mandate is where they're going to drive the most value in using the Paycom system. If somebody's interested in that strategy, then we're really who they're going to use. And that's not to say that we make clients work this strategy. I mean, if client wants to buy our product and use it the same way, they are using the older systems that they may have had and input data into one single database and that's the value they receive. I'm not going to say that we would not allow that, but we're going to do everything within our power to get that client to realize the return on investment that's available to them, if they use the product correctly. And I think our focus on that has been proliferating into other organizations as we work with both clients and prospects around these initiatives. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. That's very helpful. Just follow-up for Craig. Craig, I'm just following up on the last question. Can you give us an additional insight into just some of the EBITDA margin compression into fiscal '19? How much is really there to more - spend on marketing versus R&D or other areas? Craig Boelte : Well, I mean, as we're starting '19, I'd like to point out that we're really starting at a level that's higher than where we started '18. But as we're looking at the spend for '19, now we're continuing to spend in the R&D area. You've seen it continue to tick up and then, just kind of across the rest of the organization just to as well just in slight amounts. But then, we kind of - we'll see kind of as we go throughout the year on the sales and marketing. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Pinjalim Bora : Hey. Congratulations on a great results. This is Pinjalim Bora on behalf of Mark Murphy. Thanks for taking my questions. Going on to the productivity question again. Chad, could you update us on the number of mature sales teams that you have going into 2019? And what are your expectations for productivity for those mature sales teams in 2019? Chad Richison : Yes. So with the three that will be maturing in 2019 at various times because they were opened at various times, and it's 24 months to maturity. Important to note that an office does continue to mature past that initial stage, but they are fully staffed at that point, and they would be having a pipeline. And so you would deduct before that had not yet matured that we would be waiting on for 2020. And so that would leave us with 45 offices that will be - that we will have mature over some period of time during 2019. Pinjalim Bora : Got it. And then, the productivity per office assumptions that you have? Do you feel like... Chad Richison : I mean, I'll just go ahead and say, on the last call I talked about updating our sales capacity number. I gave that number initially in November of 2016, about 28 months ago, and the goal is to provide some guidelines about what we were thinking about sales and how high sales achievement could go for any one sales rep and any one office. Since then, we've done a lot of work on ourselves, and we've made progress on employee usage strategy and other areas that impact that number as well. And I'm not going to necessarily say we broke the model, but I mean, I've already got two reps just in the first month of this year that are averaging over $1 million in the sales already. Our last - our top rep last year sold more than anyone sold before. So our sales number does continue to increase. Additionally, the sales capacity figure did not account for additional business such as first quarter forms, up sales to current clients, any of our inside sales. So it's become more competitively sensitive to discuss that number without talking about what is all - what all goes into it. So that's not a number that we're going to be updating, moving forward. Pinjalim Bora : Understood. And lastly, Chad, this year you opened four offices, last year, you opened three. But few years - I mean, three or four years before that I think you had a cadence of five to six. Should we kind of expect this lower cadence for 2019 and beyond or is it just random and just a matter of timing? Chad Richison : We open up offices when it make sense. It is based on opportunities that we have internally to develop currently our backfill reps, as well as those mature offices managers we would be relocating to start up these offices or sales teams, if you will. And so we're continued - we continue to focus on that. We will be opening up offices this year. But we also feel really good at where we're at with being able to achieve our numbers right now with the production that we're seeing across the board within our sales organization. Pinjalim Bora : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Chad, from a high level, revenue growth was about two-x the rate of client growth in 2018. Is that predominantly a result of better attach or larger customers? Thanks. Chad Richison : I don't know that I've gone into that a whole lot, if I'm taking - I mean, definitely, we've continued to add larger clients to our platform. And I've discussed that every quarter. We continue to do that. I'm going to go back to what I said earlier about, we've always been really good at delivering what we believe our clients are going to use upfront. As a reminder, our sales reps are not able to go back into the current client base and upsell them new products after that client's been onboarded with us for longer than 30 days. So because of that, in the analysis stage, we look to deliver those products. We believe the clients going to need and use upfront. And so I would have to say, it's more weighted toward us moving upmarket and selling some larger clients than what it would be necessarily attach rates. What I will say though, is that the usage of those products that we have sold is continuing to move higher. Brad Reback : Got it. Thanks very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Schwartz : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Good afternoon. Great job on the quarter and the year. Chad, just one question on the move upmarket, just on the competition, maybe the structure of the deals. As you - after the 5,000 seats, it sounds like you had some deal activity even above that. Are you seeing a different set of competitors in those type of engagement? And then, when we think about the structure of the deal activity in that market, are there any noticeable difference in terms of the sale cycles or maybe the deployments of the customer's time? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yeah, I would say that, first of all, we go - when we're about 1,000, I can't say that we've run into a different competitor that we didn't previously know of or hadn't competed with in the past. Is selling to the upmarket still complex? Sometimes it is. It's somewhat dependent upon the goals of the organization and how they're set up currently. But also, we're starting to see more of them come to us. I mean, I think over time - and I talk about this as one of the first statements I've made that you look back 20 years ago, our products were complex. You look back five years ago, we had an easier product but it did complex things, and what have you. And so - and HR has been really happened to work hard to keep all the data correct. Most of these systems - whether or not the data is correct or not is based on how well HR has been interfacing with those employees and being able to grab that data. So that's changing now. And we believe as HR offloads the data input process, it's going to allow them to create more meaningful relationships with their staff and help drive even greater results. And so we've been focused on that ourselves. Brian Schwartz : And then, one follow-up question I have, just on the retention metric with the step-up here this year. Chad, is that partly reflective of the bigger customers that are now within the install base? Or is it too early for that to show up and the improvement in the retention is really from the entire quarter? Just trying to dig into that a little bit more. Thanks. Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean, I can tell you that we've always sold larger customers and we've always sold more of them as we've added more reps and what have you. And so we've always sold at the top end of our margin. I believe the retention is related to usage of our software and driving real results for those clients. I mean, I've said it before that didn't cost any extra to use our system the right way. And as we're gen [ph] taking employee usage from 3% at an organization to 87% at an organization, that's making a very strong impact for those clients. And as they become acclimated to that way of doing something, it can be very exciting for both of our clients - for both our clients and us as well as what opportunities exist for all of us in the future. Brian Schwartz : Thank you for taking my questions this afternoon. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Please go ahead. Scott Berg : Hi. This is Scott on for Ryan MacDonald. Thanks for taking our questions. Most of our questions have been answered, but I do have one is, as you can continue to sell larger deals that tends to be an area that's more price-competitive, and we see more discounting on all the modules in the suite. Do you think you can maintain your lead - your SaaS-leading gross margins even as you potentially have to discount as you moved higher? Thank you. Chad Richison : Well, what I would say about that is I think, it's more about cost versus price. What's the overall cost of the system when you include the ROI and what have you. If it's just about price, I wouldn't say that Paycom would be a fit for that. If we haven't differentiated our solution in a deal, I don't know that we would be ready to provide price. So I would just tell you this, we're focused on ROI. Does that mean that you don't have to have some scale pricing for extremely large clients? Well, sure you do, because at some point, the base fees becomes eaten up in that price expansion for each additional life. And so sure, I think that we'll have that as we scale, and we have. But I don't really think our price versus any one of our competitors are necessarily a fair way to compare us when a buyer's making a decision, they should base it based on what is going to be the return on investment of that decision. And also, what else are they going to have to add around one of our competitor system to exact the result that we're going to be driving for them. And so I'll just kind of leave it at that. I am not - I haven't - thus far, I can't say that we're winning deals, well, we aren't winning deals based on price. Does that mean we haven't in the past? I mean, I'm sure we've got a sales rep out there, here and there, where that's happened before. But as we identified that, those aren't things that we are looking to continue. Scott Berg : Great. That's all the question I have at the moment. Congrats again. Operator : The next question comes from Shankar Subramaniam with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Shankar Subramaniam : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the result. I just have a question on the R&D spend. As you look at the 2019 and looking to spend the R&D dollars, where exactly are you investing heavily? What are the new products that you think would help sustain growth this year and then the year later? Thank you. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, consistent with past comments, we don't telegraph specifically of what we're working on. I can tell you that in R&D, you're going to have an amount dedicated to maintenance as tax laws change, as labor laws change, we do have items that are mandated to us, you have to make those changes in the system in order to keep your clients compliant. And so you're always going to dedicate a certain amount to that. You're going to dedicate a certain amount to module enhancements. Those are current modules that you have that with greater usage, new opportunities for cost reduction strategies throughout an organization develop, and it allows you to develop more in that. And then, the third bucket that I would say that we continue to focus on is innovation and that would be bringing new tools and new concepts to the HCM market that may not currently exist or might exist in a different more complicated form. Shankar Subramaniam : Got it. And just a quick question on penetrates. Looks like there is some new regulation on HRA sign rate of the ACA premiums. Is there any tailwind as you see from regulation to benefits for you specifically? Chad Richison : Regulation to benefits, I mean, I'm familiar with what's going on right now with ACA and the - specifically, the forms that they are talking about. We don't have any guide on that yet, and they're still - as you mentioned, there's benefits that have to be displayed, and we're trying to figure out how that would be, so I think it's still too early to talk about. If you are, in fact, talking about the impact of ACA and specifically, those forms as they reflect benefits, it's a little too early for us to comment on that right now. Were you talking about something else or was, in fact, that's what you were talking? Shankar Subramaniam : I was talking about HRA, the new expanded regulation on HRA that benefits employers? But I think it's also towards - yes, go ahead. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, any regulations that are more complicated to the employers is something that we would look to try to help them out with obviously, so... Shankar Subramaniam : Thank you, guys for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ross MacMillan : Thanks so much. And congratulations. Chad, I wondered if you could just spend a minute. I know you've been very focused on employee engagement inside of the application, especially on mobile - on a mobile UI. And I wondered if you could just talk to, how if at all, is that playing out in your stronger results? Are you seeing that drive lower churn? Are you seeing that drive better word of mouth for new customer acquisition? Well, just how are you seeing that influence the model? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yeah, I would say, it's really all the above. I mean, it's definitely driving better results for us amongst our current client base and then as those employees, for one reason or another, transfer into other businesses that might not currently use Paycom. They're bringing us in. I mean, I can tell you story after story about individual employee that walked into different businesses, and we're getting leads from it. As a matter of fact, we were receiving so many leads from it, some of them won't yet through to the sales organization and we had to identify that even. So this is something we've been focused on. But I mean, it all comes down to doing the right thing for the client and helping them be able to transform their employee base into this strategy. And it's like this, the first week, there's always data that's coming in for HRA to input. They talk to their employees, show them how to use these system appropriately, and week three, there's less input coming in. And week two, there's less. And within a month, we can typically transform an entire organization to very close to maximum usage within our system. And so we've been very focused on that. And I do believe that, that is not only impacting the ROI and value for our clients, but it's a proved source of what we're able to use as we're going and talk with prospects. Ross MacMillan : That's great. And then, maybe a follow-up for Craig. Just - I know you guided adjusted EBITDA, but just - we've seen some variability on cash flow from ops relative to EBITDA. First as we went to 606, but then even I think 606, where we saw higher conversion of EBITDA in '18 versus '17. What's the right way to think about cash flow from ops relative to EBITDA? Is it - I don't know if you think of that as a percentage or you have a sort of ballpark way of thinking about that. I think in the last couple of years, it's been in sort of 70% to 75% range? I mean, is that a - you think that's a consistent way to think about it? Craig Boelte : Yes, I mean, there's different variables that go into that, that conversion from adjusted EBITDA into the operating cash flow. One thing that we don't really guide to is - on free cash flow is the CapEx. And we kind of mentioned the Grapevine building. And so what I would say, at least on the free cash flow side, we would expect our CapEx kind of as a percent of revenue to be similar in '19 to what it was in '18, but maybe a little bit back-end loaded in terms of that CapEx. Ross MacMillan : Okay, very good. Thank you very much. Congrats. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Nandan Amladi with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Nandan Amladi : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So this is an industry-level question. I'm sure you saw the ultimate announcement yesterday. How does a company going private actually impact the competitive dynamics particularly as you've moved upmarket? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, I would suspect they have the same product today as they did yesterday. So I would suspect that their impact on us would be the same. Nandan Amladi : But in terms of their ability to compete pricing any of those things? Chad Richison : Yes, look, I don't think it's a bad thing. I mean, I think if you're looking at kind of replatforming your product so that you can really compete in the market and for the future, for what's coming out in the future, I think, potentially, it's good move. I just - I don't know all the answers to that. Again, Paycom, we're staying in our own lane, we're focused on what we know we can control and really drive value for our clients, and I'm really excited about the fact that I believe 2018 was the best year we've had as a company in 20 years. And I got to see a company really shift and drive that. We've had three major events in our 20 years of business, which we celebrated in November and the first event was the Internet. And I don't know if anybody that beat us to the Internet. And second event for us was focusing on a single database and developing that out, and I've yet to see someone do that. And now we're focused on taking that single database and driving it all the way to the employee where it belongs. And it belongs there because that's where technologies met us today. And so we're very excited about our opportunities here in 2019 and beyond. We've got the right strategy. Now we've just got to continue to work our process and drive results. Nandan Amladi : Thank you. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chad Richison for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : So first, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. As many of you may know, in 2018, we celebrated our 20th year in business. While it's been an amazing journey to get here, I still feel very excited about the potential of what we yet to achieve. And so we appreciate your interest and look forward to speaking with many of you in the months to come. Operator, you may disconnect. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may disconnect your lines.",

Following that Craig will review our financials and then we will take questions. We kicked off another year with robust results that exceeded our guidance positioning us well to accomplish our performance objectives for 2019. Q revenue was approximately $200 million representing growth of 30% versus the comparable prior year period. Top-line growth percentage accelerated versus the pace in last year's first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA of $103 million represents a 52% margin. Today, we're also raising our guidance for the full year and Craig will have more details in his remarks. Our performance this quarter was primarily a result of our strong software offering, focused sales efforts and the additional value we are bringing to the market with our concentrated employee usage strategy. Employee usage of Human Capital Management or HCM technology is the future of our industry. We believe having a comprehensive HCM system can lead to higher employee engagement, increased productivity, better job satisfaction and higher employee retention. Our single database HCM solution including our mobile app empowers our clients' employees to take ownership of their HR functions. During the quarter, we released our new direct data exchange for all Paycom clients. This is a highly differentiated enhancement to our overall software offering. It's a first-of-its-kind solution within the HCM industry that measures the efficiency of the data collection process. The direct data exchange does this by reporting all of the data changes made directly into the HR database by employees, as well as all of the duplicative data points typically input by other client representatives. Paycom firmly believes in HCM system that empowers its employees to easily make and confirm changes to their own data, and to take full ownership of their personal information produces the strongest ROI for the data collection process. Before the availability of the direct data exchanges, businesses had no way of truly knowing the level of inefficiencies hidden within their HCM processes and system. Now they have the tool to effectively drive efficiencies into their HCM environment. Moving to other recent business highlights. In early April, we broke ground on our new Operations Center in Grapevine, Texas. It will be exciting to see the land transformed into what will soon be another beautiful Paycom facility. We expect this 14 acre campus will eventually house 1,000 jobs and should be completed in under two years. The Dallas-Fort Worth area features a great pool of talent to help foster our continued growth efforts. Turning to our sales initiatives. We are continuing to expand our sales organization through 2019 and beyond, and we will do so at a pace that is appropriate for our business and that we believe will allow us to effectively achieve the greatest revenue growth, which is and will remain a top priority for us.  Finally this April also marked our fifth anniversary of becoming a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. And I'm extremely pleased with all that the Paycom team has worked hard to achieve together during this past half decade. In addition to our exceptional growth and overall financial performance, we've been recognized numerous times for our positive workplace culture and dedication to client engagement. Since the beginning of 2014, we have released many compelling new products and software enhancements, nearly doubled the number of sales teams and significantly expanded the footprint of our corporate headquarters. Paycom is blessed you have assembled the most talented team in the industry, and I'm very grateful for their hard work and dedication and the best is yet to come. To conclude, I'm proud of our strong start to 2019 and look forward to continued success through this year and beyond. With that I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and updated guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our first quarter results of 2019 as well as discuss our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2019, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. As Chad mentioned, we were pleased with our first quarter results with total revenues of a $199.9 million, representing growth of 30% over the prior year period. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was a $196.9 million for the first quarter of 2019, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 30% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was a $173.5 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 87%. For the full year 2019, we anticipate that our adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 83% to 85%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $80 million for the quarter as compared to $58.7 million in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2019 was $37.1 million as compared to $30.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted R&D expense was $15.4 million in the first quarter of 2019 or 7.7% of total revenues. Total adjusted R&D costs including the capitalized portion were $21.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $13.1 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $103.3 million or 52% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $80.7 million or 52% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2018. Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was a $47.3 million or $0.81 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $41.2 point million or $0.70 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was 23.9% In the first quarter, our non-cash stock based compensation increased by $7.6 million over the prior year period due to the issuance and subsequent vesting of restricted stock with market-based vesting conditions. For the second quarter, we anticipate non-cash stock based compensation expense to be approximately $6 million to $7 million. The restricted stock vesting events in the first quarter had an impact on our first quarter tax rate lowering it approximately 400 basis points. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2019 was $69.3 million or $1.19 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $55.8 million or $0.95 per diluted share in the prior year period. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 58 million shares in the second quarter of 2019. Since we initiated our repurchase program in 2019, Paycom has repurchased more than 3.5 million shares at an average share price of $79.56.  Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of $91.3 million and total debt of $34 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of expansion related construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $80.4 million for the first quarter reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of the Paycom business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2019. Now let me turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year for fiscal 2019. For the second quarter of 2019, we expect total revenues in the range of $162.5 million to $164.5 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 47% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in the range of $62.5 million to $64.5 million, representing adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2019, we are increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $718 million to $720 million or approximately 27% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We're also increasing our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $296 million to $298 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 41% at the midpoint of the range. With that we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. RaimoLenschow: Hey, thanks and congrats on another great quarter. And Chad can I start with the direct data exchanged? How do you see that in terms of, how you're going to utilize that? Basically, it looks like a really nice tool for clients. Is that kind of something that you think about using as a kind of in the sales process because you can kind of briefly show to clients how they are doing on and how they could do better or is that something you're going to charge for? And then I had a follow-up question. ChadRichison: Yes. And so think about the direct data exchange is almost like a health check of our system. I mean if you're driving a vehicle you have a dashboard that tells you how your oil is and everything else, and that's what this is. It shows how our system is working and so the direct data exchange tracks the number of direct data changes made into the system by employees. It also tracks the changes that are duplicative or being made indirectly. And so our clients use this to help drive ROI for themselves, and we're having a lot of success with it. These usage numbers continue to ramp with this. And I believe that this type of strategy and the direct data exchange is really the death knell, if you will, to the indirect data collection process that exists right now in our industry. RaimoLenschow: Yes, make sense, okay. And then if you look at R&D like you basically are kind of really outpacing a lot of your competitors with the R&D that you're doing there. Can you talk a little bit about some of the initiatives? I mean on these growing like quite a bit higher than sales and marketing and revenue et cetera like what are the key things for you for this year? ChadRichison: Yes. Well, it does definitely a lot of the things that we're working on are being developed to support our strategy of employee usage. I believe that businesses that lack an employee usage strategy are going to find it hard to compete and even more difficult to attract and retain talent. And businesses in our industry that lack an employee usage strategy will find it hard to compete in our own industry. And so we're very much focused on this initiative. I've been talking about this for two years. We are now having clients on board and they are agreeing to a full employee usage strategy. And that means that all changes as it relates to employee data would be made by employees when relevant. Obviously, employees aren't going to change their own rate of pay, but most things are being changed by employees in our system. This is the way for the future and we're really using it to show as just an additional proof source to our clients of the ROI that can be driven when you use our system correctly. And that's really what we've been working on is getting our clients to use our system the correct way. And we're focused. As far as opportunities it presents for us in the future, once we have client employees all engaged in the system for each data point change, obviously that opens up additional opportunities of development for us. We've been focused on that as we have identified several opportunities that exist. It changes the model of the way our industry works. And so there's a lot of exciting things coming. Operator : And our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. SamadSamana: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe first, Chad, you mentioned sales investments to prioritize growth. I was wondering if maybe you can give us an idea as you think about those investments, is it more headcount at existing offices? Is it potentially open new offices? Any potential color on how we should think about timing and the type of those sales investments. ChadRichison: Yes. So we're continuing to mature all of our offices or even are mature offices continued to increase their capacity. And opening up new offices as part of our strategy. I mean there's several cities we are not in. There are cities that were significantly under penetrated with the current sales offices that we have. And we would look to add additional sales offices to those geographies as well. But we are also focused on what's the right pace for us. Again, we will be opening up sales offices here in 2019 and continuing that strategy to set us up for subsequent years. SamadSamana: Great and then maybe just one follow-up, if I may. I think that in recent quarters the company has seen increased success with upmarket customers. And I was curious if maybe there are any comments around this quarter and anything notable that we should think about especially with some of your competitors going to some changes. ChadRichison: Sure. I mean there's definitely -- you'll see some difference in the way large companies use this type of technology and smaller companies. However, the employee of a five employee company or even an employee of a 100 employee company is going to use similar or have similar tasks that need to be automated as an employee that might have 5,000. And so we've been focused on that. We are continuing to have strong client ads within the upper end of our market, which would be up to 5,000. We are also seen clients on board that again are above the top end of our range as we have made it much easier to sell on our end, as well as we've made it easier for clients to buy as the ROI becomes more clear into focus with these strategies. Operator : And our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi. It's Bevin on for Brad. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great start to the year. Can you guys just provide us some insight into how your marketing campaigns are going relative to your expectations? What kind of ROI are you seeing and what changes have you made to your marketing programs relative to last year? ChadRichison: Yes. So last year we did, I would say double down on this initiative to help market our product toward a new end user. Since the beginning of time our end user has always been the HR Payroll operating manager and it still is today. They are the end user, however, with an employee engagement strategy you are able to add value to even what the end users are using with greater employee usage. And so you will have noticed that our marketing efforts about 18 months to 24 months ago are really started shifting toward that employee user to help soften the beach is really for our clients that want more employee engagement, as they are now directing employee usage. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Got it, that's helpful. And then just one quick follow up. Can you just talk about some of the early insights you've been seeing or early feedback with the direct data exchange? And what are the key insights some of these c-level executives are saying? ChadRichison: Yes. So I mean before you didn't really know how your employees were using the system. You may have thought employees were really using the system. You may have even thought employees weren't and so what the Direct Data Exchange does is assign a number directly to what employees are doing. We've seen clients go from 30% usage up to 90%. Even what we call good has changed over time as we're moving all clients up into the 90 percentile and getting some to a hundred. And so that's what we've been focused on. Again, it's a big shift in our industry when you're talking about how to use product different. And we've been having to drive that. And how clients use the products correctly. They are --some are still used to doing it the old way and where employees might send emails, make phone calls and what have you and that information be input by a client representative versus the employee themselves. And so and it's not just about inputting data. It's about information retrieval as well. When this information exists and it's accurate, it's in the hands of the employee. There are a lot -- there is a lot that can be done to increase productivity for both that employee worker as well as the client overall. And we've continued to stay focused on that and in the DDX or the Direct Data Exchange product just reflect the health of each organization's HCM product that they've deployed. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. MattCoss: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Matt Coss on behalf of Mark Murphy. If you look at the deals you closed in Q1, can you tell us what percentage of clients agreed to the full employee usage strategy? And I know you decided some an uptick in retention last quarter, which was a great result of those efforts. Are there any other outcomes worth highlighting as a result of increased employee interaction with the database? I mean anecdotal or otherwise or any metrics you plan to share going forward on how kind of how your customers are benefiting? ChadRichison: Sure. Well, first on the percentage of those clients that have committed to a 400 employee usage strategy. I don't have the exact percentage but I can tell you it was zero fourth quarter. And so first quarter was really the first time we really drove it from the sale side. We've been driving usage with our client base now for a couple of years. We then backed it all the way up to the sales process to gain sponsorship of this type of activity before the system is deployed. My personal opinion is I think it's difficult for companies to buy HCM products in this environment, if they're not going to fully leverage it all the way out to the employee, because again employers use consumer grade type technology everywhere else in their life. They're not emailing their bank asking them to add a payee or void a check. So I don't understand why we're doing it in our industry. And that's the shift and so percentages, I don't know but it's gone from zero to quite a bit. As far as the retention number, a little bit of correction on that. That retention gain was for all of last year. We have not reported quarter one retention numbers, but I do believe as people use our product, the way it is intended in there and they're generating greater ROI that should have an impact on retention. I mean if you've bought our hammer and you've been using the claw side of that hammer to beat and pound in a nail and it's working, imagine if you turn it around the other way and use it correctly. And we're seeing that happen. It doesn't cost our clients anymore to use our product correctly. And when it happens, we're able to demonstrate a very strong ROI that's being realized by our client base. And it's being a generally accepted with all of the clients and prospects that we are engaging with. Operator : Our next quest comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. BradReback: Great, thanks very much. Chad from a high level if customers, if employees at customers start using the service a lot more, will that have any impact on gross margin? ChadRichison: I do believe that the more someone uses our system, the more proficient they become in it, and so at some level it does allow, when you're both aligned to the same service results, it does allow for some additional capacity on the service side. We don't charge for using our product correctly. It doesn't cost any more, but you could have some areas that are somewhat ancillary to the direct billing items that could provide additional value to us at the margin. BradReback: Great and a quick follow up for Craig. If we think about the increase in float balance coupled with a fairly significant increase in interest rates year-over-year. What type of tailwind has that afforded you on the top line? Thanks. CraigBoelte: Well on the interest rate flow, we went from about a $1 billion last year at this time $1.2 billion to quarter over same quarter last year. That still our client funds. So we invest them just like we have in the past. There were some upticks in rates last year. As we looked at guidance this year we're not anticipating any additional rate increases at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question. MarkMarcon: Good afternoon, Chad and Craig. Congratulations on a great start to the year. I was wondering, first of all, just with regards to the big ramp that you're seeing. Can you talk a little bit about some of the big client implementations that you had? It looked like implementation revenue jumped pretty dramatically. And so I was just wondering if you could give a little bit of a feel for that. And how did those implementations go? CraigBoelte: Well, in terms of the implementation revenue, Mark, that's implementation and another so as we recognize implementation revenue, we actually recognize that over a 10-year period, so there's going to be some clock revenue in that number as well. It was a strong quarter for implementation. ChadRichison: Yes. It was a strong quarter for implementation and our implementations are still as they've been in the past as far as timelines and what have you. We are seeing greater usage prior to implementation as we continue to drive usage even prior to the full deployment go-live of the system. MarkMarcon: Great and then the margin performance continue to be stellar. I'm wondering if you've thought about giving some new longer-term targets now that we've had 606 in place for a while. ChadRichison: We have not updated our long-term targets right now. We are continuing to review that and we're definitely focused on being a high-growth company. I think that's the other side of this. We're focused on growth right now. I mean this is the third consecutive quarter that our growth has accelerated over prior years same period. And as far as our --what we're guiding to same point today is what we were in last year, our guidance numbers are all-- we're seeing those a higher than what they had been last year at the same time. And so we're focused on that. We're definitely mindful company of our margins. And so we definitely want to be efficient in everything we do, but we're definitely focused on our growth opportunities here as we believe things has changed in our market. And I think it's a new day which is a good for all of our clients and prospects that are out there looking to gain more efficiency through deployment of this type of technology. MarkMarcon: Can I just squeeze one more in this with regards to the strong growth that you're seeing? Can you characterize that in terms of like what percentages from new sales in terms of number of clients relative to our ARPU and then also what you're seeing in terms of internal client employee hiring and what sort of adds you're seeing there? How we should break it down? ChadRichison: Yes. I would say the mix has been consistent as it's been in the past. I can't call out that we have a greater amount as a percentage of up sales today than we've had in the past. Again, the largest upscale year as a percentage that we had was during the rollout of ACA. It's somewhat returned back to normal after that and it's been consistent with years past as far as the mix between new client adds and up sales to current clients. Operator : And our next question comes from Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. RyanMacDonald: Good afternoon, Chad and Greg. Congrats on a great quarter. I guess, if you're looking at the solution set that you're providing to customers, we've seen broadly within the HCM market that HR case management is an area of strong demand among customers and as particularly as you're moving up market and you look at this Direct Data Exchange solution, does the data you collect from those customers create a potential for you to develop more automation on the platform to offer those customers and are you seeing any increased demands for that type of automation? ChadRichison: Yes. Well, definitely, as you identify and to some extent incentivize appropriate usage of the system, they does become somewhat of a cadence or regular action for employees that becomes predictable and at appropriate times you can automate certain functions that make sense. We're always a client that first looks at what the problem that exist today. We don't try to create a piece of technology and then go create a problem that needs to be fulfilled. And so, as we look at the problems that exist for our clients and the user buyers, we look to automate more of that. As this has been pushed out to the employee base, it's identifying greater opportunities for both our clients as well as for Paycom to be able to fulfill that through additional software development. Operator : And our next question comes from Shankar Subramanian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. ShankarSubramaniam: Hey. Thank you for letting me ask a question and congrats on the results. So I just have a question on the pain point, inefficiencies in the HCM usage in customers. Can you help elaborate on where the inefficiencies are? And maybe give some anecdotes on how the clients are using a system now and how this will change that process? ChadRichison: Yes. So I mean there is inefficiencies throughout the HCM system, right now, if you have employees that could be using multiple products, email and phone call, even to request time off, you could show up tomorrow and you've got 15 emails on people requesting time off, you got to go and look at the schedule, decide if you've got enough coverage whether or not to approve that time off. I mean, that's one example versus in a complete full system that has both time and attendant scheduling and everything else. The employee can make that decision themselves at night without talking to HR based of the appropriate rules that have already been set up in the system, which we do on our end. So there's those examples, there's editing examples, making change to benefit enrollment, expense management, mileage tracking, general HR and onward. And so, learning management is another piece. And so those are all initiatives that we continue to drive and make more efficient. And I will say this, I mean, both clients and HR before, this is their idea. HR has been trying to put this together. They've done it in many cases. I mean, I think HR departments and accounting departments and procurement and operating departments across the board have really looked to drive these strategies. I mean HR isn't in the middle of a data collection process because they want to be, they are in the middle of the data collection process out of necessity. Because if they hadn't been in the middle of the data collection process, in the past the data wouldn't have even had an opportunity to be correct. Well, it's not necessary for HR to be in the middle of that particular process anymore. And when you remove them out of it, it helps for their own efficiencies, because no one went to get a degree in this type of structure with the intent of doing a lot of data input. And so, we are being able to show a lot of our ROI by increasing these efficiencies across the board. ShankarSubramaniam: Got it. That's helpful. Just one quick follow up. If you look at the markets they're participating now, the 2K to 5K and then below 2K, where would you think this had the most competitive advantage for you from new client list? ChadRichison: Everywhere. I don't see why anybody wouldn't use it to be honest with you. Just, it doesn't make sense anymore of why somebody wouldn't deploy a full employee usage strategy. No reason why you wouldn't do it if you already were doing it, I guess. If you already had a full strategy going and it's working for you, but outside of that it's where everybody should be trying to get. I don't know that there's much ways you can get better at the software side and when you look at HR, I mean I see them becoming as they have more and more strategic over time as they look to go toward more revenue generating activities versus something that's primarily all cost. I mean you're great at data input, great, but it's not something that you necessarily have to do. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. BrianSchwartz: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions today. I too add my congratulations on the business performance. Chad, can you shed a light at all, just wanted to ask you a question on the mix of the bookings these days between say the upper mid-market and the mid-market. Is there any way of maybe parsing on you know what you're seeing at least from a percentage of those upper mid-market deals that are coming through the funnel? And then the follow up question along with that is for Craig, how should we think about the long-term margin implications as that upper mid-market funnel becomes an increasing bigger mix of the bookings? Thanks. ChadRichison: Yes. So I'll take the first question and let Craig do the latter. Our mix we've always sold at the upper-end of our market. I mean I remember prior to IPO in 2014, I was talking about five companies at that time that had over 4,000 employees that we had sold the quarter before. And so -- and that was with a much smaller sales organization and a different product. And so I just want to point that out that we've always sold at the upper-end of our market. It's really about those businesses that we market to. So I can't call out a different mix of clients today versus what we've done in the past other than to say we've always had success at the upper-end of our markets. So now I'll let Craig talk about the other. CraigBoelte: Yes. And I would say on the margin, I mean, as Chad mentioned, we've always been in the mid-market as well as the upper mid-market. So it's not like we're going to abandon one, the lower -- between the 50 and 2,000. So I can't see our margin changing a whole lot. I mean, we've already had this mix over time anyway. BrianSchwartz: Got it. And then one follow-up question. Chad, just wanted to ask you how you're thinking about the hiring plans for this year? And if there is any change as to your original plan given the 1Q outperformance that the business delivered? Thanks. ChadRichison: No, we have not made any changes to our goals for hiring for this year. End of Q&A Chad Richison : All right. Well, I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. Over the next few months, we'll be on the road meeting with investors at the following conferences. We'll be at the J.P. Morgan Technology, Media and Communications Conference on May 14th in Boston. We'll also be at the Baird Consumer Technology and Services Conferences on June 4th in New York. And, finally, we will be at the Stifel Cross Sector Insight Conference on June 12th in Boston. We appreciate your continued interest in Paycom, and look forward to meeting you -- many of you soon as we get on the road. Thank you, operator. You may disconnect. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I'll now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining us on our call today. I'll begin my remarks by reviewing another strong quarter and provide you with some perspective on how our groundbreaking Direct Data Exchange and employee usage initiatives are redefining the relationship employees have with their Human Capital Management or HCM software in the workplace. I'll finish by discussing some additional business highlights, and Craig will review our financials and outlooks, before taking your questions. The second quarter results came in strong, thanks to robust new business adds and we remain well positioned for another excellent full year. Q2 revenue was approximately $169 million, representing growth of 31.5% versus the comparable prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA of $69.4 million represented a 41% margin. With these results and our momentum, we are raising guidance for the full year, which Craig will discuss in more detail in his remarks. Employee usage of HCM technology is the future of our industry and our clients and their employees are embracing the digital transformation faster than ever. With Paycom, they can measure the estimated ROI on their HCM investments and benefit from higher employee engagement, increased productivity and better job satisfaction. Our early investments and employee usage are driving strong sales growth, but we believe this digital transformation is still in the early stages. Last quarter, we released our Direct Data Exchange or DDX for all of our clients, a highly differentiated enhancement to our software offering that reports all data changes made directly into the HCM database by employees, as well as all duplicative data changes typically input by other client representatives. As employee usage gains traction, our clients contract the financial benefits of eliminating these duplicative data input. Clients choose the pace of their digital transformation and Paycom can go as fast or as slow as they want. However, we are seeing clients embrace the transformation at a faster pace today than a year ago. Before the DDX, no one in our industry, let alone HR professionals knew what appropriate employee usage look like or how to measure. Now they can and they are embracing it. Turning to our sales initiatives. In addition to continuing to innovate our product offering, we are also innovating our sales strategy as buying habits across the industry, continue to change with more companies becoming comfortable buying online. This means we will increasingly employ a combination of traditional sales teams and non-traditional sales teams, such as our inside sales group. We recently brought one of our most successful outside sales managers to lead our inside sales initiative, because we have found that prospective clients are embracing this non-traditional sales model and buying online. We believe this initiative will aid our sales growth and complement our existing sales efforts. We also recently opened a new sales office in New Orleans. While we continue to expand our sales footprint, I want to emphasize, that the largest driver of our sales growth is coming from the sheer mass of our existing sales force and their increased productivity. On the technology side, we continue to add talent to our outstanding development teams to focus on new products and software enhancements. We are experiencing a lot of success, and I'm very pleased with the product line. In fact, we recently released Ask Here to all of our clients. This newest tool gives employees a direct line of communication to ask work related questions of their company representatives and receive timely answers, all through the convenience of Paycom self service technology. I'm excited about the many benefits, companies and their employees gain such as one online communication resource that ensures all increase are addressed, actions are taken and eliminating the needs for employees to follow up through email, phone call or added foot traffic. Now employees don't need to know exactly who to ask questions to, as this functionality empowers them to ask any business question, which has been routed to the most appropriate client representative with the relevant expertise. This latest innovation further enhances the employee-employer experience and strengthens the clients employee usage initiatives. To conclude, we believe Paycom is leading the digital transformation of the HCM industry, which positions us well to deliver value to our clients and their employees throughout the year and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and updated guidance, Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our second quarter results for 2019, as well as discuss our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2019, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. As Chad mentioned, we were pleased with our second quarter results, with total revenues of $169.3 million, representing growth of 31.5% over the prior year period. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $166 million for the second quarter of 2019, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 31.1% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $144.4 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 85.3%. For the full year 2019, we anticipate that our adjusted gross margin will be within a range of 84% to 85%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $85.9 million for the quarter as compared to $61.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2019 was $39 million, as compared to $30.2 million in the second quarter of 2018. Adjusted R&D expense was $16.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, or 9.6% of total revenues. Total adjusted R&D costs including the capitalized portion, were $22.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $14.6 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $69.4 million or 41% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $53.5 million in the second quarter of 2018. Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was at $48.8 million or $0.83 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $35.7 million or $0.61 per diluted share based on approximately 59 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate was 6.9% for the second quarter and 16.1% for the six months ended, June 30, 2019. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be roughly 22% to 23%. For the third quarter, we anticipate non-cash stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $5 million to $7 million. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2019 was $43.7 million or $0.75 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $34.8 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the prior year period. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 58 million shares in the third quarter of 2019. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $94.8 million and total debt of $33.5 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of expansion-related construction at our corporate headquarters. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients, was approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2019. Now let me turn to guidance. For the third quarter of 2019, we expect total revenues in the range of $170 million to $172 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $61 million to $63 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 36% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2019, we are increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $728 million to $730 million or approximately 29% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We are also increasing our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $306 million to $308 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 42% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, first of all, congrats from me for another great quarter. Chad, my question is around the new sales strategy. Can you expand a little bit on the move toward inside sales, that's obviously like a big step for you, because you had a very strong direct model? Inside sales historically has been more kind of slightly lower in the market, like how do you -- how do you plan of like how big is that's going to get and how do you try to do the client segmentation? Thank you. Chad Richison : Yes, so I appreciate the question. So if this is in a shift in strategy, we've been having success, selling online. You did allude to the fact that we've had a small inside sales organization here, that does sell the smaller either prospects that call us or potentially clients that have an easier situation. But anyway, we continue to have increased lead volume and in both inside and outside sales, and these inside sales efforts are just augmenting our traditional sales model, it's not replacing it and so this should be accretive. The plans we have to continue to expand our footprint and outside sales haven't changed. As I just mentioned, we did open up an office in New Orleans. So we continue to open up new offices in a staggered approach, when it makes sense, but we also are having increased lead volume coming in through inside sales. And in addition to innovating our product, we're also innovating our sales strategy as well. And so -- but I wouldn't -- I wouldn't call this a shift in, in strategy, we're expanding in both areas. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Could be interesting. I'm going to follow it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Howard Ma : Hi. This is Howard Ma on for Samad. Thanks for taking the question. I have one for Chad, and one for Craig. So for Chad, I'm curious, are you seeing any cases of larger customers, that are showing resistance to this fully employee self-service approach to HR. So it could be whether due to -- could be due to organizational complexities or industry or regulatory barriers? And -- or I guess another way of asking is, on the flip side, are there any industry verticals that are -- that have fewer organizational complexities and thus, they are more -- there -- it could be 5,000 to 10,000 employees, but they are more likely to switch to self service? And then for Craig. just if -- I'm looking at the revenue guidance and if I want to back into EBITDA, I think it implies that you guys are going to see tremendous sales and marketing leverage in 4Q. And so, is that true? And then, if that is true, what are the drivers? Thank you. Chad Richison : Yes. So I'll take the first question, I mean, I'm sure I could single out a specific prospect that for one reason or another might not embrace the strategy of employees having a direct relationship with the database. But I can't think of a good reason, why any prospect regardless of size, wouldn't want their employees to have a direct relationship with the database. In fact, I believe that's what the enterprise market has been trying to build too with the multiple interfaces and now you're even seeing companies lay over areas of technology onto those back end so that employees can actually have some level of experience with their data. And so, I think, whether you're a large client or a large prospect, whether you're a smaller prospect, this is the future of our industry, and we're experiencing that future today. And so I would expect that all enterprise level type clients would receive the same type of value that the others. And we're actually seeing that, we do continue to sell at the upper end of our range and even above that. And so our lead generations actually continues to drive results for us in those areas. I'll let Craig answer the guidance question. Craig Boelte : Yes, in terms of the adjusted EBITDA in the back half. We would expect to see us some leverage in the sales and marketing, but also in the G&A line as well, kind of in the back half. Howard Ma : Okay. And if I may, just a follow-up, Craig. Have you guys updated long-term operating margin guidance, long-term targets or sales and marketing? What that could be over the -- I mean, I think, can we see it, perhaps dip below 20% of sales in over the next few years? Craig Boelte : We have not given any long-term guidance on adjusted EBITDA. Howard Ma : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Pinjalim Bora : Hi. This is Pinjalim on behalf of Mark. Congrats on the quarter guys. Two questions from me. Chad, you said you have opened one office this year, I think it was four offices in the first half of last year. How do you feel about the balance between the need for office openings, than the productivity gains of the existing offices? And in that context, I mean, could you talk about how sales productivity for mature office is tracking, maybe versus last year? Chad Richison : Yes, well, first I'd say without productivity gains, you don't need to open up any offices, productivity gains are very important. And so we continue to drive that, we've opened up a lot of offices, I've said this in the past, now we're 50 and at -- once those offices are full, they are averaging about eight reps each. And so that's 400 reps, for us, and that's quite a bit out there in the U.S. right now. And so when we look at the TAM, we already have covered, there's quite a bit there already. And so, yes, we are going to continue to expand at times, when it makes sense to us, but we also want to capture everything that's available to us now as well. And so again, I didn't say this to signal a shift in strategy, it's more a little bit and I wouldn't necessarily say that it's a shift. But we are seeing some buying habits change and a willingness depending on situation for people to buy online. And as I've said earlier, as we're innovating our product, we're also innovating our sales strategy. I don't think people are going to potentially by the same way, 10 years from now, that they're buying right now and we want to be looking at that. And what does that mean? I think the reasons why they buy actually, as we look into the future will probably be similar to why they're buying right now, as far as that goes, but I think how they buy, it can be a little bit different. We're not changing, what we're doing now. I just want to say that. We did open up an office, New Orleans. We do continue to focus on expanding that footprint. So anyway, I would just leave it with that. Second part of the question. Pinjalim Bora : Yes, well, just to follow up on that. I know you don't disclose the revenue retention number quarterly, but any qualitative comment about directionally, how that is trending this year so far, would be helpful? And I've gotten this question few times. How should investors think about a net dollar retention number that is something gross retention plus including upsells? Chad Richison : Yes, well, I mean we've measured, our retention the same since 2007, and it's a trailing 12, and so we've measured at the same. Last year was a very first time we saw an increase in that over a period of about seven years. And so obviously, we're looking to increase that -- this year. Retention something that improves throughout the year, you're going to typically have your largest losses in the beginning and then retention improves throughout the year. And so that's why we updated once a year to stay consistent, but it's been our focus to focus on retention and really what drives that is client satisfaction and the ROI that they're generating off of using the software and how we're able to increase that ROI for them as well as for their employees. And so those types of things drive retention for us and we're in the middle of the year and we'll report that number at the end of this year. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead. Brad Reback : Great, thanks very much. Chad, can you update us a bit on how the price increase in the quarter was received? Chad Richison : Sure. So we made -- mention of a modest price increase last quarter. And moving forward, we're not going to communicate any pricing in the future as we don't want to discuss our pricing strategy for our competitors. But I will say this, and I've said this in the past, as we drive greater ROI for our clients, it would only make sense that we would have the opportunity to share on the value that we're creating with our R&D spend. Ultimately, our clients are going to decide our value and I feel really good about the amount of No Fee functionality. We've added into the product to drive ROI for our clients, as well as their employees and I believe the clients are having a positive response to that enhancement. Brad Reback : Great, thanks very much. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brent Bracelin : Thank you. One for Chad here and then a follow-up for Craig. Chad, just given tight labor market, it seems like improving employee experience is gaining kind of industry momentum as a tool to increase employee retention. I know this data direct exchange product is early, but can you just talk about what portion of the customer base is kind of embrace the new product so far. It's only out there for one quarter, is this 5%, 10% of the customer base now adopting the product? And just trying to gauge how fast this product can be embraced by the existing customer base. Given it is so differentiated? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes. So the short answer is currently 95% of our clients have click through the DDX five times or more and the DDX has been out for four months. So we started the shift to employee usage to drive incremental ROI for the client and the employee about three years ago. We've already got 95% on click through. Currently if we look at our clients usage in aggregate for all of them, we're in the high 80s. But I will say this, I mean high 80 isn't a B plus on DDX. But it does show that clients are progressing. And how we see that even how they're using it, now we're having clients that want us to break down the DDX per user and per department and that tells us they're focused on it and they're using it to improve their scores as they are completing the digital transformation in HCM. Brent Bracelin : Got it. Very helpful And then just as a follow-up for Craig here, obviously, growth and billings -- revenue growth and billings growth accelerated this quarter that's against the backdrop of sales office locations kind of being flat here for the last four or five quarters. How much of that acceleration and growth was driven by kind of productivity gains, higher attach rates of different modules or the price increase. Any additional color there on what drove the acceleration would be super helpful? Thanks. Craig Boelte : I mean, as we mentioned in the script, new client wins is the majority of the revenue acceleration. We have -- 49 of our 50 offices are out there that are bringing on new clients. And so that's going to represent the majority of that revenue acceleration. Brent Bracelin : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : Good afternoon. Let me add my congratulations. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the large client initiative and what we're seeing there in terms of the 2,000 to 5,000 employee range, just what the pipeline looks like, what the receptivity is, how incremental has that been to the acceleration that we've seen in terms of the revenue growth? And then I've got a follow-up. Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes. And so we had been selling above the 2,000 employee range for quite a long time before we actually formalized it and said okay, now we're moving up to 5,000 and now we're even seeing clients come in above that. So I would just say that we are continuing to get more of those, but we also have more at-bats, because we have more reps. And then as our value proposition is getting stronger, people who may not have been as interested in it six years ago, are more interested in it now, because the value proposition continues to get stronger. Mark Marcon : Okay. And then with regards to the acceleration in terms of the revenue growth, I know new logos have always been the primary contributor, but to what extent relative to prior second quarters and kind of adjusting for seasonality would the additional attach rates in terms of modules versus more pace per control be, and then of course the pricing be impacting the acceleration? And can you also talk a little bit about the Ask Here module and is that an additional incremental charge? Chad Richison : Okay. Well, first I'll tell you, I mean as far as I think you're talking about the revenue growth and what really does that encompass and you talked about pricing up sell new logo adds. Mark Marcon : It's really twisted the past. Chad Richison : I wouldn't say that it's changed much at all, is in the past, I mean, I know that our new client wins percentage and our up sell percentage are very consistent as they have been in the past with the exception of the ACA year. With the exception of that year, where we did have an upside in Internal up sales to current clients just because of the sheer mass that kind of all came on at once. With the exception to that, our percentages have been very consistent and always overweighted very heavy toward the new logo side. As for the Ask Here, like the DDX and even like our app, Ask Here is one of those no fee functionality products that we do include within our stack, so that people will use the product correctly. And so Ask Here helps employees embrace the technology even more. Ask Here has a lot of benefits for both the company as well as the employee as an online communication resource where they can ask their inquiries online and it's set up by the client to have each question and each subject is answered by the expertise of that organization are client representative. And so, we just believe this strengthens employee usage and further drives the ROI for the business. And so -- and answer to your question that we aren't charging separately for Ask Here. Mark Marcon : Perfect. Congrats again. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Schwartz : Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question, question this afternoon. I just have one. I think, Chad, we've talked before in the past. I know it hasn't been the business sales strategy, it's been a new customer acquisition story and clearly that's working really well. We have talked about in the past about maybe tapping the install base going back to increase to usage and get full penetration within the installed base. I don't know if I know any software company that's full penetration. The question I want to ask you was on the expansion of the inside sales force. Clearly, it sounds like that's geared toward continue in the new customer acquisition. But over time, do you think there is an opportunity to maybe leverage those investments and maybe look back into the install base and see if you can further the penetration within that base Thanks. Chad Richison : Sure. Well, first of all, appreciate the question, allows me to put a little bit more clarity around the inside sales efforts and strategy that I was mentioning earlier. You are correct. Those inside sales are completely for new business wins, they are not for up-sales to current clients. When I was talking about how we relocated a manager to be able to build inside sales, that's the handled new business leads that's not up-sales to current clients. We have now and continue to have and have had for some time, a group of client relations reps that do upside or up-sales to current clients. And they also help us focus on usage and that groups really done both. As I've said in the past, it's important that clients use the products that we've sold them correctly, before we're selling them additional products. And so, we focused on that. I wouldn't ever say that our companies ever had this opinion that, we're just going to sell them some things now and then come back later and really sell them what they need. We've always been focused in making sure that the clients have what they need, when they need it, but at some level, you have to earn the right through an ROI achievement to sell the additional products. And so -- but I just wanted to state that, we have not ignored inside sales. It's not some grand plan that someday, we're going to come back and start selling everybody, all the products they really need. We do that today and we're focused on usage. In fact, something I said earlier about the DDX, I said in high 80s, is not to a B. At Paycom, our DDX score when I looked at it on Thursday was 99.7%, all right. Well for this month, we've had 164,000 or 165,000 changes so far, 164,000, 700, of those were made by employees. We had about 300 changes made by HR. So we have a 99.7% DDX score. So if we had an 88% DDX score, that wouldn't be the B, just because of the sure amount of changes that HR would have made. I mean if we had that type of score, you're probably looking at closer to 20,000 changes that HR would have made. And so that's why it's important and that's why, brought it out. The DDX -- we're watching our clients get there an aggregate, everyone is excited about it and that's really what's helping us drive results, and also we're seeing -- it makes it easier for people to understand what they're buying. If you look at this industry over time, we are bolting on all these things, even as I explained it to the investors, it can get kind of difficult to understand, okay, what is everything someone is doing, as we're looking at -- you're looking into the DDX, I do think it makes it easier for a client to understand what they're buying and what their ROI is going to be and because of that, you're seeing some buying habits change. Operator : The next question comes from Shankar Subramanian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Shankar Subramanian : Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results. I just have a couple of questions, one on your marketing spend. I know the last couple of years, you've kind of accelerated the spent in marketing and you've done -- and seen good results. Can you talk about how much of that benefit you have seen in the first half in terms of your results? And then maybe qualitatively comment on how you're thinking about second half in terms of your marketing spend? Chad Richison : Yes. So, we did the national ad campaign. Last year, we actually continue to use those assets. Some of those assets, we had to actually repurchase rights to. We've done that, we do continue to use that. We do have strong marketing initiatives both this quarter, as well as through the end of the year and that is all baked into our current guidance. And we are having success with showing an industry, how to use a product in different way. Shankar Subramanian : Got it, got it. And from a competitive churn perspective, any change you have seen notably over the past three months. Is that particularly with ultimate going forward. Any kind of color on that would be helpful? Chad Richison : I have not, its usual suspects for us as far as, who is out there. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan MacDonald with Needham. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys. This is Josh on for Ryan. I was just wondering what application into modules are helping driving the greatest increase in employee usage on the platform today, maybe just some color around that would be helpful? Chad Richison : Sure. It's somewhat going to depend on the client as far as when you talking about what product drives the greatest usage for them, if you have hourly employees with schedules and their swap, you're going to have a lot of usage in the system. If you have a salaried employees, you're not going to have as much time and attendance you might be in other areas of usage. And so it's really somewhat client-specific, we're going to deliver all to them that meets their needs at the time, obviously. And then how they're using it, is going to really depend on what type of industry they are in, how many employees they have, are they decentralized, are more of their people in one area. And so, usage is different per client, but 100% usage looks like a 100% usage. We might be talking about the difference in a client that made 200,000 changes total in their database for a month versus a client, that only made 80,000, because they have a different employee base, that doesn't require the same level of data input retrieval, that you're going to have with other types of employee basis. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And then just one other question. When looking at your larger customers with 2,000 employees and above. How much room is there for seat expansion with these customers? Or are they typically getting every employee on the initial deal front? Chad Richison : Well, for seat expansion, you would have it from the beginning. I mean for us, let's say this, they wanted to add additional master users or department users, even after all their employees are users, they can add as many users as they want, we don't -- we charge on a per employee basis, as far as number of users, they can have as many users as they want on the platform. Ryan MacDonald : But for your larger customers you're typically signing up every employee in the company initially? Chad Richison : Well, for any for any sized organization, we are signing up every employee, because we have to do the payroll, we have to input all the totals. We have to balance so even terminated employees are set up in our system. So anybody that had balances and we work through that with the client. And so, you might have -- you might have terminated employees, that want access to their data and it would be a best practice to keep an HCM technology turned on for terminated employees, so that you do not have to respond on certain issues that they can actually gather that information for themselves. So from an employee side, we're going to set up all. Operator : The next question comes from Drew Kootman with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Drew Kootman : Hi guys, good quarter. Just wanted to ask on, as you guys move into those larger businesses and I know you guys have already sold to that group, but just are you seeing any changes from what the client needs. You have to change your sales tactic at all, as you move up that group? Chad Richison : I would -- no, we're not changing our sales tactics. It's the same group. What I will say is this, though, as you move up, what's the difference in an employee that works for a 200 employee company and an employee that works for a 10,000 employee company. There is no difference. In the past, the difference was the size of the company and that is still important, because size of company and how they're -- how they're set up is going to give you some type of view of complexity and what have you, but the employee users are the same. An employee at a 300 employee company is going to be meeting and using the same type of thing, that employee at a 3,000 employee company. And so as far as when you're making an impact to an employee, those 10,000 employee companies they see their employees, as the same way as a 300 employee company might see them as far as a user, I mean you're going to have department leads and salespeople and everything else. And so that's I think what's more evening out for everyone, which is making it easier for people to understand the value proposition. I mean in our industry often times, people bought off of the brochure and then you're trying to figure out what you have over the next three years of conversion. And so with this, you're seeing it upfront, you know what you're aiming for and we're having -- getting a lot of leads just from ranking file employees that leave one company and go into another company and don't really want to work with multiple systems and really go backwards in the technology. Drew Kootman : And then just one quick follow-up on the really strong adjusted EBITDA, any color on what led to that higher number specialty versus the guidance you guys were expecting? Craig Boelte : I mean, primarily, you saw the revenue beat flow through to the adjusted EBITDA line, very similar. So it was really -- lot of the revenue beat was able to flow through to the bottom line. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chad Richison for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right, well, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. Next month, we'll be on the road meeting with investors at the following conferences, I'll be presenting at the KeyBanc Technology Leadership Forum on August 13th in Vail; and Craig and James will be hosting investor meetings at both the Oppenheimer and Canaccord Technology and Growth conferences in Boston on August 6th and August 7th. We appreciate your continued interest in Paycom, and look forward, meeting with many of you soon. Thanks, operator. You may disconnect. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Also, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and certain adjusted expenses. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I'll start by reviewing another strong quarter of robust profitable growth and provide you some comments on employee usage, Direct Data Exchange and Ask Here. I'll finish by discussing the scale of the human capital management, or HCM industry and the strength of our position within it. Then Craig will review our financials and outlook before taking your questions. Third quarter results were strong driven by robust new business adds and our durable high-margin recurring revenue business. Q3 revenue was approximately $175 million, representing growth of 31% over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA of $66.6 million in Q3, represented a year-over-year margin expansion of roughly 1 percentage point to 38%. With these strong results and our expectations for continued strength in Q4, we are raising full year revenue growth guidance to approximately 30% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range, which Craig will discuss in more detail in his remarks. We have a lot of great things happening here at Paycom. We've been leading the charge in the HCM industry with our focus on employee usage that we believe is fundamental to the future of our industry and we are starting to see this theme echoed in the marketplace. With Paycom, our clients benefit from higher employee engagement, increased productivity and job satisfaction. We continue to find new ways to encourage businesses and their employees to embrace the digital transformation in the workplace just as they already have in their daily lives. Easy-to-use solutions including mobile apps continue to be important drivers of employee engagement. Earlier this year, we introduced all of our clients to the Direct Data Exchange, or DDX, and we recently demonstrated this disruptive tool as part of the awesome new tech showcase at HR Tech. The ability to track and measure all data changes made by employees and all duplicative data entries made by client representatives allows us to quantify the cost savings that our clients might realize if they were operating at or near 100% DDX score, just like Paycom and many of our clients are already achieving today. Prospective clients are taking notice of the DDX and we are receiving leads from it, including prospective clients well above our stated targeted range, who upon implementation are achieving great results with the DDX. To put the potential cost savings in perspective, while clients are achieving an average DDX score approaching 90%, if all of our clients were operating at 100% DDX score, we estimate they could save an aggregate of nearly $0.5 billion annually. Until the launch of DDX, no one in our industry let alone HR professionals knew what appropriate employee usage look like or how to measure it. And now we can take it a step further and attribute a measurable estimate of ROI to incentivize further employee usage. We are very pleased with the DDX adoption levels we are seeing, but there is still a lot of cost savings still yet to be captured by our clients as they migrate up the DDX usage scale. Last quarter, we launched Ask Here to our clients, a tool that gives employees a direct line of communication to ask work related questions at their company representatives and receive timely answers, all through the convenience of Paycom's self-service technology. While it is still early, already half of our clients have enabled the new feature and the initial feedback has been very positive. I'm very excited about the benefits companies and their employees are starting to experience and look forward to continuing to iterate and develop this new tool. These innovations further enhance the employee-employer experience and strengthen the clients' employee usage initiative, which are contributing to our rapid sales growth and market share gains within a large and expanding HCM addressable market. To conclude, I'm particularly pleased with this very strong third quarter with every metric pointing in the positive direction, and continued strong demand and new sales growth. With 98% recurring revenue, we're setting up really well for 2020. I'm confident that our product strategy, our people and our high-performance culture position us well for the long-term. We're delivering tremendous value to our clients and their employees, as we lead them through the digital transformation of the HCM industry. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and updates to guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our third quarter results for 2019 as well as discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. As Chad mentioned, we were pleased with our third quarter results with total revenues of $175 million, representing growth of 31.3% over the prior year period. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $171.4 million for the third quarter of 2019, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 31% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $149.4 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 85.3%. For the full year 2019, we anticipate that our adjusted gross margin will be between 85% and 86%. Total adjusted administrative expenses were $94.4 million for the quarter, as compared to $70.7 million in the third quarter of 2018. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2019 was $46.7 million, as compared to $35.2 million in the third quarter of 2018. Adjusted R&D expense was $18 million in the third quarter of 2019, or 10.3% of total revenues. Total adjusted R&D costs, including the capitalized portion were $24.8 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $16.1 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $66.6 million, or 38% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $49.2 million in the third quarter of 2018. Our GAAP net income for the third quarter was at $39.2 million, or $0.67 per diluted share based on approximately 58.4 million shares versus $28.8 million, or $0.49 per diluted share based on approximately 58.5 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate was 22.5% for the third quarter and 18.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. For the fourth quarter, we expect our effective income tax rate to be roughly 27% to 28%. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be roughly 20% to 21%. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-cash stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $6 million to $7 million. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2019 was $41.1 million or $0.70 per diluted share based on approximately 58.4 million shares versus $30.6 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the prior year period. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 58 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2019. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $108.1 million and total debt of $33.1 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of expansion-related construction at our corporate headquarters. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2019. During the quarter, we purchased 107.5 acres of land adjacent to our corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City for $19.2 million. While we currently do not have any plans to build on it, it was an opportunity for us to establish additional space around our existing headquarters if future business needs require it. Now let me turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect total revenues in the range of $188.5 million to $190.5 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 26% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $72 million to $74 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 38.5% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2019, we are increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $733 million to $735 million or approximately 30% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We are also increasing our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $311 million to $313 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 42.5% at the midpoint of the range. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my questions and congrats to another great quarter. Two questions. Chad, can you talk -- you mentioned earlier on your comments that DDX is kind of pulling you slightly higher up in the market. Can you kind of expand on that a little bit? Is that like into the 2000 to 5000 employee category that you kind of had -- kind of given into the sales force last year? Or is that even above that? And kind of what's the momentum that you're seeing there? And then a question for Craig, like even I have now discovered that your EBITDA margins are higher compared to last year. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers in that? While you're talking about that talk a little bit about as well what you saw from the TV advertisement that you saw last year and that kind of were successful enough to kind of run it again this year. Thank you. Chad Richison : All right. Well first, Raimo, I think you squeezed in about four questions, but I will handle it. The DDX, what I've said was we are beginning to get leads from having the DDX and that's true. In fact, one particular client that we had was double our stated range and they've already made 2 million changes in the last four months. And they have a DDX score of about 99%. And so it is differentiating us out there in the marketplace for those businesses that do want their employees to have that direct relationship with the database as it were for both input and data retrieval. I'll let Craig talk a little bit about the adjusted EBITDA. Craig Boelte : Yes. In terms of our guidance for this quarter Raimo, we're currently guiding \u2013 basically, we're at the midpoint this year and this quarter at where we finished last year. So nice of you to notice that. Some of the give and takes we're continuing to spend on the R&D and on the sales and marketing and then we're starting to see the efficiencies in the G&A line, as we're \u2013 if you remember last year towards the end of the year is when we bought that building online. So, I'm seeing some efficiency there. And then your question on the TV ad, yeah we \u2013 you are seeing some TV ads this fourth quarter, but any of that has already baked into current guidance. Chad Richison : And they were successful as we had in the last year, which is why we are continuing them into a little bit in third quarter and fourth quarter this year. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Well done. Okay. Thank you. Congrats. Chad Richison : You bet. Operator : And our next question today will come from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark Murphy : Yes. Thank you very much. I'll add my congrats. Chad, I'm curious what percentage of the new logos that you're signing recently are signing up for 100% mandated employee usage? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, we continue to have that growing as far as we're getting the pledge. I'd have to look through exactly that is a growing number. I can't say that, it's 100% of them. What I will say though is 100% of all of our clients that are on-boarding we are seeing increased DDX scores from the beginning. So they're out-of-the-gate number of DDX for those companies that have converted in third quarter are higher than the out-of-the-gate DDX scores from those that had converted in the previous quarter. And so we are continuing to see growth in the DDX, initial scores month-over-month which does continue to push our aggregate number of DDX up. Mark Murphy : Okay. Great. And then Craig is it possible to quantify, any incremental drag you'd expect in 2020 from the interest rate reductions in the overall interest rate environment? Craig Boelte : Yeah. I mean, we call out that our average daily fund balance was $1.1 billion. So a 25 basis point decline with the \u2013 it will obviously layer in, but the full 25 will be somewhere in the $2.5 million to $3 million. Chad Richison : Yeah. And last year, we did benefit from some interest rate raises. This year, we've had some interest rates headwinds as they've started to reverse. We continue to put up the numbers in face of those headwinds. The last \u2013 in the last 21 years, I mean, we received yields as high as 5.9% on overnight sweep accounts and as low as 0%. We have a very small percent of the TAM, and we have the most differentiated product in the marketplace, and we feel comfortable about being able to weather whatever happens with the interest rates. It is important to note, we sell more in new business in a week than any quarter point drop in interest rates. And so our annualized sales on average on any given week is greater than any quarter percentages rate drop. So there \u2013 it is out there. It does create some headwind, obviously, but we've been pushing through it as you've seen in this quarter. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. Chad Richison : You bet. Operator : Our next question today will come from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much. And I'll echo my congrats as well nice results. Chad, it's the time of year where we see interesting product developments being rolled out across the HCM space more broadly from a competitive viewpoint whether it's on-demand pay or layers of intelligence that are augmenting various HCM processes. I just wonder, are customers asking for things that competitors have been showcasing? And in the past few quarters, you've hinted that additional products as well. Any teasers on future product direction or places where you'd go or places maybe where you definitely wouldn't go that you'd even directionally be able to give us a sense of how you're thinking about things from an R&D perspective? Chad Richison : Yeah. So, I mean our R&D buckets have been substantially the same as far as what our spend is. You are going to have a certain portion on compliance the things we have to do to keep our software updated in accordance with the \u2013 both labor laws as well as tax laws deposit filing. You're going to have another piece of that that continue \u2013 a third of that is going to be \u2013 to continue to expand. They're not proportionate. I'm just saying, there's three categories. At any given time you can be in one \u2013 more in one category than the other, but a second category. So, first category is what I just mentioned more on the compliance side. The second category is continuing to develop out deeper within our current product set making them better. And so we continue to update that. The third category of the three would be innovation. And that's us developing items things like the DDX, like Ask Here that are typically replacing nothing within our industry or some other third-party concept. And so we do continue to work on that. Staying true to ourselves, we don't disclose those products that we're working on until they're out. But you will continue to see as you have in the past further innovation from us, as well as continuing to go deep within our product set to make -- drive more value for the client. Brad Zelnick : I appreciate that and I appreciate the commentary, maybe just -- and a follow-up from a go-to-market perspective. Again heading into a new year and I know you're probably still in the midst and the thick of your planning cycle, but as we think about your go-to-market somewhat unique very definitive model that you've pursued. As of a couple of quarters ago, I think it was we talked about moving upmarket, which really wasn't a change from what you had been doing. But as a great sales leader once said to me, if you're doing the same things this year to be successful that you did last year, you got to mix it up. Any early thoughts on just the learnings from the changes and the tweaks that you've made to the model over the past year or so or a couple of years and directionally what we might be in for as we look forward? Chad Richison : Yes. So you are right. You have to continuously change your strategy -- your go-to-market strategy as the product continues to change too. I mean if we are going to market the same way today as what we went three years ago, when we have a different product today than what we had three years ago that would be a problem for us. We're only getting stronger as an organization. I mean, we have a very small percent of a large TAM. We're creating a larger competitive moat. This year is shaping up to be our best year as an organization. And last year was hard to follow as probably our best year up until then. But here we set about ready to stamp out another 30% growth with the rule of 70 again. And so, I feel like we're doing really well and we're set up very well for -- as we head into next year. Brad Zelnick : Well congrats on all the success. Thanks guys. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Brad Reback of Stifel. Please go ahead. Brad Reback : Thanks very much. Chad can you give us an update on the inside sales initiative how that's progressing? Chad Richison : Yes. So we started that. I believe I announced it last quarter. We\u2019ve started a little bit before where I think we had five reps, we had moved in outside sales manager into build that group. We now do have two teams inside sales teams. No change in strategy there just in size. They do continue to catch those deals businesses that are calling in below 50, as well as catch those deals that might be out of territory areas where we do not have an office, where they can pick up some low-touch opportunities there. So nothing's really changed there except they are staffed. Brad Reback : Great. And then just one quick follow-up, R&D spend has increased as a percent of revenue at a very nice pace as you continue to obviously put money back into the product. Any sense longer term where we should expect that to stabilize as a percent of revenue? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean we continue to increase our R&D spend. I mean from quarter-to-quarter I think sometimes it goes up a little bit in percent of revenue there's been quarters, where it's fluctuated the opposite way when you're looking at quarter over prior year quarter. But we do continue to invest in our R&D strategies. And so, it's all relative to -- as to our growth as well. We're still very focused on continuing to be a very strong growth company and that would require us to continue to invest in the product. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question today will come from Mark Marcon of Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : Good afternoon. Let me add my congrats. With the DDX -- well it's not the DDX itself, it's the usage that this -- that the DDX is measuring is that continues to track up. Can you talk a little bit about how that's impacting the sales force and the ability to go out and convert sales leads? How well is that resonating? And then also what would you anticipate as we go through the year from a retention perspective because it would seem like you've got some really nice proof points? Chad Richison : Sure. Well some prospects have that initiative. And so, they have an initiative to have their employees have a direct relationship with the database as were in 2019 and beyond. They see that as a huge benefit to the organization. Other clients they might see it as a benefit to the organization, but they're not yet ready to actually take it on. And so with those clients, it is a different type sales process where we have to acclimate them to the idea. It's something that they haven't been used to in the past. And so we continue to do that. And so I would just say some sales, it's much easier for us. And some sales, since we are bringing something to market that's different than what they're used to we have to sell a different way. But we haven't seen any elongated sales process times and/or conversion times from it it's just -- it's different. As far as conversion, I always think that the more value you bring to clients and the more usage that you're able to establish, the longer clients look to stay with you. As far as retention, we do update that once a year. We aren't updating that now. And as we move through the end of the year, the number start to change as you go through October, November and December. And so we'll be updating that at the first of the year. Mark Marcon : Great. And can I just ask a quick follow-up with regards to just as you're planning for next year Chad, what's the organizational readiness for expansion in terms of new offices? You're obviously doing a great job in the markets you're in, but just wondering broadening up the coverage. Chad Richison : Yes. So we are opening up offices as part of our strategy. We did open up New Orleans as well as expanded an inside sales team so far this year. I will point out that of the more than $20 billion of TAM that we have, we've already got half of it covered in the markets that we have open. Our focus is on productivity of sales reps as well as careful expansion and execution. And I mean, as you can see from the results the strategy is working. Mark Marcon : Absolutely, correct. Operator : And our next question today will come from Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Schwartz : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Chad just a thought maybe I'd ask you just a question. Any update that you're aware of in terms of the competitive landscape? Are you seeing any changes in terms of the win rates that you're aware of or maybe where the replacements are coming from? And then the follow-up question I had for Craig was just on the cash flow in the quarter. It came in quite a bit higher than where I had modeled that. And just wondering if maybe you're able to spend everything that you wanted to spend in the quarter? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes. So I'll take the first question. I would tell you, it's usual suspects for us as it has been for a long time. And our win rates aren't getting any -- well the -- our win rates aren't going down. So I can just say that from there. Craig Boelte : Yes. I mean in terms of the cash flow, it's kind of where we expect it. I mean you're going to have some variation quarter-to-quarter as it relates to let's say tax payments and things like that. But yes, I feel like we're probably spending at the right levels. Brian Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today will come from Nandan Amladi of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Nandan Amladi : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So on the gross margins, how much of your gross margin improvement is driven by this push for automation versus just natural scale in the business as you get larger? Craig Boelte : I mean obviously we're seeing this employee usage strategy that it is having an impact on our gross margins. We're able to see that our specialists were able to handle a larger volume just because our clients are using the system and their employees are using the system kind to the fullest. So it is having an impact on our gross margins. Nandan Amladi : Okay. And then on the move upmarket, would you characterize any change in sales cycles as you move upmarket Chad? Chad Richison : No. I wouldn't. And I want to say, we haven't moved any further upmarket. Our range is still the range. We've always continued to get clients at the upper end of our range in the past. We just have had success with people contacting us with the strategy a little bit more so than what we had in the past. So we kind of called that out. As far as sales cycles and as well as conversion cycles those have stayed the same. Nandan Amladi : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Samad Samana of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Samad Samana : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Chad, I guess kind of maybe following up on the upmarket success. I'm curious, if you see a different trend in the modules that customers at the upper end of your customer base are adopting or if there's something in particular that brings them over or that you're seeing greater pickup that's driving that success. Chad Richison : Yes. I don't know that I could call out greater adoption upmarket. We've always had strong adoption of our products. Our clients take a greater than half of the products that we have at the time of conversion and that hasn't changed upmarket either. Are you still there Samad? Samad Samana : Yes, great. No, I did not have a follow-up question. Thanks for that. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question today will come from Arvind Ramnani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Arvind Ramnani : Thanks for taking the question. Good results. Just on the employee engagement and DDE just wanted to see are you all -- just continue to see more success of this offering? Do you think you may kind of tell to your kind of revenue model to charge more of a usage-based or kind of success or percentage of cost savings that you're offering clients or you don't think you may go that route? Chad Richison : Well, no, I mean I don't. I actually think the more you use our system the better it is for Paycom too. I will tell you that most business -- most software companies at least if you look historically, they're not necessarily advertising how much of the system you're using. We're actually measuring it. We're leading with it. We want you to use the full system. And so I don't see us that we're charging clients more for using the system. They've already bought the modules. And so once you've made that investment, you may as well -- I've always said cost you the same whether you get the full value out of the system or not. And in order to get the full value out of the system, but that's about usage and being able to measure that for our clients so that they receive that value and that return on investment I think is making the difference. Arvind Ramnani : Great. And then where are things -- we have talked about is essentially your focus on automation. With your current like product set and offering, where do you think is sort of the greatest kind of opportunity for further automation? Chad Richison : Employee productivity. Arvind Ramnani : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today will come from Ryan MacDonald of Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Ryan MacDonald : Hi Chad and Craig, thanks for taking my questions. First off, Chad I was interested to see that Paycom's presence at HR Tech with a boost for the first time in quite a while. Just curious what really went on to that decision-making process? And if you could talk about any of the benefits that you've seen since then from either increased brand awareness or from a lead-generation perspective. Chad Richison : Yes, I think this was our third year in a row to attend HR Tech. But you're right we have -- we had been absent from it prior to that. So, yes, -- I mean going through trade shows and what have you and definitely HR Tech is something that we had started doing about three years ago. We did continue it this year. It gives us an opportunity to highlight new products that we've developed. I think we implemented the HR Break Room last year where we had it I think somewhat in the middle of the floor. And so we do continue to make those investments in trade shows as well and HR Tech is a good one for us to go to. Ryan MacDonald : Got it. And then just a follow-up. On the Ask Here communication platform, I think you mentioned that about half of your customers had enabled it since you had launched it or announced it. What sort of usage trends are you starting to see even though it's early days there? And do you think this is something that had -- takes a similar path to what you're seeing with Direct Data Exchange? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes, I would say they're a little different. I mean DDX is kind of the scorecard to the strategy that a business might implement and Ask Here is actually something that should continue to grow. I mean you're somewhat limited by your imagination on questions. I mean you set up the categories of questions, it can be whatever you want. You set up who are the company representative experts on those questions, whether it's benefits administration question where it's a how do I get a key question or whatever IT questions resources whatever they're all right there. And so what it allows the company to do is set up those categories. And then for employees, oftentimes, they don't know who to ask. With Ask Here you don't need to know who to ask. You just ask your question of Ask Here and it knows who the appropriate person to respond to that question is. And so it just greater drives employee adoption, if you will, as well as that it builds that conduit once again between the employer and the employee for stronger communication. And so they're a little different Ask Here versus DDX, but both are strong differentiators. Ryan MacDonald : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today will come from Daniel Jester of Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just to kind of build off the last one, when you're introducing some of the new functionalities to the platform like DDX, like Ask Here, can you just kind of philosophically talk to us about whether you want to charge for that, whether you want to give it away for free? Like how do you think about when you're introducing new features, how do you think to your clients to ultimately benefit the most from it? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, I see that as a kind of a -- it's hard for me to answer that question without giving out too much competitive strategy on exactly how we decide, which products we're going to develop, and which we're going to charge for. I can tell you this though. There are certain products that it's so important that you get 100% usage on. You really don't want to go through the time of trying to sell it over the next year or two to clients. DDX was definitely one of those types of products that could we have sold it? Maybe on the margin, but I would rather have 100% people using it. And that's the same with Ask Here. They just both create so much value. And so I would just leave it at that. We do continue to develop other products that would be for a fee products. But these two, I really felt like it's important for us to get 100% usage out of it. We're getting close on the DDX as far as I mean we've had at least every client click through it from that perspective. And then on Ask Here, we actually have 50% of the clients using it right now. And I see that adoption rate only increasing as we head throughout the fourth quarter and into next year. Daniel Jester : Great, thanks. And then on the balance sheet ending with over $100 million on the balance sheet, can you just sort of talk about how do you view deploying that cash? And is there a time in which you'll become more structured with letting investors know about whether you're going to be using that cash for buyback et cetera? Thanks. Craig Boelte : Yeah. I mean, we are approaching over -- we're over $100 million now on the balance sheet. And I mean our first priority is to invest in growth in the R&D side. And as you're aware, we still have $120 million available under our current or existing buyback plan. And that is one of the ways that we return capital to shareholders. We were very opportunistic in 2018 towards the end and have continued to build back our cash position throughout this year. Operator : And our next question today will come from Drew Kootman of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Drew Kootman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just one for me. On DDX and Ask Here button, are you seeing any differences on people picking it up quicker, maybe they're larger clients or smaller clients? Just anything you can point to of how quickly people are adopting it in different areas. Chad Richison : Yeah. So all products start off right when you put it out then you get to train the sales organization and what have you and it takes a little while before the sales organization is necessarily, selling it that way from the beginning. I can tell you on both of those products if clients are coming in today, they're on those products. But we've got a lot of clients that we've had in the past that we didn't sell on those products from the beginning. But new business coming in should all be using the DDX and Ask Here, but we still have a large client base that we've had to circle back to. And we've done a good job as I mentioned with the DDX last quarter and as I've mentioned on this call with Ask Here. We've done a good job of circling back to those clients and making sure they're capturing the value of these products that are just included to further drive ROI. Drew Kootman : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today will come from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Siti Panigrahi : Chad, I just wanted to drill into the Q4 pipeline, which is easily a strong quarter in terms of new customer, adds. So are you seeing any more traction in terms of pipeline in your switch for like 500 to 2,000 range? Or are you seeing more on the upper end side 2,000 to 5000? Any comments in terms of demand environment? Chad Richison : I mean, no real change there. I mean, I used to talk about the top end of our range and I was talking about above 2,000. Now when I talk about the top end of our range, I'm talking about above 5,000. So I mean that's -- that's had some change a little bit. We've got a strong guide going into Q4. In fact our guide this year heading into Q4 is larger as a percentage than it was last year heading into Q4. And so, we feel really strong about what we have in the pipe for Q4. And we're seeing strong demand across the market would be the answer to that question. Siti Panigrahi : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today will come from Robert Simmons of RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Robert Simmons : Nice results guys. What has been the response or pushback to the recent price increase you put through? Chad Richison : Yes. So, I mean, we did a pricing adjustment. If you guys remember, we did that. It had very little to no impact on fourth -- on first quarter excuse me. It'll have about 1% impact for the full year. I mentioned that I believe in second quarter, I said at that time, we consider pricing adjustments to be competitive in nature. So, it's not something that I'm going to talk about moving forward in how we choose to price our product. Robert Simmons : Can you talk though -- have you seen any clients having negative reaction to it? Or are they basically just taking it in stride which is a small percent? Chad Richison : Yes. I feel really good about our pricing strategy. And as I've said before, we were able to have a price adjustment to a select group of clients. It had a very small impact on first quarter. On the quarters subsequent to that, we expect about 1% total impact on our organization for this year. And moving forward pricing, I do considered to be competitive and it's not something I want to talk about on these calls. Robert Simmons : Got it. All right. Thanks. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will now conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Chad Richison for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. Well, I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. Over the next couple of months, we'll be on the road meeting with investors at the following conferences. Craig and James will be hosting Investor Meetings at the Stifel Growth Conference in Chicago on November 7 and at the RBC Tech Conference in New York on November 19. I'll be presenting at the Credit Suisse Tech Conference on December 3 in Arizona as well as at the Barclays Tech and Media Conference in San Francisco on December 11. We appreciate your continued interest in Paycom and we look forward to meeting with many of you soon on the road. Thank you, operator. You may disconnect. Operator : Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. We thank everyone for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect your lines.",

Also during the course of today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and certain adjusted expenses. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James and thank you to everyone, joining our call today. I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter 2019 results, review some of our notable achievements in 2019 and also discuss our goals for 2020. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance and then we will take questions. 2019 was another exceptional year for Paycom as we continue to benefit from our differentiated employee strategy and measurement capabilities, along with our comprehensive product offering. We continue to strengthen our position in the human capital management, or HCM software industry. I believe we will look back on 2019 as the year employee usage emerged as a key buying criteria for HCM technology as businesses provide their employees a more efficient way to interact with their own data. I want to thank all of our employees who have helped Paycom change the way people use technology in our industry. We finished the year with very impressive results. Our 2019 fourth quarter revenue exceeded $193 million and represented growth of nearly 29% over the comparable prior year period. Our full year 2019 revenue of $738 million grew 30%, compared to 2018. Our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDA was $318 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43%. With this combination of revenue growth and margin, we again achieved the Rule of 70, as we have done for many consecutive years. This accomplishment places Paycom in an elite group of companies that deliver an enviable combination of rapid revenue growth and high margins, and our goal is to maintain a healthy balance of both. We believe our strong performance is due at least in part to growing employee usage of the Paycom system, which is generating substantial benefits for our clients, their employees and Paycom. Employee usage rates, as measured by our Direct Data Exchange or DDX now exceed 90%, on average, across our client base, which means our clients are generating substantial savings and high employee satisfaction. Ernst & Young recently updated its HR study that showed on average a single HR task or data entry point without self-service cost an organization $4.51 to complete, up from $4.39 previously. Our clients are embracing this concept and once again by using our solution, are realizing the cost savings across their entire employment life cycle. In fact, DDX scores for new clients are starting off higher than average, including several large new clients running at or near 100% right out of the gate. Our employee usage message is resonating across the industry, and we continue to promote the benefits to our clients at striving for 100% DDX scores over time. For Paycom, this trend is translating into increasing client interest and sales efficiency, more efficient customer service, high Paycom employee satisfaction and higher revenue retention. I am pleased to share that our annual revenue retention rate for 2019 increased, once again, to 93%, up from 92% in 2018, representing the second consecutive year of improvement after remaining steady at 91% for the prior 6 years. In addition to the DDX, in 2019, we rolled out over 1,500 software enhancements, including several important product launches, such as Ask Here, a communication platform that gives employees a direct line of communication to ask work-related questions that are routed to the appropriate company contact through the convenience of Paycom self-service technology. We also introduced substantial enhancements to our learning management platform with performance evidence and video content creator. We are kicking off 2020 with what I believe will be one of the most significant product developments of the last two years. On Monday, we announced the official launch of Manager on-the-Go, a tool built into Paycom\u2019s existing mobile app, which empowers leaders with 24/7 accessibility to essential manager side functionality of our solution. I believe this is the single most important product release we\u2019ve had since the launch of our employee self-service app. This easy to use functionality distributes the approval responsibilities more broadly and removes impediments to quick data flow. Just like employee self-service fundamentally changed the way employees engage with our solution, Manager on-the-Go fundamentally changes the way managers and decision-makers interact with our solutions. Paycom has been using Manager on-the-Go internally for two months. And for those managers who have been using the product, the vast majority of the manager actions previously done on desktop are now done on mobile. In 2019, we opened our New Orleans sales office and significantly expanded our inside sales capabilities. This brings us to 50 sales teams through the end of 2019. As we look to 2020, we continue to focus on increasing productivity and sales capacity within our existing teams, while at the same time, opening new offices when they make sense to us. As of December 31, 2019, our headcount stood at 3,765 employees as we continue to hire aggressively across our organization to help further bolster the foundation of our future growth. I am very excited by the breadth and quality of our workforce and our ability to attract and retain top talent across the U.S. Paycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2019. In the fourth quarter, we earned two additional accolades. We earned best places to work in the U.S. owners from Glassdoor for 2020 and The Wall Street Journal as the Paycom is one of the best managed companies in the U.S. Both these awards are extremely rewarding and a testament to the culture we continue to develop and grow. Lastly, I want to congratulate the 2019 Paycom Jim Thorpe Award winner, Grant Delpit from Louisiana State University. This award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes one of the greatest athletes in Jim Thorpe who also happens to be in Oklahoma. To sum up, 2019 was a banner year for Paycom. I\u2019d like to thank our employees for helping make 2019 our best year ever with a combination of 30% revenue growth, record adjusted EBITDA margin and record revenue retention. With the momentum we are seeing, I am excited about how 2020 is already shaping up. With that, I will turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2019 and also our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2020, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. As Chad mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results with total revenues of $193.4 million, representing growth of roughly 29% over the comparable prior year period. Our full year 2019 revenue was $737.7 million, representing growth of 30%, compared to 2018. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $190.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 28.5% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $165 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 85.3%, up 100 basis points, compared to the prior year period. For the full year 2019, our adjusted gross margin was 85.7%, also up 100 basis points, compared to full year 2018. For 2020, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at 85% to 86%. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $98.6 million for the fourth quarter, as compared to $78.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $48.5 million or 25.1% of revenues. We are seeing positive results from our recent ad campaigns and plan to continue to invest in marketing in Q1 and throughout the year. Adjusted R&D expense was $17.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 or 9.3% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $17.7 million in the prior year period. Adjusted total R&D costs for the full year 2019, including the capitalized portion, were $93.3 million or 12.6% of total revenues, compared to $61.5 million or 10.9% of total revenues in the prior year. We continue to attract great talent in R&D, and we plan to continue to invest in our future growth through innovation and new product development. Adjusted EBITDA was $78.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 or 40.6% of total revenues, compared to $57.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 or 38.2% of total revenues. For the full year 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $317.9 million or 43.1% of total revenues, compared to $240.9 million or 42.5% of total revenues in 2018. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $45.4 million or $0.78 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $31.4 million or $0.54 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 25.8%. For the full year 2019, our GAAP net income was $180.6 million or $3.09 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $50.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $35.4 million or $0.61 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. We expect non-cash stock-based compensation, for the first quarter of 2020 to be approximately $17 million. For the full year, we anticipate non-cash stock-based compensation will be approximately $78 million. For 2020, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 23% to 25% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 26% to 27%. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 58 million shares in the first quarter of 2020. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $134 million and total debt of $33 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $47.8 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. Now let me turn to guidance. We are pleased to provide a strong initial guidance that is consistent with our historical guidance approach of guiding to what we can see as of today. Our full year and first quarter 2020 guidance is as follows. For fiscal year 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $911 million to $913 million or approximately 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $384 million to $386 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 42% at the midpoint of the range. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect total revenues in the range of $240 million to $242 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 21% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $113 million to $115 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 47% at the midpoint of the range. We received approximately half of our weekly high-margin recurring revenue on Wednesdays, because January 1, 2020, fell on a Wednesday. There is a unique calendar anomaly this year that we will again experience in five years. In 2020, there are only 12 banking Wednesdays in the first quarter instead of the usual 13 and in the third quarter, there are 14 banking Wednesdays instead of the usual 13. So for quarterly modeling purposes, we expect recurring revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be impacted by approximately a half week of recurring revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter or roughly $8 million each. In the third quarter, we regained an additional half week of existing recurring revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Next year, returns to a normal cadence as each quarter contains 13 banking Wednesdays. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a great finish to the year. Two questions. First, share that your customer retention improved again this year and I mean 93% is almost enterprise type level. Can you talk a little bit to the drivers to that, because your customer base is more kind of mid-market, but 93% is kind of really best-in-class and how do you get there and kind of can that go even higher potentially? And then you kind of need to explain that Wednesday kind of think again with the Wednesday receipts because a small working industry it kind of seems a bit unusual, but maybe you can give us a little bit more background there? Thank you. Chad Richison : Sure, Raimo. So I will start off first with the retention. About three years ago, we really started driving toward the employee usage strategy and that\u2019s where employees actually help employers through managing their own data with the direct access. And so we started on that. We released the app. We started to see retention improved as that strategy continued to become prevalent across the organization. We did get some improvement both in 2018. And then in 2019 as we released the Direct Data Exchange, it actually helped our clients, helped us manage that process and put that score out there for them. And they\u2019ve embraced it. And we\u2019ve got two types of clients. I mean we do have those clients that have really embraced it. And we have those clients that are trying to, if you will. And so but for everybody, it really does show the amount of \u2013 the types of efficiencies that can be gained when those employees have a direct relationship with the database. And so that as well as we have continued to enhance our products, I mean, I look at how much we enhanced our learning management product, included it in the price. And then we\u2019ve also done that with Ask Here. And then, once again, with Manager on-the-Go, which I believe is the most significant product we have released since our app. And so I think we\u2019ve done well on retention. Your question of can it continue to go higher? Obviously, we do have some clients that might may be bought, sold, merged or out of business, it\u2019s harder to keep those, but I think we\u2019ve done a good job with that trending in the right direction. Shifting over to the quarterly anomaly that we are experiencing this year, I am going to turn that over to Craig. Craig Boelte : Yes. So Raimo, Wednesdays have historically been our largest processing day and we process about half a week\u2019s worth of revenue on a Wednesday, and that\u2019s for a Friday payday. So we do it 48 hours before payday. So anyone getting paid weekly or biweekly on that week, it impacts them. So what we saw is that first quarter, there is 12 as opposed to 13 and then we make that up in third quarter. So that $8 million really shifts from first quarter to third quarter. Chad Richison : And Raimo, I will add one thing to that. It\u2019s important to remember this. It\u2019s not new business revenue, this is current recurring revenue. This is from current clients. That means it\u2019s generated from current clients and we don\u2019t have to go out and sell clients to get it. Raimo Lenschow : Yes. It\u2019s just the way it flows basically, yes. Okay, makes sense. Okay, thank you. Congratulations. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Pinjalim Bora : Hey, guys. This is Pinjalim on behalf of Mark. Thank you for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. Quick question on if you \u2013 is there anyway to understand how bookings trended during the quarter? Was it within your expectations for Q4? Any color around maybe deals that closed above the 5,000 employee range and how do you feel about the pipeline going forward? Chad Richison : No, it was about three years ago we stopped giving specific deals. We never called out the names, but we would call out a 4,200 employee trucking company in the Northeast. So we kind of \u2013 we were kind of sharing too much information. So we did continue to have wins throughout fourth quarter as we did every quarter last year at the top end of our range and it was a strong quarter. I mean, to be able to finish the year, first have a strong quarter, but also be able to finish the year at a 30% growth rate, 43% adjusted EBITDA from where we started. When we started earlier in the year, I think our combined guide was at 66%, when you combined our revenue and our adjusted EBITDA guide. So to be able to finish at that level we were happy with that. So our leads continue to be strong. I will share this with. You our leads in the first quarter, just for the first month of January, already up 600%. And so we have continued to spend aggressively in marketing because we\u2019re having success with it. One other thing that I would provide is that we\u2019ve actually expanded our inside sales group, another two teams. And so there is four there now. As you guys may have remembered last quarter, I did talk about how we had 5 inside salespeople, we turned that into 2 teams last year that would be 2 teams of 8, so 16 salespeople and two managers. This year, the month of January, we had to add two more teams to clear the lead volume that\u2019s coming in, because it did increase. And so now, we actually have 32 salespeople inside sales and 4 teams and so it\u2019s not shifting our model and our focus. I mean we are driving it to 50 to 5,000 market. We continue to do that, but we are also continuing to have increased lead volume. And so we have remained focused on generating more leads this year as well. Pinjalim Bora : That\u2019s great. And the other question I had was on the guidance, Craig, is it possible to understand what is the assumption for interest rate cuts that might be baked into the 2020 guidance at this point in time? Craig Boelte : Yes. So if you remember, there were three interest rate cuts at the end of last year. In our guidance, we are holding interest rates fairly stable with a possible cut towards the end of 2020, but pretty flat for the full year. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Bhavin Shah : Hi, it\u2019s Bhavin on for Brad. Congrats on a great quarter and to the year. As you look into next year, it looks like your adjusted EBITDA margins are down slightly from 2019, how much of that is due to float revenue versus increased investments into the business and then where should we think about those investments and where they are going? Chad Richison : Yes. And so we guide to what we can see. Last year, I think we guided 40.5%ish, if you will in adjusted EBITDA. This year, we are guiding at 42%. We are continuing to spend. You guys probably watch some TV and definitely, if you are on digital, we are doing a lot there too. We have an opportunity right now we believe to pick up market share. Our marketing initiatives are bearing fruit if you will. And so we have continued them aggressively. And so I would say \u2013 and I will say this is that all of the advertising and marketing spend that we have planned this year is currently baked into that guide we delivered. And so which was very similar to last year\u2019s guide from a baking in the marketing spend, I mentioned the same thing last year as well. Bhavin Shah : That\u2019s helpful there. And then just a follow-up, can you just speak about the productivity that you have seen with your existing sales offices, is there anything specific that you would call out that is improving productivity here? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, the salespeople now will be able to \u2013 I would say toward the end of this year, usually, I would say, we have this many reps that continue to sell $1 million. I mean we have got reps up at $1 million. We have got some reps at $2 million. I won\u2019t have those final numbers. The sales years run or sales rep quota runs February through the end of January. So, they actually end on their largest month. And so we will have those commissions about February 15 and we will be able to talk more about that. But what I will say is I am able to see what different reps book. We do know that most all of our bookings, minus about 3% turns into revenue or turns into sales \u2013 or turns into yes, revenue, actually started business. And so we are seeing success there across the board with all of our sales reps. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Chad, on the inside sales efforts, can you remind us are those net new customers they are going after or is that up-sell into the installed base? Chad Richison : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. That\u2019s actually net new customers, new logos. So those reps do not up-sell to current clients. Brad Reback : And what are you doing on that front? Chad Richison : So we have a different group that does that, Brad and that\u2019s our CRR group and that group continues to go out, meet with clients and when it makes sense to be able to sell them additional products and that group also helps our products. That was one of the groups that really helped drive retention. I mean I should go ahead and call them out two years ago. They actually went back into the client base and made sure everybody was set up for good usage and they were actually working with the clients showing them the internal DDX score before we developed it. And so that group continues to work with clients as well as up-sell them when the opportunity arises. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a great year. Just wondering, Chad, can you talk a little bit about Manager on-the-Go like how \u2013 is there any additional revenue per client that you are anticipating and can you tell us a little bit more about what you are seeing in terms of your inside usage already over the last few months and how rapidly it\u2019s being adopted? Chad Richison : Sure. And so like DDX and Ask Here, Manager on-the-Go is actually included in the client\u2019s current pricing. It\u2019s a usage product. Work doesn\u2019t stop when you are away from your desk, whether you are walking around and you are building away from your desk or whether you are driving around or off location. And so Manager on-the-Go changes the way managers and decision-makers interact with our solutions. We actually believe it also broadens the number of users within our system, because there are several people that could be included in the time and attendance time card approval process or the time-off request process or the expense management approval process. They could be included, but for they do not have access to that type of technology where they are located, maybe they aren\u2019t, someone that works in an office. So we believe it will help broaden it. We believe it will increase the data flow. And we also believe that as people use Manager on-the-Go like our own employees who have been using it internally, it will become the way that they use the system for those specific task. It\u2019s important to note not everything we have is within Manager on-the-Go, it\u2019s task-oriented. There are some things that a client would still use desktop for specifically configuration and some other things. And so we have had it internally for two months. We actually, Mark, released it to our clients, Thursday night, this past Thursday night. And so I believe, we are going to have a lot of success with that, not unlike what we have seen with our employee app. Mark Marcon : That\u2019s great. And can you talk a little bit couple of financial questions. One, just on the cash flows, when we take a look at them in terms of the year-over-year growth and cash flow from operations, can you talk a little bit about some of the things that would hinder the growth, I imagine sales commissions were quite strong this last quarter? Craig Boelte : Yes, I mean \u2013 so, Mark, in terms of cash flows from operations, with 606, we do have some deferred costs in there. But \u2013 and the other things would just kind of be normal cash flow items. Obviously, taxes, you can have some variability from quarter-to-quarter on your tax payments. And when certain stock comp vest, you can get some benefits from that, which may lower your tax rate. So those were kind of some of the puts and takes on the cash flow. Operator : Our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Arvind Ramnani : Thanks for taking my question. Certainly, we have got a good understanding of DDX and other benefits, it\u2019s broad. But besides DDX, when you think of the other products and features you have rolled out over the last year or two, which of those has seen sort of the biggest impact on win rates and which has \u2013 which of the products have seen sort of highest client interest? Chad Richison : Yes. I will tell you, when it comes to DDX, it\u2019s hard for me to call it a product. It is almost a scorecard of our strategy or a health check. And so in order for someone to even see the DDX is valuable, they have had to buy off on the strategy, right? And so when we are talking about that, DDX, I think, helps people visualize and understand how they win with this strategy. I mean if you are a company that has just even an average DDX score, and let us say, of your changes last year, 350,000 were made directly by employees, and let us just say maybe only or the client made 150,000 changes. If you are able to take that into any other setting in retail, where you have 150,000 people going to a counter and 350,000 people going direct, and you\u2019re able to move those other 150,000 to direct versus the counter, for an overall business, there is quite a bit of not only cost savings, but as well as efficiency. And so what the DDX does is, it helps us drive that strategy home and becomes a proved source of what success looks like in that. I will say that I think learning management became a lot stronger product last year. When you think about we are replacing mundane data input tasks with a task that help drive further value for a business, learning has to be at the top of that list. And the fact that we\u2019ve added a product to the learning management system, which allows employees to actually demonstrate proficiency in what they just learned as well as many other features and enhancements that we\u2019ve made to the system, we believe that, that\u2019s moving in the right direction as well. Arvind Ramnani : Great. And one feature, if you could comment on, is essentially, on-demand pay, is that a focus area for you or is that something clients bring up? Chad Richison : Well, on occasion, I mean, I will say this, our software has the functionality to calculate net pay today. And we do not stop our clients from using third-party options. But we do want to make sure we have our bases covered. I mean we\u2019re an HCM vendor. It is important that we help keep our clients compliant. There are daily pay rules per state and there is deposit filing requirements and rules per state as well as the Fed. And so we do continue to engage with the IRS looking for a letter ruling on this specific thing of how companies can \u2013 should actually be handling it and not get in trouble from the tax. But I just want to say, I do not see on-demand pay or daily pay or whatever it wants to be called, I don\u2019t really see this as a technological differentiator for anyone in our industry. I think all systems can pretty much provide it. It is just a question of choice, not so much capability. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Schwartz : Yes hi, thanks for taking my question today. Chad, maybe just looking out a little bit longer, I was just wondering if you feel like a 25% recurring revenue growth rate is something the business could sustain here as we kind of look out over the next few years. It looks like you\u2019re guiding that for - with Q1 when you kind of normalize the impact of the bank holiday. And when I think about it, you gave us lot of stats, but during the Q&A, you mentioned how the lead flow has really accelerated here and you are continuing with the advertising spend throughout the year. So I am just wondering if \u2013 in terms of your pipeline, if you\u2019re actually seeing an acceleration in the pipeline as some of these initiatives are starting to bear out fruit for you? Chad Richison : Yes, certainly. I mean if your leads go up 600%, it is going to impact your pipeline for sure and that would be the case here at Paycom. We do continue to spend on the advertising, provided that it works. I mean I will tell you this, I would have a problem spending money. You cannot waste money in advertising. You cannot waste money in marketing. And so that\u2019s something we track week-by-week, leads came in that converted to appointments, that convert to deals and those are percentages that we track. And \u2013 but the tip of that spear is the leads actually coming in and they are good leads. And so we do continue to look to increase lead volume. Brian Schwartz : Thank you. And then the follow-up question that I had, Chad was I noticed in your introductory comments, you talked about looking back in 2019 could be, I cannot remember your language, but something significant year in terms of improving the positioning for the business in the industry. And I was just wondering with that comment, were you referring to all the new technology, product-related announcements that you had or maybe the self-service messaging is resonating fast or is anything happening out there with the competition or anything else in the industry that gave you the conviction here to make that comment about the improved positioning of the business? Thanks. Chad Richison : Sure. Well, I call 2019 our best year because all metrics were up. I mean we have had years where we have had good growth. We have had years where we have had good adjusted EBITDA. But when you are looking at what we are doing now, we are growing on a higher number. Retention is going up, which is actually harder on a higher number when it is revenue retention, when you\u2019re not getting 40% growth that we had three, four years ago. And so retention is going up. Our own employee retention is going up. It is continued to march up. That\u2019s been good. Our clients are happier. Our clients are starting out the gate with higher usage scores. We have cleaner conversions because of that. We have more motivated clients to convert. Our lead volumes up. We are getting momentum. And so all that\u2019s to say is, as I look back on 2019 and we shifted our entire strategy over the last three years. I mean we introduced an app, and then wanted people to actually use it, which changed the way people use this technology. It changed the way we service the technology, changed the way we sell the technology. And so we went through all of that with what I would say was without a blip. And if you look at 2019, it is kind of how everything came together, if you will. And as I looked at the metrics across-the-board at Paycom, all of them were good. And so that\u2019s why I called out 2019 is the best year we have had. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Simmons with RBC. Please go ahead. Robert Simmons : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So you touched on this a little bit, but can you go into what were the actual drivers of the net retention improving? Not necessarily the numbers, of course, but was it both gross churn improving and better up-sell? Or was there anything else going on there? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, I would say, you always have the same components of retention, which would include your trailing 12 revenue, which would include business you bring on, it would include up-sells, it would include all the rest of it. However, it has been very stagnant, if you will, at 91%, then it jumped at 92% and jumped at 93%. So what was different? What is different is the amount of usage we have in these systems. If you look back \u2013 listen back to past quarters, you would hear me say things like it costs the client the same whether they get all the value out of it or just a little bit of value out of it, and we are driving clients to get all the value out of it. I believe as clients have gained more value and some all of the value, they are less likely to look and they\u2019re less likely to be sold away from Paycom, as they continue to get that value here. As well as, we continue to create more value for them included in their current fee with many of the products that I\u2019ve mentioned just last year with Ask Here, enhanced learning as well as now Manager on-the-Go. Robert Simmons : Got it. And then given the more efficient support you are able to provide people now, given they are \u2013 getting better usage, do you see upside to your gross margin, either this year or potentially in the long run? Craig Boelte : Yes. I mean, we actually saw gross margin move up this year. So we are extremely happy about that. And as Chad mentioned, the more the clients use it, the easier it is to service the clients. So we did see the gross margin tick up this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Jester with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester : Yes thanks for taking my question. Just maybe kind of a big thematic one, I know you are not going to give me sort of a product road map over the coming year. But I think thematically, if you think about where you are investing R&D dollars, are there any kind of themes that strike that you can kind of help us think about how you are looking at the business for 2020? I know in the past, you have talked about worker productivity? Is it big theme? Is that still the idea or is \u2013 any shifts from now? Chad Richison : Yes, I want to make sure I understood the question, it sounds like you are asking about the product road map and what our focus are for this year. Well, we do not describe the very specific products that we are coming out with. I will say this, Paycom looks to develop products that drive not just usage, but value to the employer that is measurable. We continue to identify opportunities for that, which fit within the HCM realm, if you will. Manager on-the-Go is one way to get to some of that. I think, as we move forward into this year and especially as we look back and measure what happened, I mean, I believe, to some extent, everybody that uses our system that is in the approval process flow, if you will, will be using Manager on-the-Go. And so I don\u2019t think mobile usage is going to retreat anytime soon in our industry. And honestly, I think it is becoming more prevalent as your younger generation move into management roles. Daniel Jester : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Ryan MacDonald : Yes thanks for taking my question. Chad, you mentioned that you expanded inside sales groups to two additional teams so far this year. How should we think about the additional rollout of teams moving forward? Is this something that we would expect in terms of the pace of launches to be similar to what you did over the past few years with new office openings? Chad Richison : We continue to be focused on new office openings. I am not going to call inside sales teams new office openings. They are inside sales teams. But they are doing extremely well. So we are going to continue to open up offices when it makes sense to us, which would include identifying opportunities throughout this year. Ryan MacDonald : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up, you mentioned that the CRR group is obviously responsible for up-sells. Can you talk about the growth of that team and what it has been like in, say, over the past year and perhaps thoughts on how that team is expected to grow in 2020 as well? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes. We have not given any specifics out on the size of that team or exactly how much it grows. But I can say it keeps up with about the growth percentage of revenue. You have \u2013 those CRRs are going to be responsible for clients, a certain amount of clients that they will carry. So obviously, as your client count goes up, revenue goes up, you are going to have some of that. Now what I will say, they\u2019re more focused on the client versus the size of the revenue of the client. And so they have certain duties that they do on a weekly basis that keeps them focused on a set number of clients. And so there is a correlation between number of clients we have and CRRs. Craig Boelte : And kind of a housekeeping item, I wanted to mention as well, just our client count at the end of the year. Our client count at the end of the year was 26,527 and on a parent company group, it would be 13,581, and we also stored data for over 4.9 million employees of our clients last year. Operator : Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Michael Berg : This is Michael on for Siti. I just wanted to ask on the sales efficiency piece of the equation. How could we think about, I guess, saturation in some of your markets? And obviously, you\u2019ve been in some offices more than others. But is that a concern at some point or would that lead to more sales office openings down \u2013 in the future? How can we think about that dynamic? Chad Richison : Well, I hope it becomes a concern at some point. I would not say we are at that now. I mean you can take any city, even the smallest ones we are in that we have been in there for the longest period of time. And our calculation of our TAM is still there, a very small percent of the overall TAM that exists. And so we continue to have opportunities everywhere. And I don\u2019t see us running out of those opportunities at any given time. As you guys can see, there\u2019s all types of competition out there. And everybody and their dog wants to get into the next one. And so there is a lot of prospects out there. And we have a lot of opportunities. So no, we\u2019re not running into any saturation. Michael Berg : And then a quick follow-up on that, is there any change in the competitive landscape? Obviously, you guys are seeing a nice uptick in your pipeline. Has your win rates changed dramatically in one direction or the other? Chad Richison : We don\u2019t discuss win rates, except to say, they have been very healthy. And we did not wake up this year retreating back from where we - the success we had last year. So we are the same company. We\u2019re in a stronger position this year coming out of last year from products, staffing and everything else. And so we are going to focus on what we have to do this year to end on a good note. Operator : [Operator Instructions] At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chad Richison for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : Alright. Well, I would like to thank, everyone, for joining us on the call today. And I would like to send a special thank you out to all the Paycom employees for a great 2019 and a strong start to 2020. Over the next couple of months, we will be on the road meeting with investors. Craig and James will be hosting investor meetings in San Francisco at the Morgan Stanley Conference, on March 3 and at the KeyBanc Conference on March 4. We appreciate your continued interest in Paycom and look forward to meeting with many of you soon. Thank you, operator. You may disconnect. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James and thank you to everyone joining our call today. First, my thoughts go out to those whose health has been impacted by the pandemic. We also sympathize with businesses who are faced with unavoidable reductions in their workforces and the employees who have lost their jobs. Additionally, I'd also like to extend my sincere thanks to first responders, medical personnel and those involved in the supply chain who are on the front line. Finally, I want to thank our employees who continue to execute while working from home and also our phase four team who remain working at the office. For today's call, I'll spend a few minutes on our first quarter 2020 results and some notable achievements. Following that Craig will review our financials and provide some perspective on financial trends and then we will take questions. I am particularly pleased with our performance in the first quarter. First quarter results were strong driven by our high margin recurring revenue business model and continued strength of new business adds. Q1 revenue of $242.4 million came in above the high end of our guidance range in spite of the effects of unexpected interest rate cuts and an unemployment spike in March. Adjusted EBITDA of $117.9 million in Q1 was also above our guidance range as a result of record gross margins. We entered the year with strong momentum following record revenue retention in 2019 and a value proposition that is stronger than ever. Even though the month of March was impacted by declining revenues from our current client base due to the effects of COVID-19, we continue to see strong addition of new clients. We are also experiencing elevated lead volumes compared to the same period last year, which we are driving through our marketing efforts and the strength of our value proposition. The pandemic is exposing seams created by the disparate systems and that is creating a higher demand for the Paycom single database solution. I am pleased with the incredible results and collaboration I am seeing across the sales and marketing organization. The appropriate usage of human capital management solutions has never been more important than today and we will continue to invest and innovate to strengthen our position. More employees and managers are accessing the system and HR and employees are doing less paperwork and manual input than ever before. We continue to see strong usage patterns of our products as measured by our Direct Data Exchange or DDX with usage scores well above Q4 levels. DDX numbers continue to be strong and improve as companies adopt a full employee usage strategy. When employees have a direct relationship with the database, the employee wins, the company wins from real savings estimated at $4.51 per HR task or data entry point as well as higher efficiency and overall employee satisfaction. In February, we launched Manager on-the-Go, a tool built into Paycom's existing mobile app which empowers leaders with 24/7 accessibility to essential manager side functionality of our solution. I said at the time that I believe this was the single most important product release we had since the launch of our employee self-service app. And while we are still early, it's proving to be very popular. Within the first 12 weeks since its launch, Manager on-the-Go has significantly exceeded the employee self-service product adoption over the 12-week comparable post-launch period. This easy-to-use functionality distributes approval responsibilities more broadly and removes impediments to quick data flow and managers across our client base are embracing it. Once managers use Manager on-the-Go, the vast majority of them fundamentally change the way they interact with our solutions and actions previously completed on the desktop are now completed on the mobile app. I'm very pleased with the trends we are seeing. While many of our clients are unfortunately experiencing significant fluctuation in their employment trends due to COVID-19, we remain focused on three controllable activities, providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. I am more confident than ever in our products' value proposition and go-to-market strategy. I've been saying for some time, we may be early with our strategy, but we're not wrong. And today, we're no longer early. The digital transformation for business is accelerating. I'd like to thank all of our employees for their grit and the winning spirit they display every day in this changing environment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our first quarter 2020 results, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. These are unprecedented times and while we are withdrawing our full year guidance, we plan to get back to providing annual and quarterly guidance as soon as unemployment trends become more predictable. I'll briefly cover our Q1 results and where possible I'll provide some high-level comments about our financial outlook. Our approach is to be as transparent as possible based on what we know now. As Chad mentioned, we are very pleased with our first quarter results, especially given the unexpected interest rate cuts and spiking unemployment from the pandemic. In the first quarter, we generated total revenues of $242.4 million, representing growth of roughly 21% over the comparable prior year period, which was above our guidance range, driven by strong new business wins and robust recurring revenues. As a reminder, in Q1 2020, there were only 12 banking Wednesdays instead of the usual 13 we had the comparable prior year period. As we discussed last quarter, a Wednesday represents roughly half a week's revenues. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $238.5 million for the first quarter of 2020, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and also growing 21% from the comparable prior year period. During the month of March, we started to see the spiking unemployment across the country, reflected in our client base, a trend that continued into April. The net effect as of today is that the impact on our current client revenue is similar to the percentage increase in unemployment across the country. We are closely monitoring unemployment trends and their impact on our client base. We're also experiencing the impact of 150 basis point interest rate cuts that occurred in March. We estimate the net effect on our business for the rate cuts is roughly $4.5 million per quarter for the balance of the year. Total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $213.5 million, representing a record adjusted gross margin of 88.1%, up 130 basis points compared to the prior year period. We continue to benefit from high-margin recurring revenue and increasing customer service efficiency. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $108.4 million for the first quarter as compared to $80 million in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2020 was $51.9 million or 21.4% of revenues. We are seeing positive results from our recent ad campaigns and marketing efforts and plan to continue to invest in marketing in Q2 and throughout the year. We believe this is not the time to back off from our marketing plan. In fact, due to the increase in demand we're seeing -- and the success we are having, we plan to spend more in Q2 than we did in Q1. Adjusted R&D expense was $19.4 million in the first quarter of 2020 or 8% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs including the capitalized portion were $27.6 million in the first of 2020 compared to $21.1 million in the prior year period. We plan to continue to invest in our future growth through innovation and new product development. Adjusted EBITDA was $117.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 or 48.7% of total revenues compared to $103.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 or 51.7% of total revenues. Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was $63 million or $1.08 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $47.3 million or $0.81 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 28.7%. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $77.9 million or $1.33 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $69.3 million or $1.19 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 58 million shares in the second quarter of 2020. Since we increased our buyback on March 12, 2020, we have repurchased over 260,000 shares. Today Paycom has repurchased nearly 4 million shares since 2016. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $182 million and total debt of $32 million. As a reminder, this debt represents a financing of construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $82 million for the first quarter reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020. To conclude, I'll repeat what Chad said. We are focused on mitigating the impact of the pandemic on our current client revenue numbers by providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. We have a strong balance sheet, a highly profitable recurring business model and the strongest value proposition in our industry. We are confident that 2020 can still deliver the enviable combination of growth and margins that we have consistently demonstrated and we look forward to being able to quantify that combination for you as soon as macroeconomic factors become more stabilized or predictable. With that we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer. We will have one question and one follow-up from each person. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question and I hope everyone at Paycom has been safe and then wish all the best to everyone. First question from me. Chad, you guys have been in kind of a crisis mode in 2008, 2009. Can you just kind of compare and contrast what you saw back then, how it compares to now and then like -- and what lessons you learned back then? And then I have a follow-up. Chad Richison : Sure. So in 2008 and 2009, obviously we were a lot smaller company. We were somewhat geo-focused in a certain area. I would say we were more in the Midwest and Southwest at that time. From that period of time you had the mortgage crisis going on and other factors. And really at that time, it became a cash flow management issue for us. And at that point in time, we changed the way we managed our cash for clients because you had greater ACH risk at that time. So we made changes to protect cash flow at that time and exposure for ACH risk. But actually the three things we're focusing on right now are the three things we focused on back at that time. We continue to focus on providing world-class service to our clients, we continue to innovate through the rapid development of our software and we also were aggressive in adding new clients. And so those are the same lessons or the same activities that we're focused on right now, but it's a little different 2009 and '08 from today. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. And then the follow-up. Thank you for that. The next question I had was on -- we had now like a good month of kind of working from home etcetera. And you guys have been in terms of your sales approach very local. And I saw in the statement that you gave out maybe -- I think -- productivity by kind of doing it over video calls et cetera. Can you see what you're seeing in the field at the moment in terms of willingness to engage, ability to engage from your sales force etcetera? We're one month in. So hopefully you're getting some data points already. Chad Richison : Yes. And so, we've sold face-to-face for a long time until we added the inside sales group. Again we had about 5 of them for about 10, 15 years and then we built out 4 teams over the last 6 months in inside sales. So we've had a little bit of experience with selling virtually. I will say, we came into this year with strong sales momentum. We had a very strong value proposition that continue to resonate. Then we ran into the pandemic. And so on Sunday March 15, we actually closed all sales offices and moved them to the virtual work-from-home model. During the weeks of March 16 and the week beginning March 23 we rescheduled all of those sales appointments and really focused on retraining our outside sales organization on a somewhat new model. During those two weeks our booked sales business dropped about 50% for those two weeks. During the subsequent week which would have been the week I believe began March 30, our booked sales was back up to 80% of what we had been selling previously. And then the rest of April, we're actually at the same level of booked sales numbers we were pre-COVID. So from a sales bookings perspective, we continue to sell business through this. I can tell you that it used to be a sales manager could go on six calls a week. Now they can go on six in two days. And so reps are still highly engaged with individuals as they also work from home. Some of them are actually our clients -- our prospective clients I should say actually may go into the office and then use a type of virtually -- virtual technology to actually engage with us. But there is still people out there buying and it's a good time to buy. I will tell you that the digital transformation has accelerated through this. I think our value proposition is stronger today not less so. And so, we're having some success with sales. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, good luck. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Go ahead. Samad Samana : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and I would I like to echo -- I hope everybody is staying safe and doing well in this type of environment. So I guess my first question Craig, just for clarity you said that the change in Paycom's customer base has been consistent with unemployment kind of more broadly. Can you just clarify? So does that mean that you've seen -- I guess what's the change in pace for control that you've seen from pre-crisis to as it stands one month into April? Chad Richison : Samad I can take that as well and Craig can also chime in. The point is it would be unreasonable to think that Paycom would not follow the increase in the rate of unemployment. I would say that we're an accurate sampling size of the U.S. market as it relates to payrolls. We are industry-agnostic. So we're diversified across all industries. Oftentimes, when it comes to unemployment, we are going to see the impact before the unemployment number actually comes out. There are many states California, Massachusetts, Illinois other states where you're having to pay that last check either same day or next day from your pay date. And so oftentimes someone's going to receive their last check prior to filing unemployment and then actually being in -- within the number. And so it would be unreasonable to think that we wouldn't follow that. I will say this. Unemployment, if you look at it for the last 12 trailing months, it's been fairly consistent. It's kind of run between 3.5% to 3.8% and that's based on anywhere from 163 million to 165 million available Americans out there in the workforce. So you calculate that. We saw that jump in March; specifically the last couple of weeks of March is really where you started to see that jump. And it jumped to 4.4% or 7.1 million unemployed. Since that time for April, you're looking at -- since March 15th, I think we've had 26 million unemployment claims filed. It looks like about 24 million of those could hit in April we would expect. And so that -- you do that division over the 163 available workforce, you're going to come up with a different unemployment number than the 3.5-ish that it had been or the 4.4% that it was in March. And so all we're saying that right now is we have had visibility into our numbers. There are some changes that's happening with unemployment. We don't know if these will necessarily accelerate through second quarter. We don't know if they'll stabilize. And so I think it's just too early to tell. But unemployment does have an impact on our current client revenue. The mitigating factors that we have are continuing to add new clients onto our platform. We are seeing people engaging right now as well as any upsells we might do to current clients but I would say that those have always been dwarfed by new logo adds. Craig Boelte : Yes. And I would echo what Chad said. Even though we do have some clients who are in those industries hardest hit like restaurants and hotels, we're not overexposed to any of those industries and are very industry-agnostic. Samad Samana : Great. Thank you for that thorough answer. I really appreciate. And then maybe just one follow-up. There's been a lot of investors who've asked us a question about what percentage of a contract is typically fixed versus what is the variable component that's based on head count or payrolls processed. So, any directional percentage you can give us. Is it 10%? Is it 50%? It would be helpful just in framing as we're doing the math. Chad Richison : Sure. Well, I'm going to just go ahead and give this information out. I haven't given it out before but I'm going to talk about our billing. We have a base fee and that base fee is for one employee. And so if you have one employee with Paycom and you're using the Paycom system we're going to have the base fee, all right? Now, if you add multiple employees you might have multiple states, you may have a few more base fees. But ultimately on smaller clients the base fee can be a measurable percent of a client's bill. But as that client gets larger that base fee gets substantially distributed into the employee loss -- and the employee loss percentage becomes very close to equal to the loss of revenue percent on that client. So, it really just has to do with size of client before you could really figure out exactly how much of the base fee is in there. Now, I will say this. We're not necessarily seeing increased client attrition when we're talking about units whether it be someone leaving. We're not seeing increased client attrition from either someone leaving and/or going out of business. The impact we're really seeing is the impact as it relates to employee count. The clients that we're working with might go from running 200 checks normally with us, the ones that are impacted, but again, not all are and some have even some growth in this, but for the most part, we do have several clients that may have been running 300 checks and now they're running 17. And so we're going to still have the client. But again we're going to be impacted by that unemployment number Samad Samana : I really appreciate the openness and wish you guys well and I'll pass along to the next person. Thanks again. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Go ahead. Mark Murphy : Yes, thank you very much. Actually good timing, I wanted to follow up on Samad's question Chad. Just to clarify the math on the unemployment. So we've seen 26 million unemployment claims out of a workforce of about 164 million. So you get about 16%. I guess, I'm just curious if the employees are furloughed and they're -- and they've applied for unemployment, wouldn't they still be a payee in the Paycom system right and then -- so then you'd still be getting paid for the furloughed employees? Or is that not accurate? Chad Richison : That would not be accurate. I mean, depending on how you're using the term furloughed typically a furloughed employee is an employee that still has their job but is not paid. Paycom's model is really based on number of paid employees as it goes through. Now those employees would remain active in our system. They would continue to use our employee app. And when they come off furlough, we'll begin to receive the billing from them but -- and as far as furloughed employees and how they may be also included in that unemployment number, we would want to check on that. But in regards to our system, furloughed, terminated, laid off those should all have a very similar impact in our number, although you're going to have different termination codes because those have different rehiring activities that someone's going to take as they turn them back into active pays. Mark Murphy : Okay, understood. And then as a follow-up, I'm just curious if you've been able to survey your customer base at all to try to ascertain where they think their head count might trough at perhaps when it would bottom, the pace of rehiring. At what level perhaps they think it would stabilize to try to inform your business plan? I'll give you -- for instance, if a customer had 300 employees, they think it's going to drop to 200 in May. Maybe then they think it would ramp back up to 270. You could at least try to recalibrate and then plan on a 10% reduction in their headcount. Have you been able to do anything like that somewhat scientifically or even to have enough anecdotes to create some type of a guess on how that will look? Chad Richison : Well, I think that there's many things that we'll be able to do once we see a trend and/or some stabilization, which makes something predictable. For many of our clients, they have the same unknown factors that we do if you think about it. So it might just be timing. We might be a little early on being able to get good information that way. But we definitely are staying close to our clients. I mean we talk to them on a continual basis and we've been able to kind of see in different areas and different industries potentially impacts, but it's really all over the board. And we still remain hopeful that at some point it stabilizes. We just don't know where it stabilizes at. There's a company that made a decision in March to go into a certain phase for themselves. Do they take additional steps throughout the year, or is March a steady state for them because they took the hit upfront? We don't really know that yet. And as this quarter goes on I think we'll have more information on that. Craig Boelte : Yes, Mark and one thing too with the payroll protection program like the example you gave, those people have applied for some assistance. And under the rules if they use 75% of that to rehire then you can have a loan forgiveness on that but -- so we may see some of that as well. Mark Murphy : Okay. And then Craig one very final question, is there any change with respect to customers or prospects asking for price discounts or payment deferrals in this, kind of, environment? Chad Richison : Our pricing model is very fair. It's actually the thing that's impacting us right now. Our pricing model is based off the number of employees that you're paying within the system substantially. And so obviously I'm going to take that company. I said that maybe 300 employees before and now there are 17 employees. Well, when they were 300 employees, they're paying us for 300 employees. Now that they're 17, they're paying us for 17. So that's a fair model and I wouldn't see any reason that we would make changes to our pricing model at this point. Mark Murphy : Okay, very good. Thank you so much. Chad Richison : You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Brad Reback from Stifel. Go ahead. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Chad on the new business activity, can you give us a sense of your ability to implement remotely? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean to be able to implement is very similar to the way we were doing, a lot of our implementations. I'm not going to say it's necessarily done. You definitely have the conversation with the transition rep with that client. You go through training that way. But substantially most all of our implementation has been done through either the Oklahoma City and/or Dallas area. And so a lot of it was really done remotely anyway with the exception of the training and the data collection. As a reminder, also we've had an inside sales group for quite some time. So, no we're not seeing it being more difficult -- becoming more difficult for us to implement. In fact, our measurement through the first quarters and implementations are going faster than what they traditionally had. And honestly, so is the sales process somewhat. I can tell you that before we have a -- we've set an appointment on a Tuesday and we might have that call in two or three weeks. Now we're setting that appointment on a Tuesday, we could be having that appointment on Wednesday. And we're getting most people at the table. And so, I wouldn't say it's -- it definitely hasn't slowed us down from being able to convert. You will have clients that -- due to the current situation that they may be in, you could have clients that choose to wait a little bit longer, but I don't even have anything to really call out in regards to that right now. But anyway, that's where I would leave that. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks. And one quick follow-up. Have you seen a moderation in the rate of decline in the number of people that you're paying -- your customers are paying on a weekly basis over the last we'll call it three or four weeks? Chad Richison : Well I'll go back to what I said. It would be unreasonable to think that we wouldn't continue to follow increases in the unemployment rate. And so, you would be hoping that that would moderate to some level of stabilization at some point. Brad Reback : Got it. Thank you. Chad Richison : You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Marcon from Baird. Go ahead. Mark Marcon : Hey, good afternoon, Chad and Craig. Thanks for taking my question and best wishes for safety during this times. I'm wondering, can you talk a little bit, just a follow-on on the impact of the unemployment. If you have a 1% decline in terms of the number of employees paid, what does that translate to from a revenue perspective? How should we think about just the sensitivity there? I know it varies across the different client sizes. But if we're taking a look at the portfolio as a whole, how should we think about that? Chad Richison : I mean larger clients, you're going to be close to a 1 :1 ratio in larger clients. Smaller clients, it's going to be a lot less, I mean from that, meaning that, it really does depend on size of clients. But a larger client, yes, you're definitely closer to the 1 :1, because the base fee has been eaten up by that one-employee company. Now if you're talking about a 30- or 40-employee company, I mean, you're going to have quite a bit of base still in there. But once you're going up to 200, 300, 500, 2,000, 3,000, I mean the ratio is going to be closer to 1% loss in their employment equals close to 1% loss in current client revenue. Mark Marcon : Okay. And then with regards to the new sales that sounds tremendous. Can you talk a little bit about like who you're winning from? Is there any -- has there been any change with regards to that? Is there some special attraction in terms of the mobile self-service capabilities that would lead you to get more clients from older providers? Or has the mix changed in any way shape or form? Chad Richison : It's an interesting question. I will say that it's usual suspects for us. We're hitting them the usual ways. We do have a much stronger product now. I talked about the employee mobile app as well as the DDX success we're having. Many people are using our Ask Here as we've gone through this environment. By rolling out Manager on-the-Go, I mean our adoption rate on Manager on-the-Go for the first 12 weeks was almost double, what our adoption rate was for the employee app for the same launch period. And so we're having high levels of engagement. And so I would not say that any of our competitors have the level of engagement we have. And so we do continue to onboard people from the usual suspects. You do have some systems out there that were more in-house in nature or even some competitors that may have been more regional using licensed software. And those models are very much disrupted right now in this environment. So to the extent, we have the low-hanging fruit it's going to be more in that area. But we're also having just a lot of success, because we have a lot of clients, who even call us back. We pitched them one or two years ago. It was what it was. They understand the value proposition weren't ready to make the move. Right now, I think people are forced to look for additional efficiencies. I think most all companies come out of this leaner and more efficient and we're going to do our part just to make sure that's what happens on the efficiency side. Mark Marcon : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Daniel Jester from Citi. Go ahead. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I appreciate your comments about most of the impact you're seeing so far is in the reduction of employees at your clients' account. But I suspect that as this situation extends there is the risk of higher churn just from macroeconomic volatility. So I'm just wondering, you've done a great job over the years improving retention, is there anything specific you're putting in place to help improve or keep retention up even in these uncertain times? Chad Richison : I mean, really for retention, if you're talking about the actual loss of a client that might go out of business other than helping them find resources that might help them stay in business, there's not a whole lot of impact we can make there. Now, what I will say is even at IPO, we announced that 90% of our revenue is derived from companies that have greater than 50 employees. And so today, that's only going to be greater than that as far as a percent of revenue. My bet is it's -- well, it's much higher than 90% at this point and so for us, what we're seeing is more a decrease not a go away. Now, some of that may be answered in how long are we in this. Do things improve when they improve? What -- how long can someone last? But as we sit here today, we can't really call out a business failure today. We can call out business failures -- I should say, we can't call out business failures. We can call out impact to -- that unemployment is having on those business revenue on those client revenues. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you. And then you mentioned this briefly in your prepared remarks about DDX and improvement in engagement there. I'm just wondering based on what you've seen is the usage of DDX consistent across your customers whether they're in -- either managing these times well or not? I just wonder in times of crisis, do people go back to the old ways and move away from automation? Or does the automation stick through even in times of turbulence? Thank you. Chad Richison : That's actually a really good question. We have not seen DDX score -- the DDX scores have continued to go up. I can tell you this, just in a couple of anecdotes. It's actually been where -- we'll have clients that you'll see in certain areas. It forces their DDX to go up. If they were just kind of adopting, let's say you had a DDX score of 96% and you are sort of adopting to some level it forced people to have 100% adoption. I'm not saying that, we've made it to 100% adoption, but this -- the environment that we're going through right now has not -- had a negative impact on the DDX scores. Now DDX is a measurement of employee usage and actually a measurement of using the system the correct way. And so I would just answer that by saying more and more people are using the system the correct way today than what they had in the past. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer. Go ahead. Brian Schwartz : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Chad, I was just wondering, if you could provide some additional color on either what you're seeing in terms of the sales or the elevated lead activity by company size. If there's any reason for us to think that the sales activity by company size should be materially different for the business ahead. Thanks. Chad Richison : No. So, I'm not announcing anything different on what we're doing from a size perspective. We continue to sell both in and above our range. I had also called out that -- I think it was last earnings call, I called out that we have four inside sales teams that continue to sell to small business market. So I would say that's been very consistent for us. Yes, we continue to see clients come in at the top end of our range or even above, but we've always seen that. And so, it's been very consistent and that would be also consistent with the leads that we see. Brian Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Zukin from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and glad to hear you're staying safe our there. Maybe just the first one. Chad, can you remind us on kind of the linearity of bookings on a quarter usually? And then, maybe, traditionally or typically, from an intra-quarter perspective, like, how much visibility do you typically have one quarter out on the business? Chad Richison : Yes. So, first of all, on the bookings, I would say that, month to month they'll kind of change. I mean, typically -- well, I'll say this. Typically summer is our great month. I can tell you two years ago, August was our largest booked sales month. So it just depends. They're all over. It ebbs and flows, right? You fill up your pipeline, then you close pipeline. It is most common that the end of the year for our industry would be where your largest booking numbers would come, just because admittedly most all companies in our space would tell you, January is a large start month for prospective clients for us. And so, you do expect sales to be higher. As a matter of fact, some people in our industry even call it selling season. They'll say we're gearing up for selling season, which is kind of the September through December time frame. I can tell you with, Paycom, we're open for sales on a continual basis and it's hard for us to really point to significant booked sales in one area versus the other. It really has to do with how fast we're clearing out that pipeline, which leads to your visibility question. If we have somebody within our pipeline in a 90-day close, the likelihood of them closing, being that they've been in our pipeline for 90 days, is much smaller. It's our goal to continue to get deals that we engaged with today, to be able to move forward throughout the sales process and to get them closed up in the six to eight-week period. So when it comes to visibility, as it relates to booked sales, sure we have some. Do we have three to six-month visibility? I wouldn't trust a six-month pipeline for myself, because those are businesses that we should be able to get them going on the solution, so that they can start receiving the ROI sooner rather than later. Alex Zukin : Got it. And then, just maybe as a follow-up. I think, probably some of us are pretty surprised to hear that new bookings have kind of returned to pre-COVID levels in April and you're not seeing any customer, any meaningful changes in customer churn. Do you anticipate that being -- like, when you think about the balance of this year, is that something you're anticipating to continue? Do you anticipate those levels to kind of trend off? And, if so, how much do you anticipate to kind of sell into the base to insulate a little bit from that? Chad Richison : Well, I think, there's a difference between hope and anticipation. I mean, if I -- I think, if we were able to really quantify a lot of those and have a high level of confidence in that -- of the trend we have today continuing, we would be able to -- be providing more information than what we're doing right now. I will say that even our appointment numbers through April are similar as they were pre-COVID. And so, the interest hadn't slowed down and our ability to have those meetings hasn't slowed down. As far as your answer on clients, maybe, losing their business, I would say, which we hope doesn't happen. I mean, that's really something I'm not going to have great visibility. And, I mean, I can see when a client might drop again to use the same example from 300 to 17 employees, I don't know what happens to that client after that, if we're in a certain environment for too long. That's really going to depend on -- it's almost a per client basis what decisions they're making about their business. So it's just hard to -- it's hard to judge that right now. I don't think it's going to be forever that we're unable to judge that. And I'm talking about -- I do think there's going to come a point in time where we'll have better information on that, but it's hard to tell right now. Alex Zukin : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ryan MacDonald from Needham & Company. Go head. Ryan MacDonald : Hi. Chad and Craig. Thanks for taking my question. Chad, you mentioned before that there's a bit of a difference, I think in the code that's entered whether a customer furloughs an employee versus lays off an employee. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of mix with your clients or to the extent that you have seen thus far of layoffs versus furloughing at this point? Chad Richison : No. I will just go back to what I said. The impact on us would be the same from a revenue perspective. I don't know -- you're really going through and asking okay, do clients even understand the difference between them, between furlough, between a laid off employee or between an employee that you might be using something different through some type of termination method or an onboarding method you're going to go back to later. So, no, I mean, I wouldn't be able to give you exact numbers on those who have been furloughed versus terminated and/or laid off. All that's to say, though, if someone has put in a termination code for any one of those within the system or left them furloughed and active, but they're not receiving payment, it's going to impact our revenue the same regardless of which one of those they choose. Ryan MacDonald : Got it. And then just a follow-up. I wanted to touch on gross margins in the quarter. I think over the past few years here, first quarter gross margins have been running in that 86% to 87% range. You had a really strong performance there at 88%. What drove that nice increase that we saw on a year-over-year basis during the quarter? Is it the expanded usage from some of these self-service products or perhaps something else? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, well, you're definitely having -- and I'll let Craig chime in a little bit on this, but you're definitely having efficiencies gained from usage of the product. I mean, we talked about before that our call volume even the calls coming into Paycom has been equal to or less than prior year same quarter, right? And so even the call volumes that are coming into Paycom, we're receiving less calls because clients are using the product correctly. They understand it and now their employees are using it correctly. And so we're having a lot more success. And also we're onboarding clients with full usage strategies and we've been doing that for over a year. And so we don't have to do a lot of fixing if you will, getting all the clients to the right strategy. So you definitely have some of that, and I'm sure there's some other efficiencies gains Craig will talk about. Craig Boelte : Yes. I mean, obviously, our service department -- as the clients are able to use a system and are using the system correctly, our service department is able to handle a larger volume as well. So we've seen that and we've talked about that in the past as well. Chad Richison : To give you one more thing on that Ryan, the number of service individuals that we had servicing clients in -- at the end of December 2020 was the same as the number of service individuals we had servicing clients December 2019. Craig Boelte : Yes. I think Chad in 2019 and 2018. Chad Richison : Sorry, 2019 and 2018. Craig Boelte : 2019 and 2018. Chad Richison : Not 2020. The number of service individuals we had servicing clients at the end of 2019 was basically the same as we had at the end of 2018. So you're going to get some efficiencies when you have service individuals that are able to service more clients because the client is using the system better. Ryan MacDonald : Great. Thanks for the color. Chad Richison : You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Go ahead. Siti Panigrahi : Yes, Siti Panigrahi. Thanks for taking my question. Chad just following up your comment about new business activities the leads on a pre-COVID level, that's something different we have been hearing. What we're seeing is mostly businesses focusing on mission-critical application. So, what do you think -- what's the motivation right now for most of those customers switching their payroll at this point? Is there a different kind of motivation then that you've been sharing pre-COVID level? And then are these mainly starting... Chad Richison : No. Well I will say this. I don't think any business ever liked waste. And to the extent businesses still have waste. They're looking to become more efficient. I would also say that payroll and benefits administration and a lot of the things that we're doing in the system I would say is a very important part of what any business does. So, when we're talking about critical functions, I don't know that I align with that same thought that the types of things that someone is doing to engage with their employees right now during this environment is less critical. I definitely understand the cash flow management and the other areas that people have to manage throughout their business. And am I going to say we're the top priority for all businesses? No. Are we the top priority for all? Yes, we are. And there's many businesses in the U.S. and we don't have to sell all of them this week. But we are having a lot of success continuing to drive sales. And I really don't have anything to call out from a sales perspective, save the two weeks we took them out to train and the one week it took us to kind of get back where we did drop 50% for those two weeks and we dropped 80% that third week coming back. But since then, we've been all pistols firing -- pistons firing in regards to our sales efforts and the results they're having in booked sales. Siti Panigrahi : Got it. And I wanted to ask is there any particular verticals you are seeing more interest activities than others? And also like given that inside sales -- increased efficiency in inside sales, are you planning to hire more inside sales this year? Chad Richison : Yes. We continue to be industry-agnostic. There are industries that are going through -- there's 5000-employee companies that are now 280 employees. And you know what, what a great time to convert to Paycom. You only pay for the 280 employees that you work through. It's almost like a year-end conversion. And so, those are great times to convert to Paycom. We're industry-agnostic. For us, it doesn't matter where someone is. We're going to be focused on gaining market share as we come through this. We want to be the net winner in that as we come through this. And we've got some headwinds, right? We've got the interest rate. Now it's at zero. We've got unemployment that continues to climb. If we're doing the right things and we're focused on the three key areas that we mentioned which is continuing to give world-class service which we have absolutely done during this; continue to roll out rapid product development which we've absolutely done through this and continue to add more clients to our platform, I feel like as these things reverse on us that we're going to have some organic tailwinds if you will. So, it's very important right now that we stay focused on all. It doesn't matter to me if a client is furloughing, terminating, laying off employees. Right now, we're open for business. We want to get those clients just like we do those clients who are already growing in the face of this. We want to get them all. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you, Chad. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chad Richison for closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. I'd like to send a special thank you to Paycom employees for all the valuable work they're doing. Over the next couple of months, we'll be meeting with investors virtually at the JPMorgan conference on May 12. We'll also be at the Needham conference on May 19. Both of these are virtual. And in June we will participate in the Baird and Stifel conferences. We appreciate your continued interest in Paycom and look forward to meeting with many of you soon. Thank you, operator. You may disconnect. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, James Samford, Head of Investor Relations for Paycom. Please go ahead. James Samford : Thank you and welcome to Paycom's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Certain statements made on this call that are not historical facts, including those related to our future plans, objectives and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this conference call. While we believe any forward-looking statements made on this call are reasonable, actual results may differ materially because the statements are based on our current expectations and subject to risks and uncertainties.

Any forward-looking statement made speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Also during the course of today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and certain adjusted expenses. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks James and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I want to thank our employees who continue to thrive in this ever-changing environment. For today's call, I'll spend a few minutes on our second quarter 2020 results and some notable trends. Following that, Craig will review our financials and provide some perspective on guidance, and then we'll take questions. I'm very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and the demand we're seeing. As expected our second quarter results were impacted by the headwinds we outlined in our last call, namely the impact of unemployment across our current client base due to the pandemic and a 150 basis point cut in interest rates in March. Despite these headwinds, we continue to see very strong lead volume and new business sales achievements, which have set us up very well for the future. Q2 revenue and adjusted EBITDA came in at $181.6 and $61.2 million respectively. While we expected there to be similarities between the increase in the unemployment rate and the impact on our client base, we now know the actual impact on our client base even as unemployment has fluctuated throughout the quarter. Headcount reductions at our clients and the impact on current client revenue peaked at the end of April and began to stabilize. Based on the trends we've seen throughout the second quarter, we estimate the impact on current client recurring revenue is a loss of approximately $2 million per week. Interest rate cuts added another $350,000 in weekly lost recurring revenues. We've seen these numbers stabilize at these rates for over the last few months, thus making the impact on our revenue more predictable. I'm pleased we are in a position to provide Q3 guidance, which Craig will walk you through shortly. We began the second quarter with strong demand and elevated lead volumes, driven by our deliberate investments in advertising. Q2 demo leads were roughly three times higher than in the comparable prior year quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, the pandemic is exposing scenes created by disparate HCM systems and the increasing trend towards a more autonomous workforce is creating high demand for the Paycom single database solution. We believe the value proposition of our solution is stronger than ever and we continue to see success in both outbound and inbound sales efforts. Our sales teams continue to operate in a virtual model without disruption, and they had strong success in Q2. We continue to see strong usage patterns of our products as measured by our Direct Data Exchange or DDX. With the increasing importance of working autonomously, it is critical that companies enable their employees to have a direct relationship with the database. With Paycom, the employee wins from an easier and more comprehensive experience and the company wins from real savings. Throughout the second quarter, we continue to invest in product development and released several thousand product enhancements. One product that continued to be enhanced during the quarter was Manager on-the-Go. This tool is built into Paycom's existing mobile app and empowers leaders with 24/7 accessibility to essential manager side functionality of our solution. Manager on-the-Go continues to be widely adopted by managers across our client base with already almost 90% of our clients deploying it in just the first five months since launch. Manager on-the-Go is transforming manager workflows and accelerating the speed that data moves throughout the system, which further increases the ROI of our solution and sets up future usage patterns that paved the way for future product innovation and automation. Going forward, we will continue to remain focused on three controllable activities; providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies, and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. I'm very pleased with the execution we have delivered on all three of these fronts to-date, which I believe will further strengthen our market position in the quarters and years to come. We are overcoming the revenue headwind created by the pandemic. As I'm sure many of you have seen our commercials on TV and our advertising assets online, we have spent more in advertising in Q2 than we've ever spent in a single quarter by a significant margin. This advertising span coupled with our world-class sales organization, yielded great results for us in the second quarter. In fact, Q2 was our best quarter ever from a new business sales perspective by a large margin and we will continue to spend aggressively on advertising throughout Q3 and Q4 above the Q2 levels as we deliver our value proposition to our massive target market. With less than 5% of the total addressable market already captured, we have a long way to go. The digital transformation for business is accelerating and our investment in expanding our market share is working. I'll stop there and hand it over to Craig to review our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks Chad. Before I review our second quarter 2020 results, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. I'll briefly cover our Q2 results and trends, then I'll provide some high level comments about Q3 guidance. Our approach is to be as transparent as possible, based on what we know now that we believe there has been enough predictability and the impact of the pandemic on our current client revenue to provide near-term guidance. Before turning to the results, I want to briefly discuss the environment we faced in Q2. During the second quarter, our analysis of the impact of the pandemic was declining employment rates that our existing clients became progressively worse and hit a low point at the end of April and then stabilized. We estimate that the effect of lower headcount at our clients on our current client revenue is a loss of approximately $2 million in weekly recurring revenue as of today. We also experienced the impact of 150 basis point interest rate cuts that occurred in March, which amounts to a loss of roughly $350,000 in weekly recurring revenue. Despite these anticipated headwinds, demand for our solution continues to strengthen and we had increasing new clients sales that were solidly ahead of pre-COVID sales levels. That success has continued into Q3 with accelerating demand and sales trends that are layering in nicely on top of our current client recurring revenue base. With that as a backdrop, I'll turn to the results. In the second quarter, we generated total revenues of $181.6 million, representing growth of roughly 7% with comparable prior year period, driven by strong new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $178 million for the second quarter of 2020, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter. Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $153.8 million, representing adjusted gross margin of 84.7%. We continue to see improving efficiency and customer service and expect to see similar adjusted gross margins for the remainder of the year. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $106 million for the second quarter as compared to $85.9 million in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2020 was $52.3 million or 28.8% of revenues, up from 23.1% in the prior year quarter. We're seeing very positive results from our ad campaigns and marketing efforts and as the second quarter progressed, we made the deliberate decision to further increase our advertising spend. As long as we continue to see positive results from these investments, we intend to continue to be aggressive in this area to drive market share gains. We expect Q3 sales and marketing expense to be approximately $8 million to $10 million higher than Q2 on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. We're maximizing our opportunity to capture market share by spending more on advertising. Adjusted R&D expense was $18.8 million in the second quarter of 2020 or 10.3% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $27.7 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $22.3 million in the prior year period. We have a very ambitious product innovation roadmap, which is a key driver of our success and we will continue to expand our R&D team with high quality talent. Adjusted EBITDA was $61.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 or 33.7% of total revenues compared to $69.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 or 41% of total revenues. We were able to partially offset the loss of high margin revenue with reduced costs from lower travel expenses, but the biggest driver of the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin decline was our deliberate increase in advertising. Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $28.6 million or $0.49 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $48.8 million or $0.83 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. For Q3 and Q4, we expect our effective income tax rate to be approximately 30% and our full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 24% to 25%. Non-cash stock-based compensation was $21.2 million in the second quarter and we expect non-cash stock-based compensation for the third quarter of 2020 to be approximately $20 million. For the full year we anticipate non-cash stock-based compensation will be approximately $75 million. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $35.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $43.7 million or $0.75 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 58 million shares in the third quarter of 2020. From the time we increased our buyback on March 12th, 2020 and through the end of the second quarter, we repurchased over 330,000 shares, including over 240,000 shares purchased in the open market. As of June 30, 2020, Paycom has repurchased over 4 million shares since 2016, with $175 million remaining in our buyback program. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $114 million and total debt of $32 million. Cash from operations was $25.5 million for the second quarter. The average daily balance of funds held for clients was approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Now, let me turn to our guidance, with more clarity about headcount trends in our client base resulting from the pandemic, we believe our current client revenue has become more predictable and we are now providing Q3 guidance based on what we can see as of today. For the third quarter of 2020, we expect total revenues in the range of $191 million to $193 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year periods of approximately 10% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $56 million to $58 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 30% at the midpoint of the range. Our focus continues to be on mitigating the impact of the pandemic on our business by providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies, and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. We have a strong balance sheet, a highly profitable recurring business model, and what we believe is the strongest value proposition in our industry. We are committed to taking advantage of our financial position to drive long-term market share gains. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thank you for taking my question. Can you -- I think the biggest question we will -- are going to get is like around the increase in sales come in the advertisement spending or on sales or marketing. Can you talk a little bit about your thinking like why now -- like obviously, the level is kind of a lot higher than you what you've seen before? Are you seeing like good results, good returns on that one? Is it like -- if I listened to ADP there seem to be hurting a lot more. So, this is a good opportunity. Just tell me about your thinking here and then how you measure success? Chad Richison : Sure. So, on the last call, Raimo, end of April, I discussed how our numbers were back to pre-COVID numbers from book sales. I've since on this call said that our second quarter new client revenue numbers and these are sales -- new sales that we go out and achieve that we actually just completed our best quarter. Second quarter was the best quarter we've ever had from a new business sales perspective. To follow-up on that, July's been -- this July that we just finished up on Friday has been the best month we've ever had from a new business sales perspective. And so we're paying for that. Obviously, those leads I mentioned that leads are up 3x demo leads. These are people that hit our website and request a demo we've always had leads where someone might download a brochure or download a white paper or come to a webinar. But these are leads where people are genuinely interested and they want a product demonstration and so about 90% of those turn into appointments. And so we have a lot more appointments than we've had in the past and we're achieving greater sales. Of course we're spending to do that. Our advertising spin in the second quarter was much more than we've spent in the past and it's working. And I've been saying this, as long as advertising is working, we'll continue to do it. We haven't made any purchases, a month or two or three months out. And so our commitments a week to week type of commitment on advertising, but it's having great -- we're having great success with it. As I'm sure you, Raimo, and everybody else is seeing the ads on TV and online. And another point to make is we're not just advertising the Paycom brand, we're advertising a new way to use this type of technology. It makes no sense that HR inputs this type of data. All businesses have deployed technology as we've moved toward a -- moved more toward an autonomous workforce. I think we're somewhat in the rise of the autonomous worker. And it only makes sense that they would have technology in which both they win and the client. And so we've been aggressive with it, but it is yielding results from us. On the sell-side, which will continue to fold in and become current client revenue. Raimo Lenschow : Good. Okay, perfect. Okay, that's really helpful. And then on you talked about the $2 million per week that -- like you're losing because of unemployment and -- the unemployment situation. And you talked about the stabilization since its peak in April. Are we still kind of thinking about like the math you're laid out in Q1 or how do we have to think about that $2 million per week number now as unemployment rates are coming down? Is there kind of a new way to think about it or any help there in terms of -- like what to do with that? Thank you. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, the number was in between. I mean, it was between $1.95 million and $2 million that we're saying, it maxed out toward the end of April and it stayed consistent. I understand that unemployment fluctuated, but the impact on our numbers stayed consistent, maybe our clients took the hit in the beginning. But I did want to make a point on -- and what you're talking about is I mentioned that directionally -- in the last call, I said directionally, it would be unreasonable to think that we wouldn't be impacted by unemployment, because I did believe and do believe that we're an accurate sampling size and so we should somewhat follow that. We now know that while we were directionally accurate, we now know the exact number that it is and just to bring up, the numbers that are commonly reported for unemployment -- the unemployment claims via media, government, what have you, it's basically calculated two ways. The first source is the unemployment insurance data and this comes from a weekly compilation of -- that the DLL receives directly from unemployment agencies. You have both initial claims and continuing claims. A point to make is that initial claims peaked in the second quarter -- early second quarter, they were 5 million and 6 million. We had a couple weeks there were initial claims were 5 million and 6 million. Last week, initial claims were 1.4 million, the week before that initial claims were 1.4 million and they started to stabilize about at that level over July. An important point to make though is pre-COVID. They were stabilized at average of about 200,000 claims a week. And so that's one calculation not as reliable for unemployment. A second calculation that's used by the U.S. Department of Labor is the Current Population Survey and that's where you get the 14.7% unemployment number for April and the 13.3% unemployment number for May, and the 11.1% unemployment number for June, and how they get that -- how this data is derived from actual interviews of 60,000 households in the U.S. about 110,000 people. And so, while we were directionally accurate and while the impact of Paycom's current client revenues been similar to the increase in unemployment numbers, we now know the exact impact it had it had on Paycom. We peaked toward the end of April; we stabilized so while we can't call out improvement in the impact unemployment is having on current client revenue, we can state that the situation hadn't gotten worse and we've seen stabilization. Like I said I like to think our clients took the hits early. So, we'll have to see from there. But lastly, I didn\u2019t want to make this point. I mean I'm not going to try to be the drugstore economist, as it relates to unemployment. Our goal is to give directional guidance and now that we're giving actual guidance, I don't feel like it's necessary for us to tie to the different methods of calculating unemployment, whether it be the initial claims, which are still elevated based on pre-COVID, or the sampling survey of 60,000 households. So we've given that number and we have not seen that number move to be worse or better since the end of April. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, that's very clear. Very helpful. Chad. Thank you. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you, Raimo. Operator : Your next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Samad Samana : Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. As always, appreciate all the color you just gave. Maybe if I could just ask a follow-up on the new booking side. If I think about sales and marketing dollars, it's up about 33% in dollar terms year-over-year, how should we think about maybe framing the magnitude of that bookings growth just because, you spent the most you ever have in 2Q as less, I'm just trying to understand maybe how to think about what new bookings growth looks like either year-over-year or versus pre-COVID levels as a as a point of comparison? And then I have a couple of follow-ups. Chad Richison : Well, I mean, the bookings were up meaningfully and significantly from Q2 of last year. I will say that Q2 this year was our largest booking quarter ever and Q2 is not typically the largest booking quarter and then to add on to that July has been the largest bookings month we've ever had. So, while we continue to face the current client revenue headwind, that's impacting us through the unemployment, we mentioned, that's approximately $2 million. And then you layer in the $350,000 a week in unemployment, we're hopeful to establish a floor and a new base for growth. And so we've been very focused on that. I do fully expect that as you as we sell, just as in the past, we spend it, we sell it as it folds into the revenue side, our margins continue to improve, I actually still feel good about us being able to continue to focus on and hopefully, achieve at least a rule of 50 this year, which we would expect to improve next year. And so we don't want to be a penny wise and pound foolish when it comes to the opportunity that we have in front of us and the spend is working. We're not going to be wasteful with it, but it's working. And if you take $90 million out of a quarter for both revenue, and as well as for the interest income, there's -- our margins are quite high at an 85%-ish. And so you've got $75 million or so out there in margin that we've also potentially lost as well. And so we believe the -- we know the advertising is working. And as long as it continues to work, we're going to continue to set ourselves up for the subsequent quarters because like I said, we have not yet seen our -- the impact -- the negative impact to our numbers get worse or better. And so like I said, I mean, we're going to continue to focus on new business sales and it took a pandemic to slow and impact our current client revenue, but not even a pandemic could stop our new business sales because they're accelerating. So, -- and that has to do with the advertising spend, in part. The other part has to do with the value proposition. Craig Boelte : And Samad that's 30 million a quarter, the $90 million would be the three quarters for this year. Chad Richison : Right, $90 million for the three quarters, sorry. Samad Samana : Great, very helpful. And then maybe if I could just -- in reading the press release, the commentary around the client base, still increasing the number of clients, it sounds like maybe churn or putting us on a different maybe unit retention was better than expected, or maybe what better than what we might have expected, given how severe the pandemic was maybe if you could just comment on client unit retention as a number of customers and how that trended through the quarter versus just the pace for control change? Chad Richison : Yes, we're not going to give exact retention numbers because obviously, we give those at the end of the year, but I mean I will follow-up on the same thing that I said last time, we're not really seeing units go away. We are seeing clients that may have had 500 employees now have 60. But we're not we're not seeing unit losses. We do have a few clients that may be on pause, and we're filing some zero returns for them. Those are going to be your smaller clients that may not have payrolls to run, but they do still have to file taxes and so we can file zero returns for them. So, they're still active. So, all that's to say is we're not seeing a unit attrition. Samad Samana : Got you. That's very helpful. I appreciate you taking my questions and congrats on the strong new bookings performance. Samad Samana : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : Hey Chad and Craig. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about any sort of differences in terms of the types of clients that you're seeing that are being driven by the advertising? Are they smaller, larger? How many modules are they typically taking? How do they compare to your established client base? Chad Richison : Same, they compare the same. I will say that we did sell our two largest accounts during this quarter, just anecdotally, but that they've been the same. We were getting more usage in the upfront out of them as we are now at 100% commitment to employee usage. We now are getting that on all clients as they start, so we are seeing people's approach to conversion to be more in the effort to where employees would take a full usage strategy. So, we're seeing that, but as far as the types of clients that we're saying usual suspects for us. Mark Marcon : Any sort of change in terms of regional composition? Are you seeing more from areas that you haven't typically been in that are basically being brought in by the national advertising? Or how would you characterize that? Chad Richison : No, I mean, our -- where we have our best reps is where we're going to sell the most and so it doesn't really matter what city or location they're in. That's where we're going to do the best and our leads have continued to come from all over. We do have leads that come from out of territory, and those would be places where we don't have specific coverage, but we've been handling them the way we always did. Now, before, we would fly out and see someone that had over 100 employees in North Dakota, today, we're doing it from the chair in our home office and so -- but we're still approaching out-of-territory sales as well. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. And then how should we think about the marketing spend -- advertising is for wimps. I heard a really smart guy say that one time. The advertising spend if it keeps working the way it is, I mean, the fall selling season hasn't even really kicked off. Should we think about potentially the spend going up even further, as we go into next year and the following year, given that your market share is still leaves lots of room for increase? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, you can get to a point of diminishing returns on advertising spend, you necessarily don't buy double-digit and get double. And so you have to manage that, as we've identified different touchpoints of opportunities and advertising for a client through either initial or retargeting efforts, then that gives you an opportunity to spend incrementally on that. But you can still waste advertising dollars and so, we take a strategy that where we look at a week-by-week -- I mean, we're managing this on a weekly basis and we turn up and down the dials in areas where it makes sense for us to do that. So, our markets are markets, we are spending the advertising dollars, we are having success, but it's hard for me to say exactly where that would go other than to say that we have an elevated advertising average spend now. We are achieving a commensurate result for that and we would like to do more of that in the future, again without wasting ad dollars in areas that aren't going to produce results. Mark Marcon : Historically, July, how does it typically rank relative to -- like, what percentage of the typical best seasonal months would July be? Chad Richison : I think you can have different months that are better than others. As you know, Mark, even though we may not have said that -- said this, I believe our industry and I know almost every one of our competitors will tell you selling seasons, typically September through December as people come back from their vacations and what have you. So, I think it's a little more difficult to compare with last year where potentially you had some people that may have been on vacation and getting back -- getting ready to get the kids into school and that type of thing. You don't have those distractions as much right now. And so I'm not saying July was our best July ever. I'm saying July was the best month we've ever had for sales ever, regardless of month in a year. And so -- but anyway, hopefully that answers the question. Mark Marcon : I appreciate it. That's why I'm saying if July was the best month ever, and it's not even the key selling season that that should portend well for September through December. What -- the average float balance, what sort of effective yield are you getting on that now, Craig? Craig Boelte : We haven't disclosed the yield on our float balance, but as we mentioned, that 150 basis point cut in March had had about $4.5 million half million per quarter impact on us. We have some that's layered out. We probably -- we may not layer out as much as some of our competitors on that -- we're extremely conservative on the way we're investing those funds. But as a renewing, obviously the rates are, are pretty low on those funds. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. Thank you. Congrats. Chad Richison : Thank you. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Chang [ph] with Stifel. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Steven Chang [ph] coming on for Brad. I just have one quick question calendar-wise. I believe that you mentioned in first quarter that that quarter has one less Wednesday than normal. Am I correct assume that the September quarter will have an extra Wednesday this year versus a year ago? Chad Richison : That is correct. The quarter beginning -- the quarter ending in September will have one extra Wednesday. And so I think it happened in 2015 last time. It's happened now in 2020, where Q1 had 12 processing Wednesdays and Q3 has 14 and the point that we made in first quarter when we talked about this is that a Wednesday has roughly half of a week's revenue billing. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you so much for clearing that up. Operator : Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you so much, guys. I got a couple of questions. Maybe just for starters. Chad, I've always been very impressed by your go-to-market, the very disciplined approach to opening and maturing offices in geographies where you see opportunity, but given the success you're having with virtual sales now, does it change your long-term thinking about your go-to-market? Chad Richison : Not yet. I mean, we're going to go where prospects are buying and how they buy. If prospects continue to buy online, which, I mean, I think it's a pretty good model, it removes all distractions and we're watching deals, you know that normally you'd have had a meeting this week and a meeting two weeks from now and a week meeting two weeks from them, maybe worse. And some days you have a meeting on Tuesday, a meeting on Thursday and a meeting the following Monday. So, you know, I think as you remove the distractions out of the way, I think even buyers are able to focus more on functionality as well and, you know, product replacement. So not yet, but we're, we're looking at it, we're definitely gaining some efficiencies within our sales process throughout management, leadership, better development with salespeople, because we're obviously on a lot more calls with them than what we were able to be physically in person. So, as well as sales achievements continue to go up. So I like the environment we're in, could have done without the whole impact to our current client recurring revenue. But we like this type of sales environment that we're going through right now. But the fact is, if clients return back to having people in their office to buy this type of technology, then we're going to be in the office with them. Brad Zelnick : That makes perfect sense. And maybe if I could just follow-up with one on pricing, you've now got the government's PPP program that's expired. Our customers asking for concessions when we think about you know pat them on a like-for-like basis. How is that trending? Chad Richison : Yeah, so we have a fair pricing model. You only pay for the employees that you pay. So if you have active employees within our system and you're not paying them, we're not charging you for them. So, you know, that company that had 500 employees that may now have 60 employees, we're only charging you for those 60 employees as you pay them. So it's a fair model, does that mean we haven't had a client here or there that may have asked for that? I'm sure we have. But our models a fair model in that you pay for who you pay. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thanks so much, and congrats to you on all this success in generating new business and the environment. Thanks, guys. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Jester with Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester : Great, thanks for taking my question. Just first, on the product side, I think you briefly mentioned the Manager on-the-Go update. It's been out six months now, can you just talk about sort of adoption and maybe more generally, as you think about sort of the product, are there any big themes you're looking about in terms of sort of evolving and rolling out new features that, have come across your client conversations in the last couple months? Chad Richison : Yeah. We've had a product roadmap for a while now. And, you got to do first things first. And so for us, it was first getting employees to interact with the database. We've done a good job on that, but we can do better. And, and I again, I don't think there should ever be one change that the employee didn't make on their own, because anytime someone else does it for them, it's duplicative. No HR departments reading an employee's mind. And so that said, there are some things obviously an HR person has to do that an employee is not privy to be able to do themselves. So you have that we came out with the application, now we've moved into Manager on-the-Go. And the good thing about Manager on-the-Go is it's very similar to the app it's within the same technology and keeps the data flow moving timecard approvals, performance reviews, time off approvals and what have you. And so it allows us to get to further automation as we move along. And so our goal right now is to be making sure that people are using all the products we have. The more use cases we have for these, the more companies that buy a full solution set, because it's going to take the full solution set to have full automation. And so yes, we continue to be aggressive with our R&D efforts. We rolled out thousands updates this quarter. We're also finding efficiency throughout our R&D group from a number of hours that they are actually producing, we assign hours to a project, hours a project takes so many hours, we're producing more hours of development in this environment as well. And so we continue to be ambitious. And as we've laid the roadmap, and especially as clients and their employees use these products, it gets us even closer to other areas of innovation and automation that we continue to move in. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks a lot. And then maybe just a little bit of a longer term question here. You know, over the years, you've invested a lot in sort of physical space, right? You built a new campus in Texas. Last year, you made a big land purchase right next year facility in Oklahoma City. I guess, given how you've been able to pivot to more of a remote work environment. How do you think about the physical need for space and the physical need to invest to help you grow the business over the next year or two? Thanks. Chad Richison : Well, I've got, I think, we've got about, 50 or so people in occupying 1 million square feet right now. So, you know, we're overbuilt for the environment that we're in, right now. I think it's too early to say, I mean, I do think there is something to be said about building relationships and face to face environment. So do I see a model where we're a virtual? Not really, not from where I'm sitting right now, I think had we not had those face to face interactions and built those relationships, working the way we are right now could have been a little bit difficult. But, we're going to -- we\u2019re going to see what happens. I don't think we need to make those decisions today. But if there's an opportunity to be more efficient, obviously, that's something we'd be looking to achieve provided that is supports a strong, the strong business continuity, that objectives that we have today. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Schwartz : Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. Chad, just wanted to drill down into the record sales and try to see if anything is changing out there in the market. What I just wanted to ask you really I know you've been pushing the Self-Service messaging for a couple years now you've really been evangelizing that. And I wonder, if COVID-19 and the work from home trend now that that's taken hold, if that is somehow accelerating the messaging around Self-Service, and that could be one of the drivers of the bookings momentum? Chad Richison : Yes. Absolutely, I mean, we've been running these ads for a while I do believe people are getting it. Also, people are having a lot of success with usage. So as employees leave one company and go to another, we're getting leads that way or even people that use the Paycom Solution as an administrator, whether they're in HR, payroll, benefits of administration, procurement, performance, whatever they're in, they leave one company go to another, they're bringing in it easier to use solution whereby the client wins. So absolutely a differentiated product is what's driving our sales results, but advertising the differentiation is getting us those at-bats. And so we've been focused on that. Brian Schwartz : Thank you. And then the one follow-up I had for either you or Craig was just trying to get, if it's possible anymore color in terms of what that growth is on the bookings? Is there anything that maybe you can help us maybe then share what the bookings growth was last year in this quarter since we know it\u2019s above that? Or maybe what your best month was in the company's history since we know July would be above that without necessarily giving the exact rate? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, we haven't disclose that, and that's kind of a rabbit hole we go down that, we just continue to go down once we do. It is a fact that our Q2 bookings of this year was the highest booking quarter we've ever had. We've had great booking quarters before. This was the highest we've ever had. And then it's also a fact that July, the month we're in right now is the highest month we've ever had, which would tell you that our July month was better than any month we had in Q2, and Q2 was our largest new business quarter. So, we just finished our largest month after having just finished our largest quarter. So we'll see what happens the rest of Q3, but we've kept momentum ever since, I shut the I shut us down for two weeks end of March. My mistake, cost us about 50% of book sales revenue for those two weeks. We got back to about 80% of where we were the first week of April. We got right back to where we were on pace toward the end of April. And then as you've heard during this, that accelerated throughout the rest of the quarter, making it the largest quarter we've ever had for new business bookings. And then now we've just followed that up with our largest month. And we believe that right now, at least from what we can see, and as we sit here today, our -- the impact of our current client revenues has stabilized, and that's why we've returned to guidance for Q3. Brian Schwartz : Thank you for that additional color. Chad Richison : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Robert Simmons : Hi, this is Robert Simmons on for Alex. So I believe you've opened one new sales office in the last two plus years, given the usual ramp time for new office, with this now be a good opportunistic time to open a few new ones? Or alternatively, are you expanding your team sizes? Chad Richison : Yes, we haven't necessarily expanded team sizes. Now we did talk about how we've added inside sales teams. We started adding those. We had one that we really put together through last year and then continued to add additional teams to that. Right now everybody's an inside sales rep on an inside sales team. It's just our inside sales by definition, focuses on below 50 employee companies and our outside sales group, which again is working inside, focuses on above 50 employees. But we're just having a great success with performance, I think that the amount that anyone rep sales is continuing to increase. And it has been, I mean, this isn't a phenomenon that just happened right now. Our top reps have continued to increase the amount that one rep can sell. And so it's not that we've hired a bunch of extra reps. It's that we're having very strong performance amongst our sales rep group, with some moderate increases in inside sales teams as we fill them out. Robert Simmons : Got it. Great. And then can you size the impact of lower unemployment levels on 2Q revenue? Can we think that $2 million and multiply it by 13? Or is that too simple? Chad Richison : Roughly it will be, yes, it will be $2 million multiplied by 13 for the quarter. Craig Boelte : Yes, but plus the impact on the interest. Chad Richison : The interest would be what we called out last quarter was $4.5 million per quarter, which I think Craig Boelte : Close to $30 million. Chad Richison : Yes, $30 million total for the quarter. Robert Simmons : Got it. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan MacDonald with Needham. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, this is Josh on for Ryan. What assumptions are you baking into Q3 guidance for improvement in employment trends versus new customer growth? Do you expect that $2 million per week to remain steady and your assumptions? And then the benefit of the extra Wednesday; is that roughly an $8 million benefit to the quarter with a half week of recurring revenues? Craig Boelte : Yes, first off on the extra Wednesday, that would have been kind of the pre-COVID levels. Now, you're looking at more of a $6.5 million to $7 million range on that impact on the quarter. In terms of the Q3 guidance, what we've seen so far as it relates to our current client base is not much of an improvement. It kind of hit that $2 million level and it stayed there and any improvements, kind of ending in employment level would have minimal impact on us unlike what obviously happened in April where, we're going up so much. So, we really haven't baked in any improvements. We haven't seen any so far for the quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And then I just want to follow-up. How should we think about your hiring plans in the back half of the year versus pre-COVID plans earlier this year? Do you feel like this is also a time to ramp up hiring more than you had maybe originally expected at the beginning of the year? Chad Richison : I think it depends on the department. I think that you're going to see every business come out this more efficient. I think we all sent groups of people to work from home and we all had groups of people working different ways from home. And as you go through any business and you start identifying who's doing what, there's opportunities to become more efficient across the Board, which we've taken advantage of that. So I think all businesses come out of this leaner than what they did going into it, to be honest with you. And I think that we've seen some of that. Now that said, just like we pulled back a little bit on getting people out there selling for those couple of weeks. We did very similar with our recruiting and hiring opportunities, those have kicked back up, especially on sales, R&D side and some of the others and so -- but we'll continue to look at that and staff at what we need. So yeah, I mean, we have started to rehire again for sure. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : [Operator Instruction] Your next question comes from Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Arvind Ramnani : Hi, congrats on a good quarter. Just an overall question, certainly when the pandemic hit you all went into changing how you will sell your product, how your sales declined. Now that the dust has settled, two questions here, what areas were you most surprised about from upside and downside perspective? And secondly, are there any sort of permanent changes you're looking to kind of put in place? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, I would say, the upside perspective is obviously the sales piece. And I do think that this has, like I said, the pandemics exposed weaknesses and also created opportunities. I think probably every business would like their employee to have a direct relationship with the database, maybe they just didn't want to have that conversation. And now it's much easier to do that. From a surprise to the downside, I guess I'm surprised that our number -- the impact to our number got to where it was and it stayed there consistently week-to-week, I would have expected some fluctuation in it getting worse over time and then getting better over time. It seemed to have gotten really bad at the beginning and stayed there. But I also think maybe clients took their hits early and hopefully if that's the case, we will see -- continue to see stabilization in the number. We have thus far. I mean, we've seen stabilization in the number now for almost three months. And unemployment, as you guys have seen has moved up and down. But we'll just go back to what I say the most accurate unemployment data is derived from a random survey of 60,000 households that have 110,000 people. So that's the most accurate number that we're all trying to tie to and it's difficult to tie to. You can take that number and then also what I said, is pre-COVID the number of initial unemployment claims was around 200,000. I mean, specifically, first week in January was 212,000, second week 207,000, the next week 220,000, the next week 212,000, first week of February 201,000 and 204,000 you get the bang. And then we get to the third week in March, it jumps to 3.3 million, the next week it's 6.8 million, the next week, it's 6.6 million, and then it goes until over these last, I'm going to call it six weeks, you've been in between 1.35 million and 1.5 million for weekly initial unemployment claims filed. Far Cry [ph] almost 7x times the number of initial claims filed pre-COVID. And we're still -- our numbers are continuing to be stabilized. We're not seeing that impact. And so, we're going to separate ourselves from that comment. It was an important comment and we weren't giving guidance, we needed to give a directional and so we did that. But now we know the direct impact that it's going to have on our numbers. And so like I said, we're bringing it -- we're building a new baseline here. Hopefully, it's built and we'll see. But we're also building a launchpad as we head forward into next year, and that's what we're focused on if unemployment numbers get better with our clients, then we're going to experience some growth. If unemployment numbers get better from a survey and not with our clients, then we will not experience organic growth of current client revenue. It's going to come from the heavy lifting of new business sales, which we continue to achieve in great fashion right now. Arvind Ramnani : Yeah. That's super helpful. On the existing clients there, clients have been reducing headcount. You talked about some level of civilization, are you able to help us think through what triggers you're all seeing for that return where existing clients go back and rehire employees that they're either furloughed or laid off? Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean, I believe that some of the ones that I've mentioned before. I mean, I know we had health clubs, we had hotels, we had some different groups that were impacted by that. Could we get some uplift? Yes, we could. We absolutely could. Could we be negatively impacted more in areas that haven't yet experienced a significant shutdown? I don't know, maybe. But we're just going to have to wait and see. But one thing we did was we went through an analysis of what were the impacts on our current client revenue? What were those numbers? When did they start and what's been the movement since? And I believe that's the most relative number to us. And so we've seen stabilization. I am hopeful that that stabilization continues. We feel good about third quarter. That's why we've gone ahead and returned to guidance here in the third quarter. And then we'll see what happens subsequent to that. But thus far for the last three months, our numbers have been stabilized as far as the negative impact on our current clients unemployment trends. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Chad Richison for closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. And I'd like to spend a -- send a special thank you to all the employees for all the valuable work they're doing. Over the next couple of months, we'll be meeting with investors virtually at the Oppenheimer conference on August 12. And in September, we plan to participate in the Citi and Jefferies virtual conferences. We appreciate your continued interest in Paycom and look forward to connecting with many of you soon. Thank you, operator, you may disconnect. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I also want to thank our employees for delivering another excellent quarter. For today's call, I'll spend a few minutes on our third quarter 2020 results and the long-term drivers of our business. Following that, Craig will review our financials and provide some perspective on guidance and then we'll take your questions. I'm very pleased with our performance in the third quarter with continued strong demand for our solutions in a large and expanding human capital management market. We have less than 5% market share, which gives me a lot of confidence in our long runway. The unemployment headwinds across our pre-pandemic client base remains relatively unchanged from the second quarter but our product value proposition is having a lot of success and we are plowing through the headwinds with strong new business sales. Q3 revenue and adjusted EBITDA came in at $196.5 million and $67.5 million, respectively both ahead of our guidance thanks to strong new client adds and benefits from operational efficiencies. Based on combining our implied full year outlook for revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin, we expect to hit the Rule of 50 in 2020 despite being in one of the most difficult economic times we've ever seen. And I believe we will improve on the Rule of 50 in 2021. Our marketing plan in the third quarter delivered strong demo leads, leading to strong new client sales and we plan to continue to spend aggressively on advertising to fuel future revenue growth. The challenges created by the pandemic are exposing the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems, which are cobbled together from multiple vendors and the value proposition of Paycom's single database solution is stronger than ever for companies of all sizes including companies well above our target range. We continue to be pulled well above our stated targeted range as larger companies look to leverage automated processes for their own employees. At the same time, our small business adds have continued to increase in 2020 as we continue to build out our inside sales force. Manager on-the-Go continues to gain popularity and was recently named a top HR product at this year's HR Technology Conference. We are receiving more leads and referrals as the industry shifts toward an employee usage strategy. Since the end of Q1 2020, usage of Manager on-the-Go has nearly doubled. 98% of all Paycom clients have deployed Manager on-the-Go. Manager on-the-Go fundamentally changes manager workflows and accelerates the speed that data moves throughout the system, which further increases the ROI of our solution and sets us up for future usage patterns that pave the way for future product innovation and automation. DDX usage continues to trend upwards towards the 100% mark, up from the low 90s. In July we changed our sales procedures to ensure that new clients commit to 100% usage. We are now at our highest DDX usage rate since launching the industry's only software of its kind last year. CEOs and HR executives continue to see the savings from an employee's direct relationship with the database.  As a reminder, when an employee makes a data change themselves, the company saves $4.51 and the savings are calculated in real time using the DDX. We are extremely ambitious with our product road map and we are continuing to invest in R&D. The pandemic's impact on our pre-pandemic client revenue remains stable and it's unclear if or when those same clients will add to their employee counts. When we reported earnings in August, we said that without a catalyst we wouldn't expect employee counts to improve. And thus far it has not improved materially nor has it gotten any worse. As we work through these unique times, we will continue to remain focused on three controllable activities : providing world-class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform.  Our execution along these three fronts has been exceptional. Based on the strength of our new client revenue trends differentiated value proposition less than 5% estimated market share and the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns, I'm confident we can deliver even stronger full year revenue growth next year on top of our newly established base even without any improvement in our pre-pandemic clients' employee base. The digital transformation for businesses is accelerating and our investment to expand our market share is working. Leads continue to be driven by users, employee referrals and our investments in advertising and all are up year-over-year. We are putting a greater distance between our product, value proposition and that of our competition and we believe we are the clear choice for those seeking a more efficient way to manage HCM needs.  I'll stop there and hand it over to Craig to review the financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our third quarter 2020 results, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis.  I'll briefly cover our Q3 results and trends then I'll provide some high-level comments about Q4 guidance. Last quarter, we discussed how the effect on our current client revenue of lower head count at our pre-pandemic clients represented a loss of approximately $2 million in weekly recurring revenue. The impact of 150 basis point interest rate cuts that occurred in March represented an additional loss of roughly $350,000 in weekly recurring revenue.  To-date, we haven't seen any catalysts that have materially changed this weekly headwind. Our growth is therefore largely coming from new client business. In the third quarter, we generated total revenues of $196.5 million representing growth of 12.3% over the comparable prior year period driven by strong new business wins.  Within total revenues recurring revenue was $192.7 million for the third quarter of 2020, representing 98% of total revenue for the quarter. Total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $166.8 million, representing adjusted gross margin of 84.9%. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $113.3 million for the third quarter as compared to $94.4 million in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2020 was $58.3 million or 29.7% of revenues up from $46.7 million in the prior year period. Our deliberate increase in advertising and marketing efforts over the last several quarters are translating to more demo leads and virtual meetings and increased close rates and we intend to be aggressive in this area again in Q4 to drive further market share gains.  We expect Q4 sales and marketing expense to be similar to Q3 on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. Adjusted R&D expense was $19.7 million in the third quarter of 2020 or 10% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D cost including the capitalized portion were $29.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $24.8 million in the prior year period. Product innovation remains a key driver of our growth and we will continue to expand our R&D investments to further differentiate our solutions. Adjusted EBITDA was $67.5 million in the third quarter of 2020 or 34.3% of total revenues compared to $66.6 million in the third quarter of 2019 or 38% of total revenues. We are deliberately investing in future growth through the pandemic and believe this sets us up well for accelerating growth in 2021.  Our GAAP net income for the third quarter was $27.5 million or $0.47 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $39.2 million or $0.67 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period.  For Q4, we expect our effective income tax rate to be approximately 29% and our full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 22% to 24%. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense was $19.5 million in the third quarter and we expect non-cash stock-based compensation for the fourth quarter of 2020 to be approximately the same as Q3 2020. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $40.6 million or $0.70 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $41.1 million or $0.70 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 58 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2020. As of September 30, 2020, we have repurchased over 4 million shares since 2016 and have $172 million remaining in our buyback program. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $156 million and total debt of $31 million. Cash from operations was $66.8 million for the third quarter or a 24.5% increase over the comparable prior year period. The average daily balance of funds held for clients was approximately $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2020. Now let me turn to our guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect total revenues in the range of $212 million to $214 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 10% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $76 million to $78 million, representing adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 36% at the midpoint of the range. Based on this outlook, we now feel we can comfortably deliver a combination of revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin to hit a Rule of 50, despite a pandemic and lower interest on funds held for clients. We estimate the pandemic's impact lowered our recurring revenue base by a total of roughly $90 million to $95 million over the last three quarters of 2020, in addition to the loss of sales earlier in the year while we transitioned our sales organization to the work-from-home model. Our focus continues to be on mitigating the impact of the pandemic on our business by providing world-class service to our clients rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. We have a strong balance sheet, a highly profitable recurring business model and a rapidly expanding value proposition. With that we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Two quick ones. Chad, you talked about the new business doing well. Do you have any kind of data points that kind of help us or any more commentary around \u2013 that should kind of help us understand the momentum that you have there? Chad Richison : Well, I mean our bookings and our leads, our new business sales and our new business starts have all remained at record highs. And from where I sit right now I don't see that changing. Now that we've returned to guidance, we're focused on that piece. I do believe that you see these numbers that we've added reflected in our current quarter as well as in our guidance. As a reminder, a deal that might start at the beginning of a quarter, we would receive 100% of the revenue for that new business. And should that deal start at the middle or end of the quarter, we would receive proportionate revenue for that business but we would receive all of the revenue for that in subsequent quarters. So how deals start matter but for us leads have been up, sales have been up and so starts, so very happy with what we're accomplishing right now. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. And then one follow-up. Like in your prepared commentary, when you talked about COVID, you mentioned that obviously, the headwind is that people have a lower employee count. And since you get paid on a per paycheck basis that hurts you. So in a way if you think about it like it's a good way to understand it. At the beginning of the crisis people were furloughed then they didn't come back and so you're kind of running with that gap. And then as you think about next year as hiring starts again and the new clients that you win, you'll kind of fill up that gap that was created. Is that the right way to think about it? Chad Richison : Well, we're actually going to look to fill the entire gap with new clients added. That's what we've done up to now. I mentioned that we haven't seen any material changes in our pre-COVID \u2013 the impact on our pre-COVID client base. And so we did mention how it was $2 million anywhere from $1.95 million to $2 million of loss that we were seeing per week. We mentioned that at the end of August \u2013 or sorry at the beginning of August and we did say that we had seen stabilization in that number throughout the second quarter. As we sit here today, we can't call out that that number has changed materially. I mean you may have had a small impact one week or another of less than $100,000 impact on that number to the positive. So to the extent it was $2 million, it might be a little above $1.9 million, depending on what week you measure. But we said in August, that without a catalyst, we wouldn't expect the impact on a pre-COVID client employee count to improve. And while the unemployment has improved since that date, it's still double what it was pre-COVID. It hasn't materialized for our clients, who reduced staff. And it makes sense. I mean, there's nothing that's really happened since August that would cause a hotel to all of a sudden, start hiring their people back or restaurants, or entertainment business or health clubs. So the fact is, those businesses are more surviving. I wouldn't necessarily call them thriving at this point. And we're waiting on either an end to the pandemic, or some type of a stimulus before I think we'd see some meaningful change to that. So as we look into the future, we believe we've established a new base. Hopefully, we get some tailwind out of it. But right now, I'd call it, more of a crosswind as it stabilized, and we're jumping through that, and we can get to where we need to get by adding on new clients, which I will say, we've been doing \u2013 adding on new business at record pace through the pandemic. So I don't see a situation in which that stops for us as our value proposition has only gotten stronger. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Congrats. Thank you. Well done. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I hope everybody is doing well. Maybe Chad, just a starting point, I want to follow-up on Raimo's question around new bookings. If I rewind back to 2019, the company has added about 3,000 new clients. That's about 750 average per quarter. I'm just curious. To further frame that new bookings, is it fair to assume that you're adding more than that 750 per quarter kind of on an annualized or quarterly basis exiting July and into 3Q? We're just trying to maybe numerically nail down what that booking suggests. Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, well, what I can tell you \u2013 and I haven't called out exactly units. Units would be based on how many smaller deals we got versus larger deals. I'm more talking about the revenue generated. Whether it's a larger or smaller deal, the aggregate amount of revenue that we are both selling as well as converting, continues to remain strong and has been at record levels as we've continued on. Now, it's gotten better, right? In the beginning, we were trying to get back to pre-pandemic, which I'd mentioned in our first quarter. I believe, I gave that announcement either at the very end of April or 1st of May that we had gotten back to pre-pandemic sales levels, after we had backed off for a little bit and kind of curled up into a ball and was kind of waiting to see what happened. We got back to pre-pandemic levels. Last quarter, I talked about how that's even accelerated. I mentioned that, we've had our best month, as I reported in August talking about July, and then what I've talked about. This quarter is just the continuation of that in that we continue to get stronger and stronger in both the book sales as well as the started sales. Samad Samana : Great. And maybe just as a follow-up to that. The commentary it sounds \u2013 both you and Craig mentioned 2021 or looking out ahead to that, and I believe reacceleration of revenue was mentioned. I'm curious, if you could maybe just frame that a little bit. Are we thinking \u2013 when you say that is it in terms of accelerating from 2020 levels? Or should we think about acceleration in the context of back to what Paycom was historically growing when we're thinking about kind of a high 20s, 30% type of grower in 2018 and 2019? Chad Richison : Yeah. Well, we've calculated the impact on our revenue right now. It's \u2013 nobody has to guess, how many fingers we're holding up. We're telling you how many fingers we're holding up. So we've already calculated the amount of the impact that that has on us. And so \u2013 and we also believe that \u2013 well, we know, it's been stable. And so as we turn into next year, obviously, we have a first quarter comp that doesn't have much COVID impact on it. But as we move into those subsequent quarters throughout the year, and we're lapping COVID with a new established base and added clients during this time, I feel very comfortable about our ability to get back to very strong growth numbers with strong adjusted EBITDA numbers as well. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks, guys. And glad to hear about the strong bookings performance again this quarter. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yao Chew from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Yao Chew : Hi, everyone. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question, and I hope you all keeping well and safe. Congrats on the quarter remarkable execution from everyone involved here. I had a question around one of the comments that ADP made on their recent quarter and it ties a little bit to that. You're mentioning around stimulus Chad in terms of a catalyst. They said, stimulus helped clients that would have fallen to bankruptcy and there remains continued uncertainty as to further stimulus and strain from partial shutdowns. I wanted your take on this two ways. Number one, how do you think further stimulus or lack thereof would have a meaningful impact on the path of recovery for your business? And two, how do you position the business or go-to-market motion differently to react to the possibility of stimulus? Chad Richison : Yeah. Well, I mean, we're operating our business to succeed whether there's a stimulus or a fast end to the pandemic regardless. And so we're focused on those things we can control. And there being a stimulus, or there being a stimulus that actually works to drive business growth we'll have to kind of take a wait-and-see approach on that. But I do think that a stimulus can bridge the gap between those businesses that may be going out of business. It could be the difference in them going out of business or their survival. As we look at the amount of revenue that we've lost per week, which again has been stable, there is an amount of business there that we've been able to identify that has gone out of business. It's a smaller number, but there is a percentage of the hit that we are taking on these headwinds that we would not expect to come back, just because it's related to business closures. And that's a much smaller amount. I mean, I would say that represents probably less than 10%. It's probably in the single digits of that amount of -- that we've lost every week. I would say, 90% or more of it is still in business, processing with a lower employee count. Yao Chew : Got you. Super helpful. Thank you. One quick follow-up. I wanted to double-click on inside sales, which you called out. Can you remind us the size and resources you've dedicated to this effort, what the learnings have been? And any particular module or need that's resonating with clients in this environment? Chad Richison : Yes. So right now we have four inside sales teams. They are fully staffed at 32 employees. Obviously, they each have managers. They focus on the businesses that have below 50 employees. We've continued to generate interest downmarket. Thankfully we had inside sales before we made the shift, because I would say our outside sales, they're not using the exact same model to sell that inside sales is using, but they do use a lot of the same technology and methods to which to connect. And so, we've continued to grow our inside sales. Obviously, when you add a number of inside salespeople much larger than what you had the previous year, you would expect to have success downmarket. And so, we do continue to have success downmarket as well with our inside sales group. Yao Chew : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Congrats again. Chad Richison : Thank you Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg from Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg : Great. And thanks for taking the question. Just maybe for Chad. Now that we're in the typically strong selling season, just given the pandemic and the changes that it caused, any sense on how the HCM monetizations are being prioritized relative to past years? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, I think that our advertising is helping with that. I wouldn't say that people wake up in the morning excited about shifting over -- changing over their human capital management products. It's probably about as many people that wake up excited about going to the dentist. However, if you have enough pain, you are excited about going to the dentist or making those changes. And as we've moved to COVID, I think that the pain points have become more apparent in using outdated systems where employees have multiple systems that they need to use. So actually they oftentimes go without. The shift to employee usage, I mean, that's the thing moving forward. We're not going backwards as a society. And you're going to just see more and more businesses figure out that they can leverage their own employees' desires for their own benefit and receive a very strong return on the investment that they're paying with Paycom. So we're going to continue to drive that and receive those benefits. And again the pandemic has only exposed the problems with using dispirit outdated systems. And so, we're focused on that and we're having quite a bit of success. And that's going to continue through selling season, which for Paycom is all year round. Adam Borg : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hey. Good afternoon and congratulations. Wondering with regards to the bookings that you're seeing, any change at all in terms of the composition in terms of the source of the bookings? Are you seeing that are -- more that are coming from say regionals relative to some of the bigger competitors that are out there? And Chad, I think you also mentioned that you're being pulled upmarket, even beyond your range. Can you expand a little bit on that in terms of what you're seeing? Chad Richison : Sure. So as far as the bookings, they're all similar. There's just more of them. It's the usual suspects. I did call out that we do continue to be pulled up above our targeted range -- or our stated range, I should say. And that's been happening. I mean, that's been happening since we went public. We continue to be talking about being pulled up above our range. And so, that's continued to happen during this environment as well. And so, we have both that as well as, as I mentioned earlier, we have built out our inside sales group much larger than what we had this same time last year. So you would also expect that we would be having some success below 50, as well as that was somewhat traditionally -- I don't necessarily want to say ignored, but it was not a focus for us. And now we have a group and several teams that are making that a focus down market. Mark Marcon : Great. It sounds like you're being barbelled a little bit in terms of being pulled up and down, which is great. Can you talk a little bit about -- you mentioned that the close rates are improving. How much? And what do you attribute that to? Chad Richison : Yes. We're not going to call out exactly the specifics on that improvement. We've always had better close rates as you measure them over time. Your one-month close rate on selling a deal is going to be different than your three-month close rate. Again, if you give a deal a little bit longer, you might have a higher close rate. But I would say the one thing that I would point to that I believe that's really helping us with our close rate is the fact that we are catching a more interested and knowledgeable prospect. We're hitting the airwaves hard with our advertising. We've been doing quite a bit on digital, as well as we've had significant word-of-mouth from employees that go from one company to another and then bring us in. And so we are -- when someone's calling us now -- which again is different. Oftentimes most of the business, we've brought on we've called. And I'm not stating that still isn't a large part of our business. But one thing that has gone up as a percentage has been the number of call-ins or interested parties that are requesting those demos. And they're just more educated on what our value proposition is going into it, and I think that that's leading to a higher level of close rate for us right now. Mark Marcon : Great. And then one last one. Just it sounds like you're getting more logos, but can you talk a little bit about upsells to the extent you're seeing them? Chad Richison : Yes. We continue to upsell to current clients. It's never been anything that we've ignored. We've always done that aggressively, and that remains the case today no change in percentage from upsells to current clients versus new client or new business revenue that we're onboarding to our platform so no changes in percentage there. We're not selling more -- we're not upselling more to our current clients now as a percentage of new revenue added than what we've done in the past. Mark Marcon : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester from Citi. Your line is open. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks for taking my question everybody. First, maybe a question on margin. Year-to-date EBITDA margins are down I think about four points compared to the same period in 2019. So can you just reflect like how much of this is just the float revenue going away versus other factors impacting the business? And as you think about the margin structure of the business going into next year kind of what are the puts and takes we should be thinking about in terms of the potential to improve off of this year's level? Craig Boelte : Sure. So the EBITDA margin is down like you said about four points. I mean, that's primarily from the float revenue that we were receiving, which is a high-margin piece of our business as well as the fact that our current clients are paying less employees. I mean, that's also a piece that impacts that margin. So the things we've been extremely proud of is just our gross margin stayed fairly consistent even through this. And we're seeing efficiencies throughout the organization both in our servicing organization and our onboarding as well as just the sales organization. So as we move into 2021, we talked about hoping to improve. And obviously, the margin is one area we're going to continue to focus on. But the other thing is, we're super focused on revenue growth. So we're going to spend to -- in terms of sales and marketing for that revenue growth as well. Daniel Jester : And then I know that implementation is a very small part of the revenue base, but it is growing at half the pace on a year-over-year basis as subscription revenue. Given sort of the commentary about the strength of new bookings, should we see improvement in the growth rate in that implementation revenue line in the upcoming quarters? Or how should we think about that? Thanks. Craig Boelte : Yes. As a reminder the new booking -- the setup revenue that we charge clients, we capitalize that and recognize that over a 10-year period. So the amounts that we're charging for that setup goes into the deferred bucket. So you're not going to see significant changes in that on the revenue line. As a reminder, there's other items in that line as well. We have certain hardware sales as it relates to time and attendance and some other items as well. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open. Brian Schwartz : Thank you. And thank you for taking my questions this afternoon. Chad a follow-up question here on the implementation. Are you seeing any change in the pace of the implementations whether it's the smaller deals that you're doing or the higher deals? Have they changed at all here in the virtual world? Chad Richison : No, not really. I mean we did have a transition period right of deals that we had sold January, February and March that had a certain expectation of what conversion would look like. And then we changed what all that looked like. I mean you're expecting someone to come out to your office. You're expecting different training on site. I mean there was a lot of things that we had to change. But as we sit here today, that's all filtered itself out. Any pushes that we had through into the second quarter we started to all see that come back. And as we sit here today, our no start rate for business sold is not unlike it was last year. So it's -- they're very similar. So, I think as we moved throughout the quarters, you did have some pushes, you had a few delayed starts just because we had to really go back and -- I'm not going to say resell because we never really lost the deal, but we did have to acclimate them to a different process mindset of implementation. And we've done that and those deals have been onboarded. So, as we sit here today and as we look forward, there's nothing to call out on any type of either elongated time to go live or accelerated time to go live. Brian Schwartz : And if I could ask you the follow-up question Chad. Just thinking about it moving ahead do you feel that you have enough sales capacity here? You said you're fully staffed with the inside sales, but clearly what you're talking about the velocity of the new deals and the bookings and the advertising and then correspondingly with your services organization to be able to continue to deploy these new customers and achieve the high satisfaction levels that the company has always been able to do. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean you always want more salespeople. We're continuing to add salespeople. I think one thing we've been able to do in the beginning again we had to shift over to the new model. We've done a good job of that. We did pull back on hiring at that time. We've since put the gas back into hiring and we started doing that early this summer where we started getting back to that. Our sales reps are having a lot more success right now. Our -- we're having significant productivity gains amongst our same sales organization that we've had. Our office opening strategy is still intact. We still do plan to open up offices as it makes sense. Also right now every city is open. So, we're able to really sell from anywhere right now. So, I see us returning back to the same model we had in the past at the appropriate time. We still may receive some efficiencies through selling. Look if the client is going to continue to buy online, maybe they do, maybe they don't. I don't know yet. Then we're going to continue to sell that way even though we may be back in our offices selling from those desks instead of selling from our home desks. So we'll kind of see what happens. But so far with the exception of the negative impact that the pandemic has had on our current client pre-pandemic revenue as well as interest rates, with the exception of that, every impact that we've had as we've gone through this has really been positive and we're very happy about what our future looks like right now. And really that-- Brian Schwartz : Last question-- Chad Richison : That really is driven by the value proposition. I mean that's what's driving everything. We have the right value proposition for business and they can make that shift very easily right now. And start they can receive a product that works for them and pays them back versus a product they have to work and that's costing them money. And so that's really what's driving it. Brian Schwartz : Last question from me for Craig. I think you got this question here before kind of just more directly about thinking about the margin trajectory for 2021. I'll ask it a little bit differently because you've given a lot of color here so far. Are any of the savings that are happening today -- let's just say T&E from having the remote workforce, are any of those sustainable here as we think about 2021 or any other items such as leases? Maybe you can share with us how you're thinking about the Paycom organization returning to work. And any color on that would be helpful. Thank you very much. Craig Boelte : Yes, I would say on the travel and entertainment obviously that's at a much lower level than it had been in the past where we would bring entire sales organization in to train. I mean a lot is going to depend on what it looks like next year. I mean once -- if we get back to normal and -- we'll see those numbers start to go up some. So, I think that's what I would say. I mean on the leases we're still evaluating that. But at this point we're continuing kind of as normal until we see what it looks like in 2021. Chad Richison : And just to kind of dovetail off of that. We haven't been expanding our adjusted EBITDA percentages by pulling levers. We've been doing it by selling profitable business that all follows the same margin profile and so the more business we sell over time, we are receiving that benefit of the increase of adjusted EBITDA. And so when we look into next year, saving money on travel and entertainment and those types of sales, I mean we're not going to spend poorly on it. But that's not really our objective. It's -- saving that. Our objective is to continue to accelerate revenue, continue to onboard clients and capture more than the 5% of the market that we have today. And that's what's going to drive our margins as well as our revenue growth into the future. Brian Schwartz : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from RBC. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats as well. Maybe just the first one from me. Chad, can you remind us what's the vertical exposure for the business? You mentioned one of the reasons that you didn't see kind of the same uptick from employment bouncing back was because of the hospitality travel maybe restaurants. Can you remind us what's the exposure rate there? Chad Richison : Yes. We're industry-agnostic. And so we've said that. I guess you could somewhat calculate the exposure rate and that we've told you guys exactly what the weekly impact to our revenue has been from that -- those same clients having employee attrition layoff furloughs or what you have. But I would say, it's a little bit different everywhere. Some states have restaurants doing better than others. Some states are doing better at restaurants because the weather is conducive for their business. And potentially, if the weather does not hold up, we could see a different situation. But what we've seen up to now is people were being responsible early on with preparing for the pandemic at least our clients. I think I mentioned early on -- I mean when we were reporting second quarter -- or first quarter that we do think many of our clients took their hits early because we started to see some of that in mid-March as they started to make those moves. So I'm hopeful that people start to add back and I think that they will at some point. We're just not waiting on for that -- we're not just not waiting on that to happen or being dependent upon that for our future growth initiatives. Alex Zukin : That makes total sense. And I guess do you expect -- walk us through -- because you've seen a round of stimulus get enacted. And if you can kind of share with us from a timing perspective, if we do get stimulus at some point very early in the year, when would you expect that to actually flow into your customer base hiring trends? Or is that not the right way to think about it? Chad Richison : Yes. I don't know. When you look at stimulus, I would say even stimulus in the last package had a much larger impact on small business than what it did midsize and large business at least from my standpoint of kind of what we saw who took what if you will. And so I just think all that just depends on what type of stimulus they're putting out there. If they do a stimulus that's tied to quality jobs of people producing quality jobs of certain amounts of pay and you give your stimulus based on that or even a stimulus that has some reimbursements based off of the company adding quality jobs, it's probably going to be a pretty nice tailwind for us. If the stimulus comes and sending checks directly to individuals that are at their house, we could have a tighter labor market. So we're just going to have to see from that. But again I'm going to separate us from the impacts of employment. The changes in employment that have impacted Paycom we've seen those stabilize now for I mean four or five months. And so as we head throughout this quarter and definitely as we head into next year we're expecting that to be stable and then we're expecting to be able to hit our growth objectives through adding new clients to our platform which has really -- we've been doing a good job right now. And I think as we lapped COVID with COVID we're going to be in good shape. Alex Zukin : That makes sense. And then maybe just a final one. When you talk about bookings trajectory, you talked about new record bookings this quarter. Last quarter, I would say you talked about record months as well. When I hear you say faster sales cycles more informed buyers, more effective and efficient go-to-market, is it fair to ask you then are you seeing accelerating sequential bookings growth 3Q to 2Q and your -- and if you kind of stay on cadence you should see the same thing 3Q to 4Q? Chad Richison : Yes. I want to get away from calling out bookings each time. I have been calling out bookings because we weren't giving you much of anything else and I thought that \"Well listen I at least want to tell people that even though we're not guiding, bookings are going well.\" Now that we've returned to guidance, I don't want to keep talking about bookings. But I have said this on this call that we've been having record bookings as we've gone through each of these quarters in COVID. Last quarter, wouldn't have been any different and our expectations for this quarter for bookings that we're entering in wouldn't be any different than that. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald from Needham. Your line is open. Ryan MacDonald : Good evening gentlemen, thanks for taking my questions. Chad first one for you. When you look at the new client wins that you've had in these strong bookings what sense do you have of the capacity that these clients are starting with on the initial land in terms of total employees? I'm sure it's a bit different for each client but trying to get a sense of what the potential uplift could be once we're starting to see these new clients start hiring again. Chad Richison : Yeah. I don't have a good feel for that. I mean, I look at a client that onboards with us with 500 employees as 500 employees. Will they grow to 1,000? Maybe. Could they be $200 million next year based on other factors that may not even be COVID-related? Maybe. And so as we go and we add clients we don't try to get that myopic and what the future could bring because that's not controllable by us. And so what is controllable is the number of new clients we add onto our platform. That's completely controllable by us. We only have 5% of the market. What's controllable by us is continuing to expand our value proposition, and therefore, the return on investments for clients. And then also what's controllable for us is the world-class service that we provide in an effort to keep all of our clients that we're currently servicing choosing Paycom. And so that's what we're focused on getting more. Hopefully we're selling some clients that are in industries that are growing, but that's not how we're going to market right now. Ryan MacDonald : Got it. And Craig just a follow-up for you. It looks like free cash flow was quite strong in the quarter not only from a margin perspective, but also conversion rate from even better free cash flow compared to last few quarters here. What drove the strong performance there if anything that you'd call out? And how sustainable is this from a margin perspective as we look ahead to fourth quarter and next year? Thanks. Craig Boelte : Yeah. So we had a very strong operating cash flow for the quarter as well as free cash flow. Obviously some of that's timing on some of those accruals. We did have a little benefit from a tax rate for some items that were specific to the quarter. But overall, we felt like it was a good quarter in terms of operating cash and on free cash flow. Our CapEx was fairly similar to where it was last quarter. So I'm excited about both of those. Ryan MacDonald : Great. Thanks. Operator : Due to time constraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to two questions. And your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question. I just want to dig in to the your commentary on that rapidly investing on the new product and technology. So Chad you talked about two product like DDX and Manager Go, which basically increase your stickiness and maybe ROI for your customer. But during this pandemic, have you come across any kind of customer need or requirement that could potentially then drive new revenue opportunity cross-selling into your base like on-demand pay or any of that kind of product? Chad Richison : Sure. Well we've seen significant usage patterns be deployed around learning management. We recently upgraded and released our enhanced background checks product into the market, which has actually allowed us to eliminate some partnerships that we had on the back end and we've seen that impact go out there. But again Manager on-the-Go I would say -- well DDX last year and then Manager on-the-Go being so significant this year has allowed managers to really improve the data flow and the timeliness of it. It's been no surprise for anyone that we are trying to automate this industry because it needs to be automated. It's complex. It's high risk low reward. If you get it right who cares. You're supposed to get people their benefits. You're supposed to onboard them. You're supposed to get them their checks correctly. So nobody really cares if you get it right. And if you get it wrong there are significant penalties. And so the more you can automate these products, the bigger win for the business. And so that's what we've been focused on throughout this. And each product has a plan, and as we work out those plans we continue to enhance each one of the usage patterns for each of those products. And so we've been doing that through the pandemic across the board on all of our products whether it's performance, whether it's onboarding, whether it's learning management, background checks. You've mentioned a couple of products that we've added. And so we'll continue to do that. And we also look forward into the many product initiatives that we'll be rolling out here into the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi, guys good afternoon. Thank you. I want to follow-up on demand. So it sounds like you've had good success across each sub-segment of the market. Can you dig in around your ability to serve the larger clients? We get some questions around enterprise client ceiling. So any metrics you can share on the scale of the largest clients or any details to better gauge your ability to serve that top end? Chad Richison : Well I mean we're serving clients that triple our stated range. If you're talking about that from the top end we have a direct focus on clients that we prospect. And the primary reason for that is we do believe that the way they make a decision fits with the way that we sell. Our salespeople at Paycom sell every week and so we definitely choose those prospects. We continue to be pulled up-market as business is realized. It doesn't have to be as difficult, as they've made it in many cases. And so there's usually more decision-makers, the further up market you go, but you're also typically dealing with more product, but less functionality that they've deployed. Oftentimes, you run into somebody that has a 15,000- 30,000-employee company. They deploy technology. They've spent $2 million on it and it can do three things. It's not really a strategy. So I do see us over time continuing to be pulled up market, because I do think we're a better fit for businesses that just don't want to work that much on just software. It was a necessity 15 years ago. I might even say, it was a necessity seven years ago. It's just not necessary right now. So I see us continuing to have success up market as well. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then on sales and marketing, I think it was slightly lower than you had projected there. Is that just a function of greater efficiency on the spend, you were making? Any color on the better variance there versus outlook. And the learning you can share about sales and marketing targeting and efficiency in this environment? Craig Boelte : I would say on the sales and marketing, some of that was more timing. Slightly lower third quarter and then fourth quarter, we called out what our fourth quarter spend is. But we're going to make sure that what we spend in marketing \u2013 that it's efficient and that we're getting the return that we expect with that as well. Chad Richison : Yeah. We account for every dollar in marketing. So, I mean, if we're spending an advertising dollar we need to get that back. So \u2013 and thus far that's what's been happening. Bryan Bergin : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Arvind Ramnani : Hey. Thanks for taking my question. One of the things you mentioned was the continued progress, you're seeing winning from traditional players. Are you seeing any of these traditional players enhance the technology to become more competitive? Or are you still able to keep the distance from them? Chad Richison : Yeah. So, I mean, I've never thought that our competitors have been asleep at the wheel. It's been a very competitive industry for a long time. I think that you've seen us \u2013 well, we have for sure delivered a different value proposition in the beginning. It was \u2013 I don't know anybody that beat us to the Internet, and I don't know anybody that beat ADP to second. Then you look at the single database solution that we had built out. That was different than what our competitors were doing, which is primarily a sell best-in-breed, buy best-in-breed and integrate. And now we've shifted to an employee strategy, in which you have to be online, and you really have to have a single database. Employees don't want to use multiple systems. And so we continue to differentiate our product by the ROI that's delivered to the client. If you want to receive the ROI on a software investment similar to Paycom, I mean, you're going to have to use Paycom. We're not going to beat our competitors at being them and they're not going to beat us at being us. And so we're going to continue to widen the competitive moat as it revolves around usage and we're going to continue to automate even more and more as we move on. Arvind Ramnani : Great. In the past you have shared a metric on aggregate cost savings by using your DDX. And are you able to share kind of a similar stat in terms of like aggregate savings from your clients using DDX? Chad Richison : Well, so DDX, what DDX does it actually measures the savings each time an employee makes a change in the system versus if HR makes the change for them. The thought is, is that any change that an HR department makes \u2013 HR payroll, benefit department hiring department, any change they make for that employee and/or applicant in their system is duplicative. They did not read that applicant's mind. They did not read that employee's mind. And so that employee and/or applicant could have made that change themselves, if they had had easy-to-use technology, because that employee is making all changes themselves everywhere else in their daily lives. Why not leverage that at work for the business? And so what the DDX does is it adds that up. And if a client \u2013 it wouldn't be uncommon for many of our midsize clients to make 100,000 changes in a month. And if 2,000 of those changes are made by the HR department instead of the employees that's a company that has a 98 DDX, 98% DDX rating, but they made 2,000 changes. HR made 2,000 changes in the database. So I mean, it's going to cost them $90,000 in hard/soft cost savings that they left on the table because they did the work themselves. And so that's a calculation that was put together by Ernst & Young. I believe, when it first came out it was $4.39. It was updated earlier this year for $4.51. And as we move into next year, I'm sure it will be updated at some point again. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Josh Beck from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Josh Beck : Thanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the return on sales and marketing spend. It seems quite favorable when I hear your commentary about new bookings and market share gains. So really as you look into next year and if we remain in this work-from-home environment, is that an area that you want to continue to lean into? I just would like to hear your framework and how you would evaluate that investment as we go into next year? Chad Richison : Yes for sure. We'll continue to lean into it. I mean we're having success. There have been times throughout the quarter that we realized that we can spend more but we're not necessarily going to get more. I mean, sometimes you can spend double and it only goes up 5% on \u2013 in different advertising. As you go through this we've become smart on this. And really how we've done that is by measuring every dollar that we're spending. Obviously, we had more powder in the keg this quarter. And if we had thought emptying that out would have brought us more leads then we would have 100% of done that. I'm not interested in training, a percent of adjusted EBITDA for a percent of growth. I just \u2013 we're just not going to train 8% of adjusted EBITDA for a percent of nothing. So we've been focused on it. Leads still remain at record levels, sales remain at record levels and new client sales are remaining at record levels right now. So having a lot of success and looking forward to next year and fourth quarter. Josh Beck : Good to hear. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : This brings us to the end of our question-and-answer session. Mr. Chad Richison I turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today and to all the Paycom employees for their continued commitment and execution. Over the next couple of months, we'll be at several virtual conferences this quarter including Stifel, RBC, Needham, Credit Suisse, as well as Barclays. We look forward to speaking with many of you again soon and appreciate your continued interest in Paycom. Thanks, operator. You may disconnect. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today James Samford, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. James Samford : Thank you, and welcome to Paycom\u2019s fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call.

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. A special thank you to all of our employees for an outstanding quarter to finish the year. I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter 2020 results. Then I will review some of our notable achievements in 2020, and also discuss our goals for 2021. Following that Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. 2020 was a strong year for Paycom. We innovated our sales processes and accelerated our new business sales during the global pandemic. These accomplishments have set the stage for a year of rapid growth that we believe will propel Paycom to reach $1 billion in revenues in 2021. The digital transformation of the human capital management industry has reached a critical stage where the accepted practice of HR and payroll personnel inputting data for employees has come to an end. The industry trend toward self-service has been leading to this point, and I believe the pandemic effectively sealed the fate of the old model. Businesses must shift to provide employees direct access to the database, because it\u2019s better for the business and the employees. The coming extinction of the old model has been our expectation for many years, and I\u2019m very excited to see it happening. Our differentiated solution positions Paycom very well to accelerate this trend and deliver long-term sustainable growth. We finished the year with strong results. Our 2020 fourth quarter revenue of $221 million came in very strong, thanks to elevated new business starts in the quarter. Our full year 2020 revenue of $841 million grew 14%, compared to 2019. Paycom maintained an annual revenue retention rate of 93% even with the pandemic causing some businesses to close and a reduction in employee headcount related revenue at existing clients. Our full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $331 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 39%. Our focus on the sum of revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin has served us well in balancing both growth with profitability and in 2020, we exceeded our recently stated goal of hitting the Rule of 50. With Q1 of 2021 expected to be the last quarter that the pandemic impacts our numbers from a year-over-year perspective, I believe we have an opportunity to reach the Rule of 60 in 2021. Our marketing plan throughout 2020 worked very well, delivering strong demo leads throughout the year. In 2021, we plan to continue to spend aggressively on advertising to fuel future revenue growth and continue to expand a roughly 5% market share in a large and expanding HCM TAM. We are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems with the value proposition of Paycom\u2019s single database solution that is stronger than ever for companies of all sizes, including companies well above our stated targeted range. We continue to be pulled well above our stated target range as larger companies look to leverage automated processes for their own employees. At the same time, our small business adds continue to increase in 2020 thanks to the efforts of our expanded inside sales force. Growing employee usage of the Paycom system is generating a substantial return on investment for our clients, their employees and Paycom. High employee usage rates as measured by our Direct Data Exchange or DDX remained strong across our client base. When combined with high adoption of Manager on-the-Go, these applications are creating new opportunities for product innovation and automation. An example of such automation that we\u2019ve deployed internally is fully automated payroll. It has been our goal to provide our clients with a better employee transaction interface for payroll. BETI or B-E-T-I is that better employee transaction interface. BETI guides individuals through an employee specific payroll process in which they create and approve their own paycheck. This means payroll is completed at pay period end, which has traditionally been the date in which the payroll department gets started. What used to take an entire payroll team\u2019s days to aggregate is now fully automated and put directly into the employee\u2019s hands. This new approach leverages all of our solutions to produce what we call the perfect payroll and eliminates duplicative processes that can create confusion and inaccuracies when employees don\u2019t have visibility or control over their own payroll data. This level of employee control is the future payroll and I\u2019m looking forward to being able to roll BETI out to the market in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, our headcount stood at approximately 4,200 employees up 12% year-over-year, as we continued to hire high quality talent throughout the pandemic to further bolster the foundation of our future growth. While greater than 95% of our employees continue working remotely across the country, we look forward to returning to our offices at some point this year, but only when it\u2019s safe to do so. Paycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2020. We\u2019re in the top five ranking in Best Places to Work in the U.S. by Top Workplaces and the number one spot in Oklahoma, and we were named the Fortune 100 fastest growing companies for the fourth consecutive year. These awards are very rewarding and a testament to our execution in driving corporate culture. Additionally, I want to congratulate the 2020 Paycom Jim Thorpe Award Winner, Trevon Moehrig of Texas Christian University. This award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes Jim Thorpe, who is one of the greatest all around athletes in history. Jim Thorpe also happened to be an Oklahoman. To sum up, we addressed the 2020 challenges with confident result, which enabled our solutions to shine and expose the weaknesses of other disparate systems in the market. The pandemic\u2019s impact on our pre-pandemic client revenue remained stable. And while it\u2019s unclear, if or when those same clients will add to their employee counts, our continued growth relies on remaining focused on the three controllable activities that made 2020 so successful. That is providing world-class to our clients rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. Our commitment to investing through the pandemic generated elevated leads and sales. Once we get past Q1 2021, we will have lapped the pandemic\u2019s impact on our comparable year-over-year numbers. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and flexibility. As we said throughout 2020, the pandemic didn\u2019t build character, it revealed it. I was glad to see we were all who we thought we were. Your efforts have set us up great for 2021. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2020 and also our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. As Chad mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results with total revenues of $220.9 million, representing growth of roughly 14% over the comparable prior year period. Our full year 2020 revenue was $841.4 million, representing growth of 14% compared to 2019. Our revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by new business wins, including very strong new client revenue starts in the fourth quarter. We ended 2020 with approximately 31,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 17% compared to 2019. On a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with approximately 16,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 18% compared to 2019. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $216.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 14% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $188.9 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 85.5%, up 20 basis points compared to the prior year period. For the full year 2020, our adjusted gross margin was 85.9%, also up 20 basis points compared to full year 2019. For 2021, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $119.1 million for the fourth quarter as compared to $98.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $58.9 million or 26.7% of revenues. We have been very pleased with our marketing strategy throughout 2020, which more than doubled the demo lead request compared to 2019 and we plan to continue to invest in marketing in Q1 and throughout 2021. Adjusted R&D expense was $23.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 10.5% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs including the capitalized portion were $33.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $25.1 million in the prior year period. Adjusted total R&D costs for the full year 2020 including the capitalized portion were $118.3 million or 14.1% of total revenues compared to $93.3 million or 12.6% of total revenues in the prior year. Even through the pandemic, we aggressively recruited talent in R&D and we planned to continue to invest in our future growth through innovation and new product development. Adjusted EBITDA was $84.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 38.1% of total revenues compared to $78.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 or 40.6% of total revenues. For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $330.8 million or 39.3% of total revenues compared to $317.9 million or 43.1% of total revenues in 2019. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $24.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $45.4 million or $0.78 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 33.4%. For the full year 2020, our GAAP net income was $143.5 million or $2.46 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $49.1 million or $0.84 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares versus $50.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. We expect non-cash stock based compensation for the first quarter of 2021 to be approximately $26 million. For the full year we anticipate non-cash stock based compensation will be approximately $110 million. For 2021, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be 25% to 26% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 27% to 28%. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 58 million shares in the first quarter of 2021. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $152 million and total debt of $30.9 million related to the construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $52.9 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance in the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. During 2020 we repurchased approximately 433,000 shares for a total of roughly $115 million, including 244,000 shares purchased in the open market. Through December 31, 2020, Paycom has repurchased 4.1 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $423 million and we currently have $135 million remaining in our buyback program. Now let me turn to guidance. With the continued stabilization of our current client revenue base we are pleased to be able to provide Q1 and full-year guidance that is consistent with our historical guidance approach of guiding to what we can see as of today. As a reminder of the effect on our current client revenue of lower headcount at our pre-pandemic clients continues to represent a loss of approximately $1.9 million to $2 million in weekly recurring revenue. The impact of 150 basis point interest rate cut that occurred in March of 2020 represents an additional loss of roughly $350,000 in weekly recurring revenue. Also the first quarter benefits from form filing revenue related to employee tax forms for payroll\u2019s run in 2020. We estimate that in Q1 2021, there will be fewer forms filed than normally would have been filed by our client base as a result of fewer employees working in industries hardest hit by the pandemic and lower overall turnover in those industries. Fewer forms filed represents a roughly $6 million to $7 million headwind to Q1 2021 recurring revenue. With these factors in mind, our full-year and first quarter 2021 guidance is as follows. For the fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $1.009 billion to $1.011 billion or approximately 20% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $396 million to $398 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39.3% at the midpoint of the range. For the first quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $270 million to $272 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 12% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $126 million to $128 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 47% at the midpoint of the range. Q1 2021 is expected to be the last quarter that the pandemic will impact our year-over-year comparisons. After that our achievement should be more reflective of the strong fundamental growth our business can generate. With that we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great end to the year. You guys \u2013 I mean, as you mentioned, after Q1 the comps are getting significantly easier and you must be looking forward to that as well. How do you think about the linearity if you think about Q2, Q3, Q4? Is there \u2013 a lot of your comps have talked about like it\u2019s actually more the back half of the year, et cetera, like how do I have to think about that from your perspective? And then, I have one follow-up. Chad Richison : Sure, Raimo. So our approach to guidance hadn\u2019t changed as Craig said in prepared remarks. I mean, we\u2019re focused on what we can see. If you compare our Q2 through Q4 guidance that we\u2019ve given, implied guidance that we\u2019ve given for Q2, Q3, Q4 this year you\u2019ll notice that it\u2019s not unlike guidance we\u2019ve given in the past. Matter of fact, it\u2019s within a 0.5 point to 1.5 point of every guide we\u2019ve started with going all the way back to 2018 for that same period. So we\u2019re not going to necessarily get into the linearity of it, but I would just say that we always guide to what we can see and I believe that we are being consistent in how we provide this guide today. Craig Boelte : Yes, I agree with that Raimo. In terms of linearity, we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t have anything in the guidance related to recovery towards the back half. It would be more level throughout the year on that as opposed to any sort of back half a recovery that would be baked in. Raimo Lenschow : Yes. Okay. And then this year was like a \u2013 and on the full year where you had like the inside sales model working like what have you learned in terms of the pandemic, in terms of people kind of selling remotely, inside sales being successful. In terms of how you translate that maybe into kind of planning the expansion going forward? I know it\u2019s a very broad open question, but I hope that works. Chad Richison : Sure. So we had inside sales. We\u2019ve had it for a while, but we actually took a strategic position with inside sales toward the end of 2019, which really that group had always been selling online or virtually. We were able to leverage a lot of those processes that we had put in place for inside sales as we made the shift for our outside sales staff. As we sit here today, we are still 100% virtual selling right now as well as conversion, as well as up-sells to current clients. And so exactly what we would come back as far as when we do full selling on site that\u2019s really going to be dictated by the client. I do believe that we\u2019ve gained some efficiencies in this model and I\u2019m not just talking about cost, I\u2019m talking about performance. And I believe we would look to maintain those as we look to open back up as a nation here in the coming year. Operator : Your next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Chad, maybe first one for you, just as I think about bookings in the context of that customer data, it looks like Paycom added actually more customers in 2020 than it did in 2019. So it certainly kind of supports the strong bookings trends, but also maybe can you help us understand how the mix of those new customers add looked versus inside sales versus from the quota-carrying field sales that are now selling virtually versus maybe coming inbound online through some of your advertising campaigns? Just trying to think what drove that nice acceleration in units? Chad Richison : Yes. So coming into the year, I would have expected, really our \u2013 because we are selling low market, small business market as well, which we\u2019ve opened up. I mean, the percentage of small business units that we have, I mean, it\u2019s I believe mid-90s is the percent of our revenue, that\u2019s represented by clients that have over 50 employees. So you\u2019re still low on the small business, but in fact, we did accelerate that this year and I would have expected our average amount per client to drop a little bit based on that, what we actually saw is you\u2019re taking about 10% out, let\u2019s call it, just on client employees that you can already calculate through our revenue. So you\u2019ve already got that hit. And then the fact that we\u2019re selling small business clients, I was a little surprised to see that our average per client held very close to the same. It had been growing for the last several years, but even with the COVID hit, we took on our numbers that average stayed really close to the same and that came from us continuing to have success selling down market. But also we\u2019re having a lot of success continuing to sell up market and continue to be pulled further up. And so, those are starting to average each other out, but obviously, you do have some higher unit growth as you look at the down market opportunities. Samad Samana : Definitely helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up, the total full year headcount was up about 12%, I\u2019m curious how the quota-carrying reps growth looked in 2020? And how should we think about that embedded growth in quota-carrying headcount for 2021? Chad Richison : Yes, we don\u2019t break out that separate from overall. Obviously, we had talked about earlier in the year as we were going through the pandemic. We did recoil a little bit and kind of held-off on certain things, then once we kind of opened our eyes and saw what was going on, we started to accelerate that to get back to a normal level as we headed throughout the summer. And so, we have \u2013 the number of teams that we have fully staffed, that\u2019s at eight per team. And then, we look to add people to the extent that we have any turnover we would be looking to add people to replace those positions. So no real strong information to give you on exactly the number of quota-carrying employees we added for sales, but what I would say is that you did see us throughout 2020 expand our inside sales model quite a bit. And so, that was a new focus that we had not really had until late 2019. Operator : Your next question comes from Yao Chew from Credit Suisse. Yao Chew : Hi, thank you for taking my question. You guys had an amazing year, all things considered, retention, clients adds, everything. But in some of our work, we\u2019ve come across the general sentiment from shared donors that they\u2019re looking to do better and be more aggressive given the lessons and the pain that they\u2019ve seen over 2020. So the question I have is do you think 2021 gets tougher only because from a competitive viewpoint some of these donors may be renewing or doubling down on the efforts to prevent similar churn or losses that they saw? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, the \u2013 I believe that with our product, it\u2019s fully differentiated and it produces a return on investment for our clients as well as prospective clients. So I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to be getting into the situation where we\u2019re doing a lot of price selling. Now that said, there is a market for every product and so you have to be in line with what product fees are, but really it\u2019s an ROI-driven strategy. And so, we would expect people to take our product that want a differentiated strategy with a different ROI, I mean, we just talked about how we\u2019re going to be providing \u2013 our products are going to be doing full service payroll in the future. I mean, employees are going to be doing their own payroll and we\u2019re starting with that right now internally, we\u2019ve produced a better employee transaction interface through BETI and we\u2019re going to be rolling that out throughout the year. And so, just as employees are used to applying for jobs online, they\u2019re used to doing their banking online, they\u2019re used to doing their shopping online, we\u2019re going to be bringing that to the payroll business. I mean, it just doesn\u2019t make sense that we\u2019re not already there to be quite honest with you, it\u2019s how businesses win. And when you think about the hours of businesses saved, I mean, why can\u2019t employers save more on these types of input activity? So I mean, if you\u2019re with Paycom, you could save 100,000 different keystrokes, some of our clients save millions of keystrokes every month. So that\u2019s where it\u2019s going. I don\u2019t see the market moving away from that. So all that\u2019s to say is I believe in order for people to compete with us, with the value proposition, it\u2019s have to going to be more \u2013 it\u2019s going to have to more match the value proposition that we\u2019re delivering because over time you\u2019re going to be seeing more and more differentiation around what the employees do as it relates to data transfer versus what the employer does as it relates to the same topic. Yao Chew : Thank you, very clear. And I just have a quick follow-up. Can you broadly speak to staffing levels of new business wins at this point in time? I\u2019m just curious as we\u2019ve worked our way through this, are new guys coming onboard at 25%, 50%, 75% capacity, is it getting better? Just broad-strokes is fine. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, I will tell you that past May, we stopped trying to figure that out. I mean, we\u2019re out there, we\u2019re bringing on business they have what they have. If there is growth in that number, great, we\u2019re not expecting it. We haven\u2019t been forecasting it up to now. I don\u2019t really know what happens next year, but for us, once we\u2019ve lapped this first quarter, we don\u2019t really need the growth in the numbers now, that\u2019s not to be flippant about it obviously I would love for our clients and everybody to get back to normal. I guess, what I would say is, we\u2019re very much focused on new business adds. And however many employees they have at that time is really irrelevant to us. We want to set them up correctly and we need a certain number of new business adds to cover the losses that we experienced from a current client employee headcount attrition. We need a certain amount of revenue and new clients to cover that and we\u2019ve been well on our way to doing that, as I believe is reflected in both our numbers and guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Mark Marcon : Hi. Good afternoon. And let me add my congratulations to the whole team. Can you talk a little bit more about being pulled up market in terms of what you\u2019re seeing? What are the characteristics of the bigger than target market clients that are coming to you, what exactly are they looking for? Who are they typically coming from? And do you see that accelerating, are you seeing more RFPs in the large account side? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, we continue to see it. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a whole lot different than it\u2019s been in the past, but we\u2019ve continued to see acceleration of larger clients above our range coming to us. In fact, two years ago, we moved our range from 2,500 up to 5,000. We continue to see clients well above the 5,000 range coming to us. I mean, the reason why is because they\u2019re working with the same employee. Whether you\u2019re an employee and you work for a 25,000-employee company or whether you\u2019re an employee and you work for a 500-employee company, you really dislike manual processes that really become time suckers out of your day. And so, all employees would prefer to use something that\u2019s extremely easy to use, comprehensive and has quite a bit of consistency and that\u2019s also better for the employer. And so, I think that large businesses on the enterprise \u2013 in the enterprise level have been trying very hard for a long time to provide a single type solution to their employees because they do realize the importance of that, they\u2019ve just done it through integration and we do have a product that works for what they\u2019re trying to accomplish, that\u2019s incredibly scalable. And so, I do see us continuing to go up market as we\u2019re pulled and I see us continuing to stay focused on the mid-market and then, as we get leads below 50, we\u2019ll continue to sell them as well. But regardless of what the size of company you work for, you\u2019re still the same in person and you\u2019re still the same employee and you value things of ease when it comes to task management and HCM. So all that\u2019s to say is enterprise products are over complicating the situation for the employee, and a lot of you guys on the call, you know that, you work for companies with large organizations and you know what kind of a mess you have to work with in technology. It\u2019s often times an eight-legged octopus with no head. So we\u2019re fixing that problem in mid-market and I see us doing the same as we continue to be pulled up market. Mark Marcon : Great. And can you talk a little bit about attach rates for new modules with the new clients, what are you seeing the strongest attach rates? And then, also to the extent that you\u2019re up selling existing clients, what are you seeing the strongest success on? Chad Richison : Yes, we are having strong attach rates across the board. I think that the new innovations that we\u2019ve come out with both DDX and Manager on-the-Go is really helping. With that, as we look to go to a full service payroll set, you\u2019re going to need all products. I mean you\u2019re going to need benefits administration. You\u2019re going to need expense management. You\u2019re going to need time and attendance. You\u2019re going to need paid time off requests. You\u2019re going to obviously need payroll. And so the more full solution sets were able to deploy, the stronger value proposition or higher the ROI the clients is going to be able to achieve. Again, it\u2019s not purchasing the products that produces the ROI, it\u2019s using the products that produces the ROI. And as we move to more self service initiatives, which we\u2019re already there, we\u2019re going to be measuring that for a client, which we believe drives greater overall usage of the entire product. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Jester from Citi. Daniel Jester : Great, thanks for taking my question. Just on retention looking backwards in 2020, can you just comment kind of how the year progressed? Did you see the largest churn sort of in the depth of the challenges in the spring or is because the customer churn pretty stable as the year progressed? Chad Richison : Daniel Jester : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then maybe one for Craig, in 2020 revenue was up 14%, but the cash from operations was up only 1%. So as I think about sort of cash flow in 2021, can you help us think about how that could look relative to your guidance? Craig Boelte : Yes, in terms of cash flow, the things that are going to impact our cash flow obviously are tax rates as well as our CapEx. And so I would expect our CapEx for 2021 as a percent of revenue to be fairly similar as a percent of revenue as what we saw in 2020. One thing to kind of keep in mind is that CapEx, we\u2019re still completing the Dallas operations. And so that will be complete probably end of Q2, we may still have some carryover costs on that on Q3. So as you\u2019re kind of looking at CapEx, that would be the impact for 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer. Brian Schwartz : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Craig. I just had a follow-up question for you, you mentioned a comment that you\u2019re anticipating some sort of recovery in the second half of the year. Is it possible just to provide a little more color on how you\u2019re thinking about that? Are you thinking that it could be a full recovery in the base exiting the year or a partial recovery? Just wondering if you could share little more color on that comment how you\u2019re thinking about the pace of the recovery? A - Craig Boelte : No, Brian. I indicated that we had not baked in any recovery in our guidance numbers. We\u2019re -- as we provide guidance for the full year, we have not included a recovery in those numbers. Brian Schwartz : A - Craig Boelte : Yes, we had -- in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve talked about $6 million to $7 million that it will impact our Q1 numbers we feel like. Obviously that\u2019s an estimate based on the number of W-2s we would have expected to file. There would be W-2s, 1099s, 1095s for our clients and kind of what would have expected in a normal year and then what we will file this year based on the fact that certain industries didn\u2019t have the -- obviously didn\u2019t have the headcount in the middle of the year or the turnover of those employees that would have generated a W-2. Chad Richison : Yes, for example on that, Brian, it wouldn\u2019t be uncommon for a 250 employee restaurant to have 500 W-2s. Now it\u2019s important to also note that our forms business isn\u2019t just W-2, its W-3 submittals, its 1099s. It also includes in our case ACA forms that we\u2019re also fee related and charged for in the first quarter. And so there\u2019s more in there than just W-2s. But the short answer is those industries most impacted oftentimes would have higher turnover rates. And so again, it wouldn\u2019t be uncommon for a restaurant that might have 250 employees. You could see 450 or 500 W-2s on that in a full year. And in this type of year for someone that may have had 250 employees may have only see 275 W-2s, because of kind of when it happened and then we lack some growth on that. And so that\u2019s how it\u2019s calculated and expectation of what normally happens with our W-2s as it corresponds to the business that we have in their number of employees and then what didn\u2019t happen this year in regards to that. So again that\u2019s a first quarter impact only that we\u2019re talking about. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Simmons from RBC Capital Markets. Robert Simmons : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was hoping if you could speak to what you\u2019re assuming in your guidance for retention rates this year? A - Chad Richison : We don\u2019t guide to what we assume for retention. I can tell you that we\u2019re very bullish on our product and the return on investment that it uses. We\u2019re also bullish on watching how clients used the product and how they\u2019re actually achieving that. And we do believe that does impact retention in a positive way. And so I would say that we are bullish as we look toward retention this year, but that\u2019s not something we guide to as we sit here today. Robert Simmons : Chad Richison : I\u2019m not going to comment on what our different competitors do out there. I would say our situations different than theirs. I think our opportunities of what we\u2019re achieving is also been shown to be a little bit different. So I wouldn\u2019t want to use them as a proxy for what\u2019s going to happen to us and I\u2019m sure, well, I mean they may want to use us for a proxy, what happens to them, but I don\u2019t think we want to go there right now. A - Craig Boelte : And I would say we really had a strong Q4 and we felt like it was a good Q4 and really sets us up well for 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan MacDonald from Needham. Ryan MacDonald : Yes, good evening, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. Chad, first question for you, would be curious to hear more about the BETI offering and sort of what stage you\u2019re at in terms of the rollout there? Are you starting to beta that with existing customers? And then naturally, I would think that given the usage component of that or self usage component that from employee that it might fit more naturally as a cross-sell or up-sell, which is a bit different, than obviously that traditional really focused on hunting model that Paycom has really mastered. Can you talk about sort of the puts and takes there? Thanks. Chad Richison : Sure. Throughout the year, we\u2019ll be rolling BETI out and at some point it will be not only an up-sell to current clients, it will be what we sell as we go-to-market that will be the way to do payroll. We came out with employee self service in 2002. It was free and I couldn\u2019t even hardly get anybody to look at the product for two years. Matter of fact, wouldn\u2019t even tell we can develop time and attendance online that people started using employee self-service to clock in at time and attendance. And so as we look at this today, I do believe BETI is kind of the cherry on the top of the payroll cake. Even internally here we\u2019ve returned over 80% of our hours back to our own payroll department just because of the way we do things now. BETI has you doing the payroll throughout versus waiting to pay period end. So what does that do? Well, it makes it a lot more efficient for every employee as well as there is a lot of work now on the payroll side, they\u2019re just not doing. And then you think of all the after the fact corrections, manuals, voids, things that were missed basically that becomes a liability and exposure to the business, which is all going away. And so this is going to happen just as nobody gets up from their chair and goes and changes to their channel on their TV and we can all remember the days those -- that happened, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen here. Employees are going to do their own payroll and they\u2019re going to do their own payroll, because that\u2019s the easiest way for them to do it and they\u2019re going to do their own payroll because that\u2019s how business wins. And matter of fact, that\u2019s the only way business can win a payroll. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re driving at answer to your question, we\u2019re using it internally right now. I would expect in second quarter, we\u2019ll have our first clients on it. And then third and fourth quarter, I would see us really starting to roll it out as we move those usage patterns and really move the way people start thinking about payroll instead of starting payroll when the period ends, you start it when it begins and the payroll\u2019s over when pay period ends. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re driving at. I believe it\u2019s the most significant product that we\u2019ve ever developed at Paycom to be quite honest with you, because it fully automates a very complicated task that there is little to zero room actually for inaccuracies. Payroll has got to be perfect. If you\u2019re 99.99% accurate in payroll, you get an F, employees expect it to be perfect, they expect it to be in their bank account and they\u2019re not even really going to thank you for it, it\u2019s an expectation for the work they\u2019re doing. And so we\u2019re going to make sure that happens and we\u2019re going to put that responsibility as well as confirmation ability in the hands of the employees, which is where it\u2019s already at right now. Nobody other than an employee themselves knows if they got paid everything that they should have been paid. And it\u2019s best to have them confirm that and be a part of that transaction. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do and I would see us rolling this out throughout the year. As far as when to -- when does it become popular, when does it become a thing? I know, like I said, it took us a while to get people to use employee self-service when we first came out with it, I don\u2019t think this is going to take as long as that because we\u2019ve been really focused on the usage patterns that drives us toward this and we\u2019re real close to be in there now. So you\u2019re going to have those early adopters, then you\u2019re going to have the middle group and then we\u2019ll have everybody else after that. And we\u2019ll just kind of have to see how long that takes, but very excited about it and this will be a product that we\u2019re charging for. Ryan MacDonald : Excellent, that\u2019s really helpful. As a follow-up, as you think about adding to sales capacity into the new year, you talked about the 95% of your employees are still working remote, does this change in how effective you\u2019ve been, changed the way you\u2019re thinking about the traditional expansion model of opening a sales office in various regions or cities? Are there areas where you can continue to expand with a virtual model and say, smaller Tier 2, Tier 3 cities as you look into 2021? Chad Richison : Yes, no, it hasn\u2019t changed my thoughts yet. Now the go-to-market could be a little bit different, what you\u2019re talking about there is territory division and where we place an office and then how we work together. So do I see Paycom individuals working together in an office setting moving forward? Absolutely. Do I know exactly when that would be or what that might look like as we gear back up to maybe be able to visit a client back in their office? I don\u2019t know exactly how that looks right now, but I am extremely confident that our employees will be back in their offices only when it\u2019s safe to do so and we\u2019ll continue the mission that we\u2019ve set for today. Operator : Your next question comes from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Michael Berg : Hey, this is Michael Berg on for Siti. Congrats again on a great quarter and thanks for taking my question. I want to quickly follow-up on the BETI offering. What type of pricing uplift that would be to the core payroll you offer now? Chad Richison : Yes, we\u2019re not going to disclose pricing right now on this call, but I mean, eventually, it would be published and you guys would be able to figure that out, but it\u2019s important first, we go through that with our own salespeople individually and our own teams internally. But again, it will be a price that \u2013 it will be something that we\u2019re charging for, because it produces an incredible amount of return on investment. And in order to use BETI, we had to do everything else right. It\u2019s not like you can do everything else wrong and use BETI. If you\u2019re going to use BETI, you have 100% DDX score, you \u2013 all of your managers are using Manager on-the-Go correctly and BETI has completely automated your entire payroll process. I mean, it\u2019s almost the means to the end, if you will, BETI, as we roll it out. But it will be a product that we\u2019re charging for because it does create great value. Michael Berg : Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, it seems like you guys are making some pretty significant progress on the below 50 segment and you mentioned it\u2019s less than 10% of revenues. How can we think about that a year ago, was that same type of percentage or less than 5%? How can we think about how that\u2019s progressed? Chad Richison : Very similar. I believe at IPO it was 6%. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed dramatically from year-to-year, I think we\u2019re real close to where we\u2019ve been in the past on that. Now, we have added small business teams, but we really just started adding them in earnest in 2019 and I \u2013 and even though they\u2019ve had a lot of success in 2020, we didn\u2019t really even see an incredible drag on our per client fee even with losses of certain employees at different clients and with selling small business. Now do you believe it would had more growth in that client revenue number had we not been selling as many small businesses. But I don\u2019t really think the percentage is going to move drastically from where it\u2019s at today just because of all the success we\u2019re also having upmarket. Operator : Your next question comes from Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hey, good afternoon and thank you. Wanted to clarify around bookings, did you see a notable acceleration in 4Q demand versus 3Q? Just curious if there was any indication at all of expansions of sales cycles as COVID cases spiked in December. And then, how have you seen the pace of demand progress in January? Chad Richison : Yes, I can\u2019t really say that spikes in COVID cases had impacted our sales from week-to-week. Now, we did see again the spike had impacted us in that March, April and May time period where things got really bad and then kind of started to stabilize. But throughout the year, different spike in cases didn\u2019t impact our ability to sell and move product. Now that we\u2019ve returned to guidance, I believe that our strong sales bookings are included in our guidance as well as our performance. So I\u2019m not going to keep talking about bookings but what I would say is this, that when we got into March, and especially towards the end of March, I didn\u2019t have an expectation that 2020 would necessarily be a record for bookings and starts. It was. And as we turn into 2021, when you\u2019re looking at our guidance, and you\u2019re looking at the things that we had accomplished through the year, I believe we\u2019re going to need that also in 2021, which not \u2013 is not unlike any other year we\u2019ve had in the past where we\u2019ve always need record sales and as well as record starts to hit our numbers and accomplish our goal. So as we head into 2021, there is no difference in that. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then, on the competitive environment, any changes to call out as far as the source of new client additions? Chad Richison : No. Bryan Bergin : Thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Beck from KeyBanc. Josh Beck : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on some of your early comments, Chad, on digital transformation of HCM, hitting a critical point. So I\u2019m just curious, initially, obviously in the pandemic people were focused on things like collaboration and they were very heads down, but I\u2019m just curious, as we went through the year, did you see the conversation with clients change, their interest change in a meaningful way? And I\u2019m just curious if that was a big contributor to the pipeline or if there\u2019s other factors you\u2019d call out there? Chad Richison : Yes. I\u2019m pretty sure that both employees and HR departments as well as the C-suite alike agree that removing middle layers of a data transfer process is the most efficient way to do it. And I think throughout 2020, you saw frustrations rise on both the side of the people doing the input as well as on the side of the employees that lacked access or \u2013 and then, also you kind of had a rush to deploy products. I think 2021 was the year that people dusted off products that they really thought or they bought for a certain situation and then they really tried to use them in 2020 and maybe didn\u2019t work exactly like the brochure said. And so, I see this happening more and more, I think there is always been some reluctance to change. I\u2019ve always said, waking up and changing ACM \u2013 HCM companies, I don\u2019t think that some people look to do every day, it\u2019s kind of like waking up and going to the dentist. So \u2013 but I do think as we move through 2020, it became very obvious to people that you\u2019re either winning the game of HCM in your business or you\u2019re losing it and we\u2019ve identified the way that businesses win and I think more and more people accept that as what will be the future, and more and more people are motivated to get there now versus waiting too much longer to do that. And so we will continue to drive that so the businesses can have a clear ROI and a good choice for HCM. Josh Beck : Really helpful. And then on the gross margin guidance, you\u2019ve discussed the forms headwind in Q1, typically I think Q1 is a stronger gross margin period. So should we maybe make some adjustments to what would be a typical year, just anything you can share with us on the gross margin cadence throughout the year? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, I think if you looked at our \u2013 like I said before, I mean, ex-first quarter, we\u2019re still lapping COVID there. But once we get into the second through fourth quarter, our guide for growth and it\u2019s not at least on the growth side isn\u2019t incredibly dissimilar than what we\u2019ve done in 2020, 2019 and 2018 guidance. Again I think it\u2019s a 0.2% different than last year and it\u2019s maybe 1% different than 2018 and \u2013 or the 2019 and maybe 1.5% from 2018. So we feel really good about that. Our gross margins remained strong. And so as we continue to spend in both R&D and sales and marketing, certainly, you guys have seen our adds. We do believe that as we achieve success of that new business revenue coming in as well as success of usage of the products that we\u2019ve deployed, we do think that\u2019s going to be accretive to our margin profile into the future. And I\u2019m very happy with where we guided right now. We have set ourselves up well to achieve what we call Rule of 60. And so I feel really good about where we\u2019re at right now, but just like every year we enter into, there\u2019s a lot of work to be done between now and then. So I don\u2019t know, Craig, if you\u2019d add anything on the margin side? Craig Boelte : No, I mean on the gross margin we kind of gave the guide on for the full year at 95% to 96%. I mean, obviously, the first quarter is one of our largest gross margin quarter. So the $6 million to $7 million would have a slight impact first quarter, but we still think for the full year, we can finish in that 95% to 96% range. Operator : Your next question comes from Arvind Ramnani from Piper Sandler. Arvind Ramnani : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about your pipeline that was impacted by the pandemic. When those clients recover, and I think they will at some point demand for cloud-based HCM is likely to be very strong from that segment. And there will be probably like a pent-up demand from that particular segment. Is there anything specific you\u2019re doing to make sure that you win your fair share of the demand in terms of hiring sales or delivery teams to be there when the demand does come in? Chad Richison : Yes, we never stop selling those industries. I mean, my philosophy is if you\u2019re growing by 100 employees, well, it\u2019s a great time to add Paycom. If you\u2019re reducing force by 100 employees, well, it\u2019s a great time to add Paycom. So that\u2019s my opinion. We never retreated from trying to sell those organizations. We would look forward to them being able to come back fully. We\u2019re not there yet, but I do think at some point in time that will happen, I don\u2019t really know that it\u2019s a light switch that will go on, I think it will more happen over time that we start to see things like that happen. We\u2019ll have to see, haven\u2019t seen it yet. And then \u2013 but again we remain focused on all industries as we remain industry agnostic. Arvind Ramnani : Great. And just a quick follow-up on that. Operationally, there are probably some pretty good lessons that you learned over 2020. So are there any permanent changes or longer term changes you\u2019re looking to kind of put in place either in terms of sales or investment and sales offices or in terms of delivery teams, any kind of longer term changes in the operations of the business? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, there is a lot of changes that we\u2019re going to maintain, as we head through this. I mean, I would honestly say probably the only area in which we\u2019re kind of waiting to see what\u2019s going to be a more accepted practice is how we go to market in sales. We\u2019re not waiting on anything else. I mean, when it comes to how we develop software, when it comes to how we\u2019re servicing clients, when it comes to how we\u2019re having those meetings. As far as that process, the efficiencies we\u2019ve gain there, we\u2019d be looking to keep those efficiencies. We\u2019ve gained efficiencies in conversions and how we do conversions, we would be looking to maintain them. So I am not \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is a whole lot of things we\u2019re waiting to see what happens before we make decisions. There is a few of them we talked about those as far as the go-to-market. But on the back end of efficiencies that we\u2019re gained through this process, some of them are forced. We had to gain certain efficiencies to be even able to work at home. We even answer the phones at home. We had to gain certain efficiencies. And so there\u2019s a things that we\u2019re going to maintain as we come back to work from the office and most of those are already known to us. Craig Boelte : One thing I\u2019d say, we are continuing to look for efficiencies throughout the model. I think I had mentioned, I said 95% to 96% on the gross margin. I mean 85% to 86% is what we\u2019re guiding to for the full year on the gross margin, but we\u2019re continuing to look for efficiencies throughout the model and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Operator : And I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison for closing comments. Chad Richison : All right. I want to thank everyone for joining us today on the call and our special thanks to all the employees at Paycom for their flexibility and their perseverance through 2020. Over the next couple of months, we\u2019ll be at several conferences this quarter, including the KeyBanc Emerging Technology Summit on February 24; and Craig and James will be hosting one-on-one meetings at the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom Conference on March 3. We look forward to speaking with many of you again very soon and appreciate your continued interest in Paycom. Thank you, operator. You may disconnect. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our First Quarter of 2021 results. Then I'll review the progress we're making on our goals for 2021. Following that Greg will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. But first I want to thank my colleague and good brand Jeff York, for his many years of service leading our sales organization. Over the last 14 years, Jeff has built a sustainable sales organization with a deep bench of like-minded professionals. I look forward to continuing to work with him in his strategic leadership role. One of those like-minded individuals is our new Chief Sales Officer, Holly Faurot. Holly is a true success story at Paycom. Her 14 year career with us began with an internship in the sales organization. Ali quickly progressed into a top sales rep, a top sales manager and a top regional sales manager, earning many of the company's highest sales ranking awards along the way. In 2016, she was asked to further expand pay comms client relations department, which presents additional products to clients and focuses on creating value by increasing employee usage. Holly has been instrumental in contributing to the success of pay comp across the entire sales organization, and I'm confident she will continue to build on the momentum we are seeing. We delivered strong first quarter results, even with a tough pre COVID year over year comparison, our 2021 first quarter revenue of $272.2 million grew 12.3% compared to the prior year period and came in above the top end of our guidance range. Despite several previously identified headwind unsurprisingly, the first quarter revenue was impacted by lower forms, filings and adjustments due to lower hiring trends in industries most impacted by the pandemic in 2020, excluding forms, filings and adjustments. Revenue are year over year recurring revenue growth accelerated again in Q1, as we go through 2021, we will have a cleaner comparison that will provide a true reflection of our revenue growth profile. Since the arrival of the pandemic turning to profitability. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA was 133 million representing adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.9% as reflected in our updated guidance, which Craig will discuss. We believe the combination of revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin makes us well positioned to exceed the rule of six feet in 2021. Our marketing plan continues to work very well. Delivering strong demo leads in the first quarter, we continue to see success from our advertising span and we intend to continue to spend aggressively to fuel future revenue growth and expand, or roughly 5% market share and a large and expanding HCM team. We are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems with the value proposition. The pay comes single database solution that is stronger than ever. Employees expect their HR software to be efficient and easy to use. In fact, in a recent survey, we commissioned with the third party employees express frustration with complex and disparate HR software. That lack the transparency and usability they've come to expect from consumer oriented technologies, pay comms, employee usage strategy and single database solutions. Squarely addresses these expectations. We had record high employee usage rates in Q1 as measured by our direct ad exchange or DDX. This is fueling new opportunities for product innovation and automation for products like Bette or better employee transaction interface for payroll, which we started rolling out to a select few clients during the quarter, Betty is already receiving high marks as it transforms the way payroll is done, I believe over the next 12 to 18 months that he will become the standard for how payroll should be done. Now that the first quarter is over. We have substantially left dependent mix impact on our comparable year. Over year numbers, new client additions are driving our growth in Q2 and beyond the negative revenue impact the pandemic had on our pre-payment client revenue remained stable while we haven't seen any material improvement in employment trends at those same clients, our forecast and future growth initiatives are not dependent on any improvement. Our strategy throughout the pandemic has remained unchanged. We will continue to focus on the three controllable activities of providing world-class service to our clients rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. We've done a great job and succeeded in these areas, which has kept us on track to achieve our growth initiatives. I'd like to thank our employees for their patience, flexibility, and grit over these last 14 months and summary. Now that we've left Q1 tough year over year comparison with the last pre COVID quarter, we expect that the strength of our growth profile will be reflected in our future results. The record new business revenue and record number of new clients added in 2020 combined with robust first quarter sales is bolstering our long-term revenue growth opportunity. As a reminder, we only have approximately 5% market share of a growing TAM. So we have a long runway ahead of us. Our strategy is working and our products have never been more relevant with that. I'll turn the call over to Craig for a view of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our first quarter of 2021 results in our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. As Chad mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results with total revenues of $272.2 million representing growth of roughly 12% over the comparable prior year period, which was primarily driven by new business wins, including very strong new client revenue starts in the first quarter within total revenues, recurring revenue was $267.8 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 12% from the comparable prior to your period as expected the effects of lower head count on our pre-pandemic clients and the impact of 150 basis point infrastructure that that occurred in March of 2020 remain relatively unchanged. In addition, as we discussed on our Q4 2020 earnings call your employees, working in industries hardest hit by the pandemic and lower overall turnover in those industries resulted in pure annual forms, filings and adjustments. It is difficult for us to estimate the exact amount that those trends impacted us, but we don't believe it was dramatically different from our expectations. Total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $236.9 million representing adjusted gross margin of 87% for 2021. Our target adjusted gross margin find is expected to remain strong at approximately 85 to 86% adjusted. Total administrative expenses were $119.8 million for the first quarter as compared to $108.4 million in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted sales, a marketing expense for the first quarter point 2021 was $59.3 million or 21.8% of revenues. We continue to be very pleased with our marketing strategy, but another quarter of very strong demo leads and we plan to continue to invest in marketing throughout the remainder of 2021 adjusted R&D expense was $23.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 8.5% of total revenue adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion for $34 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $27.6 million in the prior year period. We've been aggressively recruiting talent in R&D to drive our future growth through innovation and new product development adjusted EBITDA was $133 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 48.9% of total revenues compared to $117.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 or 48.7% of total revenues. We've benefited from cost efficiencies in G&A, which we expect to continue throughout the year. So we plan to continue to invest in the marketing and R&D. Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was $64.6 million or $1.11 per diluted share versus $63 million or $1.08 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately $58 million shares in both periods. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $85.9 million or $47 per diluted share versus $77.9 million or $33 per diluted share based on approximately $58 million shares in both, we expect non-cash stock based compensation for the second quarter of 2021, the approximately $27 million to $28 million for the full year. We anticipate non-cash stock based compensation will be approximately $105 million to $110 million turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $215.1 million and told that a $30.5 million related to construction at our corporate headquarters cash from operations was $89.5 million for the first quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. Average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients with approximately $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021, shifting to guidance we have now substantially last, the last pre COVID year over year comparison, and our guidance for strong second quarter revenue growth represents a career reflection of the strong performance we achieved throughout 2020. We're pleased to be able to provide the following Q2 and full year guidance for the second quarter of 2021.  We expect total revenues in the range of $231 million to $233 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period, approximately 28% at the mid-point of the range we expected just to tee that off for the second quarter in the range of $80 million to $82 million, representing an adjusted the, but on margin of approximately 35% at the mid-point of the range for fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range. The $1.017 billion to $1.019 billion up from $1.009 billion to $1.011 billion or approximately 21% year over year growth. At the mid-point of the range, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $400 million to $402 million representing an adjusted, but margin of approximately 39.4% at the mid-point of the reign to conclude our strategy to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and grow the business has been working. And we will continue to focus on providing world-class service chart, clients rapidly developing new technologies and increasing the number of new clients added to our platform. We have a strong balance sheet, a profitable recurring business model, and a long runway to deliver sustainable long-term revenue growth. With that, we will open the line for questions operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] your first question is from the line of I'm sorry if I mispronounce it Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, it it's very close. Thank you. He congrats on a great quarter and I'm sure you're looking forward to Q2. Chad, can you remind us because that's the question I get a lot from investors. How can the 12% growth in Q1 jump to like 28% in Q2? Because it comes, I can easily, like what's, what's maybe talk about the puts and takes that are driving it because that makes it really exciting. And then one for crack you mentioned it a cost efficiency efficiency in DNA. Can you just kind of elaborate a little bit on that one? Thank you. Chad Richison : Yeah. Thanks. Raimo. So I guess first, I would say, as you know, Q1 is typically one of our largest quarters for revenue in any given calendar year, and that's because of our annualized revenue billings of forms, filings and adjustments that come in throughout the year, which has to do with you know, hiring and turnover trends throughout the year at different businesses. Well, 2020 reacted differently than any other year since I've been doing this since 1998, in which the hiring trends were different. It wouldn't be a traditionally, you know, a restaurant that may have a hundred employees could easily do 300 W2's with forms filings. And what have you you know, they share that same restaurant may do 120 a W2. So we saw significant differences in hiring trends throughout 2020 than what we'd seen in the past. We did try to estimate what those would be. Also as a reminder, this Q1, we are still lapping Q1 of a previous year that did not have COVID in it which made for a tougher comps. And, you know, as we move through out second quarter we've substantially lapped the pandemic. Now you did still have a recurring revenue still getting worse throughout the month of April. As we had mentioned that it, got to its worst point beginning in may and then started this stabilized, but we are excited about our next quarter guide. You know, the guide that we're putting forth in Q2 of this year is the largest Q2 guide we've had since 2017 on a percentage basis for revenue growth. So, you know, you weren't you, you weren't necessarily wrong in your early take that you know, we're getting back on the right track or, you know, they're since civic alphabet, Arish, Tigan Sheena Mo as you might say, in your native language, Raimo Lenschow : That's very good. Yeah. Chad Richison : Miners paying off my German miners paying off Prego, I'll answer your second one in England. His last name is bulky you know, in terms of the[indiscernible] the cost effective, you know, efficiencies, we're seeing, you know you know, as we're looking to hire additional people, you know those are primarily to be in other areas of our income statement. So, you know, we're continuing to hire aggressively in the R&D area, and then the you know, in the sales and marketing as well as in the operations area. So you know, we're just not going to see the same level of hiring in the, in the, on the G and nylon is what we would see in other areas of the business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Good, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my questions. Chad, maybe the first one for you on the booking side, you know, as you mentioned, we're starting to kind of a lap last year and you guys had a great 2020 would you say that one was one Q 2020 from a bookings perspective? You know, it wasn't a record compared to other quarters, maybe just help us further triangulate on, on the, in quarter new bookings performance, and then just a follow up question as well? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, since obviously our bookings have been very strong. I mean, last year we did have a record bookings as well as we added a record. Well, that record new business revenues, as well as a record number of clients to our platform, which was an increase from prior years as we've returned to guidance, you know, we've gotten away from talking about bookings, obviously. Our bookings are very strong as what's reflected in our in our second quarter guide. Samad Samana : Understood. And then maybe on Betty's, you mentioned a couple of customers have a, that it's already been rolled out to them. Could you maybe help us understand how pricing for that's working and maybe how pervasive that use of that looks like at those customers? Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean, Betty's really an all or nothing type usage product. I mean, you do have to change your internal process in order to use Betty, because like we said, in the past, payrolls are traditionally started after pay period end and, and Betty contemplates all that happening at payroll beginning to where one's pay period ends, the payroll is done. And so we have had clients already submit using Betty and their employees are actually able to use Betty as a matter of fact, one within the first hour of release we had like 65% employee approvals. And by the time of submission, they were over 85%. So, you know, employees are already engaging in it. We're getting feedback from employees that, you know, this is the first time I've really looked at my check and, and much less understood it. So we're having a lot of positive there. We expect to put on you know, at least a hundred more clients in the next couple of months on Betty and then throughout the year we'll continue to convert all over. And what I mean by convert, it's not a conversion of data, it's more a conversion of, of their internal process and how you approach each payroll a little bit differently in our own environment. We've gone from over 55 clicks or processes within a payroll down to three each person's experience is going to be differently depending on you, you know, whether you're doing commissions, bonuses, labor, distribution, job costing. So it is a little bit different for each company, but it does drive a lot of efficiencies. And as those payroll administrators submit a payroll, you know, they have a very high degree of confidence in the accuracies that have already been approved by those employees. So it's going very well now, as far as billing Betty's, not Betty's not going to be billed unlike many of our other modules. It will be a per life per employee fee to use Betty. And then as we move throughout this year we'll continue to sell more and more clients on its value grant. And I apologize in advance for squeezing a third one in, but I'll break the rules here. Any other changes we should expect with, with Holly's appointment in her new role and any other changes to either the go to market motion or, or the sales organization that we should they should, we should anticipate in conjunction with that. Well, I mean, we, we change as a sales organization every year. You know, we changed about three or four years ago to really focus on employee usage as an organization. We focused on selling usage, we'd come out with the DDX. Then we came out with a manager on the go Nat. Now Betty. So obviously as we settle into this year, you know, there are some changes that we make to our selling motion, but that's not unlike what we've done in any given year. You know, Holly was you know, she was our first intern on the sales side. And actually she started interning for us when I was the sales manager. So Holly has a deep knowledge of what we've been doing this entire time. She's helped us build the depth to now. And the reason why Holly was chosen is it allows us to continue to increase the drive that we have throughout our sales organization with a consistent leader you know, with also a consistent talk track that we've been driving throughout the sales organization for the last 20 years. So I wouldn't see any significant changes happening to the sales other than what we always have, which is a improvements on our strategies as we deliver more value to the client. Samad Samana : Perfect. Thanks again for taking my questions. Thank you. Operator : Your next question from the line of Baird with [indiscernible] Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks very much. Chad, the upside in the quarter, wasn't as robust as we've come to expect with you guys. Was there any sort of one or two items in the quarter that maybe weren't as strong W2's maybe a bit below original expectations or anything along those lines? Chad Richison : Yeah, it's related to year-end services. I mean, our, you know, we have pretty good visibility quarter to quarter based off of our recurring revenue. And then, you know, what we believe we will be adding from a new client, a revenue perspective, you know, when you're looking at year-end, which as you guys have seen in the past are typically our largest step quarters because of those year-end service fees. You know, it gets harder to exactly you know, put an exact number on how those negative trends impacted us. We did a pretty good job of estimating that, but and we don't necessarily guide to have a certain level of B we guide to what we can see and oftentimes with new business revenue that can be impacted you know, one way or the other. And as it relates to first quarter though we've always been heavy on annual forms, filings adjustments. And, and so, and also to note that, you know, it's not just our W2 forms you know, with us, we also have ACA forms at the Everett at the end of every year as well. So I think we did a pretty good job estimating its impact. Obviously the fact that we continue to grow throughout the quarter and we'll coming out strong into Q2 reflects that we did have a strong adds throughout Q1 and coming out of Q4, but, you know, those, those numbers were impacted by our annual foams filing business. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from Milan [indiscernible]with Baird. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my questions. I'm wondering, you know, the commentary with regards to what you're seeing in terms of the number of employees within the client base. You mentioned it wasn't much of a help in terms of the first quarter, but as you look through the quarter and going into March and then April and now going into may, are you, are you starting to see a rebuild and how should we think about the sensitivity in terms of if there's a one in a 1% increase in terms of the number of employees, how does that translate to revenue? Broadly speaking? Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean, well, we'd like to think, you know, 1% equals 1%, but that 1% has to happen you know, across our client base that we serve, which is less than 5% of the total addressable market. And so you know, as in answer to your question, as far as those clients that were mostly impacted by the pandemic that we said really hit its worst for us in may, and then started to stabilize for us, we haven't seen any meaningful changes in those, in those same clients. So, you know, as we move forward, I don't know that that number becomes an important bellwether for us. As far as that you know, $1.85 million to $2 million impact that we see from the recurring revenue negative impact from those clients. So I don't know that it's a part of our story moving forward. Obviously we would hope that those clients are able to hire back and that they are able to come out of it in the same situation that they entered into it. But we'll have to say again, we're not seeing any we're not seeing any meaningful improvement in those, in those numbers. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. is that because of certain industries, Chad, or, I mean, when you take a look at the overall employment numbers broadly speaking, it's it does seem like, you know, sequentially on a seasonally adjusted basis. Things are improving broadly speaking, and we'll, we'll get the April report here in, in, in a few days. Is it just certain industries or what would be the reason why we wouldn't start seeing some of the national trends come down to, to the Paycom client base? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, our comments, weren't really a wholesale about you know the United States, as much as it is about these particular clients that work with us and you know, were working with us prior to the pandemic. They, you know, that we that, that they had to layoffs in different hiring trends throughout the year. You know, a lot of them may have been kept afloat with the PPP. That's been out there. And what have you, but we're not, we haven't seen any significant movement with that group. Like I said, I do believe that people took their hits early, as it related to many of our clients. They may not be as quick to add people back potentially some may have become a little bit more efficient and, you know there may be some out there that are you know struggling, but again, we've been focused on adding new business to our pipeline. So and focused on and focused on those. So all that's to say it's been stable with that group. And I don't know if or when the trends would impact that group because I believe it's going to be more of a client by client impact. Operator : You. Our next question is from the line of Daniel Jester with Citi. Daniel Jester : Pretty great. Yeah. Thanks for taking my question kind of along the same line, Chad, I mean, I think many would project that we're going to see some historic levels of hiring here in the U S in the next couple of quarters. So, you know, you've been through macro up cycles in the past, so maybe you can just remind us how does sort of the HR, either the buying cycle or sort of the sending intention, how does that evolve as we get into a really brisk hiring environment? Do you see HR officers trying to get ahead of that? Or is there a bit of paralysis because they're focused on in the business and maybe don't want to make a change on their payroll module when the outlook looks so bright? Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, we're in a business where we make those departments more efficient. And so to the fact that you need to go hire many people you know, using our on-boarding product, using our applicant tracking or talent acquisition product, or using our background checks products that we have out there. I mean, I think that we can aid people in that. So I also think you're really seeing a shift toward the employee user. You know, I don't know that four years ago you could even point to many employee users, especially in the mid market. And today that's really becoming the standard. And so I think there are a lot of business that are focused on leveraging employee usage trends of what they use in their daily lives, working with consumer products. I think there's a lot of businesses looking to leverage that, to create value for themselves. So as businesses come back and I'm not saying that we're not seeing positive hiring trends, my comments are related to those clients that represented the $1.85 million to $2 million weekly impact. We're not seeing those numbers moved dramatically. Are we seeing impacts of businesses starting to come back and, and hotels starting to hire more and in what have you, we're seeing some of that. And where we can see that is in our talent acquisition is more requisitions as our open AR is in our background check. So I do think things are getting better, but the question was more related to how are those clients that were impacted those clients that we said had that monthly negative rate, or excuse me, monthly, weekly negative revenue impact of $1.9 million to $2 million. I think about a quarter or so ago, we called that it may have improved to a hundred thousand a weekish? It kind of fluctuated week to week. And then now we've said you know, we haven't seen any substantial or meaningful change from that which would be accurate as we sit here today, but we are bullish about you know, employee trends beginning to get better for us. It's never something that we've been able to focus on you know layer hat on that or bet the farm on that. You know, you've got to really do the work and what we are doing. We are going out and we are selling businesses right now. And, you know, if they have 415 employees, then, then we're selling them at that and we're bringing them on now, maybe they grow, maybe they don't, but, but we've just been focused on adding new business into onto our platform and that's worked well for us. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you. And then just on Betty quickly you know, now that you've announced that, and you're starting to get some customers on it, are you seeing some of your other customers kind of get more with some of the modules that they need to be able to use that? So are you seeing more engagement on manager on the management of go, are you seeing more engagement on DDX as customers get ready to use Betty in the future? Chad Richison : Yeah, me and him, both manager on the go and DDX are at the highest level of usage, no matter how you measure it. So you know, and I'm talking about at the highest level of usage right now, and so that's been getting better and better as we've gone you know, throughout the, I'd say, I think we've had the DDX for the last 18, 19 months. We've had manager on the go now for well over a year. And so we continue to see those trends take up now, is that in the anticipation for bedding or is that because of the value someone's receiving by using those things independently, whether you're setting up for Betty or not? I would say it's, it's probably the latter but the fact that it's happening will set us up very well for Betty. And I do believe that as people look and see the value that Betty's going to deliver for both the business, as well as the employees, I think you're going to even have more usage around the DDX and manager on the go from a best practice perspective. Operator : You were next the question is from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Brian Schwartz : Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my questions this afternoon. Chad, one question for you and then a follow up for Craig for you. I'm a new business that was coming in the quarter. Can you share any color in regards to the linearity on how that business came in? Seemed like there was a possibly a different operating environment when we started in January versus kind of the end of the quarter. And then I have a follow-up for Craig. Chad Richison : Yeah, no, I wouldn't say there's been any meaningful difference in how we've brought in our revenue. The first quarter, this year, then how we had done then how we'd brought in revenue. In first quarter of subsequent years, you know, you're going to typically have your greatest number of starts you know, in the first part of that as people look to start fresh at the beginning of a year, of course, in first quarter, you're your quarter to date near due dates are the same. So anytime in the first quarters you know, not a bad time to convert and what have you, but now I wouldn't say that we'd seen trends meaningful meaningfully different than what we'd seen in the past, as far as when someone chooses to start in the quarter Brian Schwartz : Thanks for that. And then Craig one follow-up I just have on the guidance, maybe a underlying, the annual guidance. I remember last quarter when you reinstated the annual guidance, you know, you set a target out there for rule of six day and at that time that guidance had assumed no, a macro recovery and you know, raising your guidance here today, still targeting that rule of 60 for this year, but I'm just wondering if there's any change in terms of your view on that timing behind a macro recovery, or if it still assumes no big macro recovery this year? Craig Boelte : Thanks. Yeah. I mean, Our annual guidance still assumes no macro recovery at this time. So consistent with how we you know, got it last year as well. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Robert Simmons with RBC. Robert Simmons : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you talk to what you're seeing in terms of return to office and return to in person selling and also then what the expense and Margaret, the patients of that are or could be? Chad Richison : Yeah. So is that question as it relates to us or our clients from a return to office? Robert Simmons : Mostly for you, but, you know, whatever you're saying. Chad Richison : Yeah. You know, well, first I'd say it's very regional and you know, return to office strategies depending on where you're located for us internally we've, we've continued to be work from home. For most everybody we have put out a return to office plan for our employees beginning with the supervisors in certain leaders coming in June. We will then have the team leaders start to come back in, in July, and then we will start alternating in our general population throughout the month of August in hopes of being back to the office Full-Time in September. Now when you're talking about ourselves opportunities, as far as going to meet with clients, we're going to continue to meet clients where they live. You may have some clients that are wanting us to come in. You may have some parts of our sales process and our steps of certain cells that continue to stay in more of a hybrid model. And then I would see us going in person for others, but I wouldn't say that we're back at that level or anywhere close. Yet in fact, we don't have any sales person that's gone out and, and called on a purse, a business in person yet. So we're kind of waiting to see how that develops. I would say we're hopeful. But I think that's something that's going to just kind of happen you know, throughout these next couple of quarters. And we'll just kind of see what happens. You know, the expense related to a kind of return to, to office. You know, we wouldn't see that as significant increasing costs. No we're already maintaining the buildings and, and all of those things. So even on the travel side, we wouldn't see it as a significant uptake in any of that's been already baked into our guidance. Robert Simmons : Correct. Thank you very much. Operator : Your question is from the line of Ryan McDonald with the Needham and company. Josh: Josh in for Ryan. Just one question for me. If you look at platform usage pre-COVID versus today, do you think clients are deepening their understanding of productivity and how software can affect their workflows that previously, maybe they didn't understand in the same way versus managing their operations. And then do you think this results in a permanent shift of customers buying more models upfront as we exit the pandemic? Or could there be some reversion to pretend mimic trends? Chad Richison : I mean, it would be hard to think that we're going to go backwards in technology. It doesn't usually happen that way once you've you know, once you've made that jump. So I wouldn't think that we're going backwards right. Shift and customers buying more modules upfront as we exit the pandemic, or could there be some reversion to pretend them it trends. I mean, it would be hard to think that we're going to go backwards in technology. It doesn't usually happen that way once you've you know, once you've made that jump. So I wouldn't think that we're going backwards as far as your question about, you know, I do believe that the farther an employee of the way, maybe the more metrics you may have to look at you know, the harder an employee is to touch the more metrics you're left with that you really need to manage. And so I do think being able to engage with employees through technology makes it both easier for the employee, as well as for the business to kind of really share in the same transparency there. So I don't see us going backwards in regards to that, plus I really it's something that was happening anyway. I mean, it wasn't that the pandemic created these opportunities. I think the pandemic more sealed the fate of the old way. In fact, we were already seeing trends with employees that are used to using consumer-based technology to, you know, do banking get a plane ticket, order, a coffee, and then they came to work and it was 1992 through email. And what have you. So we were already seeing the trends of that usage happening. I think the pandemic just provided a stronger proof source for the reason for that. It probably accelerated that for some people that, that I don't see us going backwards in that because it was right before the pandemic and the pandemic just you know, produced another proof source for reasons why it's important to be employees to have a direct relationship with the database. Operator : Your our next question is from the line of [indiscernible] Penny Gray with Mizuho Ami Mehta : Yeah, it's actually Ami Mehta on [indiscernible] behalf. Congrats on the strong print. I've heard the questions about guidance that I'd want to phrase mine a little bit differently. It looks like the magnitude of the two Q guide and the magnitude of the annual year, the full year guide implies some, some strength in the back half of the year. I know you can only comment on what you see for sure right now, but I'd love to get your insight on how to disentangle the magnitude of the two Q guide and that of the annual guide anything you're seeing in the second half of the year specifically would be helpful. Chad Richison : Yeah, so we we've always guided to what we can say. You know, we have not changed that approach, as we'd said to Q2 is our highest guide that we've had since 2017, you know, as we sit here today, I really don't know deals that are starting in October. But I know as we moved about this quarter and especially as we move throughout you know, future into the future quarters that, you know, we'll, we'll see more and more revenue than that, that we're on-boarding. That's, that's what I would say as well as, you know what I mean, w you know, we, we look as we set up our guide, we got to what we can see and, you know for the back half, you know, we'll continue to take a look and data as appropriate Ami Mehta : And on the, the sales office side of it, I know there's been some commentary around or returned to the office. I'm curious about your plans for sales office openings this calendar year. Is there any light that could be shed there? Chad Richison : You know, it's still part of our strategy opening sales offices, and, you know, we're going to continue to do that as it, as it makes sense, as we talked about during the pandemic, you know, every office was substantially open because our people could really sell a prospect anywhere prior to the pandemic. You know, it was all in person. So if we needed to if we wanted to sell a deal in Las Vegas, we don't have an office in Las Vegas. We had to, we had to fly someone there and go there in person during the pandemic. We were able to do that virtually and so you know, as we shift back there will be offices that will be looking to open. And then, you know, we'll have to do it in the right time as well, because I'm not a hundred percent sure when we will be going to full in office selling again, if ever from that perspective, as it relates to the mid market.  I'm talking about where every appointment's in person. I mean, before, if we had five appointments with the prospect, every one of them were in person, I'm not a hundred percent sure that's going to be the case on a go-forward basis. And that's not something we're trying to force. That's something where we're going to meet the prospects, where, where they live in a way that produces you know, a successful communication for both for both us and the prospect. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : I thank you. I want to ask a question around clients, switching behaviors. So it wasn't common providers have talked about our retention benefits that that tends to be partly supported by a reluctance to switch here from the pandemic concern and some of the PTP reporting apartments. I just sales team see any of that behavior in the pipeline. And if you consider that an incremental opportunity if things normalize we'll? Chad Richison : Our retention is directly reflected with usage. In fact, someone gave me a retention report the other day, and I thought it was a usage report because the trends are almost the exact same you know, you watch, you watch your usage go up, you watch retention go up. And so that's really what we've been seeing as a, as a reflection of, of strong retention. It's about usage you know, are there out there that make it to where somebody is less likely to switch, I don't think so. I mean, you, you're going to become more efficient if you switched to us with a very strong value proposition, your employees are going to like it more and we're going to create even more value. So I don't really think waiting. It's a good opportunity to wait on that. So we've been focused on driving revenue prior to the pandemic. We've been focused driving it during the pandemic and, you know, once the pandemic ends, I mean, it's not my job to say when that happens. But once the pandemic's over, I would expect us to continue to have a strong sales, regardless of, of what's out there as far as trends one way or the other with software because of the efficiencies that we're driving and the dramatic difference in experience that a client is going to have using our product today than what they would have, you know, four or five years ago. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then just, Are you seeing any different behavior in what modules existing clients are attaching as, as the economies reopening here, we're seeing new clients take on more at the point of purchase? Chad Richison : The background checks are doing better than they've done in the past or than they did last year, because you're having a, you know, more people hire, you know, when I talk about hiring trends and improvement, I'm talking about those businesses that we had pre-pandemic that were hit. I'm not talking about all the new businesses that we've added since or businesses that weren't hit negatively by the pandemic last year. So I want to be able to separate the two of those when I'm talking about hiring trends, where we're not seeing improvement, I'm talking about those clients that were most impacted by the pandemic last year, and they're in the industries, you would think they would be in. But we still do see positive trends happening across the board with more people you know, doing background checks, doing on-boarding today more so than they were doing last year, but we're still not back you know, to where we were pre-pandemic. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Josh Beck with KeyBank. Josh Beck : Thank you for taking the question. Chad, you made a pretty specific comment about bevy becoming the standard for payroll and 12 to 18 months. So I'm just curious what you mean by that would love to hear a little more on that topic. Chad Richison : I think all of our clients will be using Betty within the next 12 to 18 months. Josh Beck : Okay that definitely clarifies it. What about with respect to marketing and advertising? How have you changed maybe the, the composition, the channels versus say pre pandemic? Is there any notable differences in how you want to invest across those areas? Chad Richison : Yeah. Well, I would just say we've gotten better at it. You know, you, as you continue to spend on it. And again, we measure this week after week, week over week based off the number of leads that we get. And so, you know, sometimes some weeks leads are generated in areas maybe a little bit stronger areas one week then than what we may see in the next week meaning that you may have more come in digitally one week and the next week could be delivered through what we're doing from a targeted marketing perspective where we already know who you are, we're targeting you. All of that's a part of our marketing strategy. We're not just putting ads on TV and seeing who's calling us you know, we have we have many legs to our marketing department and as well as to our marketing strategy. And so it's continued to evolve and we continue, but we've continued to measure it the same way. I mean, our, a successful marketing campaign delivers demo leads for us. Those are companies that request a demo. We have leads that aren't demo leads of someone that may go in and download white papers, or, you know, they're interested, but they have not yet requested a demo from a demo lead perspective. We're still setting appointments with over 90% of those as they come in. So they're very strong leads for us, and we've been having a lot of success. Operator : Your next question is in the line of Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler Arvind Ramnani : Hi, thanks for taking my congrats on a good quarter. Now just want to go back to this topic of Betty. You know, you certainly provided a lot of color on Betty and it seems that it's getting really good traction. And, and I know it's very different than DDX but, but can you kind of help frame how impactful that is as it pertains to the win rates? I know DDX had like a big impact on, on win rates. And you know, I'm just trying to get an understanding of the business model impact on bitty? Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean well, Betty is a unique product that comes with a unique strategy and that is about having employees being able to visualize what their checks are, what the check is going to be what components impact their check to where they're able to visualize and participate in that throughout the pay period and then it paid period end you know, they're able to approve that that check is correct. And what that does is it eliminates manuals, voids, adjustments, all the things that payroll departments and accounting departments traditionally have to do after the fact, once they found out that that check wasn't exact didn't exactly include everything that it should have for that employee. And so by moving the process up to the beginning of the pay period versus at the end of the pay period you know, it's going to change the way people do that, that payroll, as far as the win rate, do I think it's going to impact our win rates? Absolutely. once people really start using it, you know, the DDX we came out with it started impacting our retention not long after we came out with it and, and manager on the go, I would say is a similar product as that. And all of that got more and more people engaged employees, again, engaged in our software, interacting with the database on their own, and the more people that interact with the database on their own, the more accurate the data is, the more confirmation that you have, that the data is accurate and it produces less liability and exposure for the businesses that deploy it. So I see that continuing with us as we move forward. And I do think it's going to impact both our we're in win rates and our retention positively as it becomes prevalent within our platform. Arvind Ramnani : Right. Operator : Last question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey, there, this is Alan on south street question. No, we only get client counts on a quarterly basis. Like, can you talk about the momentum? You're seeing upmarket that is driving improvement and up rules per client, and I've got one follow up. Chad Richison : Yeah, we've continued to have success. You know, we, we really started rolling out an inside sales group. I wouldn't say we had five or so people for several years. And then about two years ago, we started building out that group, as we've done that, we've obviously seen more deals below our target market. And we've continued to see a deals above our target market. Even as we rolled through last year, I was even a little bit surprised that our average billings per client wasn't down a little bit when you looked at the growth that we had in client units. So, but it was pretty much the same which just shows the fact that yes, we are continuing to add small business clients, but they're also being bookended with the large business that we continue to bring on as we'll. Operator : And that does conclude the question and answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Chad Richison for closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call to today. I'd like to send a special thanks to all the employees at Paycom for their commitment and patience throughout the pandemic. Over two thirds of our staff are either fully vaccinated or in the process, as I've stated in the past. I do believe that getting vaccinated saves lives, maybe your own, the likely loved ones. And as from an investor outreach front this quarter, we'll be presenting at the Cowen technology conference on June 1st and at the bear global consumer technology and services conference on June 10th Paycom loss to also be hosting one-on-one meetings in may and in June at the Needham, JP Morgan and steeple conferences. We look forward to speaking with many of you very soon, and I appreciate your continued interest in Paycom. I thank you, operator. You may disconnect. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. James Samford. Thank you. Please go ahead.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad. Chad Richison : Thanks, James. And thank you to everyone joining our call. Today I'll spend a few minutes on the highlights of our second quarter 2021 results and the opportunities we are pursuing as we look ahead. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance and then we will take questions. We delivered very strong second quarter 2021 results with revenue $242 million. That grew 33.3% our fastest quarterly growth rate compared to the prior year period since Q4 of 2016, and well above the top end of our guidance range. The upside from the quarter was primarily a result of broad-based demand strength from new client ads and consistent cross selling to existing clients. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $87 million representing an increase of 42% over the prior year period. With these strong results, we are once again raising our full year guidance which Craig will discuss in more detail. The investments we make in our products generate tremendous value for our clients and driver differentiated employee strategy. Our newest employee innovation is Beti, the industry's first self-service payroll technology, allowing employees to do their own payroll, which we officially rolled out to the market in early July. Beti which stands for better employee transaction interface, is an employee driven payroll experience and represents one of the most important advances we've made today. With Beti, employees do their own payroll which allows our clients to benefit from increased payroll accuracy, while employees gain full insight to their paycheck including advanced knowledge of take home pay and how it's calculated. Employees have a direct connection to their paycheck to resolve errors well before payday, so they don't have to wait on or contact anyone for assistance. The additional clarity on how their pay changes and is calculated combined with automatic alerts when items require their action gives employees and clients confidence in the accuracy of their payroll. I'm very pleased with the launch so far. We are receiving tremendous feedback including a VP of HR who said Beti is the most revolutionary payroll product I've ever seen. Another comment from the Chief HR Officer noted that Beti is giving ownership of payroll to employees and managers which is great because they know better than anyone what their paycheck should be. As we said during our Q1 earnings call, we're planning to have 100 pilot clients on Beti in the second quarter and we easily achieved that goal. On July 6, we opened up Beti to all clients. And through the end of July, we've already sold Beti to over 1000 new and existing clients. I continue to expect that all Paycom clients will eventually deploy Beti, it's the only way payroll should be done. Our marketing plan continues to deliver strong demo leads and we intend to spend aggressively in the coming quarters to fuel future revenue growth and further expand our market share in a large and expanding HCM camp. Our messaging continues to resonate with prospects as we contrast the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems, with the value proposition of Paycom's single database solution and self-service capabilities that are stronger than ever. Employees expect their HR software to be efficient and easy to use. And once again, we had record high employee usage rates in Q2, as measured by direct data exchange or DDX. We continue to enjoy increasing traction with both smaller and larger companies. As a reminder, we added multiple inside sales teams as we've continued to have success below our target range. Due to the technological advances, we've made and the demand that's building around our Employee Self Service initiatives, we've continued to be pulled further upmarket as well. As a result, we are pleased to announce that we are expanding our proactive outside sales efforts from targeting firms with 50 to 5000 employees to targeting firms with 50 to 10,000 employees. We've had success selling organizations above our historic range driven by larger company demand. This change we are announcing today empowers our sales representatives to proactively target in this expanded segment. And we're excited by this incremental opportunity. We have clients in the segment already, so we're confident that our solution will compete and serve these clients effectively. On the Paycom branding front, we recently signed a 15-year naming rights partnership with the Oklahoma City Thunder that will transfer their downtown home into the Paycom Center. Oklahoma City is home to 1000s of our employees and I'm happy that the Paycom Center will be home of the Thunder. We have now lapped the tough pre pandemic year over year comparison and Q2, it is more reflective of our historical growth profile, record new client additions over this past year driving our growth. While we saw a very small headcount improvement in our pre pandemic client revenue base, our guidance and future growth initiatives are not reliant on any employment improvement. In summary, Q2 is a very strong quarter that reflects the strength of our execution throughout the pandemic and the investments we've made to further distance ourselves from the competition. Innovation, customer service and new client growth represent the foundation of our long-term revenue growth strategy. And with only approximately 5% market share of a growing [ph] TAM, we continue to have a long runway ahead of us. I want to thank all of our hard working and dedicated employees for their resilience and commitment to winning. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our second quarter 2021 results in our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2021, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We're very pleased with our second quarter results with total revenues of $242.1 million representing growth of 33.3% over the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by broad-based strength with new client wins and consistent cross selling to existing clients. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $237.6 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 33.5% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $206.9 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 85.4%. For 2021, we remain on target for adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 85% to 86%. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $136 million for the second quarter, as compared to $106 million in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2021 was $64.3 million or 26.6% of revenues. Our marketing strategy continues to generate strong demo leads both within and outside our historical target market range of 50 to 5000 employees. We plan to continue to invest in marketing throughout the remainder of 2021. And as Chad mentioned, we have increased our target market range to 50 to 10,000, thus empowering our outside sales representatives to proactively target larger companies. Adjusted R&D expense was $26.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 10.8% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D cost including the capitalized portion were $38 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $27.7 million in the prior year period. We continue to be very pleased with the high-quality innovation we're seeing from our investments in R&D and we'll continue to aggressively recruit talent in R&D to drive our future growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $87 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 35.9% of total revenues, compared to $61.2 million in the second quarter of 2020, or 33.7% of total revenues. Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $52.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share, versus $28.6 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $56.5 million or $0.97 cents per diluted share, versus $35.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the prior year period. We expect non cash stock based compensation for the third quarter of 2021 to be approximately $25 million to $26 million. For the full year we anticipate non cash stock-based compensation will be approximately $95 million to $100 million. For 2021, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 24% to 25% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be 26% to 27%. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $202.4 million and total debt of $30 million related to construction at our corporate headquarters. Cash from operations was $57 million for the second quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2021. During the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately 94,000 shares for a total of roughly $32 million. For June 30, 2021 Paycom has repurchased over 4.2 million shares since 2016, for a total of approximately $455 million, while we currently have roughly $300 million remaining in our buyback program. Shifting to guidance. We are pleased to provide strong third quarter guidance that reflects the robust performance we achieved in the first half of 2021. And we are raising our full year 2021 outlook as a result. Our Q3 and full year guidance are as follows. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $249 million to $251 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 27% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $87 million to $89 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35.2% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1.036 billion to $1.038 billion up from $1.017 billion to $1.019 billion, or approximately 23.2% year over year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $410 million to $412 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39.6% at the midpoint of the range. When combined, we now expect revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin to easily exceed the rule of 60 this year. To conclude, we are very pleased with the performance in the quarter, which gives us increasing confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year. With the launch of Beti and expanded target market and a deep product development pipeline, we have a long runway ahead of us to continue to deliver rapid growth for years to come. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Hey first of all, congratulations. That was an amazing quarter end amazing return to high growth. Chad, quick question on the decision to go towards like the 50 to 10,000 employee clients now. Historically, you were always a little bit hesitant because sales cycles seem to get more complex like longer, et cetera. How do you manage that process? And can you still do it with the same sales force, and then I had one follow up. Chad Richison : Sure, Raimo and so if you remember, it was about three years ago, our range at that time was 50 to 2000 employees. We continue to be pulled up. And so, at that point in time, we made it official allowing our employees to target proactively target companies of that range, because again, we've been pulled more up market. Same things happened here up to 10,000. We continue to be pulled further up market, I would say that the buying criteria for companies of that size has changed. We're all working with the same type of employee, there's no such thing as a large market employee and a small market employee. You can work for a 300 employee one company and work for a 10,000 employee company the next. And so, we're providing a very easy to use standard way for employees to interact with their data. And we're finding it easier to work with larger businesses as they look to displace multiple disparate systems with one. Raimo Lenschow : Yeah, okay. Perfect. Make sense. And then on Beti, like, if you think about the 1000, the greater than 1000 clients already signed up, like what has been the feedback so far from those clients? Were there some surprises, maybe that you've seen there and that you can utilize for the rest of the client base? Thank you. And congrats again. Chad Richison : You bet. And so, employees, like I've been saying employees pretty much fly blind into every payroll. They do the work, they clock in, clock out, put in their expenses, manage benefits, manage time off, and everything else, and then they get blindfolded before payday. And then they get to find out on pay day what it meant. I mean, it's similar to blinding the pilots right before they land. You know. And so, what we've done is taken that blindfold off to where employees understand how their checks are calculated, and they can help the payroll department have perfect payrolls, because there's not a payroll person out there, that doesn't have anxiety going into each payroll day, because they want it to be perfect. And so, what Beti does is help everybody get to the right level of accuracy. And it also eliminates a lot of the after fact, manual checks, voids and adjustments that oftentimes clients have to do after an employee's check is incorrect. And we know how important it is for employees' checks to be perfect. They expect it. So, we're having a lot of success with it. And now would expect us to continue that. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Samad Samana with Jeffries. Please go ahead. Samad Samana : Hi. Good evening, and congrats on that 30% plus growth. It was great to see that come back. So Chad, maybe first question for you just want to think about, it does a cross selling was much more mentioned more often on this call and I think historically, tend to say customers adopt a bit upfront. So, can you help us understand why cross selling is becoming a bigger motion? And is that primarily Beti or is it across the portfolio? Chad Richison : Yeah, I couldn't say that our cross selling today as a percentage is more of our revenue than what it's been in the past. I would say on a percentage basis, still cross selling for the biggest percent of our revenue is during that year of the ACA, where again, everybody had to take it. I do believe that we're going to be having three or four quarters here some pretty good cross selling, as we move everybody over to the better employee transaction interface, which is Beti. Also, as we're selling new onboarding new clients now, Beti is a part of that. And so, our sales reps - Beti comes with the payroll package now. It is an additional fee for that. But it is included on every quote moving forward for new businesses as we believe this is the way businesses win and achieve their return on investment with our product as it relates to the payroll side of what we do. Samad Samana : Great, really helpful and maybe as a follow up to that, this was one of the biggest beats take I'm supposed to carve out the expectation. So, I'm curious if you could maybe help us maybe unpack how much how you think about it in terms of better new bookings versus this uplifted Beti versus employment recovery in the install base, as we think about maybe the strength and the quarter? Chad Richison : Sure. Well in regards to beat in Beti, Beti had very little bit zero impact on second quarter. I talked about on our May call that we would be looking to put 100 clients on it that quarter. We achieved that, I think within the first couple of weeks, and then we held we went through that. And then on July 6, we actually released it to all other clients. So that was within this quarter. So, Beti would have played zero impact as it relates to last quarter. We do think it's going to be a part of our differentiated strategy moving forward. So new logo ads, as usual, is what contributes to our growth, followed by upsells to current clients. As far as macro, we've been going through this now for a little bit. I've been talking a little bit about us having some improvement with the pre pandemic client base, as far as this quarter. I'd say we saw an improvement in hiring during this past quarter, and the impact that it had on our revenue for this quarter, from our pre pandemic client base was $1 million to $1.5 million for the quarter. So that's about $100,000 worth of weekly improvement on that number that we had talked about prior. Samad Samana : Great. Appreciate the questions, and congrats again on the strong results. Great to say. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line at Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Chad, as your sales people have the opportunity to move further up market, do you think that changes the sale cycle length? And if it does lengthen, how do you manage that? Chad Richison : No, I don't, I mean, a little bit, it's hard for me to say that, you know, a 5000, employee company sales cycle is going to be the same as a 150-employee company sale cycle. I will say the 5000 employee's sale cycle is the same as a 10,000-employee sale cycle. So, I don't know that there's some major differences between the two of those as far as what their sales cycles would be. We're still not looking to engage with long sales cycle that requires us to link up with multiple disparate systems. So, somebody has to be a fit for us to go into that something else. I would say as we continue to have strength the down market, we continue to aggressively achieve our lead volumes, and they continue to go up. And oftentimes those leads are also small business. And so, first of this year, we had four sales teams, and that was up from one the previous year. Throughout this year, we've added another six inside sales teams. And so, now we're 10 inside sales teams, which sell the emerging business or that would be the below 50 market. So, we continue to do extremely well, below 50. And we continue to be pulled up market because again, it's the same employee interface, whether you work for a 150employee company, or whether you work for a 10,000-employee company. Those employees expect ease of use and easy access to their system. And so, we're seeing a lot of momentum being created based off of employee usage, needs and how much it makes it easier for them. Brad Reback : That's great. And then one quick follow up on Beti, can you help us on the monetization of, sorry if I missed it. What type of lift you get from an existing customer that's adding Beti and been on net new what type of work? Chad Richison : Yeah, so we've added products in the past where we got 100% usage very quickly, and I'm thinking of DDX and Manager on the go. And those were products that we just included in our pricing with Beti, it is an additional priced product, even though it's now included on every single payroll deal. We believe our pricing is competitive. So, I don't like to just put it out there. You may be able to find it out there. But all I would say is, it's reasonably priced like many of our other modules. Brad Reback : That's great. Thanks very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : Hey, good afternoon and let me add my congratulations. With regards to the rapid ramp in terms of the clients that are using Beti, with the 100 that that first came on, can you talk a little bit about like, what sort of experiences they were seeing? Did it really ease or increase the accuracy that they ended up experiencing? Or are you getting any feedback from clients about A, our payroll department doesn't need as many people? And how easy was it to lift, you opened it up on July 6, and now you've got over 1000 on Beti, how easy was it to convert them to Beti? Chad Richison : Yeah, and so well with Beti, we're already on it. It's something that we turn on for you. But what we have to work with you to convert your processes, we've got a lot of these processes that happened after the factor. We need to have those happen at the beginning or during the payroll transaction. And once you do that, a lot of the processes you'd normally do after the factor are irrelevant. We're able to displace those. And so, we eliminate a lot of processes. And then with some of the processes we move them into earlier in the processing phase. And so, but an answer to your question, we hadn't had anybody turn it off. Once you turn it on, and that's what your employees are doing, you have a very high satisfaction rate with employees, and we have a very strong ROI. Beti itself 100% pays for itself. And it actually helps even pay for the payroll the entire payroll module, because there's an incredible amount of ROI, when you're not having to do manual checks, voids, adjustments, and wire money into employee's accounts to cover in SFBs, they may have because their payroll was wrong. And so, it also gives employees visibility into what their check is going to be. A lot of people live check the check, I mean, over 80% 85% of the U.S. employee let's check the check. And they need to know exactly what the pay is going to be. And if it's $30 off, that's a big difference for them. And so, Beti gives them visibility long before check date, and gives them the ability to interact with their check to make sure it's accurate, which again, increases ROI for the business. It also lowers the business's exposure and certain risks associated with paying people. There's some pretty specific laws on making sure you pay your employees correctly, and that you pay them on time. And with Beti, that's easily achieved. Mark Marcon : That's great. And does all of those clients have time and attendance already set up? Or did some of them have to add that? Chad Richison : You know, that's a great question Raimo. I would expect that most of our first\u2026 Mark Marcon : It's Mark. Chad Richison : Oh, sorry, Mark, sorry, Mark. Mark, I would expect that most of our clients already had time and attendance, because we'd like to go through there and get the ones using quickly that are already ready. Now, I would say most of our clients at Paycom already have time and attendance. But you are right, there will be certain modules that as we go to move Beti would be required for a client to implement. Mark Marcon : Great. And then one last one, just on the increasing the target range from upper limit of 5000 to 10,000 would be when you first expanded from 2000 to 5000, how many of those 5000 and employee companies were kind of like inbound and kind of approaching you guys? Obviously, you've got a great marketing campaign that's been very successful. Imagine that's drawn a number of inquiries. But can you talk about, like how much of that is being pulled in as opposed to being pushed? Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean, we do not have a marketing strategy for companies above 5000. We do targeted prospecting. And our targeted prospecting strategies had been three years ago, they were companies below 2000. And then we move that to below 5000, which we've experienced for the last three years. And now we're moving into 10,000. And what that means is we'll start proactively targeting these. We have continued to have people call us of employee sizes in that range. And again, the more that we've had, we've continued to move up our market. And so, what it allows us to do now is do targeted prospecting toward those. And as salespeople make calls, you know, they're able to proactively make those calls. Now, sales reps have always been able to make a proactive call. Sales rep can go out there right now, until a 50,000-employee company, I don't care. But as far as what were our targeted prospecting efforts are toward those companies now that have between 50 and 10,000 employees, and then in our more small business or emerging type companies, it would be for those that are also below 50. Mark Marcon : Great, congratulations. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester : Hey, great afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. It seems like every day there's a new story about how tight labor market is. So, I'm just wondering if you could talk about sort of how the tight labor market may be or may not be impacting inbound demand that you're seeing. Chad Richison : Inbound interest that we're seeing? Daniel Jester : Yeah, that's right. Chad Richison : Okay. Okay, got it. Your last part there cut off? Well, I mean, definitely, I think it plays a role. We've done a lot of surveys that employees like easy-to-use technology at work, I've said an employee shouldn't have to work to work. And so, you definitely have a frustrated employee base, if you have multiple pieces of technology that are difficult to use. Also, it's a hunt for talent out there. You want to retain your good employees, that's a must. Good technology helps you do that. You also need to deploy pretty good technology on the talent acquisition side, because everybody's in a dogfight for talent. Right now, it's a very tight labor market. So, I do believe that there's some of that in there. But everything shifted to this digital transformation and the right way to do something, and it only makes sense that employees would be the ones engaging with their data. And so, we're having success with that. But no, I think the labor market might be tight for a while here, we'll kind of see what happens after that. As far as our business, because of our new business ad, we've really what we've needed stability. And we've had that since the summer of last year, we just we needed some stability within the labor market. And so, I don't think, even if there's different situations with the pandemic, as we go through the remainder of this year, I still believe we're dealing with somewhat of a tight labor market. So, I don't feel like the macro on a go forward is going to impact us like it had, provided that we have some stability here. And it looks like we will from an employment perspective. Daniel Jester : That's great. And then just as a follow up, you've been selling virtually for, like 18 months. Now you talk about adding inside sales team. I'm just wondering if you can kind of reflect on once you actually do get back to the normal environment, does this change your philosophy about adding new sales offices? Chad Richison : No, no I mean, its timing, we're just now our managers are getting back into the office. And throughout the rest of this year, people are going to be filtering back into our offices as we go back to the office to do our selling. As far as what type of model and hybrid model we're going to be using, we've been paying attention to why prospects buying, we've also been paying attention to how prospects buy. So, we're going to be supporting the methods that best help both the prospect as well as us be able to, in our case, display what our product does, and in their case, have a clear understanding of what the ROI is for them. Daniel Jester : Great, thank you very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Schwartz : Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And congratulations on a great quarter. Chad, maybe if I could just start there on the quarter. Can you shed any light on just how the bookings or the business activity trended in the quarter? Just have a linearity was, we'll start from there. Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean, we've had really strong bookings since April of last year, things kind of took off, and we were doing well, anyway. But I mean, we've had very strong bookings, in fact, these last two weeks that we just had here in July, these last two weeks that's the largest number we've put up ever in bookings. And so, bookings have been strong as we've continued to push a differentiated strategy that's getting a lot of momentum here in the marketplace. Brian Schwartz : Thank you. And then Chad, one question I had just on the target expansion move here. I'm just wondering if there's any industry verticals that would have, I would think about fewer organizational complexities to them, and therefore would just be right for Beti and more likely to switch to self-service when you target. Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean, I really look at it as it's a product for everybody, from the employees' perspective, I would even say that the more complex it is, the more you need to deploy Beti. The more data points you have on a check, the more important it is to deploy something like Beti. So, I'm not going to say that any specific vertical or either easy or complex type of company that Beti would be best for. I think it's best for everybody. And it's 100% best for the American worker to have a product like this to where they can engage themselves with their data, and something that's going to significantly impact their ability to work their financial plan. Brian Schwartz : And then last question for Craig, just on the marketing and advertising campaigns. Given the bookings momentum year in the business, the commentary, I wonder if you have any plans to increase your advertising spend here in the second half of the year, in support of the Beti product cycle and in the current momentum in the business? Thanks. Craig Boelte : We're going to continue to spend aggressively on sales and marketing. You've seen that in the past, the back half of the year where we've kind of ramped up sales and marketing. So, I would expect to kind of see the same for us through the rest of the year. Obviously, in marketing plans we've currently baked into our third quarter and full year guidance. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ryan McDonald with Needham. Please go ahead. Michael Rackers : This is Michael Rackers. I'm on for Ryan McDonald. Thanks for taking my question. So, we've heard from multiple vendors that churn ticked up slightly on the quarter, as some of the customers that may have wanted to make a change last year couldn't do so because of the other pandemic driven priorities. Did you experience any similar uptick in churn within your customer base? And did you see any more opportunities to replace competitors during the quarter given this dynamic? Chad Richison : Yeah, what I would first say is it's a bad idea to use our competitors when in relation to churn as a proxy to us, but we do not report either gains or no gains as it relates to retention until the end of each year. What I would say though, is that we're having a lot of success, deploying differentiated product, both to new customers, as well as to current customers and those clients that are buying product are staying. And so, we're having a lot of success. It's a differentiated strategy. And as we continue to have increased DDX usage, where more and more employees are the ones making the impressions on the database and not an intermediary through another department within the company, we would have an expectation that we would continue to have a strong retention rate with our clients. Michael Rackers : Right, thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Matt Diamond : Hey, guys, this is Matt Diamond on the line for Siti. I want to add my congrats for the solid results. One question that's come up. And I think we've alluded to it a little bit, is around Beti. It was mentioned that there are going to be three to four quarters of continued pretty above normal cross selling. We also know that Beti necessitates all of the Paycom modules in order to for clients to be eligible for Beti. Can you help us handicap really what size of the existing client base has all of those modules [ph] CNA sounds like it's pretty widespread, so that we can get an idea of what the magnitude of that cross-sell opportunity looks like over the next three to four quarters? Chad Richison : Sure. And so, I do want to say one thing, Beti does not require you to have all of our modules. There's a lot of modules you don't need to utilize Beti. Now, it would make sense that someone would take the modules, but things like talent acquisition, as far as you know, recruiting Cobra, a lot of our modules, you don't necessarily have to have to run Beti. But it's a good idea that you implement it within your business so that your employees can use one system. But there are modules that would be required to use Beti like paid time, off time, and attendance, expense management, benefits administration, there are some of them, definitely that you're going to want to use them because without them, you wouldn't be able to use Beti. A lot of those are fairly popular products to us. But we have several clients that don't have them. And so, I would like to thank our sales reps who are probably out there right now, our CRRs who're probably working with a lot of those clients that are already ready to go where we just go and click a button, eliminate most of your processes and shift a few to the beginning. But I'm sure that we will have our internal sales group our client relations group continuing to reach out to clients of all characteristics, whether they have all of the products currently required or just partial. So, there is an opportunity there for us. As far as handicapping it again, we consider our pricing competitive in nature. But there are opportunities sports out there. I do want to say this though our revenue gains are going to be primarily driven by new business wins just because of what in the end and I'm saying new logo wins exist because of the size of a new logo compared to the potential upsell of that same logo. Matt Diamond : That's a perfect segue to my next question, is there anything that's being done differently or that's been adjusted on the product side to address these 10K customers and above employees, the 10k employees and above. It doesn't seem to be the case. But anything that can be commented on in regards to the R&D spend, and what's being prioritized for that customer base would be helpful? Chad Richison : No, there's no debt. We're not doing anything different for a 10,000 employee company that we're doing for a 2,300 employee company. Matt Diamond : Excellent. Thanks so much, guys. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please go ahead. Bryan Bergin : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. A question here on Beti. Can you comment on what level of client adoption you're anticipating by the end of 2021? And the clarification on the new sales. I understand it's being included in each deal you bid. But are you sitting near 100% attach on it as well here the last several weeks? Chad Richison : Well, again, yeah, we just like you said, I mean, we started selling it July 6, then, as it relates to new clients, a lot of them would be in conversion. It would be rare that we'd sell a client on July 6, then they would have started by now unless they're smaller business and on the smaller business side, then you definitely could have had some of that. Yes, I mean, because it's the way we're training and setting them up. We're not training on the old model now. I mean, we're going through conversion and training, we're training on how employees do their own payroll. We're not training you and you put your employees' data into our system. And so, yeah, it's part of the conversion. And so, it would be a logical for me to think that anybody even tried to do it the old way. And also, it's included in the ROI. I mean, now our ROI cases include Beti. And it's an important part of the ROI. I mean, you can use Beti and actually it'll pay, it can help pay for the entire system, depending upon how many true issues you've been having in payroll. Payroll is, it's a high risk, low reward activity. If you get it right, who cares employees expected. And if you get it wrong, you upset employees. They have NSF fees, and then you get to pay tax penalties. And so, having perfect payroll is extremely important, and it just wouldn't make any sense to me that any client would buy our product without Beti. And it wouldn't make any sense that they would, since they bought it, it wouldn't make any sense that they wouldn't use it, because their employees want to use it. Bryan Bergin : Okay, and then just another thought, a common question we're getting around Beti, and the potential offsets of existing service revenue, can you help kind of frame the magnitude of that work within your business to begin with as far as error correction and things like that? And then clarify your view on the revenue accretion of Beti versus those types of services that might automate away? Chad Richison : You know, I mean, there's definitely going to be Beti's going to replace some what I'm going to call bad revenue for the client. The client didn't have visibility. The employee didn't have visibility, so they have to void a check, and they have to do a manual, than they have to send a wire. And then, to the extent there's a tax event created, because it extends a different quarter a different tax period, you've got to deal with that. And so, there are definitely some fees associated with that. That can be labor work on both our side and the client side, which can carry maybe a higher or a lower, I should say, operating margin as it read in regards to that but - or a higher expense to both us and the client. From a Beti perspective, there's not we're doing to it on our end, and there's not anything the clients having to do. And what I tell clients is, hey, our competitors got themselves out of doing your payroll, we get you out of doing your payroll. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, this is Alan on for Alex Zukin. I just wanted to drill in on the new business going forward, obviously, sounds like you guys are seeing a lot of strength there. I was wondering if you can help kind of put the context what you're seeing at the lower end of your customer employee range and the top end and kind of how you're thinking about that for the second half. Thanks. Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean, I would say more of this same. We don't really get to dictate what size companies coming in from our lead volume. As we use our advertising assets, you could have a three employee company clicking on it that has a pet store, and you could have a 10,000 employee company clicking on it. And, we're going to be going after those of all sizes and have been and so, I wouldn't see how we would expect it to be dramatically different than what we're seeing right now. Again, our move up market, we're already there, we just announced that. I mean, we're already there. We're getting the leads; we're already selling the deals. We've got deals larger than 10,000 that are already using our company. So, we're just making it more official, and kind of flying the flag out there right now that we're open for business and we're going to be targeted prospecting those clients up to 10,000 as well. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Chad Richison. Chad Richison : All right, thank you. I want to thank everyone for joining us today on the call. As we communicated internally, we're gradually making our way back to the offices and hope to be back as soon as conditions safely permit. I want to thank all of the Paycom employees for their perseverance through the pandemic. Over 70% of our staff are either fully vaccinated are in the process. I like to reiterate that I believe getting vaccinated that saves lives for every 100,000 fully vaccinated people that made it less than one will lose their life from the break through COVID-19 case. Please get your vaccinations and let's end this pandemic. On the investor outreach side, this quarter we'll be presenting at the Oppenheimer Conference on August 10, followed by the Wolfe Conference on September 8, and the Citi Conference on September 14. Paycom will also be hosting one on one meetings in August and September at KeyBanc and Piper Sandler conferences. We look forward to speaking with many of you very soon and appreciate your continued support with Paycom. Thank you, operator. You may disconnect. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect,",

We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. The reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors. paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad. Chad Richison : Thank you. James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our third quarter 2021 results and our progress on key initiatives. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance and then we will take questions. We delivered very strong third quarter 2021 results with revenue of $256 million representing robust year-over-year revenue growth of 30.4%, which was above the top end of our guidance range.  We continue to see strong demand for our products across our target market, and we are having great success attracting new clients. We have reinvested and will continue to reinvest revenue upside into the business while still delivering attractive adjusted EBITDA margins.  With these strong results, we are once again raising our full-year guidance, which Craig will discuss in more detail. Our innovative solutions continue to gain popularity and we're being recognized by industry organizations for their impact on the human capital management industry. In September, Paycom was once again awarded the 2021 top HR product honor at the HR Technology Conference for our newest innovation, Beti.  This marks the third consecutive year for Paycom to receive such honors, which included the Direct Data Exchange in 2019, Manager on The Go in 2020, and now Beti in 2021. It is precisely the combination of these 3 industries first coupled with our comprehensive single database that is transforming the human capital management industry and turning employee usage and easy-to-use solutions and the key buying criteria for clients.  Beti is a self-service payroll technology that allows employees to do their own payroll and we're having great success in the market. As a reminder, with Beti employee submit their own time work and make their own benefit selections, schedule deductions, manage tax statuses, remit expenses, request time off, and do all the things that an employee does to calculate a check. Beti does the rest and works with the employee to ensure a perfect payroll for them prior to the payroll.  Employees doing their own payroll is the only way payroll should be done. I am very pleased with the market response to batty and I continue to expect all clients to eventually deploy Beti. Our advertising and marketing efforts continue to deliver strong demo leads that are fueling our revenue growth. And we will intend to continue to spend aggressively in the coming quarters to further expand our market share in the large and expanding HCM TAM.  Our advertising strategy's working and we are deliberately reinvesting revenue upside into advertising, marketing, and product innovation. You've heard me say consistently that we are willing to trade a point of margin for a point of growth, but we are unwilling to trade a point of margin for a point of nothing. And that philosophy has served us well over the years and you can see it in our results. On the sales front, we\u2019re seeing success with both smaller and larger companies. I'm particularly pleased with the traction we're having in our recently expanded target market range of companies with up to 10,000 employees, where our messaging around ease-of-use and the employee self-service is resonating. Finally, it's great to see all the Paycom faces back in the office even if behind masks. We have successfully transitioned nearly all employees back to our offices around the country and it is great to see we're getting our office culture back.  While we accomplished extraordinary things working remotely, I believe were even better together. Many of our new hires are experiencing for the first time the daily buzz and enthusiasm that makes Paycom a unique place to work. While our sales teams are still selling virtually, we're already seeing the benefits of everyone being safely back in the office, sharing best practices and collaborating more closely. In summary, Q3 was a very strong quarter driven by record new client revenue.  The investments we've made throughout 2020 and to-date in 2021 have made Paycom more differentiated than ever, and we are seeing the benefits across the sales, service, and product organizations. As a reminder, we have approximately 5% market share of a growing TAM and a long runway ahead of us. I want to thank all of our hard -working and dedicated employees for their grit and commitment to success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig. Craig Boelte : Before I review our Third Quarter 2021 results and our outlook for the Fourth Quarter and full-year 2021, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis.  We're very pleased with our Third Quarter results with total revenues of $256.2 million representing growth of 30.4% over the comparable prior-year period, driven primarily by strong new client revenue growth. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $251.3 million for the Third Quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 30.4% from the comparable prior-year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the  Third Quarter was $214.8 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 83.8%. Third quarter margins were impacted by both our return to office and our aggressive hiring of the individuals needed to service our current and future growth. For 2021, we expect to deliver a very strong adjusted gross margin of approximately 85%. Adjusted total administrative expenses were $142.5 million for the third quarter as compared to $113.3 million in the third quarter of 2020.  Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $66.3 million or 25.9% of revenues. Our marketing strategy continues to generate strong demo leads and we plan to continue to invest in advertising given the strong return on our investment we are seeing. As Chad suggested, growth remains a top priority and advertising is a productive lever that we have continued to deploy to drive revenue growth.  Adjusted R&D expense was $29.3 million in the Third Quarter of 2021 or 11.4% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion for $40.7 million in the Third Quarter of 2021 compared to $29.8 million in the prior-year period. Even in this tight labor market, we're having good success attracting and retaining talent. Adjusted EBITDA was $89.7 million in the Third Quarter of 2021, or 35% of total revenues compared to $67.5 million in the Third Quarter of 2020, or 34.3% of total revenues.  Our GAAP Net Income for the Third Quarter was $30.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share versus 27.5 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the prior-year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. Non-GAAP Net Income for the Third Quarter of 2021 was $53.6 million or $0.92 per diluted share versus $40.6 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the prior-year period. We expect non-cash stock-based compensation for the Fourth Quarter of 2021 to be approximately 22 million to 24 million.  For the full year we anticipate non-cash stock-based compensation will be approximately 98 million to 100 million. For 2021 we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be 23% to 25% on a GAAP basis, on a non-GAAP basis, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be 25 to 27%. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter of 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $230.9 million in total debt of $29.6 million. Cash from operations was $83.2 million for the third quarter, reflecting our strong revenue performance in the profitability of our business model.  The average daily balance of funds-held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2021. During the third quarter of 2021, we've repurchased approximately 61,000 shares for a total of roughly $29 million. Through September 30th of 2021, Paycom has repurchased nearly 4.3 million shares since 2016 for a total of approximately $484 million. And we currently have roughly $271 million remaining in our buyback program.  Shifting to guidance, we are pleased to provide strong fourth quarter guidance that reflects the robust performance year-to-date and we are raising our full-year 2021 outlook as a result. Our Q4 and full-year guidance are as follows. For the Fourth Quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues in the range of $274.5 to $276.5 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of approximately 25% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the Fourth Quarter in the range of $103 to $105 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 37.7% at the midpoint of the range. For fiscal 2021, we are raising our expected revenue range to $1.045 billion to $1.047 billion, up from $1.036 billion to $1.038 billion or approximately 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range, we expect full-year adjusted EBITDA in the range of 413 to 415 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39.6% at the midpoint of the range.  To conclude, we are very pleased with the performance in the quarter and how the full-year has been shaping up. Product differentiation, outstanding customer service, and our use of effective advertising and sales levers are all contributing to our strong results and we have a long runway ahead of us to continue to deliver rapid growth for years to come. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thank you and congrats again for another quarter as the fastest growing HR Company that I cover. I have 2 quick questions. First, Chad, can you talk a little bit about -- you talked about the customer -- new customer momentum.  Can you talk a little bit about the lending kind of sites and the module uptick that you see from this new customer? Is there any change in terms of what people are buying, how Beti etc. are impacting, how big you are lending for them? And then I had one follow-up question. Chad Richison : Yeah, definitely. Well, Beti, for instance, Beti is included on all accounts since July that we've sold. And so that doesn't mean that we've converted all of them that we've sold since July. But Beti is included in that meaning that it's sold as part of the package that we sell with that.  Included in that there are products that are, to be honest with you, are somewhat our most popular products anyway. But I do believe Beti is making an impact on our ability to sell more products at the point -- at the initial point-of-sale? Raimo Lenschow : Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then if you think back to the pandemic that you did really well in new customers but your existing customers had a lower employee count, which obviously then hurts. Since now in September, a lot of the benefits fell away, like what are you seeing in terms of rehiring at the existing customer level and that could that be another driver for you as we think about the next year as well in terms of the revenue trajectory. Thank you. Chad Richison : Yeah, I'm going to take this as you're talking about the clients that we had at the time of the pandemic and then the negative impact on them, which we've quantified in the past of that $1.8 to $2 million. We've talked about a couple of different quarters of seeing improvement in that specifically this last quarter, the Second Quarter, we did talk about, we did see a little bit of improvement to the extent we did. It was around $100,000 a week.  That's a trend has continued into the Third Quarter where I would say it was very similar to what it was in the Second Quarter as to that improvement of about $1 million to $1.5 million positive impact on the quarter from our pre -pandemic client base, becoming a little bit healthier. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Well, done. Congratulations again. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : All right. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the strong sustained growth from me as well. Maybe first Chad, it may seem like you guys would have [Indiscernible] clarified that you're investing for growth and you want to invest aggressively.  I'm curious, as you think about the investments you've made today, is there any change in the mix between those as you think about maybe -- you mentioned the reopening. Will there be a mix shift in dollars going to either advertising versus back into sales headcount versus other modalities like user conferences? Just how should we think about that investment framework mixing in terms of dollars as the world reopens? Chad Richison : Sure. We're definitely focused on the marketing and advertising and I'm sure you guys have seen our assets out there working. We continue to drive that. We've also returned to the office, each of our offices as well as here in Oklahoma City, I was actually week-and-a-half ago with all of our sales leaders in Aspen as we've done, really our first big meeting with one another since the pandemic.  Something else that we're doing, we're having a lot of success hiring, we have to hire service individuals and train them up ahead of the revenue that we're bringing in and so we had a lot of success hiring service individuals with the anticipation that our growth continues as it has and we will need them to service these accounts. And so those are the large areas. Obviously, marketing is more of a lever type area and we spend that deliberately throughout the quarter to make sure that we're not leaving pattern and the CAG that we could turn into future sales. Craig Boelte : Yeah. And Samad I would also echo that. I mean, we're also having success on the R&D side. I mean, we're able to hire and bring those individuals in as well. Samad Samana : Great. Then maybe just a question on bookings linearity in the quarter. Maybe if you could just help us understand the overall strength of bookings in the third quarter, and then how it trended throughout the quarter just given we've had varying use in software more broadly around trends evolving over the course of the quarter. Chad Richison : Yeah, and our bookings in the quarter remains strong throughout third quarter. In fact, the October we just finished was our largest booking month ever. I know I say that quite often, but we would expect -- we would expect to have strong quarters in subsequent quarters and months for bookings, but bookings remain strong now.  Deals are booked and then they turn into revenue over time. Whether that's 13 weeks or 17 weeks is our focus for those, but yes, we had a lot of strong bookings come in in third quarter. And as I mentioned, October was our largest booking month we've ever had of our Company. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks again for taking my questions. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Chad, as you went back over the last 18 months and the efficiencies that you've been able to achieve across the organization, where would be 1 or 2 places where you generated the most and where do you think it's most sustainable going forward? Chad Richison : That's a good question. I think that we've gained a lot of efficiencies through our own technology that we've developed to use internally, some of that is based off of internal communication which had to strengthen in order to survive the work from home and the impacts of the virtual environment and we passed with moved to it.  I believe we're still gaining efficiencies through the sales model. As predominantly most all of our sales are still done virtually, which does allow for a better training on our side and allows our managers specifically to be able to set on more calls. I'm sure there's others, but I would call out that -- those two for sure. Brad Reback : That's great. Thanks very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good afternoon, Chad and Craig really strong sequential growth in this quarter and obviously called out the bookings I was wondering, could you help put a little bit more color behind. where you're seeing the bookings strength, is its newer markets for you relative to older markets, smaller clients versus larger clients, obviously the marketing is having a positive impact, but wondering if you're seeing any patterns that are discernible? Chad Richison : Not really. I would say it's more of the same for us, there's just more of it now. I would remind everyone that we did increase our inside sales group in the past. I talked about that, how we've grown that over the years. We now have teams there that we have. Of course, they're bringing in smaller deals with a little bit lower revenue associated with it, but I wouldn't be really be able to call out that the mix is different than what we've had in the past. It's the same type mix. We continue to go more up market, but we always have. And so, but the mix is very similar. Mark Marcon : Great. And can you give a little bit more color with regards to the impact of Beti and then lastly, just a little bit more color with regards to the impact of bringing people into the office in terms of the gross margin for this quarter and how we should think about gross margins going forward? Chad Richison : I will say the gross margin. I mean it will definitely be impacted some by their return to work. You definitely have some of that, but I would also say that we've had a lot of success hiring our service individuals as we get ready to get trained up for the revenue that we're bringing in and so there's been quite a bit of it there as well. From a Beti perspective, we started selling it to the group, to the masses in July.  And since July, I think in July, I said that we had sold 1,000 somewhere in conversions, some had already started. As of today, we've sold nearly 4,000, again. Some have already started and some are in conversions. So that product continues to be successful for us as it changes the way that employees do their payroll and really puts the control into their hands. Mark Marcon : That's great. Thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Ryan McDonald of Needham. Your line is open. Michael Rackers : Hi, everyone. This is Michael Rackers on for Ryan. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. At HR Tech and some other industry work we've done this year, we've heard about a lot of new customer interest and vendor functionality in things like Daily Pay and Talent Intelligence, which seems to be more targeted to the customer segment that you are starting to target more moving up market. How do you think about product expansion and the larger customer segment that may or may not have some different module requirements? Chad Richison : I mean, we're in the larger -- for us the larger clients are the 10,000 employee companies, I believe our largest client's around 20,000 - is employees. And so, we believe we provide a very strong product for that. I've said in the past that there may be such thing as an enterprise level business, but I do not believe there is such thing as an enterprise level employee, you're an employee, you can be working with a 300 Company today and a Company that might have 50,000 employees tomorrow, but you're the same person and you expect the same type of functionality. And that's really what we are providing is the appropriate tools for the employee base. I mean, you can hand me a shovel and ask me to dig a 4-mile trench and I may or may not be able to do it, but that's not the correct tool to do that. And so, one thing we've been able to do is bring the correct tools to the employee base regardless of size.  And a lot of the things you'll find is that the things that an employee has to do are pretty much the same, whether that employee is working at a Company that has 300 employees or 5,000 employees, all rules apply. As you get into the larger companies, you do sometimes have to deal more with international type tax situations and other. But for the most part, we feel really good about the value that our product's able to deliver to those large market employees as well. Michael Rackers : Right. Thank you so much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your line is open. Matt Diamond : Hey guys, this is actually Matt Diamond on behalf of Siti. Congrats, again on the results here. One thing I'm trying to figure out is the potential for sales office reopening. Chad, it sounds like everybody's enthusiastic to be back in the office, but it's undeniable the benefits that came from virtual selling over the last 18 months. How should we think about sales office openings in 2022? Chad Richison : Sure. We actually did. I didn't call it out in prepared remarks, but we actually did open up an office in this past quarter. We opened up a second Manhattan office there in New York City. As far as from sales, I think it's important to state that we are back in the office but we're selling virtually from our office. And so, the change there is we were selling virtually from our homes, now we're back in the office selling virtually from the office and so we have the collaboration and it may just make more sense for us to be there. Matt Diamond : Helpful. And with Beti, it sounds like there's a lot of positive momentum happening in that module. Could you help us understand what percentage of Paycom 's client base today is prepared to upgrade to Beti or you sold Beti, I know that there's some requirements that go into that module, but any color there would be helpful? Chad Richison : Well prepared from a product stand -- prepared mentally, I'm hoping all of them are but prepared from a product standpoint, there would be some products that we would upsell to some of our clients that would enable them to get the full value and actually be able to use Beti.  I haven't disclosed exactly what that is because that's a moving target as we continue to have success selling Beti both into the current client base as well as to all new clients that are brought on. Matt Diamond : Understood. Thanks so much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you. I have a follow-up on Beti here. Just curious how the efforts are progressing on selling it back into that existing base. So, Chad, of those 4,000 or so sold clients, can you give us a sense on how many of those were in the existing base versus new? Chad Richison : Well, we're not splitting that out separately, but I would -- you could expect there be a healthy mix of both with 4,000. So, you'd have a healthy mix of both. For current clients, it's one of those things where they're having success with our current products in the current environment and we're going up to them asking them to change their internal processes again to start the process at the beginning versus at the end.  We're having a lot of success with that and as we get more and more proof sources of current clients that have shifted over to it and their employees are having great success, we're receiving both more client referrals as well as more prospect referrals, which is driving more results for us. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Fair. And then just on the challenge on the hiring front, any challenges at all in acquiring needed talent across the organization, whether that since sales or services? Chad Richison : Well, there's no doubt it's a tighter market. It really does depend on at what level we're talking about bringing people in and then also what departments. Some levels we're actually receiving upgrades in Talent due to the fact that I think our brand's much stronger than it's been in the past and we're destination location for employment.  And some areas just like everyone else, it's a tight labor market we're all fighting for talent, so it's really somewhat department dependent as well as at what level of employee versus is it a new front-line type position or is this a management level position? But it's tied everywhere, but we're having a lot of success continuing to bring people in. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Thank you. Chad Richison : You got it. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Fools Research. Your line is open. Alan: Hey there, this is Alan on for Alex Zukin. Seems like there's a bit of an inflection with demand environment in the March and April time frame. How are you thinking about the completing trends around both reopening along with the shortage of talent? Are these opposing forces or are they coming together to drive demand? Thanks. Chad Richison : I'll tell you from where we're at right now and I've said this a little bit or consistently, we needed stability in the market in order for us to -- in order for it to enable our growth so that our growth could actually be reflected as we brought businesses in. We needed some stability. We've had that. As far as it being a tight labor market, I do think there is some impact, obviously, and the larger we get, the larger the impact on our ability to have what I'm going to call same-store or current client growth and see that.  We've never been a Company that's been dependent upon that, nor have we really looked at that as any type of driver for us and probably still today wouldn't even have thought of it as a question, except for we did go through the pandemic and lost a significant amount through our client base, but from a macro standpoint of what we see amongst our client base, we see stability and our growth is coming from our ability to add new clients onto our platform. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Robert Simmons of DA Davidson. Your line is open. Robert Symons : Great. Thank you. So, I was wondering, what are you seeing out there in the market from the competition? Is there anything unusual going on in terms of pricing, marketing, or anything that you've [Indiscernible]? Chad Richison : Okay, so it's hard for me here you. I heard the what is going on, is anything going on new with the competition? I can't say. I would say we've always been in an extremely competitive market. I think that's good for clients. The more competitive an industry is, the more innovation you see, because the harder we're all trying. I can't say that I've seen anything new in the market from our clients, be it from different types of technologies and/or techniques that are used.  We've always -- clients have always sold against us with different pricing, discounting and different people accentuate their positives. The positive we insinuate is the fact that we drive significant return on investment for those -- and a low-cost total ownership for those businesses that choose Paycom and that's all experienced through employee usage in an easy-to-use product. Robert Symons : Okay great. And then are you seeing any change in demand environment in terms of like which modules are particularly, I think picking up by clients in terms of, as they could change on what people really want to focus on or is that really not a factor that present more? Chad Richison : Yes, sure. I will tell you one thing that we are seeing, and I've said this in the past. We've always been really good at selling products. Sometimes not as good at getting clients to use the products that we sold. What I would say it's happening now and it's really been happening. We came out with the DDX, we came out with Manager on The Go.  We kept the data moving, we gave people visibility. When we came out with Beti and gave them another reason to go ahead and fully automate. We've continued to do that and we've continued to see great success around usage, which is really driving everything for us right now. Robert Symons : Great. Thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Barvin Chow of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Barvin Chow : Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on your quarter. Chad, I was wondering if you could just dive into the up-market motion a bit. How has the pipeline here evolved since you formally opened up this opportunity and any sense of how the initial sales cycles that are win rates as compared to the rest of your business? I know it\u2019s kind of early days still. Chad Richison : Yeah, I would say really no big changes on that. We expanded the market because we had -- we're already having success in it and already had a very strong pipeline as we continue to move up market. I would just say it's more of the same on that and really wouldn't be able to call out many differences than what we've had in the past. We've just formalized our target market up to 10,000 employees now, as we had been having success in that 5,000 to 10,000 range throughout this year. Barvin Chow : Got it. Then on Beti, I know you're not breaking out the split between the 4,000 of new and existing. But maybe of those existing, any sense of how many of them have come back to the table to adopt additional modules, that fully utilize the benefits of employee sell payroll? Chad Richison : Yes. I would say every client that's deployed Beti would have to have the full solution set that Beti requires to be able to even implement Beti. So that would have happened up front. Again, I do want to state that most all of the products required or necessary to work Beti are our most popular products.  And we've always been pretty good at selling the value to both the client and the employee for them taking that product and using it. So Beti itself; it's incremental to our overall revenue and it will prove very positive, but really where it's making the impact, it's driving an incredible amount of value for the client. I mean, it's a very nominal spin for them to add it.  But the value multiple that they are receiving just by adding Beti really makes all the other products that we've already provided to them much more valuable with the stronger return, and it's very measurable for both them and the employee. One thing we are starting to receive a lot more of right now are employee referrals who have used Beti even at one Company, they go to another Company and we're continuing to have strong referrals from rank-and-file employees, that have used our technology and now are at a different location for business. Barvin Chow : That's great to hear congrats again. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Chad Richison. Please go ahead, sir. Chad Richison : All right. I want to thank everyone for joining us today on the call and a special thanks to our employees for helping to deliver another very strong quarter. I'd like to reiterate that I believe getting vaccinated saves lives. So, I hope that everyone who hasn't been vaccinated is able to get it so we can end this pandemic.  On the investor outreach front, this quarter will be participating in several virtual investor conferences, including the Stifel Growth Conference on November 11th, the Needham SaaS one-on-one conference on November 18th and the Barclays Global TMT Conference on December 1st. We look forward to speaking with many of you very soon and appreciate your continued support Paycom. Thank you, Operator, you may disconnect. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We ended 2021 with a very strong quarter and I\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for the outstanding effort they put in to making 2021 a great success. I will spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter 2021 results. Then I will review some of our notable achievements throughout the year. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. 2021 was a very strong year for Paycom. We extended our platform to the employee even further through innovations like Beti, which enables employees to do their own payroll and we are seeing very strong adoption in record employee usage as measured by the DDS. Strong demand continues to bolster our sales momentum and record new client sales in 2021 have positioned us to deliver another year of rapid growth in 2022. For years, I have been predicting the end of the old model whereby HR and payroll personnel\u2019s routine of inputting data for employees is replaced by a self-service model that provides employees direct access to the database. The old model is dying and that is good for both the business and the employee. Paycom is leading this transformation. We will continue to automate the processes that generate maximum ROI for our clients. Our 2021 fourth quarter revenue of $285 million came in very strong up 29% year-over-year. Our full year 2021 revenue of $1.56 billion grew 25% compared to 2020. Employee usage, which is at a record high is a key driver of revenue retention and I am pleased to announce that Paycom\u2019s annual revenue retention rate increased once again to 94% this year, which is a validation of the strong ROI our clients are achieving. Our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA was $419 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 40%. The sum of our 2021 revenue growth rate and adjusted EBITDA margin resulted in us hitting the Rule of 65%, reflecting the solid demand for our solutions and the profitability of our business model and was well ahead of our stated goal to reach the Rule of 60. As you can see with our full year 2022 guidance, we are starting strong with the Rule of 65. Our marketing plan throughout 2021 continued to perform well, delivering strong demo leads throughout the year as we spend aggressively on advertising. More importantly, our sales teams are successfully closing these leads, which is the key driver to our revenue growth. In our first year as our Chief Sales Officer, Holly Faurot has executed fabulously on her sales plan and I am very pleased with the coordination we are seeing across the sales and marketing organizations. We are capitalizing on the shortcomings of disparate HCM systems that are failing both the employees who struggle to use them and the businesses that struggle just to make them work. Our proven single database platform just works better and we continue to differentiate ourselves with easy-to-use solutions that enhance the employee experience and generate maximum ROI for our clients. In response to increasing demand in 2021, we expanded the upper end of our target client size range from 5,000 to 10,000 employees, as we are seeing success selling to larger clients. We are also concurrently expanding geographically to meet the increased demand. In addition to the Manhattan office we announced a few months ago, we recently opened four outside sales offices in the following locations, Las Vegas, Jacksonville, New England and South Jersey. We have now opened five offices in the last five months. That said, I\u2019d remind everyone that we still only have approximately 5% of the TAM today, so there\u2019s plenty of runway ahead to expand and continue to capture market share. Paycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2021. Our latest innovation Beti, was awarded the Top HR Product of the Year honor. As a workplace, we earned the top 20 ranking in Best Places to Work in the U.S. by Top Workplaces and we were named the Top Workplace in Oklahoma for the ninth consecutive year. We were also named the Best Company for Women to Work. These awards are a testament to our execution and thriving corporate culture. As of December 31, 2021, our headcount stood at 5,385 employees, up 28% year-over-year, as we continue to have great success attracting and retaining high quality talent to further bolster our future growth. Additionally, I want to congratulate the 2021 Paycom Jim Thorpe Award winner, Coby Bryant, from the University of Cincinnati. This award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes Jim Thorpe, who was one of the greatest all-around athletes in history. Jim Thorpe also happened to be an Oklahoman. To sum up, we are executing well on all fronts with innovative solutions, high employee usage and increasing revenue retention. Robust market demand and our proven go-to-market strategy are fueling strong new client revenue momentum. I\u2019d like to thank our employees for help making 2021 such a strong year and we are set up to do even better in 2022 and we are off to a great start. With that, I will turn the call over to Craig for review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2021 and our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2022, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the year with very strong results, delivering a milestone full year 2021 revenue total of $1,056 million, up 25.4% compared to 2020. Fourth quarter results were excellent with total revenues of $285 million, representing growth of 29% over the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth is driven by strong demand, new business wins and adoption of recent new product offerings. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $280 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 29% from the comparable prior year period. We ended 2021 with nearly 34,000 clients, representing a growth rate of 9% compared to 2020. On a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with roughly 17,700 clients, representing a growth rate of 10% compared to 2020. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $239.7 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.1%. For the full year 2021, our adjusted gross margin was 85.1%. For 2022, our target adjusted gross margin range is expected to remain strong at approximately 85% to 86%. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $72.3 million or $25.4 of revenues. Our marketing strategy in 2021 has been very effective at driving high quality demo leads, and our outside and inside sales teams have been doing a great job closing these leads. We plan to continue to invest in marketing in Q1 and throughout 2022. In addition, as Chad said, we have added four more outside sales offices, bringing the total outside sales office opening to five new openings in the last five months. We also continue to add inside sales personnel as we grow our sales organization to meet the demand. Adjusted R&D expense was $32.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 or 11.3% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $33.2 million in the prior year period. We aggressively recruited talent in R&D throughout the pandemic. We plan to continue to invest in our future growth through innovation and new product development. Adjusted EBITDA was $109.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 or 38.4% of total revenues, compared to $84.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 or 38.1% of total revenues. For the full year 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $419.3 million or 39.7% of total revenues, compared to $330.8 million or 39.3% of total revenues in 2020. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $48.7 million or $0.84 per diluted share versus $24.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares. For the full year 2021, our GAAP net income was a $196 million or $3.37 per diluted share. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 30.4%. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $64.4 million or $1.11 per diluted share versus $49.1 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year period. For the full year 2021, our non-GAAP net income was $260.4 million or $4.48 per diluted share versus $203.5 million or $3.49 per diluted share in the prior year period. For 2022, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with Q1 GAAP effective tax rate expected to be approximately 30%. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $278 million and total debt of $29 million. Cash from operations was $319 million in 2021, representing an increase of 40.6%, reflecting our strong revenue performance and the profitability of our business model. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. During 2021, we repurchased approximately 164,000 shares for a total of roughly $65.6 million. Through December 31, 2021, Paycom has repurchased nearly 4.3 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $488 million, but we currently have $266 million remaining in our buyback program. Now let me turn to guidance. For fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $1.314 billion to $1.316 billion or nearly 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $524 million to $526 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 40% at the midpoint of the range. We are starting this year\u2019s guidance at the Rule of 65. For the first quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $342 million to $344 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of 26% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $161 million to $163 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 47% at the midpoint of the range. 2021 was a very strong year for Paycom as a direct result of the investments we made. We will continue to invest in talent, marketing, innovation, customer service and geographic expansion to meet the strong demand we are experiencing and to support our high expectations for long-term future growth. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey. Thank you. Congrats to a great finish to the year. Chad and Craig, I\u2019d like two questions. One was on the retention rates of 94% is kind of again up from last year, very, very strong number, especially considering where you were playing in the market. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there and does that kind of -- is being -- how are you thinking about this number going forward? And then the second question is where I got a lot of questions were from investors was around the customer add. Obviously, last year, especially with the pandemic, so you had like a crazy big number there, that kind of moderated this year, like how do you -- how should we think about it, especially in light of your comments, Craig, around the investments on inside and outside deals? Thank you. Chad Richison : Yeah. Raimo, so starting with the first on retention, it was about three or four years ago that we started to increase that rate. We would been 91% for six years straight and then it jumped up to 92%. And it really jumped up once we started implementing employee usage products. We would come out with the app, it went up. Then we looked at the year before, the pandemic hit in 2020, it went up again to 93%. Again, we had driven through the direct data exchange, having employees make those changes themselves, increased satisfaction again for those clients as it increased their return on investment. 2020 we held the line at 93% and that had somewhat to do -- it\u2019s a trailing revenue, trailing 12 revenue retention number. Obviously 2020, we did have some retreat in our revenue, just the natural attrition that came from those employees being laid off or leaving their business during the pandemic and then now in 2021, we have been able to increase it once again to 94%. And answer to that question, though, it\u2019s all really driven by usage. The more success a client has using our products, the greater the return on the investment they are achieving and that makes them want to stay with us longer. And so how high can it go? Obviously, at some point you do have to look at, you are always going to have a certain number of clients that could be bought, sold and merged. But I -- we are very ambitious with that number. We are seeing a lot of satisfaction across the client base. So I don\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we are done with our retention aspirations, but we feel really good by being able to raise it again. As far as the client count that you mentioned, in 2019, our parent company group and those are decision, client decisions, grew by 6.5%, that client number. Of course, today in 2021, it grew 10%. Last year, it grew 18% and that was really in conjunction with the fact that we added small business teams to sell small business units. We accelerated our advertising spend in 2020, which generated a high volume of leads, a lot of those were beneath the 50 employee range. And so that\u2019s when we added several teams to catch that and that really -- we benefitted that from a percentage growth unit add. I would point out that in 2020 even though we did have around 18% parent company group growth from a unit perspective, our growth per client, billings per client annualized were was roughly flat and in 2021 that number is up about 14%. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Congrats. Chad Richison : Thank you. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Samad Samana of Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi. Great. Congrats. I will echo that as well just a really great end to 2021. So, maybe, Chad, I want to just to follow up on Raimo\u2019s question and you kind of touched on it a little bit there at the end. But if I think about the net adds that you have added in the context of the, call it, net new recurring revenue, you are getting to like an average customer size of new customers added like north of $70,000 of average revenue versus, like let\u2019s call it, in the 50s, maybe looking back to 2019. So you are seeing pretty significant growth there. I am just curious, is that a fair way to think about it that you are just signing customers that are even much larger today than in 2021 and how should we maybe think about that just on the historical comparison? Chad Richison : Sure. So it\u2019s been similar as what you have seen us pick up in the past as we have continued to focus on larger clients that\u2019s driven that number up. We are having more success selling larger clients. So you might say that the ones we are bringing in on average are larger than what we bring -- brought in in the past. We are selling more of them. So we are just having more unit counts at that level than what we have had in the past. And then, obviously, we have continued to add product into the mix, which also adds value to each deal that we bring in, regardless of what size they are at. Samad Samana : Great. And then maybe just a follow-up, Beti is impacting retention in a positive way. I am curious if you can maybe update us on what the traction is in terms of getting the install base to using Beti and how we should think about that progression in 2022. Chad Richison : Yeah. So we are having a lot of success with the install base using Beti. I mean, internally, there is a little bit of a process change for our clients. You are moving things that you were doing after the payroll ends, the pay period ends. You are moving that to the beginning. But we continue to have success selling Beti, both into our current install base. And as a reminder, all new business that we have brought on since July of last year all have Beti included in its pricing and usage expectation. Samad Samana : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Brad Reback of Stifel. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Just a first quick one. Chad, can you remind us how many sales teams, both internal and external, you have today and maybe where that was a year ago? Chad Richison : Sure. Craig? Craig Boelte : Yeah. So outside sales teams, we are at 54 now, and as we mentioned, we have added the four recent ones and then we added one towards the end of last year. So we have added five of those. And then in terms of inside sales teams, from our KPIs, we count the inside and the CRR group as one. But we have also announced that we have had over -- have 10 plus we are adding to the inside sales group. Chad Richison : And so outside sales is at 54 I think right now\u2026 Craig Boelte : Yes. Chad Richison : \u2026total outside sales teams. Brad, the last time we added sales, outside sales team, we added in 2019, we added our New Orleans office. We did not add any in 2020. The end of 2021s when we brought through Manhattan and then we continued on with four since then. Brad Reback : That\u2019s great. And maybe just following up to close the loop on the unit versus pricing dynamic, with these added sales teams, would it be right to assume that we could probably see a more even split in 2022 with the 25% growth between unit and price or maybe even a little more unit? Chad Richison : I am not sure. I -- we are not as focused on unit growth, I would say. I mean, obviously, we want to win our deals. Sometimes our unit growth goes up, as it did in 2020, just because of the success we had with our inside sales group. Obviously, those deals have a smaller revenue contribution. So as we turned into 2021 and we had success selling in 2020 as well above our range, but in 2021 we raised our range because we continue to have so much success. So our focus continues to be the mid-market, but we also have success below and that is really what contributes to the increase in unit count are the small unit deals. Brad Reback : Got it. Thanks very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Mark Marcon of Baird. Mark Marcon : Hey. Good afternoon. Let me add my congratulations. With regards to the revenue per client increasing by 14%, how much of that is just because of the bigger clients that you are selling relative to an increase in terms of the number of employees per client just as employment came back versus adding more modules or selling more modules? Is there a way to think about that in terms of the three elements? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, well it\u2019s going to be driven by size of client number of modules sold into client, for sure. Any contribution from improving employment in regards to our base would be minimal. Mark Marcon : Okay. So that that was a minimal contribution in terms of the employees in the base. Chad Richison : Correct. Mark Marcon : Great. And then, can you talk a little bit about the assumptions for the gross margins, obviously, continue to be best in class? I am wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the expectations here for 2022. What are you assuming in terms of average flow balance and with rates starting to finally move back up? How much do you think you could end up capturing as rates start hopefully normalizing? Craig Boelte : Yeah. In our gross margins, we don\u2019t anticipate, we don\u2019t factor in any rate increases. I mean, obviously, if there are rate increases, which they are talking about here in the first quarter in March, that would be a tailwind to us based on the average daily balance somewhere between $4 million and $5 million on an annual basis. But that would layer in Mark. I mean, it wouldn\u2019t come to us the day increase rates. So that\u2019s something that kind of layers in over time. Mark Marcon : Is that $4 million to $5 million for -- how many basis points? Craig Boelte : Per quarter basis for 2025, right? Chad Richison : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It would on an annual basis, brings 25-basis-point increase. Craig Boelte : For the 12 months. Mark Marcon : Yeah. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Ryan MacDonald of Needham. Josh Reilly : Hey, guys. This is Josh on for Ryan. Congrats on the strong year and quarter here. I am curious, now that you have just opened five sales offices, what are you seeing in the macro that it\u2019s kind of giving you this confidence here over the last couple of quarters to open these offices? And then are you seeing improved activity in Hospitality and some of the troubled industries from the pandemic starting to pick up here materially before Omicron hit? And then what kind of a pause are you seeing with Omicron, if any? Chad Richison : Yeah. First, I would talk about the office openings. I mean, demand is really what\u2019s driving us to add more sales teams. Again, we started really spending heavily on marketing in 2020. It brought on high quality revenue that produced very strong margins for us and we continue to have elevated leads. And so -- and again, we didn\u2019t really open anything in 2020. So it\u2019s really time for us to start that again. As it relates to Omicron, I would say that oftentimes we don\u2019t really know why one company may be experiencing less employment today than it did last week and why it may have more next week. So I don\u2019t really see these factors as long as we have stability having a large impact one way or another on our quarters as we move forward. I talked about the importance it will need that we had to lap the pandemic with stability and we have had that substantially since the summer of 2020. So we feel good about where we are at from here and feel like barring any major move and I believe it would have to be major in some type of employment situation, which we don\u2019t expect. I think it should be business as usual for us as we go forward throughout the year. Josh Reilly : Okay. Got it. Great. And then just the follow-up question on the interest income. Is that kind of returns to the model here over the next couple of years, investors are obviously more focused on free cash flow generation with the increasing interest rates. How do you think about the balance of reinvesting that that interest income for growth versus letting it just fall to free cash flow, and ultimately, buying back more shares, obviously, depending on how the stock price goes? Chad Richison : Yeah. Gross price is always growth for us. I mean, we have been investing our profits into growth and they are creating more profits. So, that\u2019s just kind of what\u2019s been happening. But in regards to the interest rates, we wouldn\u2019t do anything than natural than the things we are doing right now. Craig, I don\u2019t know if you would add anything. Craig Boelte : No. I mean, obviously, as I come back, I mean, we would trade off a point of margin for a point of growth, but we are going to still spend wisely as we do -- as you see that we have always done. Chad Richison : And our focus is growing as fast as we can in 2022. So we have that locked and loaded and the funds to be able to do that. Josh Reilly : Great. Thanks, guys. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Siti Panigrahi. Siti Panigrahi : Oh! Siti Panigrahi. Hey. Congratulation. Great quarter. So I was getting two questions about your Q1 guidance. Sequentially, it was 21% is almost similar to last year versus prior to COVID is 30% plus. Is there a similar kind of expectation from W2 and form filing this year as well, Chad, or any other factor you have considered in your guidance? Chad Richison : Yeah. There\u2019s a little bit of that. I would kind of point to how fourth quarter in 2021 was our highest revenue quarter that we have had from a fourth quarter perspective. Meaning, typically first quarter can outpace first quarter -- fourth quarter throughout the years. This year fourth quarter outpaced first quarter in 2021 really hadn\u2019t happened since 2015 then it happened in 2014. Really what\u2019s happening is our revenue make up mix, as we continue to sell more products, both at the time of sale, as well as into the base, the contribution that those annualized form filings has on an overall client annualized revenue that we get from them is smaller. And so the recurring revenue -- monthly recurring we are charging a client you might say is outpacing that that we would have growth in annualized fees, if you will. And so -- and then, yes, I think, you still have some of the trends that we are followed in 2020 or happened again in 2021 somewhat. But I think our comps were a little bit easier comping over this year than what we had going into 2021 W2s versus the 2019 W2s. But anyway, all that\u2019s to say, I think, one thing that\u2019s starting to happen in our revenue mix is that the monthly recurring that we are charging a client due to the additional products that we come up with that they are buying and finding value in is outpacing any growth in our annualized fees. Siti Panigrahi : That\u2019s great color. And then quick follow up on -- now great to see that you already added four to five sales offices and how do you think the competitive landscape will change, your 5,000 above kind of segment, now that you will have sales office and they can do in-person, which is probably more relevant for targeting this high end customer. How should we think about that growth in that\u2026 Chad Richison : Well, I think, it still remains to be seen how prospects are going to buy this technology. We are still, I mean, most people are still buying virtually. Again, we are not going to try to pull clients on to a certain way to buy. We are going to meet them where they live. So if they are used to buying virtually and they want to buy virtually where we have the solution for that, and of course, if clients are wanting us to come out there, we have that availability to be able to do that. But I would say that we are not seeing a huge shift to in-person selling at this point. We remain ready. But, again, that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to -- we are going to meet the client where they live on that. Siti Panigrahi : That\u2019s great. Thank you, Chad. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you. So you measure kind of the sales force metrics. Can you talk a bit about where sales force productivity stands relative to pre-pandemic levels? Chad Richison : Sales productivity is way up from pre-pandemic levels when you look at a -- on a per rep basis or even if you look at a per team basis. When you lose one of your senses, the other takes over and we just -- we became a lot better throughout the pandemic in how we sold. We got better at strategy. We got better at connecting to our prospects. We got better at marketing. We got better at retargeting. So, sales has been very strong and it remains that today. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And as far as employee growth or client employee growth goes, I think, I heard you say, it was minimal in the fourth quarter. Are you embedding any assumption on client employee growth in your 2022 outlook? Chad Richison : No. Bryan Bergin : All right. Thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with our Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe, Chad, for you, if you think about the pipeline, the sales cycles -- sales cycle length and just in general the impact of kind of the Great Resignation, both the puts and takes on the business, where do we stand on all those fronts as we look at 2022? Chad Richison : Yeah. What I would say is, in regards to the\u2026 Alex Zukin : And\u2026 Chad Richison : Sorry. Go ahead. Okay. I would say in regards to the pipeline, our pipeline remains very strong. I also would say through virtual selling, I do think it\u2019s been, to some extent, easier to connect to some of the players that you would have in a large organization. In small organization, you might talk to two or people, but in a large organization, you have multiple decision makers, and in our case, multiple user buyers, because we are impacting many parts of the businesses -- of the business. As far as a tight labor market, I mean, I think, that impacts all of us. We have had a lot of success in the tight labor market, especially in the -- at the -- in the management ranks of being able to increase quality for us in those areas. And we are up 28%. I mean, from an employment perspective. We added 28% to our employee base last year. So definitely we noticed it being tied out there. But and it\u2019s definitely you have to be competitive. But we have had a lot of success building our recruiting teams over the years with very strong learning management systems where we are able to spin up employees quickly, get them started on their career. Alex Zukin : Follow up, Chad, obviously, that the amount of sales offices that you added in 2021 is, I don\u2019t know if you are catching up from kind of where you weren\u2019t able to move as quickly in 2020, obviously. But from the -- to the extent that that\u2019s a direct result of, like, more people being in a position to make a move after being stalled to some extent with COVID whether it\u2019s attrition from your competitors like ADP and Paychex or whether it\u2019s the competitive environment. There was a large hack, a ransomware attack at UKG. Like what is the competitive set or landscape look like and how is your income dialed in investment incrementally and kind of expanding the sales team number by a lot more than in previous years? What is that -- what\u2019s the signal we are supposed to take away from that? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, we are focused on dominating the industry and really providing businesses with a very strong return on investment and really, that\u2019s happening. I mean a lot of the things that we are competing against are just, they are old ways to use systems. And I believe over time and you are starting to see that, it just becomes more and more difficult to use them. So, and we only have 5% of the market. I mean, that\u2019s the other thing. So we have such an opportunity. Demand continues to increase, the popularity of our brands getting stronger. We have a lot stronger proof sources or larger clients and we have increased retention rate, which shows you that they are just having a lot of success with it. And what was your question about UKG? Alex Zukin : Oh! I was just asking, have you seen any impact from the hack that they suffered or the security breach in terms of more clients, has that been a pain point that has been used by more clients to switch providers? Chad Richison : Yeah. I just wanted to get you to say it again. We are having success with that. It\u2019s a pretty bad deal when you are down that long and we are having success with that. Our hearts go out to those clients and especially their employees that are impacted. And -- but those are those are a little bit longer sales cycle when you are talking about the larger deals. I think this happened in December. Obviously, we are on it. We do believe that we are going to have success taking some business. And I mean, I think, if you are a CFO or HR person, you would be hard pressed to stay in that environment without quite a few explanations. I mean, at some points, you got the read the room on what industry you are in. And there\u2019s a lot of restaurants that won\u2019t serve you salmonella 32 days in a row. You might want to eat at one of them. Thanks for the question. Alex Zukin : Thanks, Chad. Operator : Our next question is with Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. Brian Schwartz : Yeah. Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter and thanks so much for taking my questions. Chad, just a follow-up again on your optimism on the demand trends, as well as the sales success of that that you experienced in the quarter, clearly your marketing and sales expansions having some fruition. I just wanted to ask you again here, are you seeing any changes at all in the environment in terms of maybe what customers are asking for on top of the payroll or anything, the competition or is your optimism about the demand trend just kind of strong productivity across the sales force today? Chad Richison : Yeah. Well, I think, we definitely have strong productivity across our sales force. But I do believe that that\u2019s driven by high-quality leads and a differentiated product strategy that clients are having a lot of success for it. You sell one thing, but we are able to prove it out as well and so we go out there. We onboard clients onto our product and then we are able to prove out the value they are receiving. And so, the more you do that, the more that increases demand as well as it increases confidence with your sales force. The salesperson goes out there and has an incredible amount of success bringing someone onto our platform and that\u2019s a happy client. A lot of confidence is built up within the sales staff. And so, we had to shift strategies here, we didn\u2019t start off with the employee does the work and inputs the data into the system themselves through the DDX. We didn\u2019t start off with that. We didn\u2019t start off with self-service payroll. And so, there\u2019s been a little bit of a shift from our sales department selling it one way and really coming into their own with understanding the value of selling it the correct way, which is how the clients are going to currently use the product. So, we are very bullish on that and really our demand hasn\u2019t seen much or any of the tail off and I am thinking of since 2020, since we came out in 2020. Of course, it\u2019s up from there from what we would have sold in 2020. But since those first couple of weeks in the pandemic when we shifted into virtual leads and increase in marketing and really becoming more efficient in our areas, we have had a lot of success since that time and I haven\u2019t seen us take a step back since that time. Brian Schwartz : Thanks, Chad. And one follow-up for Craig, Craig, I have a question on the 4Q cash flow. It came in far above what we were modeling. You pointed out the revenue upside is one of the driver. I just wanted to ask you, did some of the spend plan for 4Q, did that get pushed into 1Q or were there any other anomalies to explain the outsized cash flow growth in the quarter? Thanks. Craig Boelte : No. I would say it\u2019s mostly just timing, a little bit of timing Q3 to Q4 to Q1. But, I mean, really nothing unusual there. I mean -- and part of it\u2019s just the overall strength of the quarter. We had a very strong quarter from a revenue perspective as well for Q4. Brian Schwartz : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Our next question is with Robert Simmons of D.A. Davidson. Robert Simmons : Hey. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess, most of them have been asked and answered already. I guess, have you thought about giving new updated for ASC 606\u2019s long-term target margins? Craig Boelte : Under ASC 606, I am not exactly sure of the question. We are continuing to\u2026 Robert Simmons : The long-term margins, you used to give like a long-term EBITDA margin, not guide, but a target as you do it\u2026 Craig Boelte : ASC 606 long-term. Robert Simmons : \u2026realities? Chad Richison : Yeah. Correct. We did and I think we continue to hit that and then we would update it. And you are right as we went to ASC 606 we have not updated those long-term margins. We have strong margins that we are starting off with right now. Again, we are focused on growth, but our growth is producing high quality, profitable business. So, for us, we are focused on the growth side, but we do have healthy strong margins. It\u2019s something we have to take a look at internally of when we may be able to update what our long-term growth margin looks like, but we are focused on growing for the foreseeable future. Craig Boelte : Yeah. And I would say, I mean, one thing we are really starting this year, just leave it our margin off it where we finished last year. So coming out strong out of the gate, a couple of things kind of looking into 2022 just on a modeling, stock comp, we would expect it to be around $110 million, up slightly from this year. And then one thing, we did bring our Grapevine office facility online here at the end of the fourth quarter. So we are going to see a little bit of an increase in the depreciation for 2022 as it relates to that facility, probably, up around 50 basis points as a percent of revenue. And then, one thing else that we have announced is kind of the expansion in Oklahoma City as well. So CapEx will be similar to last year as it relates to CapEx. So all of those play into our margins or some of those you would add and subtract it out for adjusted EBITDA, but we are really excited about where we are starting 2022 with the Rule of 65. Robert Simmons : On the CapEx, is that similar dollar amount or similar percent of revenue? Craig Boelte : Percent of revenue. Robert Simmons : Got it. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is with Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Bhavin Shah : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Chad, just any commentary you can provide in terms of which modules are seeing increased adoption as HR becomes more strategic with the Great Resignation? And then are you seeing any customers that -- are you seeing more customers come back to the table or even the size of land get bigger? Chad Richison : Yeah. So, well, first, I would start with the modules. We have always had healthy uptake and I have always said the longer we have a module, the more uptake we have in it. When you deploy Beti, it does require certain modules to be implemented into the client base -- into that client in order for them to use Beti. So that\u2019s helpful oftentimes with our modules, especially for the new clients that we bring on that have Beti, of which all of them do. So that\u2019s helpful there. As far as module impact that we see, I mean, you are seeing some impact on learning management just as people are looking to both retain, as well as speed up training for new employees. Obviously, our recruiting, that product has been very strong going throughout the pandemic to be able to identify those people that you want to hire. But as far as when we look at the product mix, we have had healthy usage across all of them and it really just depends on what industry and what area client might be in, to whether or not they would use all of those modules or not, if that makes sense. And then, as far as seeing customers come back to the table, we are not having a lot of losses on customers as we just talked about our retention rate going up. When we do lose a client, though, it is -- we get a meeting with them normally pretty quick, just because of the usage around their employee base. If we are looking at DDX of 95%, where employees are making 95% of all the changes into the system, that\u2019s a client that finds it hard difficult to leave without destroying their return on investment and all the automation that they had achieved through our product. So we have a lot of win backs there, but I would just start off by saying, we are not really losing as many as we once did. Bhavin Shah : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just quick follow up on your office openings. I mean, as you guys open up five offices after not opening one and a half over years, how do you ensure that you don\u2019t see any disruption to your productivity with your other offices as you shift around personnel and make them sales leaders? And to the other point, like, how do we think about sales productivity ramping for these five offices, is there any change to the historical cadence? Chad Richison : Well, you don\u2019t ever take top managers out of an office and relocate them to a new office where they start off with zero employees and you don\u2019t have some impact on that office where those managers came from, because we are -- these are some of our top managers that we relocate like that now. But what you are going to gain out of that new office is going to cover up anything that may have been negatively impacted on the old and then by the time they get to maturity, there\u2019s not much difference between the two, but, well, there\u2019s not a difference between the two on what their quota is and oftentimes quota achievement. And so, I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s necessarily a giant sacrifice that we make, but you do whenever you do move managers out of an office, you do have an impact. Now, we are disrupting five of those. There used to be a time where we would disrupt four out of 12. So the disruption to us is a little bit less and I am using disruption, I don\u2019t know that that would be the right word to use to be honest with you, but you -- it does take a little bit for those managers as they get into those new territories to spin up, but they are our best managers, so they spin out pretty quickly. Bhavin Shah : Got it. Helpful. Thanks so much. Chad Richison : Yeah. Operator : Our final question is with Daniel Jester of BMO. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just piggyback on the last question, are all of the five new offices fully staffed today? Chad Richison : No. Our method is\u2026 Daniel Jester : And\u2026 Chad Richison : \u2026we get -- oh, sorry, go ahead. Daniel Jester : No. No. No. Finish, Chad, please. Chad Richison : Our method is that typically we will hire force -- a fully staffed office has eight sales reps. We will start off with three or four in an office, they get selling pipeline. They start getting starts. As we have said in the past, it usually takes 24 months for an office to get to maximum maturity and that\u2019s where they have the same quota, the same number of reps with the same level of pipelines and with the same level of expectation that we would have for their success as any other mature office. Daniel Jester : Got you. And then just to wrap up on, Beti. When the product went live, Chad, you made some comments about how long you thought it would take to get full penetration into the base. Now that we have seen sort of the growth in the adoption, any updated thoughts about how that progression is going to evolve? Thank you. Chad Richison : I still feel strongly about what I said in the past. I mean, Beti, ensures perfect payrolls. It ensures you are not going to have manual checks. You are not going to have voids. You are not going to have employees with overdrafts and everything else. So we continue to have a lot of success deploying Beti and I still expect that all of our clients will be using Beti at some point. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you very much. Chad Richison : All right. Thank you. All right. Well, I would like to thank everyone for joining us today on the call and a special thanks to our employees for helping deliver another very strong year. This quarter we will be participating in the KeyBanc and Morgan Stanley conferences in San Francisco on March 8th and March 9th, respectively. Both should be in-person, but we will see. We look forward to speaking with many of you very soon. We appreciate your continued support in Paycom. Thank you, Operator. You may disconnect. Operator : That concludes our Paycom Software Fourth Quarter 2021 Results Conference [ph] Call. Thanks for your participation. You may...",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I'll spend a few minutes on the highlights of the quarter. Then I'll focus on the opportunities that I expect to drive strong performance going forward. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we'll take questions. Our 2022 first quarter revenue of approximately $354 million came in very strong of 30% year-over-year and was well ahead of the expectations, thanks to strong growth in recurring revenue from new business sales and modestly better revenue from seasonal forms, filings and adjustments. This quarter has set us up really well to strong financial performance for the remainder of the year and we are raising our full year guidance as a result. With our new full year outlook for revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin, I now believe we can exceed the Rule of 65. Employee usage continues to trend higher as more companies embrace our self-service solutions and push ownership of the data out to the employee. Increasing employee usage is a key component of the ROI that our clients realize and we believe our employee usage strategy is a competitive advantage and a driver of our very strong growth. Already, well over a quarter of our clients have implemented and/or in the process of implementing Beti, our most advanced employee usage payroll experience to date. In less than a year over 10,000 of our clients have embraced Beti is the right way to do payroll. Beti is fundamentally a better way to run all payroll processes to the benefit of the employer and employee. We will continue to innovate Beti to deliver even more value to our clients, making it even more compelling. Beti is the future of payroll. Our marketing plan continues to perform very well, delivering strong demo leads and brand recognition across our target market. We are also having a lot of success with our retarget efforts and leveraging our digital assets. We recently launched a new ad campaign highlighting how employees have been given the wrong tools for their jobs. With Paycom, employees have the right HCM tools at their fingertips. Our marketing efforts target employee usage at both large and small clients and we're having great success attracting new clients, which is a key component of our rapid revenue growth. On the sales front, I'm pleased with the execution and progress we are making to further penetrate the markets we are in. I just returned from our President's Club meeting in Florida with our top sales reps and it was fantastic to see how everyone is energized and aligned with our go-to-market strategy. Just a few years ago, we celebrated leading sales reps who sold over $1 million in a year. Today, we are celebrating sales reps exceeding $2 million in sales in a year. Holly Faurot has done an outstanding job aligning the sales organization and the collaboration with the marketing organization is working very well. In fact, both organizations recently received Best Marketing department and Best Sales department awards. These awards are in addition to the awards we received for best companies for women and Forbes list of best mid-size employers and top workplaces. I am more confident than ever that we have the right team and culture in place to achieve our growth expectations. As a reminder, we only have approximately 5% of a very large and growing TAM and a long runway for rapid growth for many years to come. Also, I want to say thank you to Jon Evans, who was with Paycom for eight years and was our COO for four of those years, as he took over for Stacy [ph]. Jon did a great job for this company, like anyone who does a great job for Paycom, their DNA exists in the company long after they're gone. We are always excited to turn over the department to the next generation of leadership such as Justin Long and we know he'll take this group to the next level as has been proven every time we make strategic moves like this to sum up, we To sum up, we kicked off the year with a great first quarter and are entering the second quarter with very strong momentum. Our differentiated strategy, our people and the value we are delivering to our clients are fuelling our long term growth. I want to thank our employees for their hard work and exceptional performance this quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks Chad. Before I review our first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. First quarter 2022 results were excellent with total revenues of $353.5 million representing growth of 30% over the comparable prior year period. In Q1, we had very strong recurring revenue growth from strong starts and modestly better-than-expected annual forms, filings and adjustments revenue. Our revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for easy-to-use employee focused solutions and our success in attracting new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $348.2 million for the first quarter representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 30% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the first quarter was $306 million representing an adjusted gross margin of 86.6% and we remain on target to achieve strong full-year adjusted gross margin in the range of 85% to 86%. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2022 was $72.1 million or 20.4% of revenues compared to 21.8% of revenues in the prior year period. We continue to see strong return on investment from our advertising spend and plan to continue to invest aggressively in marketing and advertising throughout 2022. Adjusted R&D expense was $29.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 or 8.3% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D cost, including the capitalized portion were $42.9 million in the first quarter compared to $34 million in the prior year period. Innovation continues to be a key area of investment for us and we have a deep pipeline of projects that we are pursuing. Adjusted EBITDA was $170.1 million in the first quarter of 2022 or 48.1% of total revenues compared to $133 million in the prior year or 48.9% of total revenues. Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was $91.9 million or a $1.58 per diluted share versus $64.6 million or a $1.11 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2022 was $110.6 million or $1.90 per diluted share $85.9 million or a $1.47 per diluted share in the prior year period. For 2022, we anticipate our full-year effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $361 million in total debt of $29 million. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Now let me turn to guidance. Based on the very strong first quarter results and the strong demand trends we are seeing, we are raising our full-year 2022 guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $1.333 billion to $1.335 billion or 26% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $533 million to $535 million representing adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% at the midpoint of the range. Combined revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin, we now expect to exceed the Rule of 65 that we reported last year. For the second quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $308 million to $310 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in the range of $111 million to $113 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 36% at the midpoint of the range. The strength of our results and our raise guidance clearly reflect our confidence in the market demand for our solutions and the success we are having in expanding our market share from the roughly 5% share of the TAM that we have today. We have a high margin recurring revenue model, a strong balance sheet, and with the investments we are making and the success of our sales model, we are very well positioned to deliver another year of rapid revenue growth and robust adjusted EBITDA margin. With that we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions] The first question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. You line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you and congrats from me. That's an amazing quote and interesting guidance and very strong guidance. I wanted to kind of talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the market. Obviously there's like a nervousness about like how your European situation might spill over to the US. Doesn't look like it, but like maybe any comments on that one Chad. But then also I wanted to hear more from you around momentum in the different customer segments around large customers, small customers inside skills, what what's driving the strong momentum especially if I look at Q2 guidance that looks stronger than what you've done historically. Thank you. Chad Richison : Yeah. So first, as you're aware, our focus is here domestic here in the US. We are focused on those businesses. Our system does allow people to store employees that work internationally. So, as far as the impact on what's going on in Europe, I think from a macro level, I think it somewhat impacts every business, but for us, we only have 5% of the TAM out there continuing to drive new business revenue and that's not keeping us from being able to do that although, our hearts go out to what's going on over there. In your next question what's driving our momentum, we are having a lot of success above the 1,000 employee mark as more and more businesses look to deploy self-service technology in the hands of their employees. And then as long as you're deploying self-service technology in those employees' hands, you may as well deploy something that does the most for them or something that they can do the most on. And so that's definitely help drive our momentum as we continue to move forward. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. And then quick one quick follow up, if I think about the flow of balance, how are a potentially higher interest rates impacting you and how immediate does that affect? Chad Richison : Yeah, so, Raimo, we had a 25 basis improvement towards the end of first quarter. So, that takes a while to layer into our numbers. We're still investing in fairly short term, but obviously looking at the best way to deploy those balances. So, as they would go up, then we would -- we would start to see impact over time on those increased rates. Operator : The next question is from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe Chad first for you just, I know the company opened several new offices. I'm curious if those have been fully staffed already and maybe how those staffing of that it was informed the kind of stronger than normal guidance that you gave for the rest of the year even on top of a very strong 1Q? Chad Richison : Yeah. I can tell you all of the new offices have been open and they are producing already. So each of them do produce. It takes two years for an office to reach full maturity, but obviously we're going to continue to generate revenue from them as they're in the maturing state. So, definitely some of the revenue that we would expect, the revenue growth that we would expect to achieve this year, there will be some contributions from those offices, although small. I think -- I would think you would see a larger contribution from those offices next year and definitely as you look into 2024. Samad Samana : Great. And then Craig, maybe just a follow-up to Raimo question. I know we've only seen a 25 raise in fed funds rate, but can you just help us understand, are you baking any further increases into the guidance or is the revised guidance just as of what's already been happened, not the scuttle butter on future potential raises? Craig Boelte : Yeah, the guidance we gave is really kind of where we are today on what we're earning today. So that included that first 25 basis point increase. So, they're talking about additional raises even this week. So we kind of have to see how those layer into our -- into our earnings. Samad Samana : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats with strong quarter. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Samana. The next question is from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Chad, is your sellers get back to face-to-face interactions, have you seen any change of productivity as a result? I know you were really productivity over the last few years, but any changes? Chad Richison : No, I wouldn't say we're back to face to face. We're doing some of them face to face. So we're definitely doing more this quarter than we did the last quarter. But I wouldn't say that we are back face to face the way we were pre-pandemic. I do believe going face to face has opportunities to impact in a positive way or close ratios as we do that. But as we sit here today, it would be hard for me to say that we've fully made that shift again. We're still meeting clients where they live and we're still walking through that process and a substantial number of our clients and definitely the overwhelming majority of our meetings are still being held virtually, and I believe that we're doing that for the benefit of efficiency for both the client as well as us. Brad Reback : Great. And then switching gears, I think it was last week, ADP talked about more aggressive price increases to reflect the current inflationary environment. From your over the last 20 years, what type of impact does that have on the market and overall customer demand? Chad Richison : Well, as you know Brad, we did our very first pricing adjustment in 2019. It impacted a very small subset of our client base. And we generated around 1% at that time. At that time, I mentioned that, as we look at pricing adjustments and we increase the ROI for our clients, it would only make sense that we were able to share in the ROI that we increased. And that's really how we look at it, regardless of inflation or anything else. If are increasing the ROI for a client, there's an opportunity for us to share in that value that we create through pricing adjustments and if we don't do that, then it really doesn't matter if there's inflation or anything else. We really don't have that opportunity. So, as far as what another company might do, how that could impact us not so sure on that. But, for us our pricing adjustments to the extent we do one would be based on an increased over return on investment that our clients are achieving. Brad Reback : That's great. Thanks very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Reback. The next question is from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hey, good afternoon and congratulations on the excellent results. Wondering, can you talk a little bit about the Beti conversions that you've had so far and what sort of revenue uplift you've seen and then, what's been the change in terms of the level of client engagement and satisfaction and early reads in terms of retention trends among those clients? Chad Richison : Yeah, well from a rolling out Beti, we started doing that in July for all new clients, all quotes -- for all quotes given in July, those quotes all had Beti and so it was a part of our ongoing strategy. And so the reason I'm saying that is the way a new client would approach Beti is a little bit different than the way a current client would approach Beti. And what I mean by that, a current client does have to go through a bit of conversion and they're not necessarily in a conversion mode the way a new client. They're already in a conversion mode and so there's a little bit difference there in how we work with one or the other, but we're also getting a lot better at deploying, making those conversions and helping the client set up their data sets that they have to feed into Beti in order to make it work for them payroll after payroll. And so in answer to your question from a retention, absolutely, the more of a product businesses use in our case, the more products that they use, the longer they stay and the happier that they are. So we're having a lot of success getting Beti out there. Mark Marcon : Chad, do you get a revenue lift on the clients that you are converting to Beti and if so\u2026 Chad Richison : We do, yes. Beti yeah, Beti provides an incremental revenue opportunity for us. It's as I said, in the past it's a nominal fee. It's one of 29 modules, but we do get a revenue uplift each time we sell Beti to a current client or if we sell Beti to a new client, their pricing includes Beti and so that would be a larger fee than what it would've been prior to Beti being included. Mark Marcon : And so in terms of expectations, what's built into your expectations in terms of conversions among the client base that currently doesn't have Beti through the balance of the year? And then as it relates to the rate question and the float income, to what extent would you let that incremental benefit flow through to the operating line as opposed to investing it? Chad Richison : Well, taking the latter first, we're always trying to invest, our first opportunity is to invest in growth and so we're always looking to do that, but we were also very disciplined in what we do. The first question was as far as, is Beti built into our forecast, as far as what we're looking to do. It's been built into our forecast the whole time. I've been very aggressive about the expectations about our hopes for bringing Beti in. Although I'm happy with 10,000 clients on it, or well over a quarter of our clients, there are a lot of clients out there that aren't yet, as well as their employees, that aren't yet experiencing the benefits and the ROI that Beti can deliver. And so that's what we're focused on doing. I don't know that we're gonna hit, my expectations for speed on that we rarely do in situations like that. But what I will say is we're talking about 10,000 clients that have either signed up for it or already converted and this is a product that we started really putting out their own quotes beginning in July. So it's hard for me to find another product that's moving as fast as what Beti's moved with the exception of our ACA product like in 2016. Mark Marcon : Terrific. Thank you, Chad. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Marcon. [Operator instructions] The next question is from Ryan MacDonald with Needham. Your line is open. Ryan MacDonald : Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Chad, last quarter on the call, there was discussion of a competitor of Paycom, dealing with a hack issue in December. Obviously that competitor being at the higher end of the market, you mentioned those sales cycles take a bit longer to process through. Just curious, obviously now, sort of five months post that, how you're feeling competitively and if you've been able to successfully have some competitive wins there? Thanks. Chad Richison : Well, yeah, definitely. We've had competitive wins, but we always have, it's not that, we don't have a pull the thorn out of your strategy. Ours is a full strategy that we go through and definitely as clients were going through having their system down and having to implement all of these different technologies and/or do it manually, so that their employees could get paid. Some of them didn't. That becomes a thorn out of the palm moment, where we can pull that thorn out, and now you're not hurting exactly right now, but that's not necessarily driving an overall strategy for a business and how that changes. And most businesses of that size, I would say or all businesses of that size are pretty strategic and smart about how they move forward in it. And so all the that's to say is that it would've been odd with at the time that that happen that we would've converted all these businesses overnight because, we're not going to do unnatural things to bring in clients without them understanding what they're buying and how the value is created, because it's important for us to retain them in order for us to really generate revenue and especially margin and adjusted EBITDA from them. Ryan MacDonald : Excellent. Thanks. And then just as a follow up, just curious at what you're seeing sort of down market in terms of inbound lead flow for your inside sales teams and how you're feeling about the capacity of those teams currently, any thoughts of sort of incremental investment to expand the number of teams through the remainder of the year. Thanks, Chad Richison : We would expand the number of teams to meet up with the demand. What's driving the demand is our advertising spend. We continue to spend heavily in advertising because it's working. So as our marketing and advertising efforts continue to drive more leads than obviously we would want to make sure we have that group staffed to be able to handle those leads. The small market group, which handles under 50 employees represents about 5% of our revenue. So, when you're talking about how many resources that we would add to grow that into the future, definitely enough to service and be able to sell what the demand is that we're generating from our lead and marketing and advertising volume, but not so much that it shifts our focus and strategy away from what we're trying to capture here. Ryan MacDonald : Thanks for the color. Congrats again. Operator : Thank you, Mr. MacDonald. The next question is from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question. Chad, just one clarification and then follow-up, you said this that revenue from filing and tax models better. So is it now to the pre-pandemic level? Chad Richison : No. Siti Panigrahi : Okay. And then when you're thinking, in terms of product innovation, we heard about DDX now Beti, so how are you thinking about what's in terms of product innovation, adding more in features to differentiate further as you are moving up market? Chad Richison : Yeah, well, we have a deep pipeline of products that we continue to work on. You'll continue to see products released throughout the year. It's very important that we continue to drive and have success with the current as we have, because they're a building block of what we do next as everything has been as we've rolled it out. So everything's a building block for what's next. So it's always important for us to roll products out and then get usage. I've been on these calls and listened to different competitors calls and I'll hear them announce a product and two years later they have 300 clients on it, where, we put this out in July to all clients and put it in all quotes and we're already at 10,000 and over a quarter of our clients and so that's very good and as you get version one done, you shift quickly and version two, version three, version four, you're never done developing products and so we're continuing to enhance the products we have to have greater usage on them, and that leads to other products which will continue to roll out through this year. Siti Panigrahi : That's great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi guys. Good afternoon. Thank you. First one here on just the client employment base. Can you kind of comment on how client pays for control progressed during the quarter, and where do you estimate your client's employment base now stands relative to those pre-pandemic levels? Chad Richison : I wouldn't say that client employment had a big impact on us outside of the fact that it's stable. That's the main thing that we need, with the exception of massive unemployment, which we did see in the pandemic that happened very quickly. Quarter to quarter, I can't say that employment trends have big impacts on us due to the growth nature of our business, other than to say, if they're not -- they're not stable and I believe that they've been stable for quite some time now. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then just on the salesforce, can you talk about the salesforce growth and your salesforce retention? How that has trended here over the last several quarters? Chad Richison : Substantially unchanged maybe a little better I would say. Actually in the last year, we do know that our sales retention is a little better. Holly Faurot took over and we've had a little better sales retention, but that's also because we've got more reps moving into that executive rep position and we just have higher retention with those groups. And as they sell more quicker, they move in to that executive rep position even quicker. And so I do know that sales retention is higher than what it's been, but sales retention always remains a challenge because we have aggressive goals and there's a lot to sell as you go through -- as you go through these products, but I would say well, for sure it's improved some, but a lot of that just has to do with the people hitting executive rep even faster than what they've done in the past. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Makes sense. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Bergin. The next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So maybe just the first one, Chad, given this is probably one of the largest beats, I think you've had in Q1, and I think one of the largest raises you've had, a lot of the questions we get to kind of Raimo's first question is around how to think about your business in terms of recession resiliency or recession exposure. You've been -- you've run this company for a long time through many economic cycles. And this one seems a little different given the difficult hiring environment that most of your customers are experiencing. So just maybe comment on your, like, what's driving your incremental level of confidence in the face of some of these macro issues and a quick follow up. Chad Richison : Well, I think tight labor markets, they do a couple of things. One thing it does is you have to do more with less and one way to do more with less is have the right technology that you're deploying for everyone. If you're in a a business that move pipe around, not everybody drives the forklift, but everybody does use the app. So, with our system, you're able to really impact the entire company and to some extent, it gets more difficult to hire back office people as well. And so we're able to make that impact. So I think from that perspective, it's helpful. It's always a good time to automate and become more efficient for any business and I think that when you run through markets like this, it forces people. In good times, you don't necessarily see what's going wrong and in times that get a little bit tougher, it forces you to make those changes within your business that creates efficiency through automation and that's where we come in. So, it provided again that we're not having massive unemployment shifts. I believe we're in really good shape as we move throughout this year. Alex Zukin : Perfect. And then maybe just a bigger picture tech question, if you look at as you move up market, and as we move into an environment that's normalizing the concept of hybrid work, some of your competitors have native or have acquired native capabilities for doing kind of global payroll. How important is that as particularly as you move up market, as companies start hiring in various geographies and even on a global basis, how do you think about, I think you partnered that for that technology today, but what's the longer term plan to offer that type of functionality natively? Chad Richison : Well, everything has its time and place and there's certain things that you're able to provide for a customer ahead of some others even, but everything has its time and place and, I would say everything is important, not everything's urgent. So we continue to review those things that make sense for us. Again, we don't preclude our clients that have international employees from using third party. I would even go to say that using one system for all your US and even putting your expats and other international employees into that system and using a third party for payroll because you're in Germany. I can honestly say that even in that environment, we're a better fit than the eight legged octopus with no head they would use otherwise. All that said, everything does have its time and place for what we develop and win and we continue to be ambitious with being the largest in our industry and that takes some time and I believe that we've got a lot of strong momentum and we're heading the right way on that. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Well, keep doing good work again. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Zukin. The next question is from the line of Robert Simmons with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Robert Simmons : Thanks for taking the question. Some of your competitors that are your biggest sources of wins, you've talked about retention rates holding up better than expected. So I'm wondering, what do you see in terms of the source of your new clients and also just the general switching environment? Chad Richison : Yeah, we're not seeing any changes to our how it's impacting us. Our competitors have been talking about increasing retention on and off for the last 24 years that I've been doing this. So, we're focused on taking market share. Again, we only have 5% of the TAM right now. So we remain focused on that. And so yeah, I don't really see what they're doing to -- I can't point to changes that are being made that would improve retention rates for someone else in our industry. But I do know the things that we're doing and we're having a lot of success bringing businesses over still today as evident by what we just reported in the first quarter and what we expect into next quarter and for the year. Robert Simmons : Got it. And then on capital allocation now that the company's business model has been asset tested and you're throwing off consistently good cash flow. Have you given much thought to paying out a dividend? Chad Richison : Yes. And it's one to seven every board meeting, or one to six, every board meeting. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Simmons. The next question is from Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bhavin Shah : Great. Thanks for taking my question and echo my congrats on the strong year to start of the year. Just, first on the success, you're seeing and probably the 1K employee level, what's driving that and how much of that is maybe attributed to product improvements versus sales execution and then are there any specific verticals or geos you're seeing stronger success here? Chad Richison : I think really what's driving that is, it becomes a necessity at some level. Again, even with tight labor markets or even without, you're having to do more and more, whether it's a tight labor market or not, there's all these new laws, regulation, everything that continues to come out, whether you're in a city, state or what have you. And so, businesses can only do so much. So I think anytime you're able to put something in the employee's hands, that's much easier for them to use and saves, the back end a lot of time and eliminates or at least eliminates a lot of exposure and can decrease a lot of the liability that remains. That becomes an important thing to do and so I also think more and more employees are becoming -- they expect good technology. Our latest campaign talks about the wrong tool. Employees are going to work. They expect the right tools to do their job and more and more tech technology that allows them to manage their data is considered to be the right tool for that and so larger and larger businesses are almost in a have to scenario at a certain level and I think that we're seeing a lot of that. Bhavin Shah : Got it. That's helpful and just a quick follow up, just with the change in CEO to Justin from Josh, anything changing in terms of structure or strategy that Justin might look to employ? Chad Richison : No, actually Justin ran or implement -- has been running our implementation side ahead of that for four years that he's been doing. He's been very focused on usage. He works very closely with Holly. John had done a great job. I talked to John yesterday. We continue on. I just did want to say this one point, because I know we've had different question about this or what have you. And I only -- it's only one time that I'll -- normally we give a retention number at the end of the year and I'll look forward to giving that at the end of this year. So it's not a comment that I'm gonna make on an ongoing basis every quarter. But with that said, this one time, I will share with you that our current re number when compared with the same period last year's either equal to or improved. So again, all I can say is John did a great job while he was here and Justin's well prepared and has been working very closely with Holly and the rest of us this entire time. So, we're very excited about to what he brings to the table. Bhavin Shah : Thanks for doing my questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Shah. The next question is from the line of Daniel Jester withi BMO Capital. Your line is open. Daniel Jester : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just to circle back on Beti, have you said on average how long it takes a conversion to go from signing to go live. And I asked because given your comments that this is the fastest selling module since ACA, do you have better visibility when you're giving your second quarter guidance today because this big backlog relative to a typical second quarter? Chad Richison : No, but we have great, I wouldn't say we have better visibility, but we've always had great visibility. We've been guiding in a $2 million range since we IPO in 2014 with $107 million. So we've always had great visibility. In regards to Betty again, it's a nominal fee for us and answer to your question from a conversion, it doesn't impact the conversion on a new client. Where you would see a impact would be on current clients that are converting over and it's kind of a mixed bag on how long that conversion might take them, because of the data sets that have to be loaded into Beti that might exist outside of our system, such as they're doing commissions and the way they calculate commissions is in a completely different system than Paycom and they're fed in. When those commissions are fed in and at what time period they're fed in and how they're fed in matters and that's how we walk through a process with them. But that would be part of their conversion that currently they're already data feeding it in toward the end and we move that toward the beginning based on what employees they're paid. That's one point, there are many others, but it just depends on what's going on with that client as to what the conversion would be into Beti. It doesn't take a long time necessarily if you have a motivated client ready to go, but there is some things that have to be done on the client's end to prepare them to make that conversion. Of course, once they do now, let's, set it and forget it and the employees work the system from there. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. And I wonder if you could just follow up on that improvement retention, just help us understand what's driving that? Is that kind of the increased module adoption? Just any thoughts around that would be helpful? Chad Richison : Sure. So what I said it was either equal to or greater than, and then what's been driving our retention for the last three, four years has been usage of the product and clients actually getting the return on investment out of the product as more and more employees continue to have a direct interface with the database and skip the middle person on it and that's really what's driving that usage. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. And then on the client success upmarket, is that kind of primarily organic or is that existing clients moving up like is you're able to quantify how much is existing clients versus new clients that you're winning out in the marketplace above that 1,000 mark? Chad Richison : Well, what I'm talking about some new clients. I'm sure we've had some current clients that have gone from 878 employees to 1,012, but that's not the group that I'm talking about. When I'm talking about we've had success onboarding clients above 1,000 and much larger than a 1,000 employees as well as we continue to go up market. Of course we've always had success in that market. We're just continuing to have more and more of it because we've gone even further up and we've got more people in the field now. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. McVeigh. The next question is from Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Arvind Ramnani : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the competitive environment. You've certainly been an innovation engine. You had the direct change a couple of years back and now you have Beti. Are you seeing any of your competitors, whether it is the kind of the larger ones or more of the cloud players or even some of private companies, essentially be fast followers or sort of come up with innovation that's sort of keeping up at night? Chad Richison : Well, not keeping me up at night, but, I will say that, I don't know anybody that beat us on to the internet and now everybody is. I don't know that being first is something is enough, is ever enough. You have to continue to innovate something. We've always been in a very competitive industry, I think competitions really what drives innovation. If we didn't have strong competitors, there'd be no reason for us to come up with new innovative ways to drive stronger return on investment, but we are. We do have a strong competition out there throughout the market. I believe we have the better model and I believe if somebody wants to do less work, they should implement our model and I think that our competitors have a long way to catch up to that and I do think as you look into the future, I think that employees doing their own payroll and employees making all changes into the database through the direct data exchange, the way the direct data exchange measures, I think that's gonna be just an established expectation for any employee going to work. And so I think that's really a change you're starting to see happen is what do employees expect to use when they go to work? And I think that's shifting, I think up to now, employees expected to go to work and use the eight legged octopus with no head, which is what I like to call multiple systems cobbled together with multiple passwords, whatever emails and everything else. I think there's an expectation starting to change on the employee side of how much work they actually want to have to do to manage those types of systems. And so I believe we're at the forefront of making those changes. I think we're putting out a lot of proof sources of success as we've gone through that. And I would expect only more of the same. Can a competitor do what we're doing? Yeah. I think anybody can do anything. You've had people build space shuttles over a two year period of time. So can someone do this? Yeah. But I do think, you have to be intentful for how you do it and you've got to have that expectation. And I believe we're the ones leading. I know we're the ones leading that and like I'd said with all my calls earlier in this year, we're really set up this year to do a lot of good things and we're already seeing those things happen. So a lot of success right now. Arvind Ramnani : Perfect. Thanks for that. Operator : You, Mr. Ramnani. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I will pass offer over to Chad Richison for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today on the call. I want to reiterate my thanks to our employees for making this another outstanding quarter. This month, we will be hosting meetings at the Needham and JPMorgan conferences In June, we'll be hosting meetings at the Cohen, Jefferies, Baird and Stifel conferences. Thank you for your continued support of Paycom. Operator, you may disconnect. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We had another very strong quarter. I'll spend a few minutes on the highlights and then turn it over to Craig to review our financials and our guidance, and then we'll take questions. Our second quarter 2022 revenue of approximately $317 million came in very strong, up 31% year-over-year with continued strength in recurring revenue from new business sales. We continue to see strong demand for self-service payroll and automation of human capital management as more companies and their employees embrace innovative solutions like Beti. We\u2019ve been leading the employee usage initiative for years and our efforts are paying off. When data interactions on our platform are performed by employees, our clients realize the ROI that self-service promises. At the core of our employee usage strategy is Beti, which we believe is how businesses and their employees win in payroll. If any business is doing the employees payroll for them, that business is doing both itself and its employees a disservice. The only way a company wins at payroll is by having the employees do it themselves. It makes no sense in the year 2022 for any company to continue to transfer data inefficiently through multiple systems or manual archaic processes. Beti is the future of payroll, and already over 13,000 clients or nearly 40% of our client base have embraced Beti. That's great progress, but as I've said, I expect all clients will eventually deploy Beti in order to finally experience the correct way to do payroll. We are reinforcing this message through our marketing efforts. Our recently launched new ad campaign calls on businesses and their employees to eliminate unnecessary activities, and the early feedback has been very positive. Overall, our marketing plan continues to deliver strong demo leads and brand recognition across the target market range. In particular, we continue to see strong leads from larger clients, which is driving average revenue per client higher, and an important contributor to our strong growth. On the sales front, our 54 outside sales team continue to perform well driving deeper penetration and market share gains into our target geographies. While we estimate we have roughly half of the country covered geographically, we only have approximately 5% of a very large and growing TAM. We have a long runway for rapid growth for many years to come. To sum up, we finished the first half of 2022 with very strong financial results. With our expectation for the second half of the year, 2022 has become a year of growth acceleration and margin expansion. Our differentiated product strategy focused on employee usage and self-service payroll is resonating with prospects, and we are onboarding new clients at a very strong pace. I want to thank our employees for making this quarter another milestone growth quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance, Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our second quarter and our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2022, I would like to remind everyone that my comments relating to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Second quarter 2022 results were excellent, with total revenues of $316.9 million representing growth of 31% over the comparable prior year period. In Q2, we had very strong recurring revenue growth, predominantly from new client additions over the past year. Our revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for easy to use employee focused solutions and our success in attracting new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $311.5 million for the second quarter, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 31% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $268.2 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.6% and we are on target to achieve strong full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 85%. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2022 was $82.7 million or 26.1% of revenues compared to 26.6% of revenues in the prior year period. We continue to see strong return on investment from our advertising spin and plan to continue to invest aggressively in marketing and advertising through the remainder of 2022. Adjusted R&D expense was $33.9 million in the second quarter of 2022 or 10.7% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion were $48.1 million in the second quarter compared to $38 million in the prior year period. We will continue to invest in innovation in our world class products. Adjusted EBITDA was $119.6 million in the second quarter of 2022 or 37.7% of total revenues compared to $87 million in the prior year or 35.9% of total revenues. Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $57.4 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, versus $52.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2022 was $73 million or $1.26 per diluted share, versus $56.5 million or $0.97 per diluted share in the prior year period. For 2022, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 27% on a GAAP basis. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $279 million and total debt of $29 million. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2 billion in the second quarter of 2022. We recently increased our liquidity through an expanded revolving line of credit of $650 million and a delayed draw term loan that allows us to borrow up to an additional $750 million as needed. Potential uses of proceeds include, but are not limited to general corporate purposes, capital expenditures and stock buybacks. During the second quarter of 2022, we took advantage of a dislocation in the stock market, and repurchased approximately 360,000 shares for a total of roughly $100 million. Through June 30, 2022, Paycom has repurchased nearly 4.65 million shares since 2016, for total of nearly 588 million, and we currently have 550 million remaining in our buyback program. Now, let me turn to guidance. We are raising our full year 2022 guidance as a result of very strong second quarter financial performance and the continued strength of demand trends. We now expect revenue in the range of $1.354 billion to $1.356 billion or 28% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $546 million to $548 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% at the midpoint of the range. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $327 million to $329 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 28% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $117 million to $119 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 36% at the midpoint of the range. With only 5% share of a growing TAM, we have a long runway for continued high margin revenue growth for years to come. Our differentiated solutions and go-to-market strategy, particularly with Beti are working well and driving new client growth and higher revenue per client. Combining our raised 2022 guidance for revenue growth, with adjusted EBITDA margin guidance, implies we are well on our way to deliver a material improvement over the Rule of 65 we achieved in 2021. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Congratulations from my end. Two quick questions. Chad, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? Obviously, macro is a big question for everyone on -- everyone's mind. Employment data are still very, very strong. But like anything that you're seeing out there in terms of end demand changes or a different behavior from customers? It's my first question. My second question is Craig for you. Obviously, we have quite a bit of rate changes over the last quarter. Can you just remind us how that fits into your numbers going forward? Thank you and congrats again. Chad Richison : You bet. Thank you, Raimo. I'll take the first. Now we really aren't seeing much of a change from what we've seen in the past. I mean, I will say that I believe that it's not as difficult maybe to hire people as it was 6 months ago, but it's still very much an employee's market. And I would say we're nowhere back -- in no way back to where we were in 2019, where it was more of an equally yoked employer-employee market. So, there's still a lot of jobs out there unfilled, and it's still a very -- we're still all in at somewhat of a fight for talent. Craig Boelte : Raimo, on the interest rate question, for every 25 basis points that interest -- the Fed funds rate goes up, we get about $5 million of annualized interest income, but it's typically layered in. So, we saw one in May, and then June and July, we saw some. So those will layer in some in third quarter, and then some in fourth quarter as well. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Congrats again. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Samad Samana : Hey, good afternoon, and it's great to see the strong results. Maybe first one, Chad, just in terms of deal cycles are you seeing a similar closed rates or similar lengths in terms of the typical deal cycle? Are you seeing any changes in terms of the level of approval that needs to go to? What are you seeing as far as actually closing deals goes? Chad Richison : Yes, no changes there from what we've been seeing. As far as the timeline and in our close percentages, I would say if anything, they're going up, we're definitely getting more interest in the first calls that we have, and being able to move those into second calls. So we're having more success with that. But all in all, our close ratios remain very strong and very similar to what they've been in the past. Samad Samana : Great. And maybe just on the newer sales offices. Any -- I know it's -- we're still early in, in terms of the ramp, but where are we on the staffing of those and maybe the productivity compared to maybe prior new office openings for comparison? Chad Richison : I would say the staffing is going to be similar. They're more productive today. Today's new reps are more productive than what yesteryears reps would have been. But as far as the number of reps that's very similar. The progression to maturity of any one of our new offices is going to start off with three or so reps. And then we'll continue to add reps over the course of a 2-year period. Of course, at some point, they're fully staffed with eight and they all have both pipelines and backlogs. And so after 2 years, the -- those cities carry the same quota as what we would have had in an existing city. Samad Samana : Okay, okay. Great. Thanks again for taking my questions, and great to see the good numbers. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead. Brad Reback : That's great. Thanks very much. Chad, can you remind us historically what type of impact employment levels that your customers have has on your overall growth? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, next year will be our 25th year and with the exception of the 2 months -- that the two beginning months of the pandemic, normal gyrations in unemployment haven't really impacted us. We've gone through multiple cycles. And now the pandemic is a little different because you had an overnight retreat of an employee base, which was a little bit different. But I would say we're very solid in regards to unemployment. That said, I mean, if unemployment doubles overnight, it would be hard for me to believe it wouldn't have some impact on our current client base, but as we sit here today, unemployment numbers still remain reasonable with where they're at right now. I mean, you might even say they're still fairly low. And then you still have quite a bit of open jobs out there with over 10 million [ph]. I mean, at some point, you have to start thinking, does everybody that wants a job already have one. Brad Reback : That's great. Thanks very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Reback. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead. Mark Marcon : Hey, Chad and Craig. Let me add my congratulations. Terrific results. Wondering, can you talk a little bit about the strong leads that you're getting, particularly from a larger client? Can you talk a little bit about what sort of size difference you're seeing? How big are some of the companies that are now coming into the pipeline? And to what -- how big is the average client now relative to say a year ago? Chad Richison : Well, it continues to go up because as you remember, it was about a year ago, maybe a little longer that we increased our range up to 10,000. And so, obviously, it's going to continue to go up a little bit. I wouldn't say that there's been a massive shift for us to go a whole lot higher than that right now. So what I would say is, is there's been more within that range, not necessarily quadruple that range. But we continue to engage well above our target range, and we're having a lot of success. A lot of the leads we're getting right now are still coming from employees of companies that have used us elsewhere, have that single easy to use experience, and are really wanting to have that same experience at the next company they went to. So we're still having a lot of success and continuing to bring in strong demo leads through both that which I'll say is indirect as well as through our advertising and marketing efforts, which are still yielding great results for us. Mark Marcon : That's great. And then, with regards to the float balances, what was the effective yield that you were able to generate off of last 3 months? Craig Boelte : Yes, Mark, we haven't disclosed what yield it is, but I mean, we're investing still fairly short-term. We have commercial papers from overnight money market as well. So, kind of a mix of that and we're not chasing yield, but we're paying attention to it. Mark Marcon : Okay. Obviously, getting more and more promising. Thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Marcon. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Schwartz : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I like to owe [ph] congratulations again on these terrific results. One for you, Chad, one for Craig. Chad, the commentary that on the deal closers -- closures you're saying higher ASPs. Are you seeing similar trends in your lead flow also? And then the question I want to ask, Craig, with the guidance you're retaining the same EBITDA margin. But clearly we know that inflationary factors have gotten worse here throughout the quarter. So I'm just wondering, are you able to maintain that margin because of the efficiencies of the business that you're able to overcome? Or is that are you holding back any sort of spend that maybe you had planned in the second half of the year? Thanks. Chad Richison : Sure. So on the first, I mean, definitely, the leads are also coming in with larger clients, but also we still continue to target -- to do targeted prospecting. That's always been our bread and butter. We're very -- we remain very focused on that. That's more of our general pressure relentlessly applied strategy that we deploy through target marketing efforts, but there's no doubt that the leads continue to generate larger opportunities for us. Craig Boelte : Yes, and in terms of the inflationary question, we've seen some pockets where we're seeing some higher inflationary areas, but overall we're continuing to look for leverage throughout the model and really not holding back on any hires. Just finding leverage throughout the model. Brian Schwartz : Thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Schwartz. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham. Please go ahead. Ryan MacDonald : Hi, Chad and Craig. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a great quarter. Chad, in your prepared remarks, you talked about this dynamic where you've got nearly half the country covered geographically, but only 5% market penetration currently. As you think about continuing to expand Paycom's portion of the pie, where do you see the most value in terms of incremental investment? Whether it be continuing that geographic expansion in the back half of this year with new offices, incremental advertising spend to build the brand awareness, or perhaps continued investment and expansion inside sales teams? Thanks. Chad Richison : Well, number one, is us continuing to get better at the outside sales process. We have more opportunity out there for us within the markets that we're in. We only have 5% of the market out there. So, I would say number one for us is continuing to get better at selling our value proposition out there to prospects. We have continued to be pulled up market, because of the strong value proposition that we are delivering all the way down to the employee level. And so, we are continuing to get more leads that tend to be a little bit larger than what we've had in the past. And I would say, in aggregate, there's more of them as well. And so really, that's been our focus is getting better at executing and being able to sell that. Now that alone isn't our only strategy. We're getting better at sourcing leads, we're getting better at retargeting them. And then of course, we continue to look at expanding geographically when it makes sense to do so. And when we have the staffing and leadership bench to be able to do them. Ryan MacDonald : Thank you. Maybe just as a follow-up, when you look at sort of the yield that you're looking to get off of the digital marketing investments in the advertising, can you talk about what the timeframe that you're looking for in terms of that return on investment, and whether if we do see a slowdown in the back half years that could materially impact those returns in the near-term? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes. Well, we measure it weekly. So I mean, we know our return weekly. I mean these aren't -- I mean, these are very strong demo leads. These are clients who are asking for a product demonstration. And we have very good close ratios, once we engage with those clients. And so, it would be more of that for us. As far as the slowdown in the back half of the year in this, I really don't -- I really can't see that. I mean, we have a very strong value proposition which is resonating very well out there, both with employees as well as with their employer. And to some extent, the world is conspiring to help us here in just the way different individuals now deploy and utilize technology. And so we're at the forefront of that. I've said many times, I mean, we might be early, but we're not wrong. And so we're going to continue to drive our employee usage strategy throughout the -- both the last half of this year as well as next year. Ryan MacDonald : Thanks for the color, Chad. Congrats again. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. MacDonald. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Alexander Kim : Hi. This is Alex on behalf of Siti Panigrahi. I had a question about Beti. You talked about 10,000 clients uptaking Beti in Q1 and this quarter. You have about 13,000 clients. What drove the 3K net adds and what sort of per employee per month uptake be part of Beti? And what kind of growth upside do you see from Beti adoption? Like can you answer that and I\u2019ve a follow-up. Chad Richison : Yes, well, I mean, we continue -- it continues to grow every quarter for two reasons. One, we continue to upsell Beti into our current client base is it's a better way for them to do payroll. It really is the only way someone should be doing payroll today. But as a reminder, since July of last year, every new client that's come on our system has deployed Beti, and so that's a part of our product offering since July of last year to every new client. And so you got a mixture of both of those. And then as far as the opportunity that upselling into our client base has with Beti, it is incremental increase in revenue opportunity for us. So it's accretive to that profile. But in every year, we have different focuses on modules. So -- and this year, and I'm sure in the next year we are going to continue to be focusing on upselling Beti to 100% of our client base. And again, it'll be positive. But really what it does is it drives greater usage. Greater usage reduces the amount of service we have to provide to any one client. Because of course, if their payrolls are correct, we're not having to go through the process of doing corrections and corrections can produce service calls. And so, we believe that with greater usage of Beti done the right way, it changes the employee experience, it changes their expectation of what they would expect that any employer that leads to more leads for us that leads to greater satisfaction for clients, which ultimately also leads to less service on our end as clients experience the self-service opportunities. Alexander Kim : Got it. Thank you. And my follow-up was ADP continues to see better retention rates, and how does your new bookings on trends -- have trended so far and are expecting any slowdown in new business bookings from a potential macro slowdown in the second half? And is ADP still a major source of new business for you? Chad Richison : Yes, ADP has been experiencing better retention rates since I started the company in 1998. I'm surprised their retention is not already at 200%. But it doesn't impact our ability to sell and our ability to sell and take business. As again, our product is more comprehensive. It's easier to use. And it's just the way that employees should be interacting with their own data. Alexander Kim : All right, thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please go ahead. Bryan Bergin : Hi, guys. Good afternoon and thank you. Wanted to start here kind of with the [indiscernible] recession question. So just how are you thinking about the sustainability of growth trajectory in the event, the U.S does fall into a bit of a more challenged macro environment. And it's just as you think about the growth composition, what are the key swing factors that may change versus what you think remains unchanged? Chad Richison : Well, first of all, just talking about the macro, I mean, the only thing that I could really see that would have a significant impact on us would be a very quick and massive shift in unemployment. That doesn't happen incrementally over time, but happens somewhat right away. I would think that that would have some level of impact on us. We're a growth company, we're focused on growing. We're focused on automating the back office and we're focused on making it easier for employees to actually do their job. And so that's always going to be popular regardless what's going on out there. And oftentimes when people have to do something with less that means they get the opportunity to automate more. And so, I feel really good about our ability to weather, what we would expect to happen. But again, it would take something -- some massive change in the unemployment rate to really impact us. And I'm not saying we couldn't sell through that. But you kind of saw what happened during the pandemic and what happened there. And I would say, that's probably much larger type of unemployment hit than what we would expect necessarily in a recession, definitely something that would have happened a lot quicker, and all at once. But we'll just have to see, but say that I'm not really -- I can't really see a whole lot that would prevent us from continuing to grow at a strong rate. And again, I mean, this next year is our 25 years in business. So, we've been through different recessions and been on different cusps of recessions in the past. Bryan Bergin : Okay, thanks. Appreciate that. And then just a follow-up on free cash flow. Can you comment on just free cash flow margin for this year? How you expect those to land for 2022? And just any thoughts on longer term forward free cash flow conversion trends? Craig Boelte : One thing this quarter that impacted our free cash flow, some was just the tax rate. We saw last year, we -- second quarter, we had some benefit from a discrete item to the quarters or related to some stock vestings. And this year, we didn't have quite the same level. So, I would think that what we're seeing this year would be more indicative with -- as we kind of roll out throughout the rest of the 2022 and then into 2023. Bryan Bergin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jason Celino : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Really strong results here, especially given the macro backdrop, Chad, how would you describe or attribute the upside that we've seen just from industry resilience versus company specific drivers and execution? Chad Richison : Yes, so much of our upside in any one quarter is dependent upon when a deal starts. We always believe going into quarter we have a really good -- we have really good visibility into when a deal is going to start. But when it starts matters. When you're talking about overperformance within a quarter because of course, if a deal starts at the beginning of a quarter, we get 100% revenue billing for that deal, that quarter, that starts at the end of the quarter, we could only get a third of the billing or maybe 15% of it. Of course, in subsequent quarters, we get 100%. So we have pretty good visibility, I'd say we have great visibility going -- guiding quarter-to-quarter. But as far as the outperformance it's always being delivered by new client wins. And then on top of that, you really have to look at when those deals are starting for us. Jason Celino : Okay, perfect. And then, Craig, again, 31% growth in the quarter, very impressive. I think the guidance assumes for the second half some modest deceleration. Curious on what kind of macro assumptions you've built into this. Craig Boelte : Yes, I mean, as we were coming into guidance, I mean, at this point, we haven't seen anything. You're starting to hear about it, but we haven't baked any sort of a macro impact to our guidance for the back half of the year. Really, we're guiding very similar to how we've done in the past. We guide to what we see. As we get closer to fourth quarter, we can see a little more on the fourth quarter. And that's the quarter that has the bonuses, the off cycle runs. So, as we're sitting here in by the beginning of Q3, we're guiding very similar to how we have in the past. Jason Celino : Okay. Thanks for the clarification, Craig. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Celino. Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Arvind Ramnani : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So clearly good results. But I\u2019m trying to dimension are you able to kind of separate how much of your growth was driven by expansion at existing clients versus new client logos? Chad Richison : Sure. Is that the question? I'm just making sure. Okay, if that's a question, the overwhelming majority of our revenue and our revenue that we onboard, our new business revenue comes from new client wins. We do continue to sell into our client base. I've never said land and expand. We land large, but there are opportunities for us to expand into that client base. And we do that, as we believe that clients should be able to use all the products that we have the correct way to drive the employee experience. Go ahead, Craig. Craig Boelte : One thing I would say, Arvind is, our outside clients, our outside sales team, those 54 sales teams are only bringing on new logos. So that entire group is bringing on new logos. So the mix has been very similar to what it has been in the past, with the exception that ACA came about where we did -- that was such an immediate upsell. But the last few years have been very similar to the mix of new logos to upsell, and it's still -- the overwhelming majority is going to be new logos. Arvind Ramnani : Perfect. And just quick follow-up here. Have you seen any sort of layoffs or turnover with existing clients that has been a headwind on revenue? Or has it been sort of roughly equal? And then the second thing is, if you can comment on pricing, if you've been able to push sort of pricing increases through? Chad Richison : Now on the headwind. And then as far as our pricing, we've talked about that in the past where we did our first pricing adjustment, I believe it was in 2019. And we did a small pricing adjustment to a small subset of our client base. We did talked about as we move forward, that talking about our pricing model isn't something that we're going to do just for competitive reasons, but I've also always said that as we make our product more valuable, it only makes sense that we get to share in the value we create through pricing adjustments over time. Arvind Ramnani : Perfect, thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on an all out great quarter. I guess, so a lot of these questions have been asked, but I'll try to maybe ask it a different way. It sounds like you're having incremental success selling more modules at the same time, because of Beti. You're still seeing a tremendous amount of new business. You don't really see a recessionary headwind impacting employment rate. So I guess the main question I would have is, if you look at you\u2019re the constitution of your new bookings, and you look at that from kind of increased value versus increased units, how does that compare to prior periods? Meaning are you getting more of your growth from the fact that your deals are larger incrementally? Chad Richison : I would say comparison very similar to every past year with the exception of when we added on to our inside sales business, which are for more of your emerging businesses, those companies that have less than 50 employees, that group represents approximately 5% of our overall revenue. So, that's one way to think about it is companies that have less than 50 employees represent 5% of our overall revenue. And so, what has been growing is the average size of our other clients. And so that hasn't been different in any year from year-to-year. It continues to go up. And again, part of that diluting factor, if you just take the unit count divided by total number of employees in our system, part of that diluting factor is going to be all of those emerging below 50 employee companies that we added when we added this inside sales group and expanded it in the year 2020. Alex Zukin : Understood. And I guess increasingly, as you think about incremental modules, when you think about that incremental potential over the next coming couple of years, do you see it every year if everybody is buying all of the modules up front? Do you see that kind of momentum continuing in the future? Chad Richison : Yes, we've always said that people buy half at least half or greater of the modules that we have at the time that we sell them. Of course, we've been in business some time. So some of the modules you have to go back and sell into the current client base, because we didn't have them at the time we actually sold them in the beginning. I would say it's a little bit more than half now as we go into new sales just because of what's required for a client to have in order for an employee to do their own payroll. There's several modules that they have to have. I'm not going to say it's a 100% because that wouldn't be accurate. But I would say it's more than what they needed in the past. Alex Zukin : Perfect. And just a clarifying question. With respect to the guidance, you did -- it looks like a bigger pass through than usual, bigger raise than usual. So I think it'd be helpful just to understand, out of the incremental raise, how much of that is coming from the rate hikes coming from the model? Chad Richison : Well, as we've said, I mean, for us, it's really the new business sales are really going to be what's driving quarter-to-quarter, and then it does matter when they start. That's not to say that we're not going to have some positive impact from the rate increases, you had the 50 basis points in May, which is in somewhat in the middle of the quarter, not necessarily maybe a little sort of that and yet another 75 basis toward the end of July. We've talked about how those layered in -- sorry, at the end of June. We've talked about how those layer in and then you also had some in July. So we've talked about how those layer in and so we would absolutely expect that to be have a positive impact on both the next quarter and subsequent quarters. But still first price for us, which has been the growth in new logos. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Bhavin Shah : Great. Thanks for taking my question and I echo my congrats on the strong results. Chad, already you mentioned a lot of the benefits of Beti. But just as it relates to retention, can you talk about what you've seen maybe from those customers that utilize Beti to the ones that maybe don't yet? Are you seeing any improvement there? Or is it still too early? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, definitely clients that use Beti and deploy Beti are going to have much stronger usage patterns than someone that doesn't. And once they've deployed Beti, it kind of changes the game and the expectation of what an employee expects to be able to use in the business. And so absolutely that impacts our retention. As I've been saying, usage is really what drives retention. And I believe that so for any software out there, but definitely ours. Bhavin Shah : Helpful there. And Craig just a quick follow-up or clarification on float. I just want to make sure that I understand it. So is it safe to assume that your guidance takes into account the layered impact of all the rate increases up until July and assumes no further rate increases? Is that accurate? Craig Boelte : Yes, that would be accurate. It would not include any future rate increases, and then layering in what we know up through July. Bhavin Shah : Perfect. Thanks again for taking my questions. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on margin. Another great quarter of year-over-year margin expansion on the EBITDA line. But you did have some compression on gross margin. I know that Craig talked about the full year expectation for about 85% gross margin. I would think with float income going higher, you'd have a benefit there just like on the EBITDA line. So can you remind us about the investments, potentially, you're making that that could impact that gross margin trends? Thank you. Craig Boelte : Sure. So with the one thing on the gross margin line, as we continue to hire and hire in front of the revenue growth, that's going to have an impact on that gross margin and then you'll eventually grow into that. You have to hire and train ahead of capturing that revenue. So we're continuing to hire aggressively. And then also, we brought on the new grapevine facility and data center that Tier 4 data center. So you're starting to see some of the depreciation hitting the different areas of our income statement. So that had a small -- had an impact as well on that -- on the gross margin, but we're still expecting to be at least at that 85% level for the full year. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Hey, is there any way to frame what the revenue impact is, if you were -- if Beti was adopted 100% across your existing client base? So said another way, what's the revenue impact as Beti becomes 100% utilized across the client base? Chad Richison : Well, Beti is one of 29 modules that we have. So I mean, it would definitely have an impact. Again, where we're making the impacts new business logo ads, and Beti gives us the opportunity to do that. I think Beti will have some impact for sure, because we're charging for it. But I think where you'll see a better impact of Beti once we have every single client on, I mean, I think it's going to impact retention. As we've seen, usage has been impacting retention of our product. We were at 91%. I think it was 3 or 4 years ago, and it's continued to go up. And so that's really been driven by usage. And Beti generate stronger usage of our products. So, if history is an indicator, we would expect that once all of our clients have deployed it, and are actually generating that ROI, it's going to have an impact on our retention. And then also, all those clients employees will be used to Beti and as they go to other companies in the market, as a normal flow of an employee lifecycle goes from one company to the next, we believe that generates even greater leads for us, as we've been seeing now. Kevin McVeigh : Very helpful. And then, can you just remind us the philosophy on float in terms of to the market as opposed to maybe reinvestment in the business? Craig Boelte : Yes, I mean, we'll have to see on that. I think a lot of it depends on the timing of when we might make some of those investments. You look at and if it's something that we can invest in, let's say advertising or R&D, that's going to generate additional revenues. And that's something we're definitely going to look at. But we're also a company that doesn't like [indiscernible]. So we're not going to spend it just to spend it. We will to the extent that we don't see an opportunity, we'll let that fall to the bottom line. Kevin McVeigh : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Simmons with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Robert Simmons : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering, are there parts of the market that are responding particularly well to Beti, certain industries that are the most apt to want it and to embrace it? Chad Richison : No, I would say it's been industry agnostic. I mean, you're talking about Beti is -- the benefit of Beti is to the employee. So it's really -- it doesn't really matter what industry that is anywhere an employee really, really needs for their check to be accurate going into the weekend, Beti is there for them. And within every industry, you will have those types of employees. And then again, every business that would like to automate and reduce, actually reduce their exposure and a lot of their liability around the payroll process, deploying Beti is the right way to do that. And so now, I can't say that there's any industry that Beti would work stronger than the other. Robert Simmons : Got it. Great. And then can you talk about the UKG situation? I mean, how much benefit have you been able to see from that so far this year, in terms of both bookings to date, and also to pipeline for the second half of the year? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, I think that produces an opportunity for everyone. I also think it makes everyone take pause, and everybody's got to make sure they have the right plan for their clients as we're all in this same world together, and -- so I think as you see those kinds of things, I know that we looked at everything ourselves. I'm sure many competitors looked at what everyone can do differently to make sure that employees always get paid. Yes, I mean, absolutely, it produces opportunity. But I don't -- I wouldn't say it's the hack that produces the opportunity. I mean, it's the fact that someone has an opportunity to have a very good experience in a single system for their employees. So they have an opportunity to have multiple systems where their employees are trying to find their passwords. And I would say, that's what drives our wins more so than what's happened to them in the past. Robert Simmons : Got it. Great. Thank you very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. I would like to pass the conference back to Chad Richison for any closing remarks. Chad Richison : Okay. Thank you to everyone for joining our call today, and thank you to all of our employees for contributing to our continued success. We have a busy schedule ahead starting next week with meetings at the KeyBanc Technology Forum in Vail and virtual meetings with Oppenheimer and BMO. In September, we will be hosting in-person meetings in Las Vegas at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference; in New York at the Citi Global Technology Conference, and in San Francisco at the Wolfe TMT Conference. We hope to speak with many of you soon and appreciate your interest in Paycom. Operator, you may disconnect. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Paycom software second quarter 2022 quarterly results conference call. I hope you all enjoy the rest of your day. You may now disconnect your lines.",

And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We delivered another very strong quarter with a focus on high-quality revenue growth that produces world-class margins. I'll spend a few minutes on the highlights and then turn it over to Craig to review our financials and our guidance and then we'll take questions. Our third quarter 2022 revenue of approximately $334 million came in very strong, up 30% year-over-year, with rapid recurring revenue growth driven by new business sales. Demand for self-service solutions that enable employees to interact directly with their data continues to be strong and feedback on self-service payroll remains very positive. At the center of our automation strategy is BETI which is how businesses and their employees win in payroll. BETI is the future of payroll and already nearly half of our clients have embraced self-service payroll. Our go-to-market strategy includes 54 outside sales teams that focus on penetrating their respective territories. And we augment their sales efforts with marketing and advertising that drive lead volumes, brand awareness and the call to action. Our efforts are producing strong demo leads and our new brand campaign is driving strong recognition across our target market range. We are also seeing a surge in organic lead referrals coming directly from employees. As more employees experienced BETI and Paycom's comprehensive employee self-service solutions, many are seeking to bring us into the current workplace. Just like in the consumer world, employees don't want to go backwards in technology. And with Paycom, employees get the best HCM user experience and the most control over their data interactions. Employee users are becoming Paycom advocates. And when they get promoted in their current position or move on to a new organization, they are becoming strong influencers. We have a long runway to go and our multifaceted go-to-market strategy should help deliver rapid new business growth for many years to come. To sum up, we are delivering high-quality profitable revenue growth. Based on our strong financial results to date and expectations for the remainder of the year, achievement of our full year guidance for 30% revenue growth and 41% adjusted EBITDA margin puts us back into the pre-pandemic Rule of 70. Our differentiated product strategy focused on employee experience and self-service payroll is producing outstanding fundamentals with accelerating revenue growth in 2022, expanding adjusted EBITDA margins and strong cash flows. I want to thank our employees for their focus and commitment to Paycom. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Third quarter 2022 results were very strong, with total revenues of $334.2 million, representing growth of 30% over the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth is being fueled by strong demand for our differentiated solution and strong new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $328.2 million for the third quarter, representing 98% of total revenues and growing 31% from the comparable prior year period. Total adjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $280.5 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 83.9%. Our focus on high-quality revenue produces world-class margins and we remain on target to achieve strong full year adjusted gross margins of approximately 85%. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2022 was $85.8 million or 25.7% of revenues compared to 25.9% of revenues in the prior year period. Adjusted R&D expense was $37.3 million in the third quarter of 2022 or 11.2% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $52 million in the third quarter compared to $40.7 million in the prior year period. Our investments in sales and marketing and innovation are fueling our market share gains and we plan to continue to invest in these areas to drive our future growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $126 million in the third quarter of 2022 or 37.7% of total revenues compared to $89.7 million in the prior year or 35% of total revenues. I am pleased with the 270 basis points of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion that we saw in the quarter which reflects the strength of our business model and flow-through of high-margin revenue upside. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $52.2 million or $0.90 per diluted share versus $30.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2022 was $73.4 million or $1.27 per diluted share versus $53.6 million or $0.92 per diluted share in the prior year period. For 2022, we anticipate our full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a GAAP basis. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $317 million and total debt of $29 million. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $1.85 billion in the third quarter of 2022. Now let me turn to guidance. With our very strong third quarter and the strength of our recurring revenue model, we are raising our full year 2022 guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $1.371 billion to $1.373 billion or 30% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $560 million to $562 million, representing adjusted EBITDA margin of 41% at the midpoint of the range and a 120 basis point expansion from the prior year. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues in the range of $366 million to $368 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 29% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $144 million to $146 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of roughly 40% at the midpoint of the range. Combining our 2022 guidance for revenue growth with adjusted EBITDA margin, we are now expecting to exceed the Rule of 70 which is at least 5 points greater than the Rule of 65 we achieved in 2021. We have a long runway for continued high-margin revenue growth. Our fundamentals continue to improve throughout 2022 and we have strong momentum heading into 2023. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Congrats on a great quarter in this kind of environment. Chad, one question for you, then a follow-up for Craig. In terms of what you\u2019re seeing in the market at the moment, like obviously, there\u2019s 1 company after the other that\u2019s kind of talked to that -- talk about like lean demands, things happening. You guys are spending out a little bit in terms of like not seeing anything. Can you just talk a little bit about like how that\u2019s possible in terms of like the -- is there a different nature of what\u2019s going on that people holding on to their employees for longer, so then you guys don\u2019t see it? Is it kind of the offering? But it looks like it\u2019s more the whole HR space. So that\u2019s the first question. Then for Craig, any comments on the operating cash flow because that one number that came in lower than the model. So I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something going on there, would be great to hear. Congrats again. Chad Richison : Sure. I mean I'll take the first one. And I would say, first, I mean, the hiring market is still a little tight, not like it was. I mean I would say there's been a little softening in hiring as far as it shifting maybe more into an employer's market. I would still say that we're not there yet. I mean for us, though, as far as moving deals around, I mean, moving deals forward, I mean, September and October were huge book sales months for us. And as a reminder, I mean, we only have 5% of the TAM. I mean we reported 33,800 clients at the end of last year. Our 2 largest competitors have a combined 1.7 million clients. And we\u2019re out there making businesses more efficient by having their employees do the payrolls themselves. So we\u2019re not short on opportunity right now. We\u2019re making businesses more efficient and I don\u2019t see why that would slow down for us as that\u2019s really within our control. Craig Boelte : Yes. And I would say on the operating cash flow, Raimo, a couple of things impacted this third quarter. And most of it was really just timing between quarters but we had some additional tax payments here in the third quarter. Typically, we get some benefits as it relates to discrete items on stock comp. And that was -- so that caused our rate to be slightly higher, so we made some additional payments here in the third quarter. And then the rest is really more just expenses and the timing of those expenses and when they're paid. So nothing really to point out other than those 2 items. Operator : The next question is from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Chad, maybe first one for you. If I think about the growth, staying above 30% even against normalized comps, it\u2019s clearly impressive. And if I look at the fourth quarter guidance, it\u2019s actually a stronger seasonal uplift as your initial guidance for the fourth quarter than normal, so the plus 10%. If I go back and look last year, I think you said something closer to like plus 7%, plus 8%. I\u2019m just curious if you can help us maybe think about what\u2019s driving the confidence in that kind of strong seasonal uptick in the December quarter? If there\u2019s anything you\u2019re seeing in terms of change in renewal timing, or is it just float revenue? Just help us understand that. Chad Richison : Yes. I mean we've had a lot of strong starts as of late. And so those starts, when a deal starts in the quarter, that really does matter. The size of our beat for a quarter is really dictated by when a deal starts. If we start that new business, that new client for us, if we start them at the beginning of the quarter, we receive 100% of the revenue billing for that client. If we start the deal at the end of the quarter, we might receive only 15% to 30% of the revenue billing for that client for that quarter. Then of course, all subsequent quarters, we receive 100%. So we do have pretty good visibility as we go quarter-to-quarter. And what would be driving the fourth quarter is, obviously, we benefited from some rate increases. We've talked about that as how those layer in. I mean as you've seen, those do start to layer in. But also just the strength of our new client conversions. We're converting clients at a rapid pace. They're using the product right off the bat which is helpful. And so we're having strong growth into the fourth quarter. Samad Samana : Great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. We\u2019re getting close to lapping the new sales offices. Just any update on how we should think about them? Are they fully -- what you would consider to be fully productive? Or is there still room for productivity gains there? And how does that maybe factoring into both what happened in the third quarter and then your forward outlook? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean with the offices that we've opened up last year and I'm going to call it 5, even though we opened up 1 late in the first quarter of 2021. And then I think we opened up 4 in the very -- at the very beginning of 2022 or this year. I mean all offices, just as a reminder, it takes offices 24 months to reach full maturity and that's having 8 reps with the backlog and pipeline having been out in the field. Today, I mean, I would say our best one probably has 4 reps on quota right now, as we sit here today as they\u2019ve been going through and selling. And so that will continue to increase throughout next year for them and then they will become mature offices and have the exact same quota as all of our other offices in 2023 -- or sorry, at the end -- or sorry, at the beginning of -- at the end of 2023 for one of them and then at the beginning of 2024 for the other 4. Operator : The next question is from Brad Reback from Stifel. Brad Reback : Chad, have you seen any noticeable change in hiring or retention at your customers? Chad Richison : No, I can't say that we've seen any changes. Now obviously, we're seeing changes just from when we're out there hiring people ourselves. And I think to some extent, that mimics a little bit of what our clients would be doing. I would say it's not as extreme as what you were facing maybe even 9 months ago as far as the additional bonuses people would look to pay or the recruiting bonuses people might have. I think more and more companies are getting people back into the office at some level. I think there's less work-from-home and more hybrid, if not even more work at the office. So again, we're not seeing any slowdowns in our at-bats or our lead generation. But I think a lot of that also has to do just with our size. I mean we only have 5% of the market. Most everyone is using a vendor. I mean the craziest thing someone can try to do is try to do payroll by themselves without using a business or a provider. So we\u2019re having success making businesses more efficient with a very differentiated go-to-market strategy that is very much resonating out there with both the workforce as well as with those companies that we serve. Operator : The next question is from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Let me add my congratulations on the strong quarter. Craig, I was wondering if you could give us a feel for like what sort of rates you\u2019re able to get right now on the tax filing float and how that might look or what you\u2019re factoring in for the fourth quarter? Craig Boelte : Yes. So Mark, what we've talked about, what each 25 basis points represents, we haven't disclosed the exact rate that we're achieving. Those kind of layer in over time. But for every 25 basis points, at some point, we should be getting close to $5 million on an annualized basis. But all of our investments are fairly short term. We're doing CDs overnights and then also commercial paper. So those are the types of investments, as well as some 2-year treasuries. So those are really the investments we're seeing now. And then that's kind of where we're at, at this point. Mark Marcon : Great. And then Chad, you mentioned really strong bookings here in September and October. Wondering, given the normal cadence, what does that make you feel like for the fourth quarter and the strength that you\u2019re seeing in terms of the pipeline, in terms of the key fall selling season? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean I would say I mentioned those months because they're the most recent. I mean I can go back to August, July and I can go back as far as we want. We've just been having strong book sales. I mean for a long time, I mean even since the pandemic started, we're getting a lot of leads from just employees. I mean -- and we're getting leads from the largest companies in the world. I mean 20 of their employees will hit our database in a 1-month period of time. And so we\u2019re having strong leads. We\u2019re able to turn those leads, some of them into -- to influencers as we go in there. But definitely, they become data points and information that we\u2019re able to gather as we go in to clients. And we\u2019re finding that employees really like to use the product. Once we convert a client over onto our system -- and again, all new clients have BETI. They\u2019re all using BETI. But within the very first 2 payrolls, over 50% of their employees are already doing their own payroll. So that is a differentiated strategy. They\u2019re not doing that with any other company. And as those employees either get promoted where they\u2019re at or move to other companies, they\u2019re bringing us into other businesses. And so we\u2019re having a lot of success with that. And I wouldn\u2019t expect that to slow down. I think if the labor market loosens up or even becomes tighter or what have you, it doesn\u2019t really change the value proposition of eliminating and reducing exposure and risk for the company as well as helping those employees so that they don\u2019t suffer the negative consequences associated with your pay not matching what you expected to be paid. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Brian Schwartz : And congratulations on an excellent quarter. Chad, in terms of deal sizes or maybe the cycles as the lead generations going through to your conversions, are you seeing any meaningful changes in those metrics? Chad Richison : No. Deal sizes have continued to go up. So deal sizes every year, I mean, I can talk about how we continue to be pulled further and further upmarket. As far as the cycles, I wouldn't say there's been any big change to that. And let's see the other part of your question, yes. I mean deal sizes are going up. And the cycles, no meaningful changes there. Brian Schwartz : Yes, you got them both. And then Craig, one follow-up for you. The guidance for 4Q for -- on the EBITDA, on the margin, it\u2019s showing less improvement than what the business has done for the last 2 quarters. And I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any catch-up in spend or maybe you\u2019re increasing your advertising here in Q4. So I was just wondering if you have any color on that target. Craig Boelte : I would say kind of similar to how we've done in the past. We want to make sure we have the ability to spend as we see necessary as we're going into fourth quarter. And if we want to increase those ad spend, it gives us the ability to do that. Operator : The next question is from Joshua Reilly with Needham. Joshua Reilly : Nice job on the quarter here. If you look at your R&D strategy, I think you have something like 2019 modules today. Is the focus going forward more on adding new additional paid modules? Or is it more enhancing the current offerings? Or just maybe an update there? Chad Richison : Yes, I would say it's both. Our strategy, when it comes to both module creation and adoption, hasn't changed. Sometimes, we create additional features and functionality within a product and we do not charge for those features and functionality. DDX is an example of that. Manager on-the-Go is an example of that and I could name many others. And then sometimes, we create a product that has a different level of return on investment. And then we do charge for those products. And it's those products that we call modules and we do have 29 of them. So as we move forward, you'll continue to see a healthy mix of both as it makes sense for us. Joshua Reilly : Got it. And then just to clarify. On the guidance for the fourth quarter, are you considering the 75 basis point rate increase that\u2019s likely to come out tomorrow in the current guidance? Craig Boelte : Yes. I mean any rate increase in November and December will have very little impact on our fourth quarter. Those layer in over time. So those would have a very small impact on our fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Enders with Citi. Unidentified Analyst : This is George [ph] on for Steve. I want to ask about competitive landscape. Have you noticed any changes in your running into deals, in particular, as you started to move up market? Chad Richison : Not really. I would just say we're running into some competitors. We've always had the same players, whether we were -- now I would say we would have different players if we're talking sub-100 employee company or sub-50 employee company. But when you're talking about the 2,000 plus which we've always gone from 50 to 2,000 even at IPO we talked about since 2014. So when you're talking about 2,000 employees or more, it's been the same players for a very, very long time. And so I wouldn't say that we're running into new players. I would say, because we're continuing to move up market, we're seeing some of the old faces a little more. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then you mentioned the brand marketing program in your prepared remarks. I\u2019d love to hear a little more on kind of the successes you\u2019ve seen there and if there\u2019s any plans to expand that program. Chad Richison : Yes. And so I think what anybody -- when someone's looking at our new branding and marketing, there's really been a big shift. I mean we've gone from single database, employee usage-driven strategies with the DDX, the direct data exchange, where employees are making all of the changes which I will update within the Paycom system. About 95% of all changes are made directly by the employee without any touch or duplicative effort by HR or payroll. And so what you've noticed though now is our brand marketing is shifting toward employees doing their own payroll. And in fact, the consequence is suffered by the employees when they don't do their own payroll. It's funny we'll go into a business and we'll ask the payroll person as we're going through the analysis, hey, is your check ever wrong? And the payroll person is often, no, if my check looks wrong, I fix it before payroll. And so why not roll that out to all the employees because they'll do the same thing. And so I would say, before, we oftentimes might retreat to what we're comfortable with, with the app and the single database. Today, we're staying in the lane which is oftentimes uncomfortable of helping employees as well as HR and payroll individuals realize the advantages that can be realized when employees actually do their own payroll. Operator : The next question is from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Alexander Kim : This is Alex on behalf of Siti Panigrahi. I just wanted to ask how has the BETI adoption been trending for this quarter? Like what percent of BETI is your current clients? And what do you expect BETI revenue for FY \u201822? Or how has BETI performance done versus your initial expectations? And then I have a follow-up. Chad Richison : Yes. We're about 50% of all current clients are on BETI. And again, that's every client that's onboarded or had been sold since last July. They may not have onboarded right at July but every client sold since last July is using BETI. And the trend in BETI is continuing to go up. I mean that's why we're getting so many leads from employees after they leave one company and go to another, Nobody does good going backwards in technology. You take an app off somebody's phone and ask them to do it the old way, it becomes very difficult for them. And so -- and it's unnecessary. And so BETI usage continues to go up. I already did talk about or did make mention earlier of the fact that new clients within the first payroll or so, you've got 50% of their employees are already doing their own payroll. And that continues to increase as clients continue to get better at using the product. And so -- and it's our strategy. I mean today, everything is about BETI. I mean I tell our salespeople all the time. Look, if you can't get someone to understand the benefits and value of BETI to their organization as well as the positive impact on their employees, I don't have anything else for you to sell. I mean because everything else comes with that being the case already. And so it's not a -- it's a strategy that we've been continuing to drive and it's a strategy that really fits within the problems that are already inherent between employees having correct data and receiving correct pay from their employer. Alexander Kim : Got it. And I wanted to ask, with the rising inflation, have you been able to pass on price increases to your customers for your modules? And how does BETI pricing compare to your other modules? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, BETI pricing it's a nominal fee. I would not say that BETI pricing compares in fee with our more substantial modules from that standpoint. Our first pricing adjustment ever as a company was in 2019. We did talk about that in the future, should we choose to do or make pricing adjustments, it would be based off of ROI that we're able to deliver for the clients. As I mentioned in the past, sometimes, we develop product and we do not create a module from that where we're billing. So I think there -- that as we've continued on, any time that we make the product more valuable, it only makes sense that we're able to share in the value that we've created through pricing adjustments. Operator : Our next question is from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : I wanted to start with margin. Can you comment on the uptick in 3Q adjusted OpEx levels? It sounds like there\u2019s no change to your 85% gross margin target for the year. I\u2019m just curious what added leverage you\u2019re going to get in 4Q to achieve that. Craig Boelte : Yes, I would say in Q4, a couple of things that have impacted the gross margin, I guess, would be the hiring that we've had. In the past, we've continued to increase our operations group to be able to catch the revenue that we're bringing on towards the end of the year and next year. So that's something that's had a small impact on the gross margin as well as depreciation. We brought the data center in Dallas online. So that depreciation is impacting that gross margin. And then the levers we pull, we always look for efficiencies in the model. So we'll continue throughout the rest of the year to kind of look at where we can maybe have some efficiencies but get -- continue as a high-growth company. We want to make sure we're investing for the future. Chad Richison : We've made statements in the past about if our gross margin is up way too high, it oftentimes shows that we could be a little understaffed in operations and service. And so oftentimes, when you see it change a little bit toward the downside, it means that we're hiring ahead of the growth. And then as that growth begins to come in and those people take on full load clients, we start to get some of that back. Bryan Bergin : Okay. That makes sense. I guess a follow-up just off of that, would you say that you\u2019re fully staffed now across those different parts of the organization? And then just a follow-up on the new sales offices. Are these newer offices ramping faster than historical pace? Or is it basically in line with what you\u2019ve seen? Chad Richison : Yes. Well, what I will first say about being fully staffed, I mean it is -- I believe that we've done a good job of hiring. I've talked about over the last 9 months, I think it's become easier for everyone to hire as it's been more of a shift back to maybe more of the middle where we were definitely in an employee-driven environment. And then I don't know you fit in like 4 or 5 questions in all of this. What was the other one, something about hiring? Bryan Bergin : That\u2019s right. Yes. Chad Richison : Okay. Yes. I would say that when it comes to the new sales offices, as we've always had, we've always had increasing -- increasingly more success with new offices than what we'd have with the past, just because the amount of product we're selling, the fact that we continue to go upmarket. I mean as I said in the past, I mean, I don't know it's about 4, 5 years ago, I said the first rep that sells $1 million in a year, we're going to name the award after them. And it wasn't long after that someone did $2 million in a year as an individual. And I'm sure this year, someone will finish at $3 million that they've sold. And so you would expect a new office when you have your executive reps going from an average sale below $1 million to over $3 million, not an average rep but I'm saying a top rep, selling that much. You would expect that to raise -- that type to raise all boats. Including the new office opportunities as we open them. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Jason Celino : Great. Chad, Craig, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me or I\u2019ve been thinking about Paycom too much but I\u2019ve been seeing more Paycom commercials, especially on football games. During the pandemic, you really leaned into marketing and advertising to capture incremental share. Is it possible that some of the strength we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of quarters is coming from increased top-of-funnel efforts? Chad Richison : Yes, we're definitely getting better at marketing and retargeting and how we brand ourselves. So yes, I mean marketing is definitely one of those levers that we feel impact sales. And oftentimes, we're landing on a softer beach because of it. I think our market has changed dramatically even since the beginning of the pandemic when we started spending because we are able to do things with -- I'm not going to call them indirectly but softer employee-driven leads that come from rank-and-file employees that are just tired of dealing with the consequences of having their check wrong. Jason Celino : Okay. No, that\u2019s fair. I guess we\u2019ve been hearing about falling advertising prices as other types of tech and software companies pull back. With this dynamic, does that change the ROI for some of the marketing efforts or cost of acquisition efforts that you do? Chad Richison : No. I mean I still believe you can waste money in advertising. So I mean, it's not going to change our strategy. It is an ROI metric. We do measure it every single week based off not only leads but the percent of appointments that we get from those leads and then how we convert them and to close deals as they start. So that -- how we measure effectiveness of our marketing hasn't changed. Operator : The next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : First is, usually, we just say congratulations on a solid quarter. But I would say relative to everybody that\u2019s reporting this season, just amazing where you guys continue to put up in an obviously very volatile and difficult macro environment. So again, compliments aside, I guess I\u2019ll start with that question which is, Chad, if you zoom out, is the tougher macro actually helping you? Meaning that companies are starting to reprioritize certain efforts either around efficiency, more automation in their back office and their payroll and then the hiring environment to which you refer to as being back to kind of more normalized levels? Like, I guess, how much of a tailwind is this for you? And how long -- like if you had to -- if you look at your crystal ball and you kind of think about the durability of this trend, like what\u2019s your thinking around that? Chad Richison : I mean I will just say we're just getting started with BETI. I mean all employees are going to be doing their own payroll. Everybody on this call is going to be doing their own payroll. It's how companies win at payroll. It only makes sense that employees do it themselves. The only reason why employees haven't been doing it themselves is because it's always been overly complicated in multiple systems in blah, blah, blah. So I mean, I think that our biggest opportunities, the fact that people are waking up to this and they want to do less. I mean your back office, they want to do less, especially when that equivalates into less exposure for them. They can do less work and create less exposure, less risk and greater satisfaction with their employees. So I don't really think it matters what's going on in order for us to move our product from a strategic basis. Now could the size of the deals be smaller if you're in a looser versus a tighter labor market? Well, maybe yes. But I mean -- and I'm not saying that's the case now but I'm saying their reason for making the change is going to be -- exist regardless of what the labor market is. And so -- and I believe that we provide that for them. So that's really what's driving it. And I think that as we've shifted over to really giving the employee control over their own payroll and everything else that feeds it. Now if I have you responsible for your time and labor management of clocking in and clocking out, okay which all employees are but have you responsible for your expense management which all employees are, your benefits administration which all employers are, I'm just not showing you how it all added up at the end. I'm having you do all this work without ever showing you where you're going. And so now what Paycom does is we show you where you're going and how it's going to impact your payroll. You'll be amazed at how much better everybody gets it, time tracking, expense management, benefits administration. When you take the blindfold off of them and show them what it should look like at the end, they get a lot better. And I don't see that slowing down regardless of what's going on in the labor market. Alex Zukin : Understood. And then I guess maybe as a different direction, if you look at the funding environment with private companies now and I don\u2019t know if valuations are correct or that they will correct, given the incremental opportunity that you\u2019re seeing, particularly further upmarket, what -- how would you say your approach is either the same or changed over the course of the next 12 to 24 months around organic versus inorganic innovation? Chad Richison : I mean I think that we're an organic innovation company. I mean I've always said that we always look to do things that make sense to us. But I mean, we've always developed our product. We continue to be ambitious with our product and what we look for in the future. We are continuing to be pulled up market. And honestly, I think that the larger the company it is, the larger company is, the more opportunity for exposure and risk they have and even the more difficult it is to keep everybody paid correctly. And so I think you're going to see more and more -- as we have definitely see the employees of those companies call us. I mean I don't think we're going to have less opportunity with larger companies as time goes on. Operator : Our next question is from Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. Bhavin Shah : Chad, on that quip you made earlier on value of 50% self-service adoption by the first 2 payrolls, what are the things you can do to maybe accelerate that? Like what could those things be in? Is it more awareness than anything else? And any sense of what the upper balance of that would look like? Chad Richison : Well, I mean our clients are -- you're a new client and you're rolling something out to your employees. I mean I would say that our clients are getting better at it as well. I mean this 50% are just from the group that wanted to. I believe our clients are getting better at talking about the impact that can be had when an employee does their own. And so -- and you see that number go up. I'm just saying that's where they're starting which, to me, showing a very strong interest. I mean it's one thing to buy something, it's another thing to use it. And BETI's definitely a product that's getting high usage from the point of conversion on. Bhavin Shah : That\u2019s helpful there. And just a quick follow-up. I mean you talked earlier about maybe tweaking the brand marketing strategy a little bit of kind of going at it from a different angle. How has the effectiveness of this marketing campaign evolved for the last few months given some of these changes? Are you able to go after a different customer base or attract buyers that maybe wouldn\u2019t come into your funnel otherwise? Chad Richison : No, because at the end of the day, there's no such thing as an enterprise employee. I mean whether a person works for a large enterprise company or a small company, they have the same mortgage, same bills, same medical needs, same child care needs. They all expect their check to be correct. So employees that work from enterprise company one day, can work for a smaller company the next day and they can be back working for a large company. They're the same person. They expect the same things. And so when it comes to BETI, it's for everyone. It's for the employee and it's regardless of the company's size. Bhavin Shah : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Congrats. Operator : The next question is from Daniel Jester with BMO. Daniel Jester : Great. Maybe just as kind of -- earlier on the call about bookings in the quarter, Chad, you mentioned -- called out September and October specifically. Just in terms of the linearity, like how did this third quarter look like other third quarters? Did you book more business on a relative basis in September, October? Or were you just commenting on sort of the macro outlook? Chad Richison : Yes. Well, it was a comment on the macro outlook and I just took our most recent 2 months. I mean I could go back further into August, July, June. The answer to your question is, absolutely, we are booking more today than we've booked in the past. And I wouldn't say that -- I mean, September is strong, October's strong but so is August, so is July, so is June. As far back as you go, we've continued to be strong. Daniel Jester : Okay. And then you\u2019ve actually obviously run this business for a very long time through all sorts of different macroeconomic cycles. I think clearly, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about what 2023 looks like. So maybe, just philosophically, Chad, how do you run Paycom in a recession? What changes? What are the levers that we should expect you to pull either to manage cost or drive additional growth? Chad Richison : I mean very little change for us based on what we're already doing. I mean just as a reminder, I mean, we have 5% of the TAM. We have a differentiated product. As I said before, we started off the year with 33,800 clients. We've got 2 competitors that if you combine their client count, it's 1.7 million. And so what happens to us next year is dependent upon us and I think we're in control of that. So I mean, I wouldn't see any major changes from what we're going to be doing into next year. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great. And I\u2019ll add my congratulations just given fantastic outcome. Can you give us a sense, relative to expectations that you initially said, where was the source of the most upside? Was it modules kind of new logos, just employee per logo per CAC? And any way to just frame that? Chad Richison : New logos. Kevin McVeigh : New logo, that\u2019s super helpful. And then Chad, is there any way to think about -- I mean, we\u2019ve got to choke this number this morning as north of like $10 million. Is there any way to think about that relative to kind of the module adoption and the type of modules that folks are using? Because obviously, one of the debates in the market now is we get a soft landing. And based on the general market in and of itself, seems that\u2019s potentially a real likely outcome. But how to think about modules within the context of the choke, is there any way to think about that? Chad Richison : I mean we definitely have leading indicators that we look at like for background checks, how many people running background checks which is an impact of oftentimes onboarding and what have you. I mean all I would say is this. I mean those types of things are going to impact us a little bit on the margin. But for us, it's really about new logo wins with our differentiated strategy. That's what's really going to drive our growth. Sometimes you have some things that help you with that a little bit and that could be what's going on in the labor market. But I would say it would have to be something extreme to have any negative impact on us. And likewise, I would say it would have to also be extreme on the other side to have some major positive impact on us, except for the fact that our go-to markets normalize and how we're going to market. It's like the way we were going to market pre-pandemic which for us being out there face-to-face and having those personal interchanges and exchanges of ideas and information really helps us when we're selling deals. Kevin McVeigh : That makes sense. Congrats, again. Chad Richison : Thank you. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Robert Simmons with D.A. Davidson. Robert Simmons : So following up on Samad, your sequential guide is the strongest it\u2019s been, in I believe, 5 years. Are you expecting anything unusual in the quarter such as extra strong burns from this year or anything like that? Chad Richison : Okay. I'm making sure I understand, the sequential guide into fourth quarter. We kind of talked -- I kind of talked a little bit about this earlier. When deals start in a quarter matters. And so if a deal starts at the first of the quarter in October, we get 100% of the revenue billing for that. If a deal start -- or let's even take this quarter that we just finished with the deal started at the beginning of July, we get 100% of the revenue dollars for that deal. If the deal starts in mid-September, we might get 15% of the revenue for that deal. But in subsequent quarters, we get 100% of it. And so it's a recurring revenue model that we have here. So all I would say is that does matter. I've also talked about how -- Craig and I have been talking about how interest rates layer in over time. Eventually, they start layering in as well. I think you get a little bit of uplift from that as well. But for us, it's really the new client adds onto our platform when they start and our expectation that there'll be -- we'll receive 100% of the revenue billing in subsequent quarters, fourth quarter being the next one. Robert Simmons : Got it. So it\u2019s basically just those 2 things, might switch moving around Q3 versus Q4. All right. Great. And then I guess just have you seen any notable in your competition? I realize it\u2019s the same basis as usual but any changes in kind of the pricing, marketing approach? Any idea who\u2019s commenting recently that they\u2019re seeing their churn kind of increase in normalized but only a little bit, I mean, what are you seeing on that front? A -- Chad Richison Yes. I mean I will tell you that we\u2019ve always been in a very competitive market. As you\u2019ve mentioned, it\u2019s been with the same people. We\u2019re the new people. We\u2019re the new guys. And next year, we\u2019re 25 years in business. So we really benchmark against ourselves in the current situation about the -- with the ROI that we can create if someone uses our product. You\u2019re not going to get the same ROI if you use one of our competitors. You\u2019re just not. And so the extent someone agrees with our strategy and can realize the ROI available for them if they deploy it correctly, they\u2019re going to choose us over someone else, regardless of what\u2019s really going on with pricing. That said, pricing does matter. There\u2019s a market for pricing and I think that we all understand that. But as far as seeing any changes with our competitors, no. Other than they all continue to deploy things that they believe will make them more competitive. And sometimes that\u2019s pricing. And sometimes it\u2019s giving things for free. So it just kind of depends on what we\u2019ll see out there. But it\u2019s really been the same that we\u2019ve always seen. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison for closing remarks. Chad Richison : Okay. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining our call today and thank you all and I want to thank all of our employees for contributing to our continued success. In November, we\u2019ll be hosting meetings in Las Vegas at the Wells Fargo TMT Summit and presenting at the Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference in Scottsdale. Then in December, we\u2019ll be presenting at the Barclays TMT Conference in San Francisco. We look forward to speaking with many of you soon. Operator, you may disconnect. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We ended 2022 with very strong results, and I'd like to thank all of our employees for the consistent hard work and execution that drove 4 consecutive quarters of revenue growth of 30% or more over the respective prior year periods. I'll spend a few minutes on the highlights of our fourth quarter and our full year 2022 results and high-level expectations for 2023. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. Our 2022 fourth quarter revenue of approximately $371 million came in very strong, up 30% year-over-year, bringing our full year 2022 revenue to $1.375 billion, also up 30% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA also came in very strong at $164 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 44% bringing our full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to $580 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42%. The sum of our 2022 revenue growth rate and adjusted EBITDA margin resulted in us hitting the Rule of 72. With our full year 2023 guidance, we are once again starting the year strong with outlook for a solid Rule of 65. As a reminder, we guide to what we can see based on our existing recurring revenue, new business sales and anticipated new starts in the near term. I'm pleased with the momentum we are carrying into the new year. On the product front, 2022 was a very strong year for Paycom benefiting from our first full year of rolling out Beti, our differentiated employee self-service payroll solution. We are seeing strong demand trends that position us to deliver another year of rapid profitable growth in 2023. We are leading an industry transformation by making payroll and HCM processes more efficient for both employees and businesses by eliminating manual tasks, improving accuracy and reducing liability exposure caused when payroll and HCM is done in accurately. With Beti, employees are doing their own payroll by interfacing directly with their data and a self-service, easy-to-use software. A recent study conducted by Ernst & Young found that the average organization has a 20% in accuracy rate when it comes to payrolls, which results in lost revenue, hours wasted correcting errors and increased exposure to potential lawsuits and fines. Each of these mistakes cost an average of $291 and could cost upwards of $705 for unentered nonproductive time errors. So you can see how costly these errors become over time. In fact, over the course of the year, a 1,000-employee company could potentially incur almost $1 million in unnecessary costs, correcting common payroll mistakes. Beti automates the payroll processes to deliver perfect payroll and employees are empowered to identify and correct errors ahead of time so that everybody wins. Our marketing plan in 2022 continued to perform well, delivering strong demo leads throughout the year as we spend aggressively on advertising. At the same time, our deliberate investments in marketing are delivering high-margin revenues and we saw improving operating leverage in the sales and marketing throughout 2022. We continue to be pulled upmarket in 2022 with the fastest-growing revenue segment of our business coming from clients with greater than 2,000 employees. We are seeing increasing demand from larger organizations that are recognizing the opportunity to simplify their HCM needs. And Paycom is well positioned to benefit from this trend. With only approximately 5% of the TAM today, there's still plenty of runway ahead for us to expand our market share. Paycom received national recognition from several organizations in 2022. As a workplace, we were named One of America's Most Trusted Companies, as well as Best Company for Women, and we received a Top Workplace in Oklahoma award for a tenth consecutive year. These awards are a testament to our hard work, our thriving corporate culture and our client focus. As of December 31, 2022, our headcount stood at over 6,300 employees, up 18% and year-over-year as we continue to have great success attracting and retaining high-quality talent to further bolster our future growth. Additionally, I want to congratulate the 2022 Paycom Jim Thorpe Award winner, Travis Hodges Tomlinson from Texas Christian University. This award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes Jim Thorpe, who is one of the greatest all-around athletes in history. Jim Thorpe also happened to be an Oklahoman. To sum up, our focus on the employee experience and client ROI continue to fuel our strong results and we are executing well. I'm very excited about the long list of new innovative opportunities we will be pursuing in 2023 and beyond. I'd like to thank our employees for helping to make 2022 such a strong year and we are set up for another great year in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our fourth quarter and full year results for 2022 and our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the year with very strong results with full year 2022 revenue of $1.375 billion, up 30.3% compared to 2021. Fourth quarter results were excellent, with total revenues of $370.6 million, representing growth of 30% over the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth was driven by strong demand, new business wins and adoption of recent new product offerings. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $364 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 30% from the comparable prior year period. We ended 2022 with approximately 36,600 clients, representing a growth rate of 8% compared to 2021. On a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with roughly 19,100 clients, also up 8% compared to 2021. Total number of employee records increased 14% year-over-year in 2022 to 6.5 million. Paycom's annual revenue retention rate in 2022 was 93%, which was consistent with our recent 4-year average of 93% and up more than 200 basis points from the prior 4-year period average of 91%. Total adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $312.5 million, representing an adjusted gross margin of 84.3%. For the full year 2022, our adjusted gross margin was 84.9%. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $87.3 million or 23.5% of revenues. Our marketing strategy in 2022 has been very effective at driving high-quality demo leads with the revenue generated from prior period investments, we saw a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues for the year. We plan to continue to invest in marketing in Q1 and throughout 2023. Adjusted R&D expense was $36.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 or 9.9% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $51.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $44 million in the prior year period. We have a very strong pipeline of product development opportunities in 2023 that we believe will create tremendous value for our clients and for Paycom. Adjusted EBITDA was $163.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 or 44.2% of total revenues compared to $109.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 or 38.4% and of total revenues. For the full year 2022, adjusted EBITDA was $579.7 million or 42.2% of total revenues compared to $419.3 million or 39.7% of total revenues in 2021, representing over 240 basis points of margin expansion. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $80 million or $1.38 per diluted share versus $48.7 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year period based on approximately 58 million shares in both periods. For the full year 2022, our GAAP net income was $281.4 million, or $4.84 per diluted share, up 44% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $100.2 million or $1.73 per diluted share versus $64.4 million or $1.11 per diluted share in the prior year period. For the full year 2022, our non-GAAP net income was $357.2 million or $6.14 per diluted share versus $260.4 million or $4.48 per diluted share in the prior year period, up 37% year-over-year. For Q1 and full year 2023, we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a GAAP basis and approximately 26% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $401 million and total debt of $29 million. During 2022, we repurchased approximately 365,000 shares for a total of nearly $100 million. Through December 31, 2022, Paycom has repurchased nearly 4.7 million shares since 2016 for a total of nearly $590 million, and we currently have $1.1 billion remaining in our buyback program. Cash from operations was $365 million in 2022, representing an increase of 14.3%. The new requirement in 2022 to capitalize instead of expense R&D costs resulted in approximately $27 million in additional income tax payments that would have been deferred under previous law. This impacted both our operating cash flow and free cash flow as compared to 2021. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. For 2023, we anticipate stock compensation to be approximately $120 million. On the capital expenditure front, we're in full construction of our fifth building in Oklahoma City, and we now estimate total CapEx as a percent of revenues to be approximately 12% in 2023. Now let me turn to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.702 billion or approximately 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $700 million to $702 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 41% at the midpoint of the range. Once again, we are starting the year's guidance at the Rule of 65. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect total revenues in the range of $443 million to $445 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 26% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $210 million to $212 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 48% at the midpoint of the range. 2022 was a very strong year for Paycom, reflecting the strength of prior year investments and consistent execution. We will continue to invest in talent, marketing, innovation, customer service and geographic expansion to meet the strong demands we are experiencing. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Two questions. Chad, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on there in terms of end demand, obviously, the markets are nervous, the kind of data points about SMB coming in that they might be weaker on some of the players in the other segments of the software market. So just talk a little bit about what you're seeing. We're also looking at the numbers, your renewals came in at 93 versus 94. Just kind of just paint a picture for us a little bit there. And then one for Craig, if you think about the new year and investments, like how do you think balance that kind of seeing other guys be nervous about the economy and your investment approach for the year? Just talk a little bit about the flexibility there. Chad Richison : Yes, I'll start off. I mean our go-to-market remains very strong. We continue to have very strong book sales, and we've been selling Beti across the board. New clients that come in have about 50% of their employees doing their own payroll within the first 2 months of using Beti. And so that continues to be successful. From 2015 to 2018, we had a retention rate of anywhere from 91% to 92%, was 91% for 3 of those years and 92% for 1 of those years. For the last 4 years, from 2019 through 2022, we've had a retention rate of 93% for 3 of the years and 94% of one of those years. There's often rounding at play as you look through that. But what I will also say is with clients who have Beti, we have a much, much higher retention rate across our base. And I would expect retention to continue to rise as a larger percent of our current client base deploys Beti. Craig Boelte : Yes, Raimo on the plan for 2023, we've given our guidance on our adjusted EBITDA. And it's still a very strong guide on that as we're looking at 41%. So we -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're going to continue to spend on the marketing side, the R&D side and then in the service side as well. And really, the marketing is the one area where we can pull leverage. We don't have any long-term commitments out there. So that is an area where we could pull levers if we needed to. Operator : The next question comes from Samad Samana of Jefferies. Samad Samana : Great. I guess first one, Chad, did I hear you say -- I think you said you had just north of 6,300 employees. I think that's high teens growth over the prior year. I'm just curious how we should think about the hiring in context of it's slightly slower than it was in 2021. I'm just curious, is it that we're -- should you expect just productivity to increase? Maybe what the exit rate on that growth rate is and just how we think about the hiring trends for Paycom itself? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, we hired what we look to hire last year. I believe our growth was around 18% in hiring. We definitely have a more efficient client. I've been talking about for quite some time, who we kind of have the haves and the have-nots when you look across our client base with those clients that have already deployed Beti and are getting strong usage out of it. We're just -- we're having to do less for them. I mean we're having to fix less things. We're having to do less adjustments, and so they're just much more efficient. And so we don't need as many people when people are using Beti. That said, we had a very healthy growth in our employment last year. And so I believe we had success with that. Samad Samana : Great. And then maybe if I just think about -- we've almost fully lapped the new office expansions by a year. I know it usually takes a little bit over a year for them to become fully productive, but just how are those progressing? And how should we think about -- are there any new planned offices that you're assuming in the 2023 guidance that you just gave? Chad Richison : We always guide to what we can see. I mean, first, I'll answer those office questions. We did open up 5 offices over the course of about 3 months. One of those, I believe, was in December of 2021. The others were in the first quarter of 2022. All of those continue to progress. They wouldn't be at full staffing yet, but they would achieve that throughout this year as well as with the full backline pipeline. And then next year, in the year of 2024, they would all be on the same quota as our mature offices are. As far as what we anticipate to do this year from office openings, as we all know, that you followed us for a while, office openings that we would anticipate to expand into this year would have very little impact on this year but would have more of an impact on both 2024 as well as 2025. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Marcon of Baird. Mark Marcon : One question. Craig, you mentioned you've got $2.1 billion held for cash, held for clients in the fourth quarter. What sort of effective yield are you getting on that? And what is the expectation with regards to the float balance growing over the course of the coming year? And how we should think about an effective yield on that? Craig Boelte : Yes. So Mark, on the balance, if you look at it this quarter, it grew about -- it's grown at different rates throughout 2022. So it's typically going to grow at a rate lower than what our expected revenue growth rate is going to be. Part of that is as we continue to move upmarket, that those funds are held for a less period of time. We have to make those payments much quicker. So that move up market, we'd keep that from growing at the same rate as our growth rate. In terms of the yield, we haven't really given the exact yield but what we do say is that as the rates move up for every 25 basis points, we would expect to get about $5 million. But it layers in over time. And as we're continuing to look for longer-term investments on our portfolio, some of those are at a little lower rate. And we've actually started to layer in some of those. You can see that from some of our earlier filings. So we're not going to get -- and also the banks are a little slower to give you those 25 basis points. So it takes a couple of quarters to get those layered in. So it would be something lower than the Fed funds rate. Mark Marcon : Okay. Would the rule of thumb, 70% to 80% of Fed funds with a delay be kind of a good rule of thumb to think of? Chad Richison : I mean -- well, I think you're close. Craig Boelte : I mean I would say that that's kind of in the range, Mark. Chad Richison : We're sub-4 today. Craig Boelte : Yes, we're sub-4. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. Brian Schwartz : Congratulations on a real nice job with the business in 4Q. I just wanted to ask you a question about either the business activity or the pipeline momentum by customer size. Are you seeing any differences in terms of the demand or the behavior of the larger organizations that are flowing through the pipeline versus, say, the smaller companies? Chad Richison : Well, we've definitely continued to creep up as we have done even since IPO as we've continued to increase our target market. In fact, last year, revenue was up 60% with clients that had 2,000 employees or more. So we are definitely seeing a demand continuing to be pulled higher, especially as businesses are looking to deploy Beti so that their employees can actually do their own favorable. Brian Schwartz : And then one follow-up just for Craig real quickly. Did you buy back any stock in the quarter? And can you just remind me again how much authorization you've left for buybacks? Craig Boelte : Yes. So I don't think -- we didn't buy back any this quarter. For the full year, we bought back about $100 million worth. And I think we have a $1.1 billion left on our buyback. Operator : The next question comes from Joshua Reilly of Needham. Joshua Reilly : If you look at the growth expectations for 2023 here, how do you think about the mix of growth from new customers versus existing? As we know existing customers, while smaller historically in net new bookings, their growth has increased in the last couple of years. And we're seeing some different trends with different software vendors. Chad Richison : Yes. We're -- ours is going to primarily come from new logo ads when you just look at the size of revenue that we need to grow by in order to continue to hit our objectives. And so first price is going to be new logo adds. We don't really have a lot to call out on pace per control growth from that perspective. But new logo ads is going to be primary for us. We've always had a healthy upsell to current clients. It's just been at a much smaller level than what new logo ads are. And it's been consistent, our upsells to current clients as a percentage has been consistent each year with the exception of the year we had ACA. Joshua Reilly : Got it. That's helpful. And then as we look to Q1 here, how should we think about the impact from W2 revenue? Remember, last year, that was impacted on a year-over-year basis because of the turnover in 2020 due to COVID. Are the trends going to normalize here in this March quarter given what happened in '22 with hiring or anything to highlight there? Chad Richison : Yes. I feel like they are more normal. I think it's important to understand that the -- our year-end services as far as what we provide to a client. That hasn't changed a lot in the last 15 years as far as you added 10 99s at one point, but you have W2s, W3s 10 99. Meanwhile, the growth of our other revenue as we've added all these other products has been somewhat substantial. And so it's just the percentage or amount that our year-end services has on the overall client base is much lower now than what it was in the past just because it's not growing at the same rate. I would say, yes. I mean I would say, yes, from a normalization. I think you saw normal hiring and business patterns more so last year than what you had in year's past -- in a couple of years past. So from a normalization of year in forms filing, yes, I would say that we were there. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Enders of Citigroup. Steve Enders : I guess I just want to dig into a little bit more on the outlook for next year and particularly on the margin side. I think you talked about in the past that if we think about float income flowing through that, that some of that would flow down to the bottom line. So just trying to think about how you're thinking about that layering in for '23 and kind of where are the biggest areas of incremental investments are coming and that's lead into the EBITDA, slight guide down from where we were in '22. Craig Boelte : Yes. Primarily, we've continued to invest in sales and marketing, and that's what we said on the prepared remarks. We're going to continue to invest there and assuming it's going to continue to work. So that's really the area where we're going to continue to invest. Also in the R&D, I mean, we have a lot of projects in the works, and we'll continue to hire aggressively in the R&D side as well. Steve Enders : Okay. And I guess on the marketing spend that you're putting out there, I know it's been a more recent initiative for you all, I guess, what's kind of been the ROI on those dollars that you have seen? And how has that kind of changed the top of funnel activity or conversion rates that you've seen as kind of the brand awareness campaigns have gotten out there more? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean marketing, we started in 2020. That was also the year that we added 4 inside sales teams. And then in 2021, we added another 6 inside sales teams. I believe one of those years, our unit count went up about 17% with 72% growth. Marketing drove that as we do our marketing and spend money on advertising we have clients of all size call us. And so marketing is directly responsible for any business that's coming in below 50 employees. And you have some direct responsibility for it above 50 employees, but it provides more support at that level as our go-to-market's different, above 50 employees than what we experience below. Growth first prize, as Craig has talked about. And as we look at guidance into this year, we expect to spend healthy marketing. But also, we expect for it to work, which would return itself with highly profitable revenue, which we did see throughout 2022, which produced a healthy adjusted EBITDA margins. Operator : The next question comes from Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Siti Panigrahi : Chad, if I look at your clients' growth in 2022, 8%, that's kind of slowing down versus pre-COVID level, which used to be more in teens. I'm sure there's a factor of like you're moving up markets or client size, but is there anything else we should -- anything that impact it? And how should we think about the client growth rate going forward? Chad Richison : Yes, I would say the comp had a little bit to do with it. Prior to 2020, we had 5 sales reps that sold inside sales. In 2020, we added 40. And then in 2022, we added roughly another 50, 60. So we started selling small business, emerging business in a much stronger way as the advertising was working. So -- and I don't want to say that our unit count was inflated prior, but it was different because we did add a lot of small business units and it contributed to a 17% growth in units. I think we've had -- and again, it did that in the year where we did 25% revenue growth. So I think as we look last year, you could deduct that we had a lot of success selling in midrange and above midrange in clients. And I would say our small business adds were somewhat more normalized because we didn't really add any small business teams last year like we had in 2020 and 2021. Siti Panigrahi : And then as a follow-up, into your guidance, what sort of conservatism have you baked into your guidance. I know this is definitely going to help floating come this year, but what sort of macro environment you're factored in into your guidance? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, we continue to guide in the $2 million range. So we have quite a bit of visibility as we go quarter-to-quarter. I will say that in -- we started our guide last year for 2022, we started it at 25%, and we were comping over a year where we had done 25% growth. This year, we're starting our guide at 24% comping over a year where we had done 30% growth. And so we haven't changed our approach to guidance. We guide what we can see and achievement matters throughout the year. And so that's what we're focused on as we move throughout the year. And so I'm trying to answer your conservatism. I mean, we guide to what we can see each time, and we look to unload the musket throughout the quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : I wanted to follow up on retention first. So I heard the comments about Beti clients being higher and the relative stability from prior years. But just as we think about the year-on-year downtick here, can you talk about -- is this larger client churn? Or is it a lot of turn among smaller clients? Just trying to understand that dynamic. Chad Richison : Well, we're definitely -- from a smaller client perspective, and of course, they contribute smaller revenue amounts. But from a smaller client perspective, I do think that you're sending more -- you're seeing more of a trend -- like maybe what you saw more pre-pandemic, I mean there's less prop up for them in the market. For most new businesses, I believe, about 75% of them fell within the first 3 years. So all that's at play when you're working with smaller business. As I just mentioned, we started adding -- really started adding those small business units in 2020 and then continue throughout 2021 and even added more obviously in 2022. And so that definitely plays into it. I would also say that it's a revenue retention number. So you have a dividing number that you start with. I've been talking for quite some time about the efficiencies that clients are using Beti and what they're gaining. In fact, we're just -- we're not having the same hiccups with them that we would often charge them for at a lower margin and then have to fix. And now those are really being prevented with Beti. So you've got a couple of things at play. And then also, you've got some rounding at play, but all that's to say is 93% from what I've seen still up there an industry-leading number. And I do expect, again, with clients that have Beti, I mean we're running at a 99% type retention rate with them. So it's a little bit different there. And as we continue to convert our current client base over to Beti, we expect to have some gains in that. I will mention that we always have some uncontrolled losses, your bot sold merge type businesses. So getting to 100% isn't achievable. But I believe that we continue to have an opportunity to bump up retention, and that's going to come through usage -- appropriate usage of our product. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Understood. And then a follow-up on margin here. So Craig, I may have missed it, but did you say where you expect gross margin to land in 2023? And I hear your message on increased efficiency in sales and marketing, and you've also mentioned increased, I guess, new product development. Should we expect that the explanation around EBITDA downtick year-on-year, more about R&D ramping? Or is it both R&D and S&M? Craig Boelte : Yes. I would say it's both R&D and sales and marketing. And as we're looking for our plans for 2023. We didn't really talk about the adjusted EBITDA, but we've been doing a pretty narrow range for the last several years. Yes, gross margin for the last several years. Operator : The next question comes from Jason Celino of KeyBanc. Jason Celino : Maybe, Chad, you've been pretty vocal about opportunities in automated payroll and broader HR -- when we think about generative AI, I feel like this is up your alley. I mean, what excites you most about the technology if you've looked into it? And what could it mean for Paycom and HR as a whole? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, we are solving problems for the client and processes that I believe can be automated and hadn't been until really Beti came into play, which somewhat forces appropriate usage within our software for employees so that they can get paid correctly. I do believe that there's more automation that we can be doing. But you've got to start with, you've got to have the client and the employees using the product correctly, which I will say that about 50% of our client base, that is the case. And last year was our first full year of selling Beti and bringing it to the market. And so we're having a lot of success for that. I believe AI for the sake of AI isn't really valuable to the client. But I believe that if you can do something consistently and you can use something like AI to do that, I think that's a good thing. So I don't expect we would see it as a wide platform within our industry this year type thing with that, but I think you'll have more and more businesses looking for that machine learning and other types of automation that could be used to automate problems experienced by our clients right now. Jason Celino : Okay. No, that's fair. And then just, Craig, maybe a quick one. I think the beat in the quarter, $18 million, 6% beat toward the higher end of what we've typically seen over the last 4 years. Anything to note on the strength, expense management, anything on timing of some investments? Craig Boelte : I mean there are really 3 or 4 buckets that really helped drive that EBITDA beat. One, your marketing spend was a little higher fourth quarter, and some of that is just when we are doing those marketing things that we had planned. A little higher capitalization rate on the development, and that's focused on new initiatives. Beti clients generate higher-quality revenue. So we saw a little bit of that. And then in the quarter, we had a net insurance proceeds of about $4.8 million for expenses that were incurred both current and prior year quarters. So that's really what drove the adjusted EBITDA beat. Operator : The next question comes from Arvind Ramnani of Piper Sandler. Arvind Ramnani : I just wanted to ask a question. How should we think about growth from existing clients who are expanding their own client base? Chad Richison : Not any different than what we've experienced in the past. I mean, again, I'm removing the COVID year out of that, but not any different than what we've experienced in the past. In any given year, you have some clients grow, you have some clients not. You have some clients buy business. You have some clients sell business. And so I believe that's always somewhat worked itself out. Maybe we win some. Maybe we lose some. But really, the growth for us is driven by new logo adds. I mean, Holly has booked sales numbers that drive our revenue growth, and that's how we're going to hit our targets. I think that we expect stability within our current client base as we look to guide, we do have an assumption of stability. We don't really make assumptions of growth and/or downsizing within those -- within our current part -- across a 30,000-plus client base seems -- it tends to have averaged out over the last 25 years that I've done this with the exception of the 2020 -- some in 2021 time period. Arvind Ramnani : Terrific. And if you can just kind of help me to reconcile the 8% growth in new logos versus 14% employee expansion? How should I interpret those two numbers? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, that would tell you that the client size is growing as well there. We -- I've been continuing to call out that we're having success continuing to be pulled further and further up market. A couple of years or about 6 years ago, we went from 2,000 to 5,000. A couple of years ago, I mentioned that we're going up to 10,000. I talked about how we're continuing to go up even further. And so that's going to get you a larger employee count with potential for less of a unit count. But I would also say, I don't want to overlook the fact that we've had a lot of success on the small business unit. And when you're looking at unit count growth, they're all created equal. I mean everything is -- whether you're a 1 employee unit or whether you're a 10,000-employee unit, you're created equal on that report from a unit count percentage. But it's just been a trend to larger clients with the exception of the 2 years where we decided we're going to add our small business, emerging business units, our groups, of which now we have 10 teams and that really hasn't grown. The teams haven't grown. Of course, we continue to add small business units. Operator : The next question comes from Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Bhavin Shah : Chad, I know we touched on this a bit earlier in the call, but are you seeing anything as it relates to changes in the pipeline generation or sales cycles over the past few months? Maybe even reasons why customers are maybe looking to switch and selecting take up. Chad Richison : I mean we continue to have strong product demonstration leads, but that's oftentimes a function of our marketing and advertising, and we pay for those leads. I can say for us, it's been business as usual. We've been back in the field since September last year, meaning actually back on site on every single call, where before we were doing more of a hybrid some were virtual, some were in person. So I would say, if anything, we're having less calls with the client to get to close. I can't necessarily say that's speeding up the process, but I think we're having better conversations as we go through the process. So really nothing to call out there. Other than today, when a client calls Paycom and looks to have a product demonstration, it's about Beti. And I would say, in times past, it could be about whatever thorn had in their paw that we'd be looking to pull out. So it's a little different today in the type of lead we are generating. Bhavin Shah : Got it. And just a follow-up, how do you think about the par opportunity in 2023 relative to some of the growth that you saw in 2022? Any specific areas of modules that are -- Chad Richison : Well, Beti definitely drives PEPM, because you definitely have to have a certain product set for us -- from us purchased and being used -- so I would say that the clients that we are selling in 2022 have a better, stronger product mix than those clients we would have been selling in 2018 in or 2019. We still do have an opportunity with current clients. We do have to really work at their pace to get them over to Beti and really to get them to achieve the value that it can deliver, and we continue to look at that. And there's still opportunities obviously, within our current client base to deliver more PEPM as well as on new business sales. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Daniel Jester of BMO Capital Markets. Daniel Jester : Great. Just on that comment about Beti, Chad, can you update us what percentage of the base has Beti at year-end? Chad Richison : We're around 50%. It's about where we were when we reported in November, as clients go through year-end, there's different objectives for both them and us as we're onboarding clients. Beti does require a conversion of process on the side of the client as it is going to change how their employees utilize the system. There's a detailed conversion type plan that we go through with every current client as they choose how and when to deploy. But we're continuing to meet out there with our clients. I would also say that your larger clients are deploying it a lot quicker. Current clients are deploying it a lot quicker than what your smaller clients -- current clients might be deploying it as a point that I would mention once more all businesses of any size, whether they're small or large since July of 2021 have been sold and converted into Beti. So we're really talking about our current client base that we had prior to that. Daniel Jester : Great. And then just lastly, and you touched on this a couple of times about sort of the upmarket success and opportunities. As I think about sort of how you're investing to attack those opportunities. Is this strategic, i.e., that you're devoting more resources specifically because you think there's more opportunity upmarket? Or is this tactical in which kind of year in and year out, you're deploying resources and maybe 1 year, you see more opportunities smaller and down market and another you're seeing more opportunity in the upmarket, so you can be sort of tactical with those sales investments. Chad Richison : Yes, I'd say it's a little bit of both. And one thing I've been saying for quite some time now, our industry shifted. It shifted to leverage employee usage to help the client. When employees use the product correctly, the client has less exposure and liability around this process, which paying employees, providing them benefits and everything else. I mean that carries some exposure, even how you have an employee applies for a job. And so I believe that all these -- the self-service technology has really been helping the client. The reason I say that is this, when it comes to an employee, Jan Smith, whether Jan Smith works at a 30 employee or whether Jan Smith works for a 10,000 employee in regards to how they work with HCM and payroll products it's substantially the same as far as the needs that Jan has. So what I would say is we've stayed very focused on the employee and an employees and employee regardless of which company they work for. Are there some things that a larger company we just know we're going to run into that's going to be different than what we would run into in a company that might have 150 employees? Absolutely, there's some changes in that. And I would say that's where more strategy comes into play as well as making tactical moves to make sure that we're able to provide the back-end experience that they're looking for. But I will say the more that we're doing at the employee level, the less you're having to do on the back end because a lot of the things you're doing on the back end is to make sure you're not having issues with the employee data and/or if you do, you're having to fix it. And so you get a lot of points for prevention these days. And large companies, they don't want to do a lot of extra work either. Operator : Thank you. And with that, we will conclude our time of question and answer. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Chad Richison for closing remarks. Chad Richison : Well, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today, and I want to send a special thank you to our employees for contributing to our continued success. The 2022 is a great year for Paycom, and we're set up for another great year in 2023. We'll be hosting meetings in New York at the Wolfe March Madness Software Conference in February. We'll also be participating in the KeyBanc Emerging Tech Conference and the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in San Francisco in March. We look forward to catching up with many of you soon. And operator, you may disconnect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call. Thank you for your participation. We would now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Matt and I will be the moderator for today's call. All lines have been muted during the presentation portion of the call for an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, James Samford, Head of Investor Relations. James, please go ahead. James Samford : Thank you, and welcome to Paycom's earnings conference call for the first quarter 2023.

A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today, and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James. And thank you to everyone joining our call today. We delivered strong results in the first quarter and I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on a variety of initiatives. I'll start with highlights from the first quarter then I'll discuss some of our plans for the remainder of the year. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance and discuss our new dividend policy, then we will take questions. With that, let's get started. Our 2023 first quarter revenue of approximately $452 million came in very strong up 28% year-over-year with strong recurring revenue growth from new clients. First quarter adjusted EBITDA also came in very strong at $221 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of roughly 49% up 70 basis points year-over-year. With our updated full-year 2023 guidance, we are well positioned to exceed our initial outlook for a solid Rule of 65. On the product front, BETI continues to be a key differentiator in the market with Employee Self Service Payroll continuing to drive strong client additions. The industry transformation to more efficient HCM and payroll processes is accelerating. And now with BETI, payroll processes can be automated to deliver perfect payroll. Using BETI, employees do their own payroll. Employee usage is a key differentiator and new clients are coming to Paycom for exactly that. With 95% of database interactions being completed by the employees of our clients, as measured by the DDX, we are changing the way employees engage with HCM solutions. Our product and go-to-market strategy are working. I just returned from our Annual President's Club Meeting with our top salespeople. And I couldn't be more excited about the tone of the conversations and enthusiasm for our product especially around employee usage in BETI. We are having increasing success at market with continued rapid growth at the upper end of our target market range. Large organizations benefit tremendously from simplifying their HCM and payroll needs with our single database solution. We have 5% of the TAM today, however, our TAM has increased now that we've laid the groundwork for our global platform beginning with Global HCM, which further strengthens our value proposition with our largest clients. To sum up, we are executing well with a highly differentiated product and go-to-market strategy. Our addressable market opportunities continue to expand and we are pleased to enhance our long-term commitment to stockholder return with the initiation of the quarterly dividend program. I'd like to thank our employees for helping lay the foundation for another record breaking year. With that I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Before I review our first quarter results for 2023 and our outlook for the second quarter and full-year 2023, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We delivered very strong results this quarter with revenue of $451.6 million up 27.8% compared to the prior-year period. Our GAAP net income for the first quarter was $119.3 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, up 29.8% compared to the prior-year period based on approximately 58 million shares. Adjusted EBITDA was $220.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 or 48.8% of total revenues, compared to $170.1 million in the first quarter of 2022, or 48.1% of total revenues. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2023 was $142.7 million, or $2.46 per diluted share up 28.9% from the prior-year period. Our revenue growth was driven by strong demand, new business wins and new product adoption. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $444.4 million for the first quarter of 2023, representing 98.4% of total revenues for the quarter, and growing 27.6% from the comparable prior-year period. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2023 was $98.1 million or 21.7% of revenues. We have been aggressively investing in marketing to drive strong demo leads that complement our outside sales model. Adjusted R&D expense was $37.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 or 8.3% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion was $55.2 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $42.9 million in the prior-year period, reflecting continued investment in new products. For Q2 and full-year 2023, we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be approximately 28% on a GAAP basis, and approximately 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet including cash and cash equivalents of $506 million and total debt of $29 million. Cash from operations was $146.1 million in the first quarter, representing an increase of 24.6%. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023, up approximately 10% year-over-year. Now let me turn to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we are raising our outlook and now expect revenue in the range of $1.713 billion to $1.715 billion or approximately 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $717 million to $719 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 42% at the midpoint of the range. With these strong results and outlook, we are well positioned to exceed the Rule of 65. For the second quarter of 2023, we expect total revenues in the range of $397 million to $399 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior-year period of approximately 26% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $152 million to $154 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 38% at the midpoint of the range. Finally, after 25 years of rapidly growing Paycom into a highly profitable company, we're expanding our capital allocation strategy. On May 1, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend program that we expect to initiate in mid-May. In 2023, we project Paycom would generate greater than $1.7 billion in revenues, over $700 million in adjusted EBITDA and strong operating cash flow, all of which continue to grow. We believe Paycom is in a unique position to return value to stockholders in the form of a dividend and still have the necessary resources to aggressively pursue growth opportunities. Since 2016, we returned a total of nearly $600 million to stockholders through stock buybacks and we have a $1.1 billion buyback authorization still in place. Today's dividend policy announcement reflects our confidence and the resilience of our long-term growth opportunity, the strength of our balance sheet and the profitability of our business model. We intend to pay a dividend at an annual rate of $1.50 per share with a first quarterly dividend of $37.5 per share payable in mid-June subject to Board approval. 2023 is off to a great start, we are in a strong financial and strong competitive position in a large and attractive addressable market, we have a long runway to continue to deliver rapid organic revenue growth, high profit margins and attractive cash flows. With that, we will open the line for questions, operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Congrats on a number of strong quarter and dividend introduction. Two quick questions for me. First, on the global initiative, Chad, can you help us understand a little bit like how a global or like what's the extent of what you're trying to do here? Is this like helping existing customers that have subsidiaries? Is this like a whole sea change in strategy that you become like more international? Just help us understand a little bit there and then I have one follow-up? Chad Richison : Sure, and so right now, Raimo, we have several clients who currently use our domestic software, and they use it internationally, they rigged the system a little bit so that they can store employees in other countries, and then oftentimes, they'll work with a third-party for payroll. So our current clients, they don't have to do this any longer. Because the Paycom system now does have Global HCM product that'll work in 180 countries in 15 languages. And Global HCM for us is everything, minus the payroll side. And so, we've looked at integration opportunities, we've looked at working with third-parties, and even potential acquisitions. But the fact is everyone else does it the old way, and payroll and HR departments send data for processing. And we're not going to be putting any development into the old way. So for us, BETI is packing her bags, and we'll be going around the globe, as we develop it out. Raimo Lenschow : Yes, yes, okay, perfect. Okay. But does it mean that you want to become now a global company with operations in other major countries? Or is this just more for U.S. domestic clients to give them more optionality and kind of work with them better? Chad Richison : Yes, absolutely. We'll be a global company, this is the first step. And that's moving our product into the different languages and getting the HCM side done. And now we're heavily focused on bringing BETI to the other countries which it will require us to have operations in certain countries in order to do that, in order to process in those countries. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Samad Samana : Hi, good afternoon, and congrats on the good quarter. Chad, I had a whole list of questions. But then you said the word open to acquisitions, which I'm really stay before. So I'm going to pivot in real time here and ask you between the dividend announcement, you mentioning potential for M&A, which is something to take on as an historically done, is M&A something that is just maybe going to be something part of the broader capital allocation strategy of how to use the company's cash going forward or and is that just limited to maybe the global side of it? Or is it -- would it be something you'd explore in other areas too? Chad Richison : Well, I mean, I don't want to say never, but it's been our process to develop internally and develop things that way and grow that way. And so my comment early were earlier was more as we looked at building out the payroll side internationally, we did review multiple options for that. But at the end of the day, there's no shortcut to long-term success. And so, at the end of the day, we're going to dance with what brung us and we know how to develop software. And we're already well on our way in getting things set up to be able to have a Beti in all the other countries as well. So on answer to your question, I would say more no, Samad, I mean, if I was going to have to be direct with that, but we did do a dividend and we still have a $1.1 billion buyback in place. Samad Samana : Great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Craig, just the numbers on the margin side were impressive as always, the sales and marketing dollars jumped a pretty good bit from 4Q to 1Q more than you normally see. I was just curious, I know, you mentioned marketing campaigns. Was there any acceleration or pull forward maybe in sales, headcount addition, or anything else that we need to maybe be aware there beyond just digital marketing? And how should we think about that maybe going forward? Craig Boelte : No, I would just say it's pretty normal, I think last Q1 was slightly down. But yes, I mean, just kind of normal marketing spin and campaigns that what we talked about kind of from Q4 of 2022 to Q1 of 2023. Some of those pushed into this quarter. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is now open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Chad, do you have a pretty unique perspective on the economy across the country? Down market, up market, GEOs [ph], verticals? Anything you're seeing specifically that gives you pause or optimism? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, no, I wouldn't say either way. I mean, I do think it's a little bit easier to hire, I would look at the -- if you're looking at from a year ago, I would say the labor market was a little bit tighter for us on hiring, just as more people touted the work from home in which we came back to work. I think that, especially on the tech side, we seem to be doing very well attracting top talent there as more and more companies have shed some of those jobs. From our own client base so, we're definitely focused on adding clients don't really have anything to call out on seeing any negative softening within our own client base. I've tried to do as much as I can to kind of look into the future with 5% of the TAM and several accelerators for ourselves. It's, I'm focusing on being a sales person, right now then an economist. But definitely, we're really not seeing much in our own numbers as we look into the future, but from hiring people, which I mean, I think is somewhat of a proxy to what happens as well, for our clients. We are definitely seeing it's a little bit easier to hire, especially on the technical talent side. Craig Boelte : Yes, Brad, and I would say on our client base, I mean, we have a very diversified client base. And that's both geographically and based on industry. So some of the things you're hearing out there that, we're not overly exposed to those. Brad Reback : That's great. Thanks very much. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Hey, good afternoon, Chad, Craig and James, and congratulations on the really strong results, and also the initiation of the dividend, which I think is a huge positive. With regards to what you ended up seeing during the selling season, and then extending into the first quarter. Could you give us a little bit of a sense for on the recurring revenue, if we strip out the float income, what you ended up seeing in terms of like, sales from new logos relative to upsells, relative to increases in employment within the existing base? And how you're thinking about the pipeline on a go forward basis? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, for us on that it's all really about new logo adds, I mean increases an employment from existing base or decreases, I can't say that that's had a meaningful impact on us, one way or the other, with the exception of the -- what I'm going to call maybe a six month to 12-month period in COVID, where it went down and then back up, you had some significant fluctuations then, but since stabilization, it's not going to be employee gains and/or at this time, we don't really have the employees leaving that would impact that. So for us it's new logos, we added over 3,000 clients to Beti in this first quarter. And that's been going really well. I don't know if Craig would have anything to add to them. Craig Boelte : No, I would agree with Chad. I mean, it's primarily new logo wins. And that's what's driving the recurring revenue. Mark Marcon : Great. And you just came out of club. What are you seeing this in terms of sales force productivity? And how much more were the people have to do in order to qualify for club? And what regions are you really starting to see some real pickups in terms of traction? Chad Richison : Yes, we had that President's Club in Hawaii, which was the very same place that we had it at our initial President's Club 15 years prior. So I was able to actually talk about the numbers from that first club, and now and we've continue to accelerate the amount that any one sales rep can sell, our top sales reps continue to sell more than they have in the past. This year again, I mean, we had a rookie sales rep that sold over $2 million. When we IPO that would have been great for a city. And now we have a rookie rep selling that. And so the numbers continue to go up, as we've had a -- we've continued to develop product, we put more into the product, so it produces more value. So of course, it costs a little more than what it used to. And then, we're getting better at marketing, and landing leads that we're also getting better at closing, because we have a very strong differentiator and we're back out in the field, I think that's it was a big part of it too, for us to get back out face to face, because these are big decisions for companies to make. And I think we present well in-person. I would expect another record to be broken next year, as we've already got some reps that are very close to what our top rep finished at last year. So that's in, which is always how we've achieved our numbers as sales performance continuing to get stronger. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Brian Schwartz : Yes, hi, thanks for taking my questions. This afternoon, I'll congratulate a real nice, fine start to the year for the business. Chad, I wanted to ask you, I saw that you announced a global HCM solution and capability this quarter. And just wanted to ask you on the strategy behind that is, is the strategy more to extend the reach and capabilities of your multi-national customers? Or is there an opportunity that you see in the future of targeting international markets? And then if I could ask one other question along this new solution? How should we think about the solution in terms of the impact to the margin, whether it can be accretive or diluted to the overall business? Chad Richison : I mean on the first question, I mean, I think people can talk about whether it's a single database or willingness to integrate with multiple systems and what have you. The fact is, is there's one type of employee, I mean, the employees are the same. And they like doing their own payroll. And so for us international and laying the groundwork with global HCM is the first step to going all the way up market. I mean, there's never really been an issue for us in scalability of the system, it's really been about the buying decisions that you'll oftentimes see way up market. Well, employees these days, they don't have a high tolerance for a system complexity in any stage of product that they use. And so I think we've got a very simplified product that does very complex things. And I would say there might have been one thing that we were missing, to be able to go work with the largest companies in the world. And I don't think we're going to be missing that one thing very much longer. That said, I mean, our system still does work well. We have a lot of clients that have, definitely we're having success up market, we have a lot of clients that are 10,000 employees and more. We have clients that even like our system so much they were willing to work around to use it for other countries. Now, they don't have to do that on the HCM side, and we would be planning to roll out Beti in other countries throughout this year. Brian Schwartz : Thank you. Craig Boelte : Yes, also on the margin front, I mean, we wouldn't call out that it would be accretive order, it should be a follow the same profile fairly similar to what our current clients are doing. I mean, obviously, we'll have some R&D costs as it relates to building some of this out, but in terms of just the overall margins, it should be very similar. Brian Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Joshua Reilly with Needham. Your line is now open. Joshua Reilly : Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. On the international product here, when you say you're building Beti on a global basis, does that mean that you plan to build native payroll solutions from international countries? Or is Beti going to sit on top of the existing payroll solutions used by customers with an international presence? Craig Boelte : We would be building Beti out in each country. Chad Richison : Okay, we are building Beti out would be the better way to say that. Joshua Reilly : Okay, so you are building a native payroll in some of these international countries? Chad Richison : Correct. Joshua Reilly : Got it. Okay. And then have you increased your advertising spend sequentially from Q4? And I think in the past, you've said that increasing that spend implies more confidence around demand. Is that accurate that you're seeing more demand in Q1 than Q4? Chad Richison : I mean we continue to see strong demand. We saw the strong demand in Q4 too. Oftentimes Q4, sometimes you can advertise a little bit stronger than others, depending on elections, depending on how many ads are running. Oftentimes, you can be competing against that and what the ad dollars cost. And so, sometimes the juice didn't work to the squeeze there you have some holidays, but we do monitor our advertising spend weekly. And we monitor the lead generation from it. And we're constantly making moves in method to how we generate more leads. Joshua Reilly : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Chad, in this macro environment, we keep hearing small businesses kind of under pressure right now, they're cautious in terms of commit to any kind of investment in this environment. So wondering, what are you hearing from your customer base? Any color would be helpful? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, we're not hearing a lot right now. I mean, now I would say a part of that is, we're very focused on growth and landing new logos. I wouldn't say that we're having, we're not seeing losses from clients going out of business, any different than what we had seen in the past, again, with the exception of the COVID time period. So I really can't call out much. And it might just be where we're focused, again, only about 5% of our revenues derived from companies that have less than 50 employees. 95% of its derived from companies have larger than that, obviously. And then we're continuing to grow at the top end of our range, it's probably our fastest growing segment. And so, I'm not saying things couldn't be happening, down market. It's just from the data that we have. It's not something that that we could call out on our end. Siti Panigrahi : That's super helpful, and follow-up for Craig. If I heard your client phone balance, I think 2.4 billion you said, that's almost kind of 9% on a year-over-year growth, compared to other years, which was pretty high. Is there anything that we should, anything that caused this slowdown. And also, any color in terms of interest income any float income contribution this quarter? Chad Richison : I can take the first question, I'll let Craig handle the interest income, but from a slope balance perspective, the larger the client, the less days you hold on to that money. So that money clears very quickly with large clients. So what, which if you're handling a small business, you might hold on to that for a month or a quarter. You're handling a large client, you're holding on to that for about 24 hours. So there's larger amounts, but it impacts your average daily balance a little bit, because you're -- it's clearing out of there so quickly with the larger clients. Then I'll let Craig handle the second part. Craig Boelte : Yes, I would say on the interest income on our client funds, we call out last quarter we're realizing around 80% of the Fed funds rate. And part of that's because it's layered in, we have some investments that are a little bit longer-term. And then I mean, the banks don't give you the full amount as the Fed raises those rates. So that's kind of what we've said last quarter, I really wouldn't update that any. Siti Panigrahi : Great. Thank you. Great quarter. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Jared Levine : It's actually Jared Levine on for Bryan tonight. In terms of a retention, how did 1Q revenue retention compared to 1Q '22. Were there any notable changes based on clients with under 50 employees, and then those clients with 50 plus employees? Chad Richison : Yes, so we provide retention at the end of each year fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, I kind of said on the last call, we have the have and have nots here at Paycom and that was related to BETI, our BETI retention rate last year was better than 99%, than anybody that had BETI. So I expect our retention to remain strong, and even as increase as a -- increase a larger percentage, as more clients use the product the right way to achieve the maximum ROI that's available to them. But yes for retention, I've also said in the past typically, regardless of that, I'm not comparing it from last first quarter to this first quarter. But typically, for especially for larger clients of any of our competitors, retentions oftentimes starts off lower the first of the year and continues to increase throughout the year, because less clients usually leave in the fourth quarter, if you will, but nothing to call out especially in the first quarter, I would just say we've been very stable. And the companies that use BETI do better. Jared Levine : Got it. And then there's my follow-up, what is your adjusted gross margin expectation for this fiscal year? And then we're specifically looking at 1Q, what weight on that adjusted gross margin within that operating expense line item? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean we didn't guide to the adjusted gross margin. I mean, it's been very stable over the last few years, and add 85% to 86%, I mean typically, if it gets too high, we may be a little bit behind on hiring. And so that's usually what would cause it to creep up some and it fluctuates based on how our hiring trends are, because those were the individuals that are bringing on handling the new business that we're bringing on, and we have to hire them ahead of the revenue growth. And that way they can be trained up and ready to capture those clients. Jared Levine : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Jason Celino : Hey, thanks guys for taking my questions. Chad, in the press release for Global HCM a few weeks ago, you mentioned that you've been working on the product for two years. Since it doesn't include BETI yet, why not just wait until you had developed it for some of those countries first, or maybe can you just talk about the timing on why move now? Chad Richison : Sure. Well, you're going to have to do first things first. We're going to have to have it but as I mentioned with Raimo's very first question, we have a demand for Global HCM right now is we have clients that are storing client or employees that they have in other countries in our system right now. And somewhat rig in the system. So we have demand right now for HCM. And you have to have first things first. I mean, with BETI, everything's connected, it's not like it's payroll only, you have to have time and attendance, you have to have expense management, you have to have paid time off. So you have to have these other products within the system to work, BETI, I wouldn't say that we're developing just payroll only, we're developing BETI, the BETI process internationally, we looked at kind of us to following what the competition does out there with international and I mean quite honestly, I think it was unimpressive for an ROI strategy that it produces for clients. And our clients now are used to using BETI and so I think they're going to expect that internationally and I think that's how we win. So I would say it's the beginning foundation for what we're doing but also we have demand for that product in of itself right now. Jason Celino : Okay, yes, that's fair. And you have mentioned some of your customers are kind of [indiscernible] onto your systems already, but how is there any way to know how many of your customers have international employees or offices? Chad Richison : It's our larger clients, it would be our larger clients in many of those cases. So not going to give out a specific number, but I mean the revenue opportunities there for them. And then of course, when you look at our just prospect base that's out there, over time, this will increase the size of companies that we prospect. Jason Celino : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Arvind Ramnani : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about some of the churn kind of benefit you see from legacy players. And are you seeing any kind of change and sort of the competitive dynamics or sort of the win rates that you have historically seen from some of the legacy players? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean I wouldn't call at anybody in particular, we're getting much stronger. When we released BETI in 2021, I think it was July of 2021, we very first even started selling it, we've gotten a lot better at our value proposition and how we actually go to market with it, I think it took some learning, it was somewhat hard to teach old dog new tricks, from our standpoint of our sales force. And when we started selling BETI, we were all virtual sales. And we've made a bunch of changes dramatically. And so I definitely think having a stronger value proposition as we've had with BETI as well as us being face to face is helping our close ratio out there. And I would say it would be competitor agnostic. When we have a strategic buyer that takes the time to really try to achieve the return on investment that implementing any one of these products would promise to produce, we do very well. Arvind Ramnani : Terrific, and certainly within the technology world, there's a lot of conversation with ChatGPT and AI. And just wanted to sort of get your perspective either sort of expected impact to Paycom specifically, but even to the HCM space. Do you think this is a space that's kind of susceptible to change or kind of some pressure from ChatGPT? Do you think it's not yet kind of relevant to your space or to your company? Chad Richison : No, I definitely think it'll be relevant. You can use AI for multiple things. There are areas that you can use it for that are better than others. There are front end things, you can use it for direct to the client, there are back end things that you can use it for, that a client may never see. And so, when you're talking about AI, it has many uses, some of which is front end and some back end. And I don't want to talk specific, what exactly, we're using it for already internally and what our opportunities would be into the future. But an answer to your question. Yes, I do think that over time, AI is going to be a thing in our industry. Arvind Ramnani : Terrific, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Jackson Ader with SVB. Your line is now open. Jackson Ader : Great. Thanks for taking our questions, guys. The first one is on Chad, you mentioned hiring and maybe being able to kind of hoover up some of the tech talent that have been coming from some of the larger maybe tech layoffs. But it sounded like that was more on the developer or the R&D side. I was curious whether you've also been able to maybe pick up additional sales people along the way as well. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, well I called out R&D, because that's a side that we oftentimes hire people that have experience with technology writing code and what have you, our salespeople, we've always -- we typically look for people with less than two years outside sales experience. We do take changing careers, what have you. We do have specific education requirements for that position. And so, I wouldn't necessarily say it was difficult for us to hire jobs. But what has changed on the sales side is you get a little bit more time to look there for a while. I mean, if you had a salesperson that you had, that you were interviewing yet a week or two to make a decision, because they were getting 12 offers, I would say today, that's slowed down quite a bit. So I would say you're able to take a little bit more time than what you were able to do when we were very compressed in time, during the interview process to hire salespeople. I'd say that's changed some on the sales side. But I just I called out technology, because we're just we're seeing it. We're seeing it. Jackson Ader : Right. Okay. All right. Cool. That's great. One quick follow-up, just like on the mechanics of the BETI payroll rollout. So you're in 180 countries with Global HCM? But like, do you roll out BETI one country at a time is, we're going to see like 180 press releases for all the different countries that a block here, a block there, just mechanically, how is that rollout going to work? Chad Richison : There's about 16 to 20 countries that represent about well over 80% of the opportunity. So, I would expect us to be rolling those out first as you look at it, but yes, I mean over time, we build things ourselves. And so I would expect us to continue to roll them out. But there is 16 to 20 countries that are going to be first. Jackson Ader : Yes, okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Most of my questions have been asked, but I guess maybe on the topic of just pipeline and sales expansion efficiency, I guess, how do you think about office openings, territory expansion, through the rest of the year, maybe sales hiring, moving into the back half of this year to get ready for next year? Just any kind of commentary around that, particularly as it would relate or compared to last year? And then just a quick follow-up? Chad Richison : Yes, so that opening up offices continues to be a big part of our strategy. We've continued to open up offices, I think a year-ago, was it last year, maybe about 15 months ago, let's call it 14 or so, we opened up five offices from December through February. And those offices are maturing very well, and continue to mature and we will continue to open up offices. For us our bottleneck on being able to open up offices is capacity of our management group being ready to do that. We have to both backfill for managers that may not be accomplishing their goals, as well as we have to expand and over the course of 25 years, I think we've done that pretty well. But it is an -- it's a part of our growth strategy. And we'll continue to open up offices when we're able. Alex Zukin : Perfect. And then I guess, maybe just a quick financial question. Free cash flow was feel free really strong here in Q1 and quite a bit stronger than we were modeling. What's the right way to think about that progression? As we head through the year. And in general, as you're seeing steady adoption, specifically, get better. I think, last quarter, what you mentioned almost 50% of penetration for Beti, where does -- what's the target for this year? And how much does that? How much more efficient is an incremental Beti sale than then traditional one? Chad Richison : Yes, I'll take the free cash flow question. I mean, first quarter was strong, as we look at through the rest of the year, we've called out kind of what our CapEx is going to be. We're wrapping up our building in Oklahoma City, a large building here. So CapEx will be a little bit more back end loaded in terms of how it throat flows throughout this year. So that will -- that's kind of the way I would look at the free cash flow for the year. And on the Beti penetration. Craig Boelte : Yes, I can take that. So I think the question was, how much more efficient is an incremental Beti sell me. Beti is a very nominal sell door current client. From that perspective, I mean, it's not an expensive item and drives a significant amount of ROI. What I would say on new clients, on new clients that come in with Beti, because they all have to, I would say the biggest margin impacts for them than us, I've always said, it costs you the same whether you use the system correctly or not charges the same. So you may as well, try to get the most value out of the system by using it the right way. So when someone uses Beti, it returns a significant, there's a significant return on investment to the client. For us, you might see some positive margin impact by those clients that use Beti have less paper cuts caused to themselves. And therefore on the margin, they require less service for us to be able to provide them and less services around what I would call more of our low margin activities, which is going to be amending -- amended returns and other issues that could come out by having payroll done wrong. Alex Zukin : Understood. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bhavin Shah : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just -- I come for Craig. Craig, if I just look at your 1Q sequential growth or 4Q our recurring revenue, it looks like a trend a little bit lower versus the prior 1Q's. I know the declining mix of tax wins revenue has an impact here, but any other commentary on the narrative go lives or even growth within the tax forms? And how that's trending? Craig Boelte : I would say, we call out the tax forms, I mean, obviously, they don't grow in quite the same rate as the rest of our revenue, but they become a smaller portion of our overall revenue. So I would say that that's kind of what we've seen on those tax forms filings. They don't have the same growth rate as the rest of our revenue. Chad Richison : Yes, set a little bit differently. Since 1998, when we started the company, we've only added one product to our year end services. And that was ACA, that's it in 25 years. Meanwhile, our monthly recurring revenue products, we've continued to add products that we charge on a monthly recurring basis for them. And so the monthly recurring, it's just growing at a rate much more so than our annual recurring. And over time, the annual recurring amount represents a smaller amount of a client's bill because of that. Bhavin Shah : Got it helpful. Just one follow-up on float revenue, and just your philosophy on reinvesting some of the upside here. Can you just remind us of your philosophy, and if anything has changed at all, given some of the announcements on kind of your global initiatives? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, we still investing in a pretty short-term investments very safe. We're looking at CDs, commercial paper, treasury notes, and then some overnight. So we're still very safe on our investments and fairly short-term. And then as we do global, we'll look at those opportunities as well. Bhavin Shah : Thanks again for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO Capital. Your line is now open. Daniel Jester : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon, everybody. Maybe you want to tackle global HCM in a different way. If I think about the some new products you've launched in the last couple of years, Beti, TDX. Like that goes into theoretically the entire customer base. And for Beti, I think we saw the impact on your business, like relatively quickly. I'm just trying to size up like on global HCM, it's not going to go into all of your customers. And so is it so -- is your large customer opportunity so big that it actually can move the needle this year? Or is global HCM something who's thinking about from like a multi-year perspective laying the groundwork? And it's not going to look like Beti affecting the numbers this year? It's a long question, but hopefully got through -- got to my point across? Thank you. Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, we just came out with global HCM. I do think it'll be somewhat accretive to our numbers this year, more so in subsequent years. And it's a significant system. I think it'll allow us to continue to go further up, even just the global HCM side, increases our TAM by about 50%. So, I mean, it's available there. And then, as we continue to add the payroll to it, I just think that puts us on a different playing field for us to continue to go up market as well as serve those clients of ours that currently have international presence and might not be using our system, the way they're going to be using it into the future. Daniel Jester : Okay, thanks. And then as a follow-up, maybe just on the dividend and the buybacks and capital allocation. You haven't really been utilizing that buyback authorization in the last few quarters. So I'm wondering, maybe just refresh us on your thinking about doing the dividend when you have been using other levers that you already have had in place? Thank you. Chad Richison : Well, I would, for one thing we did buy back over $100 million last year. So we've been, maybe not the last couple of quarters, but for sure last year, we continue to do buybacks and over $100 million over time, we've bought back $600 million and 4.7 million shares. So, I would expect that, it'll be a balance between buybacks and dividends as we kind of look to the future. Operator : Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you, and congrats on that terrific results. I think I know the answer. But the source of the upside, and then the race beat -- be it kind of the quarter as well, that was new logo, primarily just wanted to understand where that's at relative to expectations initially? Chad Richison : Yes, new logos drive our growth. And so I'm not going to say you see, when interest rates go up, we've talked about how we're achieving roughly 80% of that as it moves. So obviously, that impacts us positively as well. But for us, what's always driven our revenue has been new logo ads. Kevin McVeigh : And then if you think about kind of the move internationally in up market? Does that impact the implementation strategy at all? In terms of upfront, you try to be very opportunistic, RAM modules, things like that. Is that the same strategy as you kind of scale the client base? Chad Richison : Yes, I mean, it's stipple our implementation strategy as you continue to add other countries? Yes, I mean, it is going to change implementation to some extent. Now, that will, a lot of that will determine -- a lot of that will be determined by the origination of the client. Where's the client? Are they in Nebraska? Are they in Mexico? Are they in the U.K.? Where's the client? And you have different time zones and everything else where sometimes people are awake, sometimes they're not. So definitely, it changes your implementation strategy as you go global. Kevin McVeigh : It's great. Chad Richison : I don't know that many of our methods will change as much as it would be modifying them to meet the needs of the country that we are in. Operator : Thank you for your question. The last question comes from the line of Robert Simmons with DA Davidson. Your line is now open. Robert Simmons : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering, do you have customers who are now using global HCM? And if so what's been the early feedback? Chad Richison : We have some companies that are starting to pilot it, I think there's a couple. And a lot of global HCM is developed with current client feedback. From that perspective, just seeing what they're trying to accomplish, what they're using. And then just making a decision that we had just take our current systems and be able to put them to where they could be used in 180 countries and in 15 languages and so that we would expect more and more clients throughout this year to use the global HCM piece of Paycom. Robert Simmons : Got it. And then on the dividends, how do you think about it just seemed like going forward? Would it be as percent of GAAP EPS or free cash flow or some other metric? Chad Richison : Now, I mean, right now, it's -- we're looking at it as a fixed amount, the $50 over the next year, or $37.5 a quarter. I mean, right now, it's, that -- it's basically a 50% to about a 50% or 0.5% dividend yield based on our start current share price. So, but we would look at it as that $50 and then adjust that as we see fit in the future. Robert Simmons : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your question. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I'll pass the conference back the Chad Richison for closing remarks. Chad Richison : I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. Our employees efforts continue to put Paycom in a great position, and we're off to a great start in 2023. So thank you to the Paycom team. Over the next quarter, we'll be hosting meetings at five conferences beginning with the Needham Tech and Media Conference and the Moffett Nathanson Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, both of which will be held in New York. Following that we'll be attending the JPMorgan TMT conference in Boston, and the Jefferies Software Conference in Newport Beach. We'll also be presenting at the Baird Global Consumer Technology and Services Conference in New York in early June. We look forward to catching up with many of you soon. And operator you may disconnect. Thank you. Operator : That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Kate, and I will be the moderator for today's call. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, James Samford, Head of Investor Relations. You may go ahead. James Samford : Thank you, and welcome to Paycom's earnings conference call for the second quarter 2023. Certain statements made on this call that are not historical facts, including those related to our future plans, objectives and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Any forward-looking statement made speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Also during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and certain adjusted expenses. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today, and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We delivered very solid results in the second quarter, and we continue to expand our opportunity, both within and outside the U.S. I'll start with highlights from the second quarter and progress on our initiative. Following that, Craig will review our financials and guidance, and then we'll take questions. Second quarter 2023 revenue of approximately $401 million represented strong growth of 27% year-over-year. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $157 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of roughly 39%, up approximately 130 basis points year-over-year. We are delivering a solid combination of growth and high margins, while maintaining a disciplined investment strategy and product and international expansion. On the product front, the ROI that our clients are achieving from Beti is unquestionable. We recently commissioned a total economic impact study from Forrester Consulting that quantified the savings from using Paycom and Beti, including a 90% reduction in labor for payroll processing and saving HR and accounting teams more than 2600 hours per year. Companies that are not adopting Beti are missing out on a significant opportunity for savings from this structural change to how payroll should be done. With millions of employees already doing their own payroll and organizations seeing incredible ROI with Beti, there's no reason not to adopt it. The product is working as we anticipated, and our messaging is resonating. So we will remain discipline in promoting the power of Beti to new and existing clients. In April 2023, we launched access to our Global Human Capital Management Software in more than 180 countries and in 15 languages and dialects. Today, we announced that we have expanded our HCM solutions to include self-service payroll for organizations with Canadian employees. Now, more North American businesses will be able to improve their payroll processing by giving their employees a more transparent and user friendly experience in Canada with Beti. We are seeing continued success selling across our entire target market range, and our efforts up market continue to be strong. With our recent launch into Canada, we've opened up a new large cross-border opportunity. As we continue to expand our geographic reach, I expect our move-up market to continue to accelerate. As a result, we are redefining our target market range to include organizations with greater than 10,000 employees which represents an enterprise segment that our sales reps can now directly pursue. With our new expanded market opportunity, we now estimate our market share is well below 5%. This expansion gives me confidence that we can grow at an impressive pace for many years to come. In addition to launching our payroll services in Canada, our product development team also rolled out two significant tools in our software, Everyday and the Client Action Center. Everyday allows employees to get paid on a daily basis. Unlike other products on the market, with Everyday, employees access their earned pay early without being charged a fee, and employers are not exposed to potential losses from all factors that impact pay, including early departures, garnishments or benefit deductions to be collected. Everyday is a fully compliant payroll as opposed to a pay advance like many other daily pay services. The Client Action Center furthers our dedication to creating software that simplifies the lives of our clients by providing them with an intuitive dashboard within the Paycom mobile app. This new tool makes it even easier for our clients to take action and get updates on service related items. We've received great feedback from clients on this streamlined approach, since we rolled it out in June. Finally, Paycom was recently recognized as one of America's Greatest Workplaces in 2023 by Newsweek. The award highlights companies dedicated to providing employees with an enjoyable work environment that also fosters growth and development opportunities. In addition, for the second year in a row, Comparably named Paycom, one of the best career growth opportunities among all companies. In summary, our highly differentiated product and realized client ROI continue to drive our strong results. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to excellence, as we continue to change the way payroll is done. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig, for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig E. Boelte: Before I review our second quarter results for 2023 and our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2023, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We delivered solid results this quarter with revenue of $401.1 million, up 26.6% compared to the prior year period. Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $64.5 million or $1.11 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares. Adjusted EBITDA was $156.6 million in the second quarter of 2023, or 39% of total revenues compared to $119.6 million in the second quarter of 2022 or 37.7% of total revenues or up 130 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2023 was $94.3 million or $1.62 per diluted share up 29.1% from the prior year period. Second quarter GAAP tax rate came in higher than expected at 30.5%. For the full year 2023, we now anticipate our effective income tax rate to come in slightly higher at approximately 29.5% on a GAAP basis, and approximately 27% on a non-GAAP basis. Demand trends remained strong, particularly upmarket. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $394.5 million for the second quarter of 2023, representing 98.4% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 26.6% from the comparable prior year period. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2023 was $100.4 million or 25% of revenues. We continue to aggressively spend on marketing and sales ahead of future growth. Adjusted R&D expense was $42.5 million in the second quarter of 2023 or 10.6% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $61.2 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $48.1 million in the prior year period. We continue to invest in new products and expanded geographic offerings. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet including cash and cash equivalents of $537 million and total debt of $29 million. Additionally, we announced today that we have expanded our revolver from $650 million to $1 billion. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.2 billion in the second quarter of 2023, up approximately 13% year-over-year. Now, let me turn to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we are raising our outlook and now expect revenue in the range of $1.715 billion to $1.717 billion or approximately 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $722 million to $724 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 42% at the midpoint of the range. With these strong results and outlook, we are well-positioned to reach the Rule of 67. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect total revenues in the range of $410 million to $412 million representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 23% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $156 million to $158 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 38% at the midpoint of the range. We paid our first quarterly dividend of $37.5 per share in June, and the Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $37.5 per share payable in mid-September. Paycom is in a strong financial position and executing well against a very large market opportunity. Our focus on delivering strong revenue growth and attractive adjusted EBITDA margins remains top priorities, and I am pleased with the consistency of our execution and the resiliency of our business model. We look forward to delivering continued strong results as many of our initiatives gain traction in 2023 and 2024. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will be from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. I had two quick questions. First, Chad, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there in terms of end demand, etcetera. Because, and the reason why I'm asking is, like, if I look at, this quarter you beat by $3 million, the full year was only raised by $2 million. So, do we need to read into that, that there is, that you're kind of slightly concerned about the second half of the year, like -- maybe you kind of frame it for us in terms of how we should think about that. And then the second question was on Everyday. Like, how should we think about that in terms of, like applicability in terms of is this for all the clients? Is it for a select group, that have more contingency workers, whether it's interesting, how think you broadly you can roll this up? Thank you. Chad Richison : Sure. So, I mean, I'll take your last question first and circle back. But, in regards to Everyday, we put it out there because there are industries and certain companies that have moved toward a more pay as you want type program, typically for lower wage earners. Our product that we put out there allows early wage access or everyday access to wages. And the employer is not on the hook. It's not a loan, so the employee is not charged. And oftentimes, these amounts are guesstimated. And then if the employee leaves early, or if they didn't collect all of the deductions for the employee, the employer is on the hook. And so, all I would say is it, it\u2019s meeting a need that's already out there. I do not suggest that business has changed to a daily pay environment, but some of them are already out there. And so, it gives us an opportunity and it's linked to our bulk card. In regards to your first question about demand, demand for us is still very strong, especially with outside sales and new bookings. We're booking larger deals. We're booking $2 million deals, $3 million deals. We hadn't booked those before. So, outside sales is strong and up year-over-year. Inside sales, which sells small business or smaller emerging business below 50 employees is also up year-over-year. We do have a metric within our business model that sells that's down year-over-year and that's our CRR sales. The CRR group upsells current clients and this group\u2019s been down year-over-year and honestly, that's because, we've remained very disciplined in converting our client base to Beti, you had that first group that came on and then we've been out selling the others. It's a lot of work for our CRR with very little revenue opportunity for them. So, we've actually given compensation accelerators to incentivize the group to sell it, but it's still a smaller revenue product or billing item for us. So, while self-inflicted, I mean, we are having CRR's focus on Beti. And that's cost us $15 million to $20 million in bookings this year. But, again we\u2019re doing the accelerator commission for the CRRs to make-up for the lower revenue. We've been changing out the jet engines on our plane in mid-flight here. I mean, Beti, dramatically changes the way our clients do their payroll, produces a dramatic ROI. So, we have to remain disciplined. We're not going to make a client go on it. We have to sell them on it and, it takes a while. Once you sell a deal, it takes a while. CRRs have to be out there to convert them. So, I think we're doing something like triple. We're tripling their commissions, for what they're going to be missing out. But for us, it's significant, because employees are going to be doing their own payroll. Millions already are with Paycom. Employees who do their own payroll don't want to go back to the guessing game. So, while Beti is a small revenue amount for Paycom, it produces strong employee and employer advocates, which produce more leads for our outside sales group. And, with less than 5% of the market, we'll recapture the delayed opportunities in due time. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Samad Samana : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask one follow-up to Raimo\u2019s question on the guidance. If I think about recurring revenue, and I take out, but the impact of higher rates and the and the average flow balance, it kind of suggests maybe, like, a 20% to 22% or let's call it low-20s like, software revenue growth rate going forward. Is that the right way to think about maybe the durable, subscription revenue growth rate or just maybe help us understand, is that just for the back half or if we think about the durable number? How should we think about that? Chad Richison : Samad, I'll let Craig kind of comment a little bit on that. From my perspective, I mean, there's really only one metric that's given away for us and that's the fact that we're having CRR spend three days converting a very small revenue item for a client that produces strong ROI. I think it's a season that we're in. As far as the percentage growth, I mean, you guys have the numbers, we've talked about what we earn on interest as they've increased. We've also talked about how that's layering in. So, I know there's different models out there and they all seem fairly consistent with one another. I don't plan on giving any of the back, but if you want to take it out, I think that's a fair thing. Craig E. Boelte: Yes, I mean, we delivered a strong, a very solid quarter, Samad, and as we looked at guidance, we're still guiding to 25% for the full year and 42% adjusted EBITDA. We haven't given any long-term guidance in terms of revenue, but we have a large opportunity in front of us. We had several announcements on this call. And so, the opportunity is definitely there. It's just up to us to go out and achieve that. Samad Samana : Great. And just a quick follow-up on the product side. On the new product rolled into Canada, have you already had -- do you already have beta customers, is that hiring a different type of rep? Have you opened sales offices there? Maybe just help us think about both the -- who's trying the product already, and if you've already built out the go-to-market infrastructure for that? Chad Richison : Yes. So, we rolled out Canada and that included all territories and provenance in Canada. We rolled out full service payroll where we're doing direct deposit taxes, everything. We've already got clients that are signed up in the pilot have been for a while. We really focused on those countries that our U.S. based clients already have as an opportunity. We could see that because we rolled out our Global HCM product. And, we rolled out our Global HCM product based on people rig in our system for these other countries. So, we're continuing to roll out countries. We'll be rolling out more countries this year. We're not picking the easiest countries. We're picking the countries that have the greatest amount of U.S. based company employees. And so, that's where we're focused first, I don't see us rolling out a sales office in Canada, right now, just because we have so much opportunity as we continue to go upmarket. As I've been mentioning, we're getting a larger and larger at-bats for our business, which, Beti drives a strong result in ROI for them as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is now open. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Chad, on the CRR headwinds, you talked about $15 million to $20 million of bookings. Should we assume that's the revenue sort of headwind here in \u201823 as well? Chad Richison : Bookings kind of flow in. They don't come in right away. So I mean, there would be, some amount of that, you wouldn't get all of that this year, but I mean, we look at how much we were up last year and how much were not this year the big, the dramatic change there, but really it just comes down to we've still got about 40% of our client base, not on Beti, and that ROI is available, if not, we're servicing two different products sets here. So, the Forrester study was put out, talked about how it's 90% of the savings. I mean, and it's significant there. Employees and employers are having success with it. And so, we didn't just start doing this. We really started doing this end of last year, but we've been seeing the impact just because it takes a while. And the CRR is really the only group we can send out to a client, to help with that change management and be there for the first payroll on Beti and walk them through the data sets. And so that's the group that we're using to do it. And so, but in answer to your question, not 100% of $20 million would have what we have realized in revenue this year. I will say though with CRRs, it comes in pretty quick. I'd say they sell it one month and most of its up within four to six weeks with that group. Brad Reback : Got it. And then just lastly on the CRR point, was it below your expectations for the quarter, or they pretty much hit your plan, for the quarter? Chad Richison : I would say that it's been a harder slog to move Beti than, in this last group. But, I mean, it's impacting us, but we have to stay disciplined in it. It's -- once we get these clients moved over to Beti, it's a very little revenue piece for them, but it's a significant amount of ROI. It also makes servicing clients easier for us, just because you don't have the paper cuts that come with an HR and payroll department trying to do it for the employee. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Mark Marcon - Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Hi. Good afternoon. Couple of questions. So one, between Everyday and Canada, can you talk a little bit about, like the types of clients that you would be targeting to a greater extent. It sounds like you're forecasting that we're going to see some decent expansion in the 10,000 plus employee range type clients. And to what extent was not having Everyday holding you back before. Chad Richison : Yeah. I wouldn't say Everyday was holding us back at all, because people had options for that, as you know, there's daily pay options out there. And so an answer to your question and what we would go after in Everyday, that would be someone that's using some other product where employees are having to pay. And in some states, the client may not be compliant, because taxes are due. We'll often also see Everyday used in more of a quick service type environment or in an area where you might have more transient workers that typically work shorter periods of time for any one business, the normal groups you'd expect there. That would be different than what we'd expect with Canada. I mean Canada is going to be any client that has employees in Canada, and it's also the first time that we've been in business now 25 years. It's the first time that we've developed another country, and it's not like a country. It's multiple provinces, territories. And as we look at the next countries we're developing, it's the same type of thing. These countries are large entries. But we're well on our way. And like I said before on the last call, there was really only one thing holding us back from going up market. And that's the fact that we didn't have international capabilities. And with our global HCM product and now with our first expansion into Canada, we're well on our way with that. Mark Marcon : Great. And then in terms of the CRR and moving, Beti, to the remaining clients, what is your -- what's your forecast, Chad, just in terms of how long it will take to get that 40%? And to what extent could some of the Forrester data that you've put together, helped to speed that up? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, the Forrester data is -- it's helpful. I mean, especially if you played it correctly to any client. It's hard for me to, I mean, I said I thought we would have all converted within 18 months and we're going to be past, we may be past that point, but we're coming up on being past that point, if not. And so I guess, there's an incredible amount of value that automatically associated with clients rushing to capture that value. There's also some change management on the client side. I've also talked about I'm not going to force a client to go on it. So, we do have to sell it. And then because it\u2019s a smaller revenue item, we've got to incentivize our sales reps another way to sell it to be able to keep them whole on commissions and what have you so that we get what we want. So, it's hard to answer that question. But we're focused on it. I will say this, we've got some groups of CRRs and sales managers that are closer to having their clients converted than others. And so, you have that and we continue to bring out new products. So, I mean, I think that, for all of them, they're going to be in this just for a little bit to get the rest of them going. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Joshua Reilly with Needham. Your line is now open. Joshua Reilly : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe starting off, if you look at the revenue beat in the quarter, it was a little less than 1% versus the midpoint of guidance. Historically, these have been cultured to 1.5% to 2% on revenue How should we think about the way you're positioning guidance going forward? Has there been any change there? Is there a little bit less conservatism built into assumptions? Any color there would be helpful. Craig E. Boelte: No, I mean, we guide to what we can see and obviously when a deal starts in a quarter can impact the guidance for that quarter. So, there are certain things within a quarter that can make the beat larger or smaller. And so, we typically guide to what we can see and really no change to our, a stance on guidance. But as Chad mentioned, we saw the CRR impact start to come through. And that's what we've seen over the last quarter. Chad Richison : And quarter four really has much more variability. We have probably 20% of our clients that are brand new to us. So when you think of that, we don't necessarily know how they're going to pay bonuses and if they're going to pay bonuses. So, a little more, uncertainty in that Q4 as we move throughout the year. Joshua Reilly : Got it. And then sales and marketing was up about 2 million quarter-over-quarter this year in Q2. While last year it was up about 10 million, sequentially. Should we read into anything around the pace of investments in sales and marketing slowing a bit while you increase more in investments in product and R&D continues to increase. Do you need to get some of these new products out? And then you're going to reaccelerate investments in sales and marketing after that point in time? Thank you. Chad Richison : No, I would say, we saw some efficiencies in sales and marketing. And as we've mentioned on previous calls, at some point, you get to hit the point of diminishing returns. So, I think you saw big increase last Q2. This second quarter wasn't quite as large and some of those are also timing quarter-to-quarter. But I don't think we've necessarily pulled back on sales and marketing. We didn't pull back on sales and marketing to invest in R&D. It's just where can we get the best returns? Operator : The next question will be from the line of Steve Enders with Citi. Your line is now open. Steve Enders : Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question here. I guess maybe to start, now that you're opening up into the 10,000 fee customer range, does there need to be any change in the go to market to go capture some of those more enterprise focused accounts and any areas that may needed to be built out to be able to get into those customers? Chad Richison : No. I mean, our marketing efforts are a little bit different. And answer to the question on the sales motion. No. I mean, back in the day, I mean, every client's different, but today, employees are the same. I mean, it\u2019s just what we're dealing with. There's no such thing as a large market employee versus a small market employee. They've got all have perfect payrolls and what have you. And so our approach to selling because we're selling one system is very similar. The prospecting methods, meaning the methods through which you go to get appointments are they're a little bit different in how we're doing that, but not unlike how we've been doing it with companies that have 10,000 employees already. So, I wouldn't say it's much different than what we were doing there, but and it's a little bit different if you're trying to get into a company that has 250 and employees, how you're getting in there to be able to make an impact. I mean, there's a lot of companies that will listen to you, but we're looking to meet with the decision makers and buyers. And again, employee advocates are helping us. Three or four years ago, we had zero employee advocates. Today, we continue to cultivate advocates of our client employees who use our system and then go to other companies and bring us in. And so we're still having a lot of success with them. Steve Enders : Okay. Gotcha. That's helpful there. and then on the international expansion, good to see the entry into Canada and officially announced. How should we be thinking about the pace of further country openings and I guess any initial learning\u2019s from entering Canada and have the platform performed there that could be applied to some of the other countries that you're targeting here? Chad Richison : I mean, it gets easier as you do more countries because you run into crazy things in each country. I mean, every country operates a little bit different. There's countries that their year runs April 6th through April 5th. You know? there's countries that you don't reconcile attacks at the end. You got to have a stamp in the beginning. So, we're running into that with all countries. We do continue to spec them out and we'll have about couple more significant countries this year. I've mentioned on the call not long ago that we believe that about 20 countries will represent most all the opportunity that we'll need for the US based clients. Not all, but most all. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up, Chad. When you are now going to Canada or even other countries, are you targeting customer in those countries, or are you focusing on US customer who has employed there. The reason I'm asking, are you trying to build now sales team in Canada and other countries or it's still focused here in the U.S? Chad Richison : I mean, the answer is yes. We will eventually have sales teams in other areas that we're expanding to, but it's first things first and that we're not focused on opening up sales team in Canada right now. We do have a service centre there now with people available to service. They've been trained and have been using our product themselves. But really it's an opportunity for us to continue to go further up market. We get a lot of call ins and interest in regards and leads in regards to a large businesses. And we sometimes fall by the wayside in regards to how they manage their global group. Our global HCM product helped a lot with that, because so much of the global payroll is already disparate and siloed all over the place. And so the global HCM helps some of that. But now as we're building out Beti in each country, it just wouldn't make sense for a company not to use us for all of that. And so originally, our focus is US based companies. There's plenty of them as we go up market, but eventually, absolutely, we'll have sales, we'll have sales teams other countries. That's not something more eyeballing right now, though. Siti Panigrahi : Okay. Thanks for that color. And one more follow-up on the, Beti, when you say the 40% of customer yet to move, I understand they're all your prior customer, not the new customer, they by default get Beti. So, definitely, there's a clear value proposition of Beti and it been there two years. So, what's the pushback you're hearing from those customer? What's stopping them moving to Beti? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, I think the biggest pushback is the fact that it is -- it can be a significant reduction in force as well. I think that there's change management on the client side, some changes they have to make on their side of how they feed the data. So that's primarily it. I mean, I can tell you a lot of what we get, it's not broke. you know, we're already using Paycom. Our payroll's not wrong. you know, we've got a 100% DDS. Why do we have to go through? We're working on other things. I just don't know that it becomes the priority. And so the Forrester study will help and as we continue to go out there and show the value that it can create with appropriate usage. And then also we kind of got a little bit of the tail wag and the dog strategy with the employee base, especially hourly employees that's inherent, they'll do their own. So that's helping us out a little bit in there. But at the end of the day, it's a sales call that we have to provide value for we're not going to force a client, we're going to influence them in making a decision that can drive significant ROI in regards to payroll and HCM Software. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Bryan Bergin : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you. Wanted to ask a margin question first here. So can you talk about investments being made in in cost to revenues just considering the higher float revenue tailwinds has been a bit lighter than we've expected. Are there catch up investments being made here? Are you broadening out the international operation? Just give us a sense on what's kind of weighed year-on-year and where you're expecting adjusted gross margin to land this year. Craig E. Boelte: Yeah. I mean, this quarter was down slightly. It's typically going to be headcount. We hire ahead of the growth it's going to be a higher headcount in the service group. We're starting to see a few costs as it relates to international, but it's not really moving the needle at this point. So, we haven't guided to gross margins. We've always been in that 84%, 85%, 86% range. And we would expect that to be what it was similar moving forward. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then on the updated revenue guide for the year, did you add any incremental revenues assumptions related to the Canada entry or for Everyday? Chad Richison : I mean, it\u2019s going to be a small impacts this year, just because you have bookings then conversions. I mean, Everyday could add a little bit, but not going to move the number. Craig E. Boelte: Yes, that\u2019s not going to move the number. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Great. thanks. This is actually Devin on for Jason today. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to get an update on your sales capacity, do you feel pretty good about capacity for the remainder of the year and for next year, particularly as you continue to move up market and expanding to Canada and maybe other regions down the line? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, well, outside sales is rolling. I mean, we've got people that are selling numbers that, I mean, even one deal's bigger than was some unsold before at Paycom. So I mean, sales just continuing to do well that our capacity is continuing to increase, continue to get stronger at staffing. And again, I'm talking about from our outside sales perspective, which sells 95% of our new business, that we bring on, a new clients that we bring on. So, we're doing well there and, I would expect us to continue to do so. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. No. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. Any additional details on how would you think about what you're getting on your effective yield for [cash health] (ph) clients just given another interest rate hike, in the past month Thank you. Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean what we've said in the past and really don't have an update on that, we typically get about $5 million annually on 0.5 basis point increase. We had $2.2 billion average daily funds held this quarter. I mean, we're typically trying to get somewhere between 80% and 90% of the Fed funds rate. It layers in over time. It doesn't -- it's not an immediate impact to us. We have a certain funds that are layered out longer. So that's the impact that [rate hike] (ph) has on us. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Ryan on for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. So, two quick ones Historically, free cash flow margin and cash conversion had been lowest in 2Q, but it came in relatively strong this quarter. So just wondering if you can unpack that strength. And then on retention, you reported 93% at the end of last year, but given the macro, any swings in that number that we should be aware of just through this first half. Thanks. Chad Richison : I'll take the last one first and I'll let you handle the free cash flow margin. We report retention once a year does fluctuate throughout the year. And then we report once a year, I believe, in February, every year for the prior year. And so we don't have any updates on the retention number right now, but we will, at the end of the year. Craig E. Boelte: Yeah. I mean, on free cash flow came in very strong for Q2. Some of that can be timing, overall, it's the main things that impact free cash flow are going to be CapEx and some of your tax rates on that. But yeah, we're very happy with the way it came in at Q2, much better than last year's Q2. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bhavin Shah : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Chad there's always a lot of noise as to where we are in the macro cycle. Can you just help us understand what you're seeing with your customers in terms of [indiscernible] how that might have turned it throughout the quarter and if you see any differences across the various customer sizes that you serve? Chad Richison : Stable. We've seen stability. I mean, I can't point to macro issues. Bhavin Shah : Got it. And then earlier in your prepared remarks, you mentioned kind of year-over-year growth in both outside and inside sales. But can you double click on this? Like, how is growth trended in terms of both those areas versus prior quarters, are you seeing accelerating growth, similar growth, deceleration, just any way to kind of think about the magnitude of what you're seeing with both inside and outside sales? Chad Richison : I mean, very strong. I mean, outside sales is probably the strongest growth we've had in three years from a percentage basis. I mean, inside sales strong, but again like I said, it represents 5% of our revenue. So, it's important, but yeah, I mean, I would say, from a sales perspective, we're getting stronger and stronger. I mean, again, we're selling $2 million and $3 million deals. I mean, that's when we IPO, that's what a city would sell and last couple of years that's what a sales rep of the year would sell and now we've got deals of that size. So as our products gotten stronger, and again, the value's gone all the way out to the employee, and the employee user has become more technological in what they expect for usage. We're kind of really able to help everything out. The employee as well as the employer to drive this and capture this ROI available. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO. Your line is now open. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, first, I want to ask about sort of the back to the base motion. You know, you made a comment that the Beti transition is, kind of impacting the velocity of that group. As you think about Global HCM it also sounds like that's going to be a back to the base motion with customers that are already have, international employees. So, it's going to be the same team selling that and how do you deal with the bandwidth, as you ramp that global product? And then secondly, can you just clarify is Everyday and Client Action Center, are those green modules that you charge for? Thank you. Chad Richison : Okay. Everyday, yes. Client Action Center, no. Every client has it, the ability to enable it right now. As far as, yes, it is the exact same team that sells the Global HCM product as what sells Beti. It's also that same team will sell Everyday as what sells Beti. And so they still have the ability to sell it. They still have the ability to go out. Nothing's precluding someone from going out and making a sale. The issue becomes, it's not an issue. Again, it's something that we have to do is regardless of what you choose to go sell on your own, you've got these clients that don't have Beti that some of them you already have sold Beti to and you're going to have to go out there and spend the time to get them converted. And it's our CRRs that to those conversions. And so the difference can be instead of having a 1.5 hours or 2 hour sales call to sell a product, you're out there for 3, 3.5 days. Again, not all in the same week. It might be 3.5 days over a 4 week period of time, getting the company, converted over to Beti, and then you're out there when they're doing their first payroll and making sure that the ROI is being realized. And once someone's made that conversion, I believe we earn the right to even help them, achieve greater return on investment by with these other products. And so I'm not saying I've told any CRRs, hey, don't go out and sell a product. What I've said is, this is your priority. Any clients that aren't currently on it achieving the value. I know it's a smaller revenue amount. So, I'm going to pay you triple because I know it's a small revenue amount. So anytime you sell one, this will be your commission and we have to do that so that we can move everybody into the right value because it is the correct way to do it. It's the correct way for employees to do it themselves. And so that's what we're focused on. We're not retreating from that. And I also believe that we do have -- we have some good things coming out here with product. We've announced some of it. We've got more coming out throughout the year. So, but it is the first things first. I'm not throwing my hands up on what the CRRs can do. I'm just explaining where they're at as of today. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Robert Simmons with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Robert Simmons : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. So, I was wondering, how does, Everyday work in terms of monetization? Will you do it the same way you do other modules works per employee per pay cycle or would it be a different model? Chad Richison : Yeah. The best way to think of Everyday, it's still per employee per pay cycle, but now you have more pay cycles. Robert Simmons : Got it. And then, on Beti, are you still seeing 99% annual retention for clients who are using it? Chad Richison : We haven't updated any retention number since we last did our retention, but it's -- I don't see people leaving that have Beti. It's very -- let's not say you can have some [bots sold] (ph) merged. I mean, we've been the benefactor of where a large company's buying a smaller company. The smaller company uses us, Beti, and then we get a $1.4 million deal because the small company doesn't want to convert off Beti, and the large company ends up converting to us for it. So, I even see us being more the benefactor of mergers as we move into the future, which oftentimes it was a wash or the larger company buys the smaller company. Robert Simmons : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will be from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Arvind Ramnani : Hey, thanks for taking my question. So I just going have -- first thing is like, can you talk a bit about the competitive environment, particularly from some of the legacy players, AC, and Paychex has that changed, has put any kind of pressure on your sales cycles or kind of conversions? Chad Richison : No. I'd say the competitive environment's been very similar as it has, which, as I've always said, has been competitive. And it's always been a dog fight. I've said that multiple times. You've always had competitors that'll go out there and say, hey, I'll give you a year for free. I've always told prospects. I mean, if you want the lowest price, call your current vendor, threaten to leave them. That's how you get your lowest price. But now if you want value and a return on your investment and you want to turn those fees into actual value that you can achieve. One way to do that is to go with us. So you were always going to have that. You're always having to have competitive -- competitors out there, and it's no different than it has been. Arvind Ramnani : Terrific. And then just a really quick one, can you tell us interest income contribution for the quarter? Chad Richison : No. As we've mentioned in the past, Arvind, we received, our goal is somewhere between 80% and 90% of the fed funds rate. As they have increases in the fed funds rate, and it takes a couple of quarters for that to layer in. And so that's what we've said in the past. Operator : Thank you. And the last question comes from the line of Jackson Ader with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Jackson Ader : Thanks for taking my questions, guys. The first one is maybe on the talent acquisition or the recruiting modules. We're starting to see maybe a loosening in the labor markets. And I'm curious whether you're seeing usage for your recruiting or talent products either start to slow or maybe actually pick up, like if there is some sort of counterintuitive demand for those products as the labor market begins to loosen. Craig E. Boelte: Yeah. It's stable. I would say where we see it, it is a talent acquisition product, but I would see where you start seeing that's background checks. Pre-employment, background checks and how those are going. I would say it's stable, as of right now. Jackson Ader : Okay. Alright. That's fair. And then the follow-up is for \u2013 so on the sales side, when you're increasing the target market up to 10,000 employees. So how do you make sure that your outside salespeople don't just go out there and start hunting the gigantic deals and make sure that -- they don't take their eye off the ball in terms of the bread and butter deal. Thanks. Chad Richison : Yeah. Well a weekly quote is, make sure that, But, ultimately, they will go after larger deals. They don't have that many of them for any one territory. It's not going to increase it so much. that that's all you're doing. And I mean, our salespeople, probably 75% to 80% of what they make is commission based and that\u2019s based off revenue being achieved. You can still achieve a lot of revenue off of the sweet spot of our market that we've been focused on. We continue to be pulled up market. I've been mentioning that, and there's no reason not to go after that market as well. I mean, eventually, we're going to land one of these largest companies in the world kind of deal. I mean, eventually that's going to happen because it's just right. So, we've got to take our at-bats in our swings with them. Operator : That concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to pass the call back over to Chad Richison for closing remarks. Chad Richison : I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. Over the next quarter, we'll be hosting meetings at five conferences. Beginning next week, we'll be at the KeyBanc Tech Leadership Forum. At the end of August, we'll be hosting meetings at the Stifel Tech Exec Summit and the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference. In September, we'll be presenting at the Citi Global Tech Conference in New York and hosting meetings at the Wolf TMT Conference in San Francisco. We look forward to catching up with many of you soon. Operator, you may disconnect. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Chasson, and I'll be the moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, James Samford, Head of Investor Relations. James Samford : Thank you, and welcome to Paycom's earnings conference call for the third quarter 2023.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We delivered solid results in the third quarter with very strong profitability. All focus on Paycom innovations that are transforming our industry and strengthening our competitive position. Following that, Craig will review our financials and our guidance, and then we will take questions. Throughout our 25-year history, Paycom innovations have been transforming the payroll and HCM industry. And now we have fundamentally shifted how businesses use core HR and payroll products. We started transforming the industry in 1998 by moving payroll to the web. We have made many innovations in those 25 years, but none more important than do-it-yourself payroll for employees with Beti. This is a paradigm shift for our industry and delivers tremendous value to our clients when employees do their own payroll. Along with our focus on automating and innovating all of our current products, we're continuing to enhance our global HCM and payroll product for international enterprises. Today, we announced that we are expanding our global payroll product to include Mexico. During the third quarter, employees in Canada started doing their own payroll with Beti and now employees in Mexico can, too. We are continuing to help clients navigate to the new way of doing things. And as a result, nearly two-thirds of our clients have made the shift to Beti. For most employees, the value of the perfect payroll is oftentimes immeasurable. If their check is perfect, they don't need to borrow money from a friend or family member to get through the weekend or make a bill payment. How do you measure the value of that? We're getting better and better at helping employers measure the full value available to them when payrolls are perfect. A portion of that value is easy to calculate because it's the value they receive by the elimination of after-the-fact payroll errors that require correction payroll runs, manual checks, voided checks, direct deposit reversals, additional wires, tax adjustments, W2Cs, et cetera, et cetera. Perfect payrolls eliminate these common after-the-fact payroll corrections that would otherwise be billable. So the more employees do their own payroll, the greater the savings delivered to the client from Paycom future billings, which results in lower related revenue recognized by Paycom. I'd like to thank our employees for their consistent execution and their commitment to our long-term strategy. I also want to wish Paycom a very happy 25th birthday. I look forward to many more. And as many of you know, we're just getting started. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our third quarter results for 2023 and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We delivered fundamentally strong results this quarter with solid revenue and earnings growth. Revenue of $406.3 million was up approximately 22% compared to the prior year period that came in below our guidance range as a result of lower-than-expected service revenues and unscheduled payroll runs. As Chad mentioned, Beti adoption and usage creates tremendous value to clients as they experience perfect payrolls and eliminate errors, corrections and unscheduled payrolls, which would otherwise be billable items. In addition, our CRR teams continue to focus on Beti adoption and overall system usage, which resulted in lower cross-selling revenues. We delivered very strong GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. Net income was $75.2 million or $1.30 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares and adjusted EBITDA was $165.6 million, representing third quarter margin of nearly 41%, up over 300 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2023 was $102.4 million or $1.77 per diluted share, up 39% from the prior year period. During the quarter, we repurchased over $76 million worth of stock and paid nearly $22 million in cash dividends. As of September 30, 2023, we have retired nearly 5 million shares and when combined with dividends, we have returned over $700 million to stockholders. We still have $1 billion remaining under our buyback authorization and the Board has approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-December. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2023 was $94.3 million, representing 23.2% of revenues. We continue to hire top talent to expand our sales footprint and invest in marketing to drive lead volume. Adjusted R&D expense was $46.2 million in the third quarter of 2023 or 11.4% of total revenues, up 20 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $69 million in the third quarter of 2023. The capitalization rate increased approximately 33% in the quarter as we continue to invest in new products and support our international expansion efforts. Third quarter GAAP tax rate came in at 26.3%. For the full year of 2023, we expect our effective income tax rate to come in at approximately 29% on a GAAP basis and approximately 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $484 million and total debt of $29 million. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Now let me turn to guidance. Throughout 2023, we have been seeing moderating upside to our guidance model, which corresponded with increases embedded usage and macro headwinds from inflation that may impact each client differently. Now that more clients are achieving the ROI that Beti has to offer, it has eliminated certain billable items, which is cannibalizing a portion of our services and unscheduled revenues. With 10 months of data from increased Beti usage, we are incorporating the impact that our clients' ROI achievement has on our model. Based on these factors, we expect fourth quarter 2023 total revenues to be in the range of $420 million to $425 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 14% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $169 million to $174 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41% at the midpoint of the range. With our Q3 results and our Q4 guidance, we now expect fiscal 2023 revenues to be in the range of $1.679 billion to $1.684 billion or approximately 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $712 million to $717 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 43% at the midpoint of the range. Combining our expected revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin, we are still on track to reach the Rule of 65 in 2023. As we look out to 2024, we have a number of strategic initiatives that we believe will further strengthen the value clients receive from our offering. We are making strategic performance and client value decisions that, we feel are best for our long-term relationship with our clients. Our mission is, to ensure and achieve client value and that is our focus. Our guidance for the next 15 months assumes, the impact from the strategic revenue decisions, we are and will be making. As a result, we believe it is prudent, for us to set expectations, for 2024 year-over-year revenue growth, of between 10% and 12%. We'll have more visibility when we provide formal guidance in early February. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow : Hi. Thank you. I'm trying - to get a little bit more clarity on the Beti impact. So if I'm listening to you, it sounds like Beti is the main problem here or the main issue for what's going on. But it's kind of - but it has been launched for a while. So, why do we see the impact like so dramatically now? And maybe you can link it in with the strategic revenue decisions for next year. Is that kind of Beti or do we need to think broader here? Thank you. Chad Richison : Sure. I mean, first, in regards to the first one, Beti usage has continued to increase throughout the year for us, and that continues to increase. We've been pretty close to guidance almost every quarter this year. And so Craig kind of talked about that moderating throughout the year. And we're seeing what accelerated impact Beti has. And then, Craig, you can add kind of the... Craig Boelte : Yes. So Raimo, I mean, it impacted it in a couple of different areas. I mean, obviously, the unscheduled runs to correct payrolls and some of those service revenues that, we have as it relates to correcting payrolls, those numbers were moderating, and they typically come in towards the end of the quarter. So that's part of the impact for the quarter as well as the CRR impact, which I called out on the prepared remarks. And then also the pre-employment services came in a little light. So it was really a combination of all four of those items. Operator : Our next question is from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Samad Samana : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I want to unpack a couple of things to follow-up on Raimo's question. I mean if I think about the dollars that you would add based on that 10% to 12% growth in 2024. Yes, I guess I'm curious, based on the staffing levels of the organization, should we see either a change in the cost structure or just thinking about dollars added and sales headcount that's adding it? Just how do we kind of square those two things, especially with the offices that you added in late '21 and early '22? I'm just trying to understand, because 10% to 12% would be a pretty significant departure, from the growth we've seen historically? Craig Boelte : Yes. We haven't given any guidance as it relates to the cost structure, Samad. I mean that's something we'll be looking at. One thing we just wanted to do is give you guys kind of an indication, of what we would expect with some of the things we're seeing now, as to how 2024 would be shaping up. Samad Samana : And maybe just, I guess, a follow-on on that. So I understand that Beti's efficiency drives maybe some services revenue that you would have otherwise gotten, but what about in terms of whether - can you give us any update on maybe the number of new customers that you added in the quarter, or ARR added in terms of new represented seats that, can maybe help us think about either growth in customer count going forward? Or what are you assuming for that for 2024? Just any color would be helpful? Chad Richison : Sure. I mean what we can tell you about, what we see right now, is outside sales remain very strong inside sales remain very strong. And cross-selling with our CRR group continues, to be down as we are focused on these current clients that we have. Operator : Our next question is from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is now open. Brad Reback : Great. I'll keep it simple. Is there any ERTC revenue in 2023? Chad Richison : Brad, I know -- I mean some of the competitors have called out that top of revenue and that it was going to have an impact. Our client base are quite a bit larger than what you're hearing from some of the competitors in terms of our client size. So I'm sure there was some. We had some people that were applying for the employee retention credit. And most of that, I think you have to file - by the first or second quarter of next year and the IRS has kind of put a moratorium on that for a period, but I would say it's not significant. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Just following on, on the other questions. Thanks for taking my question. Is it possible to breakdown like what the impact was with regards to what you're seeing in terms of these efficiencies, how much you're seeing out of the CRR group and can you clarify what you mean by the strategic revenue decisions that you're taking for next year? Does that mean potentially pairing some clients or not renewing them? Or what exactly does that mean? And how does that - how does strong outside sales correspond to the 11% to 12% growth? Chad Richison : Sure. Well, the first question is, you may have a client that was used to - they're supposed to be running 13 payrolls in a quarter. And they were running 19, and now they're back to running 13. And so you have some of that going on with Beti as well as a lot of just the fixes. I mean it just eliminates everything. I mean perfect payroll's a thing. New clients come on with Beti and half of their employees are doing their own payroll by the end of the first month. Our new logo sales are strong, like I said, inside sales is a cross-selling, I mean it's been pretty weak. And that's not going to change for a little bit. I mean we're not going to keep trying to sell more products to a portion of the base, not using it or receiving value. We're going to go back in and partner with the client to ensure they're achieving the full value available to them. And so that's a big part of our strategy here. And I will say our strategy is related to the base, not the go-to-market. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Ari Friedman : Hi. This is Ari Friedman sitting in for Brian Schwartz. Thanks for taking my question. I guess like a question I have, can you just talk about like the - what you're seeing just in terms of SMB and mid-market in terms of demand in comparison to last quarter and how it's trended? Thanks. Chad Richison : Demand remains strong. I believe that what we're talking about is more specific to Paycom and not something that would necessarily well, I mean, be happening with the rest of our industry. I mean we've made a big paradigm shift and going through this. These are things that we've done before as we've gone through these types of things. And I think that we've stayed very dedicated, and there's a lot of clients that we have that we continue to onboard all the new ones that, continue to get great value. And so, we're going to stay focused on what we're doing and also looking out for our current clients. Ari Friedman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Joshua Reilly with Needham. Joshua Reilly : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Has anything changed in terms of customer retention in the last couple of quarters? And how much of an impact, if any, is that having on the Q4 and the initial 2024 guidance? Chad Richison : Sure. So neither what I would call is our surprise in the third quarter nor our larger-than-normal adjustment for fourth quarter guide, are related to any change in our expectation for retention achievements. Said a different way, there have been no changes to our retention expectations since we gave Q3 guidance on October 1. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Enders with Citi. Steve Enders : Hi great. Thanks for taking question here. Maybe just I guess, follow-on to the last question. I mean, it seems like gross retention hasn't changed, but it's more of a view of the net retention dynamics. I guess, first of all, is that the right way to be thinking about it even for next year as we think about that low teens guide? And I guess, any way to like quantify the change in net retention that you're kind of talking about here? Chad Richison : Sure. So, we report gross retention once a year in February. As I've said before, we measure retention throughout the year. It's usually strongest in the fourth quarter. And so in February, we'll give our gross retention number. When you're looking at retention of revenue specific to a client that is using the Paycom system, if they're a new client, that revenue retention remains strong and specific to that one client, because they were new. It's not something we had previously. If they were a current client, as we transition them to Beti that does impact their future billing with us. And so, absolutely, as they continue to get great value, it is - a lot of that value is reflected in reduced billing. I mean I would say from a customer perspective, that's a smaller portion of the overall value that, they receive for Beti. But I mean, look, the only people that went in the old model is the payroll company and whoever is getting the accolades for fixing all the errors. I mean the employee and the business loses. And so, we're continuing to work with our clients in that - on that. Operator : Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question. Chad, what I understood that Beti now seems like cannibalizing your services revenue. But have you thought about the incremental revenue that you could get from Beti or even raising pricing? I understand you even did it for free. Have you thought about any changes strategically, to offset some of this services revenue coming from your unscheduled payroll? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean I will tell you right now, I'm focused on the client value and the differential between what they're paying and what they're actually achieving. And I've kind of been saying it for a while, we've got the early adopters, the late adopters. I mean, Beti rollout to new clients was revolutionary. I mean our go-to-market is continuing to be unchanged on the health indexes for that group. And by that, I mean the usage, how many employees are using it, manager on the go, everything across the board. They're very strong. Beti rollout to our current client base, I mean it was heavily nuanced. And it's not Beti's fault. Beti's the way to do payroll. People may need some time to see the value, and I get it. But I mean Beti is still the right way. Operator : Our next question is from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi guys. Thank you. I'm just trying to unpack this 2024 early growth view. And if I just think about how we understood your growth algo before, I guess in round numbers, if normal growth was around 20%, we figured 15 - 75% of the 20 points would have been new logo-driven. It sounds like there's demand there, but that's - there's a pretty sharp disconnect versus the 10% to 12%. So just can you help us with this? Chad Richison : Sure. I mean, new business sales as well as cross-selling within our base has always been a mitigating factor to any type of transition shift, we make like this. And again, new business sales remained strong. In fact, most of the calls we get in is about Beti. We've got our first enterprise rep and they're only targeting deals that have greater than 25,000 employees. Its current rep to Paycom. And they've got plenty of leads. And so, it's a paradigm shift that we've been making and, but as far as the go-to-market and the new business logos that we're on-boarding, I mean we're not having issues with that, and we're not looking to make changes in regards to that. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Is the activity that you're seeing for client with Beti usage? Is it occurring any differently with any particular client segment sizes, i.e., larger clients using it more on that having that bigger impact? Chad Richison : I would say that's more specific to the setup of the client at what time we actually went and set them up and kind of how we walked through that. It's also kind of dependent upon their own payroll and how they're doing things. As far as does it have a bigger impact on one versus the other? If deployed correctly potentially, but the larger the impact would really be, based on how much were you messing it up. I mean, you get to some points in large companies. And I mean, they don't even have pray to do it correctly. I mean they just don't. So - and then if you're dealing with a four-employee company, their employees not care about perfect payroll. I mean - so from that standpoint, I mean, it's the way to do it. And like I said, the only person that wins in the old model is the payroll company. I mean we've been charging people to fix mistakes for 80 years, our industry, mistakes that we've allowed them to make. And so yes, we could look at - well, if we eliminate all these mistakes, we're not going to have as many direct deposit reversals and tax changes, and W2Cs and new payroll runs. I mean we get it, and we've been mitigating it with business sales along the way. But now our CRR group, as I said on the last call, we're dedicated to helping clients achieve value. That's where we're at today and the decisions we're making today will drive long-term share or long-term value for our shareholders, me being one of them. And so, the decisions we're making today will allow us to get to the next step. But we're not abandoning and/or changing our strategy in regards to Beti. If anything, I would say we're leaning in more. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Jason Celino : Great. Hi guys. I'm just also trying to unpack these new numbers and when we look at the exit rate from Q4, it kind of assumes a 14% growth rate. So, the early look for next year is a deceleration from that. So I guess, I'm just trying to wonder if this early look you're giving us, does it imply incremental bookings headwinds? Chad Richison : No. Bookings from our go-to-market, no. Operator : Our next question is from Arvind Ramnani with Piper. Your line is now open. Arvind Ramnani : Thanks for taking my question. I just was - I have two questions. One is, can you just expand on the kind of the strategic initiatives you're taking that's kind of causing you all to kind of, I guess, do what's right for our client, but see like deceleration in your revenue growth. Can you just expand on what specific strategic initiatives that you're taking? Chad Richison : So I mean, we're making strategic decisions with our base to make sure they're achieving full value. We don't really need to telegraph more than that. I don't want to share what we're doing and I'm not going to hand one end of the thread from, which someone can pull. I can tell you that all these decisions are specific to what we are doing with our base and not our go-to-market or new clients. Operator : Our next question is from Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. Bhavin Shah : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Chad, just one clarification and one question. Just clarifying the 10% to 11% guidance, is it fair to say that those headwinds that you're seeing next year is primarily all due to changes in assumptions to your customer base? Or is that more a little bit on the new logo side as well? Chad Richison : No, it's a paradigm shift. And no, I would not say its regard - again, back to my previous statement. We're not seeing anything within our go-to market. And by that, I'm talking about outside sales, new logo and/or inside sales new logo from that perspective. We've made a paradigm shift. I mean, we can't change the industry and not change the industry. So we've been going hard at it for two years. And I mean that's not changing. Some of the largest companies in the world are going to be using Beti. It can be challenging to make a paradigm shift, but it's not our first rodeo. I mean, back in '98 would have been, a lot easier to install Windows 95 on a software 486 desktop with a hard drive communicated with a modem like our competitors. In 2003, it would have been easier to partner with best in breed. So we don't necessarily do what's easy. We do what creates value for our clients and drives the return on investment. And when we stay disciplined doing the right things, we accelerate opportunities for ourselves, the client and consequently drive shareholder value, which is very important to me personally. Operator : Our next question is with Robert Simmons with D.A. Davidson. Robert Simmons : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess how much revenue are you generating today from your international efforts? And how quickly do you think that can ramp up? Is that included in the outlook for next year? Or is that would that be a potential upside to those numbers? Chad Richison : Every - we're not - I think what Craig was trying to give is more initial outlook, if you will, a nod to all the initiatives that we have right now as we move forward. I do believe that next year, we're already seeing it now will be - continue to be pulled up market. But still focused on our core market that we focus on, but we'll continue to be pulled up as we have been. And yes, a big part of that continues to be the global HCM product and expansion into additional countries. I mean zero employees are doing their own payroll in Canada until I think it was August. And now employees in Mexico will be. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Your line is now open. Matt Pfau : Hi. Great. Wanted to ask, one of the items you mentioned were some macro headwinds from inflation. Maybe you can just clarify how big of a factor that those are? And then in the initial 2024 guide, what you're anticipating from a macro or a demand perspective? Any change there? Thanks. Chad Richison : I mean from the macro headwinds, where we're seeing it specifically related to preemployment services that we have. So that's really more in regards to that, that carries through. Craig Boelte : We expect that to carry through into the fourth quarter and into next year as well. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Bergere with Bank of America. Adam Bergere : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess kind of open-ended, but what's like the silver lining in this from like an investor shareholder perspective, like win rates go up pretty materially since there's tangible cost savings there when you use Beti. Is help with the move upmarket, given more value. Just trying to think about past this initial cannibalization period, like what should we look at like as the positives on the other side. Thank you. Chad Richison : Well, yes. No, I think that's actually a good point. First of all, I think you should see this as a transitory period. And we've kind of been talking about our continued ability to move current clients over to Beti and help them achieve value. I came out and said I hope all clients are on 100% within the first because it produces that much value. I thought it'd be quickly. We have one-third of our clients that we want to make sure are getting value out of Paycom with what they're using. And we also want to be able to preserve the opportunity to be able to sell them on the real value of Beti and the opportunity it has for them. Operator : And our last question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex Zukin : Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just a clarifying one. If I think about recurring revenue versus services revenue, what's the right way to think about services revenue specifically for Q4 or implementation revenue? And then for next year, is that just going to be something that trends down significantly from where it's scheduled to end this year. I know you've typically not provided that level of detail, but it sounds like this strategic shift is associated with maybe some elimination of that implementation or services revenue. Craig Boelte : Yes. I mean there's going to be two pieces. There's a services revenue and then obviously, the unscheduled to do some of those corrections as well. So I mean, as you've seen throughout our history, you kind of see a sequential Q3 to Q4. So you can tell that a lot of those services revenue and on schedule, even though some of them relate to bonus runs, there's quite a few of those in Q4. So as we were looking out to Q4, that's really the impact that we saw into Q4. And some of that's going to carry over into 2024. And that's why we thought it was important for us to give that initial look. Chad Richison : And we've got 80% of our employees. Okay. Go ahead. That's fine. We've got 50% of the ones using Beti - the clients have deployed Beti, 50% of their employees are now doing their own payroll. So that eventually goes to 100 and then eventually, we continue to work with their client base. And so all that's to say is our clients should be getting more and more efficient if we're - if it actually works, that's the way the value would be showing up. And then to us, it will show up in go to market. So, all right. Operator : There are no more questions. So I'll pass over. Chad Richison : Sorry, I'm going to go ahead and - very good, want to thank everybody for joining the call today. Over the coming months, we'll be hosting meetings at a few conferences. In mid-November, we'll be participating in meetings at the TD Cowen and Needham Virtual conferences. On November 28, we'll be attending the UBS Global Tech Conference in Arizona. In December, we'll be in San Francisco at the Barclays Global TMT Conference. We look forward to catching up with many of you soon. Operator, you may disconnect, and thank you. Operator : That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Co-CEO. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We ended 2023 with better-than-expected results, thanks to the considerable coordinated efforts of our team across the organization. Before digging into the quarterly results and achievements in 2023, I'd like to discuss today's announcements about the promotion of Chris Thomas to Co-CEO. Following that, I will briefly introduce Chris who previously served as our COO. Craig will then review our financials and our guidance before taking questions. With that, let's get started. As Founder and CEO of Paycom, my position has provided me the opportunity to work with great leaders who have built Paycom into a world-class HR and payroll software company. One such leader is Chris Thomas. He is someone I have extreme confidence in and a leader I can share responsibilities with at Paycom. I've been preparing this opportunity for Chris and myself to work even more closely together for some time now. Today's announcement further illustrates the trust I have in our leadership. Personally, this is very exciting, because it allows me to invest further in the areas that I'm passionate about, which are the ones where I can have the largest impact for our clients. In this new role for Chris, Paycom will be even stronger than ever before. A key area of my continued focus will be product innovation and strategy. And Chris will continue to focus on operating other aspects of the business. Our collaboration has strengthened Paycom and I'm excited for what we will do going forward. In the last several months, we continued to strengthen our leadership team with the addition of Jason Clark as Chief Administrative Officer and Steve Sturges as Chief Marketing Officer. Jason was the CEO of one of the region's largest workers' comp insurance companies. Having worked with Jason in various capacities for about 12 years, I officially brought him into the organization last year knowing this was an ideal fit for him and for Paycom. Steve formerly owned and operated a very successful marketing agency and I've had the privilege of working with him for about 15 years. I'm excited to see him continue to elevate our brand, engage our clients and drive further demand generation for our sales force. This evolution of our organization is exciting, and I believe it will bring significant value to our clients, employees and investors. Now, I want to discuss our vision for 2024 and then look back on some highlights of 2023. Following a better-than-expected end 2023, in 2024, we are primarily focused on three key areas. World-class service, solution automation and client ROI achievement. Our continued focus is being the leading provider of comprehensive payroll and human capital management solutions in every market we serve. We are bringing the power of Paycom to more employers and employees and showing more organizations the ROI they experience by using our single database software. On the product front, Beti has been one of the products at the leading edge of our AI and automation strategy, delivering tremendous ROI to our clients. Our recently commissioned third-party study on Beti highlighted three benefit areas. On average, a greater than 80% reduction in errors, and 90% reduction in time spent processing payroll and improved employee engagement. A leader within the restaurant industry noted that the automation from Beti took days off payroll processing time and that as employee checkers went down, employee engagement went up. Additionally, certain organizations using Beti experienced up to 100% of their end-users regularly engaging with our easy-to-use system. Solutions like Paycom\u2019s GONE tool are expanding automation to other areas of our product suite, namely our time off applications. The rollout of GONE towards the end of 2023 has been going very well. This new product uses AI and decisioning logic to automate all decisions for time-off requests, which further enhances both the employee and the manager experience by eliminating conflicts and resolving time-sensitive decisions. Today, clients may make between 20 and 30 decisions or more per year per employee concerning PTO, vacation request and the denials or approvals that go into staffing decisions. GONE eliminates those unnecessary interaction points by providing a consistent and fully automated experience for employees, managers, HR administrators and the business as a whole. With GONE, an employee in any industry can request time-off at midnight on a Friday and know immediately if it is approved or denied because GONE has automated all time-off request decisions. It's another example of a product that's a win for our clients and a win for their employees. We delivered a lot of innovation on the international front in 2023. We launched our global HCM product and now companies of all sizes use this product across 180 countries and in 15 languages and dialects. We developed and launched native payroll in Canada and Mexico. Now we've developed and are launching a native payroll solution in the United Kingdom. Our international strategy complements our product strategy and adds to the momentum we are seeing with US-based companies that have an international presence. While still early, we are very excited about the potential impact this initiative will have on our expanded team. While I'm proud of our product developments and international expansion in 2023, I'm even more excited about where we're headed with the product department. As a company, we all know and feel the excitement that is happening within our walls. Since 1998, Paycom has changed the way businesses operate through innovation and automation. Our revolutionary product roadmap will continue to bring new levels of value to our clients. I'm glad to see both growth in our product and in people we are elevating and bringing back into the organization. The buzz about the future of product innovation across the organization is exciting and encouraging. The client experience is everything to us and that all starts with our product. We are excited to release more product enhancements and innovations than ever before. To sum-up, in 2024, we will continue to be hyper-focused on world-class service, solution automation and the client ROI achievement strategies. This means, we will continue our emphasis on client ROI and user experience. I'm confident that the size of our opportunity and our track-record for execution will bolster our growth trajectory. I'd like to thank our employees for their important contributions in 2023 and commitment to Paycom. In fact, because of them, Paycom earned many top workplace accolades in 2023, most notably Gallup's Exceptional Workplace Award. Additionally, Newsweek recognized us as one of the most trustworthy organizations and as a Top Workplaces for Diversity for parents and families. These accolades mean a lot because it's a reflection of our leadership and the culture we've built. Before turning the call over to Craig, I'd like Chris to briefly introduce himself and discuss his vision for the role. Chris? Chris Thomas : Thanks, Chad. I'm honored to help lead such an incredible organization. I want to personally thank you for the guidance, tools and insights you provided me through the years. Having had the opportunity to lead approximately 10 departments over my tenure, like product, service, learning, HCM, implementation impacts to name a few, I feel even more prepared to help leap Paycom into future. I am proud of our leadership group who have strategized and built the client value achievement strategy. We spent a lot of quality time throughout the year, especially last quarter having meaningful engagements with our clients and the feedback has been very encouraging. We are strengthening our relationships and relentlessly pursuing solutions that deliver high ROI for our clients. The innovations in automation and user experience are resonating across our client base, delivering immediate and measurable value to our clients will deliver long-term value to Paycom. As a result, our service and client relations groups are working together more closely than ever before, which is driving further ROI for our clients. We're going to continue to generate even more momentum as we engage clients to help them maximize their value when using our system. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chris. Before I review our fourth quarter and full-year results for 2023 and our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2024, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the year with solid results with full-year 2023 revenue of $1.694 billion up 23% compared to 2022. Fourth quarter results were better-than-expected, with total revenues of $435 million, representing growth of 17% over the comparable prior year period. Our revenue growth was driven by new business wins, partially offset by lower cross-selling to existing clients. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $427 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 17% from the comparable prior year period. We delivered strong net income and adjusted EBITDA in 2023. Full year GAAP net income was $341 million or $5.88 per diluted share based on approximately 58 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for 2023 was $449 million or $7.75 per diluted share, up 26% from the prior year on a per share basis. In the fourth quarter, GAAP net income of $82 million and non-GAAP net income of $110 million represented a $1.43 and $1.93 per diluted share, respectively, based on approximately 57 million shares. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $719 million representing full year margin of 42.5%, up over 30 basis points year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $177 million, representing a quarterly margin of 40.6% for the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock or approximately 2% of our shares outstanding for a total of $213 million and we paid over $21 million in cash dividends. As of December 31st, 2023, we have repurchased over 6.1 million shares, and when combined with dividends, we have returned nearly $1 billion to stockholders. We still have approximately $800 million remaining under our buyback authorization as of December 31st, 2023, and the Board has approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-March. We ended 2023 with approximately 36,800 clients, representing a growth rate of 1% compared to 2022. On a parent company grouping basis, we ended the year with roughly 19,500 clients, up 2% compared to 2022. Digging into client mix details and using client figures based on parent company groupings, client count for companies with greater than 500 employees was up 11% year-over-year and client count for companies with greater than 2,000 employees was up nearly 18% year-over-year. Total number of employee records stored in our system in 2023 was 6.8 million. Paycom's annual revenue retention rate in 2023 was 90% compared to 91% in 2022 with attrition concentrated primarily at the low-end of our market. Note that our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon included additional information about a recent modification in our annual revenue retention rate calculation. Adjusted R&D expense was $51 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 or 11.6% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs including the capitalized portion, were $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $52 million in the prior year period. We continue to invest in the long-term future growth opportunity including in areas of automation, AI and innovation. Our tax rate for the year ended 2023 was 28% on a GAAP basis. For the full year 2024, we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be approximately 29% on a GAAP basis and approximately 25% on a non-GAAP basis. In fiscal year 2024, we expect stock-based compensation expense as a percent of revenue to be approximately 8.5%. This does not reflect any potential one-time adjustment related to the forfeiture of the 2020 CEO Performance Award. We will provide details on this one-time adjustment if any when we report first quarter earnings. Turning to the balance sheet. Even after the substantial buybacks and dividends paid in the quarter, we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $294 million and zero debt. Cash from operations was $485 million in 2023, representing an increase of 33%. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. On the capital expenditure front, our fifth building in Oklahoma City is substantially complete. We estimate total CapEx as a percent of revenues to be approximately 12% in 2024. Now let me turn to guidance. Our approach to guidance remains consistent with our historical approach and that we guide to what we can see in factor in relevant trends, opportunities and potential constraints. For 2024, we're also factoring in a wider range of sensitivities, such as fluctuations of interest rates and the outcomes of several near-term strategic initiatives. For fiscal 2024, we expect revenues in the range of $1.860 billion to $1.885 billion or approximately 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range, which is consistent with the target growth range we provided on our Q3 earnings call. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $720 million to $730 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenues in the range of $494 million to $497 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 10% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter in the range of $218 million to $222 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 44% at the midpoint of the range. 2023 delivered solid results for Paycom. The strength of our product and the client initiatives we have in place give me confidence that 2024 will be a solid year of execution. We will continue to invest in talent, marketing, innovation, customer service and geographic expansion to strengthen our competitive position and meet the demand of our expanding TAM. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thank you and all the best to the new management structure from me. Two questions. One, Chad, can you just speak a little bit to retention in 2023, and customer growth in 2023 because if I do the math right, it was like a 1% growth, which seems unusual for you guys. Can you talk a little bit about like factors we saw there, and that probably kind of linked in with that 90% retention number? And then on EBITDA guide, Craig for you, and if I look at this year, we're kind of guiding down a little bit on EBITDA margin. Can you talk a little bit maybe about some of the projects or some of the work you're doing there that kind of drives that? Thank you. Chad Richison : Sure, Raimo. I'll take -- I might take both of those actually. As it relates to retention, this year we reported 90% versus 91% from last year. Kind of looking at retention, we typically don't discuss it based on client size, but the main part of the attrition was really in that down-market side. If you remember, we added a lot of smaller clients during COVID where we used to have five individuals -- five sales people in that group and we increased that to actually 10 teams of 8. So we added a lot of smaller clients during that time. And that was really what we saw as it related to the retention and that group to pressure on that down-market group. And they are the ones that are most impacted by the macro, the higher interest rates, the higher inflation. As it relates to the margins, what I would say is we've really started at 39% to 41% for the last four, five years, and that's really where we wanted to start this year. And it really gives us the room to invest where we need to invest in the areas of innovation and sales to continue to drive revenue growth. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Perfect. Makes sense. Thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please proceed. Samad Samana : Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions and welcome to the new members of management. Maybe my question follows up a little bit on Raimo's. I'd like to dig deeper into the retention change. It's gone from 94% down to 90%, that's about 4 points. Is that all due to the surge in clients that you added in during the COVID period, and I guess the question is maybe what is causing the attrition beyond that being is it business failure ticking up, is it non-controllable churn, maybe help us think through what is causing that at the low-end? Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean at the low-end it's typically more going out of business, but that group of clients are more impacted by the macro. We also changed the way we marked our clients' loss where we're pulling that forward a little bit, Samad, where we're marking them quicker than we have in the past and that way we can get back out, and really, we tried to sell some of those as are still in implementation, so. Samad Samana : Great. And then maybe just as I think through the fourth quarter, it was well-ahead of what the guidance was, just trying to unpack that with rates, maybe looking like they're clicking down, have you seen any change in either -- and the employment market things, have you seen any change in either pre-employment services doing better-than-expected bonus runs, maybe help us think through the strength that you saw in the fourth quarter versus the guidance you gave after the third quarter? Chad Richison : Yeah, I mean. I would say, we probably went into fourth quarter a little more conservative than what we have in the past, after a kind of our Q3 results. We were really looking at where the downside could be or what can happen in fourth quarter, and I would say things came in better than what we expected. Samad Samana : Great. Appreciate taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Jefferies. Please proceed. Baird, I apologize. Mark Marcon : Can you hear me? Chad Richison : Yeah. Mark Marcon : Hello? Can you hear me? Chad Richison : Hey, Mark. We can hear you. Hey Mark, we can hear you. Mark Marcon : Okay. Great. Thanks. Hey, can you talk a little bit about the traction with the sales force and what you're seeing just in terms of new client growth, because I'm looking at the implied ex-float revenue growth for the first quarter and you did mentioned the retention is lower, so understand part of that, but I'm wondering, can you just talk a little bit about sales effectiveness and what you're seeing there? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, we've had a lot of success with sales effectiveness. Obviously, we're selling a differentiated solution that brings differentiated value. We did mention on the call that we've had more success in the 500 and above. I think we called out, 11% growth in that group, 18% growth in the group that has 2000 or more. And so, we have been pressured more at the lower end of our market and also there's a resource aspect, as we look to onboard clients and what we're going through there, how we use our resources to best impact client value. And so, we're having a lot of success there in the market. Oftentimes, you are trading off -- you are trading off on a unit basis, oftentimes small units for a little bit larger type units, and I'm talking about employee size. Mark Marcon : Great. And then can you talk a little bit about the specific areas of investment that you would be making, you're starting the year out slightly more conservative EBITDA target, what are the specific areas where you're going to invest a little bit more, I imagine part of that is product which you ended up referencing, but I'm wondering if there's any other areas that we should look to? Chad Richison : Growth has always been first prize for us, so I mean, that's really what we're focused on. When we're talking about an impact on the -- from an adjusted EBITDA perspective, I mean, we're focused on the three areas that we talked about with solution automation, world-class service and then client ROI achievement. But those don't necessarily -- we've got the staff to do those things. Those are things we're working through and continuing to impact quite positively. From an additional expense perspective, that's going to be growth initiatives related. Mark Marcon : Great. Thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Brian Schwartz : Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Chad, wanted to ask you along the lines of the sales effectiveness, what you're seeing in terms of cycles and as well as the top of the funnel momentum? Are you seeing any changes in that aspect of the sales? Chad Richison : I mean, that's a good question. We've continued to go further at market, I've mentioned it on the call. And there is a little bit different motion as we work through that process and as we've gotten better at it. And so, as you go further up market, you're going to have, it might take you a little bit longer than what it would then if you're in the mid-market. For us, it's still about the work of the sales individual. I mean, it really does determine how strong a sales individual is in regards to the process that's being worked and how quickly a client can see that value and then onboard onto the system. So, I would say it's more specific to an individual salesperson. And then I would add to that that as you go up market, you have more people that you talk to, more stakeholders within any company, and you want to make sure you cover all those bases as you move toward. Brian Schwartz : Thank you. And the follow-up question I had on the project investments, just thinking about that on the sales and the distribution side. Is there anything you can share with us how you're thinking about the pace of either new offices, or new sales rep hiring this year, maybe versus what you did last year in 2023? Thanks. Chad Richison : We're heading into 2024 really well staffed in sales. So I think that -- even it have to play itself out, but as everyone knows. I mean, our sales office openings are based on the capacity that we have internally to be able to do that. And all I would say is that we're better staffed going into 2024 than what we have been in a while for managers all the way out. And so, those opportunities as they make sense for us -- as it makes sense for us to do it, we'll be looking at that throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Reilly with Needham. Please proceed. Joshua Reilly : Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just some more color on the customers you're seeing attrition with, in the cohort of those who have adopted Beti versus the remaining customers yet to adopt Beti. Are you seeing higher attrition with those that are yet to adopt Beti? Chad Richison : I mean, we want to begin talking about our retention as one number, whether someone's on Beti or not, they are client of ours, we want them to be a client of ours. Obviously, I've called this out in the past, it continues to hold true, those companies that use our system fully get the most value out of it. And obviously we have a lower, much lower attrition with businesses that use Beti versus those that don't. Joshua Reilly : Got it. That's helpful. And then what are you seeing an average headcount for customer and what assumptions are you making in guidance in terms of average headcount per customer? If you -- and then just following-up on that, if you expect it's going be flat year-over-year in '24, is that somewhat of a headwind to growth versus a normal year for you guys? Thanks. Chad Richison : I mean, we've seen -- the headcount for customer has been very stable. And so, as we're looking at 2024 guidance, we're expecting the same, very stable, as it relates to headcount per customer. Operator : Our next question comes today from Steve Enders of Citi. Please proceed. Steve Enders : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the question. And maybe for Chad, just when we get a better sense for, I guess why now is the right time to shift to a Co-CEO structure and why is the time for you to be focusing more on the product and strategic side of the business today? Chad Richison : Yeah, well. I mean, it's been 25 years and I have the right person to do it with, this wasn't -- I mean, this is something that we've been going through. As Chris mentioned on his prepared remarks, I mean, Chris has taken a tour through the company and has operated 10 of our significant departments already in the company. And so, it's something that I've been excited about, but I mean, the long and the short is, I mean innovations where I oftentimes supply my greatest gifts and that's where I'm best at it, and there are new technologies and toys to build with now. It's an exciting time. I've had a lot of fun running special projects that in September of last year, our product department which I've mentioned this at the Barclays Conference, began reporting to me again. So I've really enjoyed working with them. I've been focused on that as well as our sales strategy. And look, I'm not retiring. I mean I don't even know what that would look like. I'd like to compete, be part of a team and the long and the short, Chris and I can accomplish more together than I could alone. Steve Enders : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe we can get an update on how the Beti adoption is going, pushing that back into the base and maybe how things have -- like, what the expectations are for this year for where they could potentially go? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to say we're pushing Beti back into the base. I think that to the extent a client sees the value and they're ready to use Beti within their organization, we're there to provide that. We are meeting clients where they live in usage right now, and helping them achieve value, regardless, whether they use Beti or not. I will say though, as I continue to say, Beti drives a lot of efficiencies for businesses. It makes a giant impact for both them and their employees. Our go-to-market strategy has been 100% Beti since July of 2021, and in regards to current clients, we're meeting them where they live and we're helping them achieve value because our systems are very robust without Beti. And it keeps getting missed but GONE is a very significant product. I mean it automated quite a lot for a business. And so, a lot of our clients are achieving a lot of value through using that product as well right now. Operator : Our next question today comes from Kevin Veigh with UBS. Please proceed. Kevin Veigh : Great. Thanks so much. And congratulations on the better-than-expected results. Just wanted to talk about the buyback for a minute. I mean it seems like, maybe the first time it's been scale. Just any thoughts around that and as we think about the buyback into '24, again it looks like the average share [repurchase price about $1.78] (ph), just want to start there, so any thoughts on that? Chad Richison : Yeah, so for the quarter we bought back a little over 2% of the company. And for the full year, I think we bought back 1.5 million shares. So we've been active buying back stock of the company. We still have a significant amount left on our buyback program. So we look to be -- and we've always been very opportunistic as we're looking to buy shares back. Kevin Veigh : Then if you think about kind of the Beti adoption across existing clients, and the implementation, has that kind of run its course at this point or is there any way to think about how that flexes over the course of 2024? Chad Richison : Well, I believe there'll continue to be clients that see and want to utilize the value of Beti. And so, yes, we will have more clients and as they see the value and choose to come on to Beti to actually achieve that value, we're going to be there to help them. I will say we're meeting clients where they live with our product right now. And that's a good place for us. That's a good place for clients. We're meeting them where they live and we're helping them achieve the value available to them in the software, whether they use Beti or not, it's a single database system. It's very easy-to-use and there's all kinds of areas where our clients are receiving value, especially right now, as we've even introduced GONE, that's giving us more-and-more conversations because everybody wants to automate time-off request. I mean there's nobody that doesn't want to automate time-off request. So we're having a lot of success with that as well right now. Kevin Veigh : Great. Thank you. Chad Richison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please proceed. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about CRR strategy. I know last -- last few quarters you talked about how CRR going to focus on cross-selling Beti. But what I understand, it's normally focused. So what's the CRR strategy right now? Are they cross-selling any other module? And how should we think about that cannibalization opportunity that earlier you talked about CRR by spending more time pushing Beti, how is that going to change and the impact for 2024? Chad Richison : Sure, so what I would say is, even as we looked into this year, it wasn't as much that the CRRs were out-pushing Beti as much as they were out converting the Beti's that had already, told us they are wanting to go. And that does take some time with the CRRs to do that and that time they spent doing that, making sure we get appropriate usage, prevented them from being able to do certain other task. I mean, I would say that right now, and I've been saying this even probably mentioned this on last quarter, we're not preventing a CRR from going out and selling, there's just a certain criteria of usage that we look for both before you sell a client a product as well as after you sold a client a product to make sure that the value is being achieved. So I would just say that there is a little bit different process that they go through now in regards to selling, as you've heard me say before, it's easier to sell a client a product and to get them to actually use it the correct way to achieve value and we've been very focused on both of those pieces, both in last year and that will continue into 2024. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks, Chad. And then last quarter you talked about some of the impact from macro, mainly like pre-employment checks, those kind of services. How has that been trending since then? Chad Richison : Yeah. I would say, you know, we talked a little bit about it last quarter that it was still positive, but not growing at the rate that we had -- had been experiencing in the past. I would say it's still similar. I mean, the market is tight, you're not seeing people change jobs as much as what you may have in the past, but it's still up, it's just that it's still a little soft in that area on the pre-employment services. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Jared Levine with TD Cowen. Please proceed. Jared Levine : Thank you. In terms of the competitive environment, have you noticed any change in 1Q or 4Q, and if so, is it broad-based or limited to certain competitors? Chad Richison : No, I mean, it's always been a very highly competitive environment. I've -- without naming them, I've talked to talked about our competitors. I still think we're primarily the new company and we celebrated 25 years last year. So all that's to say, I think we've all known each other for a long-time, we've all been highly competitive, and that's always been the case. Jared Levine : Got it. And then looking at the... Chad Richison : And that\u2019s a positive thing. Jared Levine : Yeah. Then looking at the 1Q guidance here, how does the absolute dollar form filings revenue embedded within that, why don't you guys compare it to the 1Q '23 form fillings revenue, just in terms of how much of a headwind year-on-year the growth that represents? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean the forms filing is somewhat of a headwind in Q1. We've seen that for several years ago, really not any new forms after the ACA forms came out, so I mean, it's kind of been the same type of forms that we typically file. We've talked about the number of people that we have on our system and that's typically -- that growth rate typically follows kind of the forms filing growth for the quarter. Jared Levine : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Please proceed. Jason Celino : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Craig, you talked about a wider range, the guidance this year based on different scenarios, where I think you said, interest rates and other strategic initiatives. Maybe can you just talk about what to expect into the low-end versus what you're baking in at the high-end? Craig Boelte : I mean, there's different things that we're factoring in on the full year guide. This is much wider than what we've done in the past. I mean, the main driver is going to be the fed funds rate and what they do with that. You've heard anywhere from 3% to 7% decreases in rates. So we wanted to make sure we gave a range that we could fit that in if any of those scenarios happen. Jason Celino : Okay. Perfect. And then on the customer growth for going-forward, maybe for 2024, internally, what types of initiatives like marketing, targeting, do you plan to implement or do to trying to reaccelerate that? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yeah, so we're very focused on our go-to-market strategy. We focus on the revenue opportunities available to us. I wouldn't say it's just a unit game. But you're playing both sides of that, obviously, because it's unit does help with the revenue. And so, we're not changing a whole lot when it comes to our strategy. I think our message is getting cleaner. And like we like I said in the call, I mean, we just put out another report in regards to Beti's value. We do continue to have a lot of interest about businesses using Beti and then again just a single database system. Jason Celino : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Arvind Ramnani : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of questions on Beti. I guess, like have you seen any sort of client attrition, that's like attrition from existing clients or some clients -- prospective clients who are choosing to kind of go a different direction, because they don't like Beti. I mean, has there been any kind of negative or pushback on Beti from customers or is that largely been quite positive? Chad Richison : No, we're having a lot of success with Beti. I think you're talking about head-to-head where someone might choose not to use Beti and continue to do it the way it's been done traditionally. That really comes down to the sales person, and having somebody that understands the value and then also spending the time with the client and all the stakeholders and working through that, so that you know they can actually see the ROI available for them. Arvind Ramnani : Great. And I guess that some kind of want to kind of use the latest version of Paycom, do they have the ability to use Beti, but say like, hey, in terms of like us self-certifying the payroll, if that's something they want to give the employees, is that -- are you able to turn-on and off that option where you say like even all of Beti accept this turn-on, turn-off option? Chad Richison : So, we have 31 modules and those are chosen by the client, how they use those. Now, many of our modules are tied together. And so, it's through one module that you get the value of the other, but that wouldn't be the case with all 31. I would say there's some 34 -- sorry 34 modules, I would say there's some core modules that are going to be critical for a client to be able to actually process a payroll for tax depositing and everything else. And then there's some other modules, you know that that's more driven at the client choice of whether or not they want to provide that solution to their organization or whether or not they have that covered in another area. Arvind Ramnani : Just last question here is like, if someone has payroll but they are basically not the ability to kind of run payroll through all but seem like employees are not required to certify their paycheck every two weeks. Is that a possibility or no? Chad Richison : Yeah, that's client dependent on exactly what they require in that. That\u2019s up to them. Arvind Ramnani : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Bhavin Shah : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Chad, I think you spoke about some of your strategic initiatives kind of impacting 2024 topline. Can you maybe just provide a little bit more further insight into which ones are having the greatest impact on revenue and how long do you think these kind of headwinds from these strategic initiatives last, is it a one-year thing, or do you think it will take multiple years to play-out? Chad Richison : Yeah, in terms of our strategic initiatives for '24, I mean obviously it could have an impact on the topline as well as some of the expenses as well and I would say that a lot of those are going to impact '24 and maybe have a small tail on that? Bhavin Shah : Got it. And then. I guess maybe one clarification, I think from what at least I understand and please correct me if I'm wrong, it appears like for your messaging today that you're perhaps a little bit less aggressive in terms of pushing Beti into the customer base versus your prior commentary. If that's true, why wouldn't this decrease some of the kind of revenue headwinds that you talked about last quarter that Beti might be creating in fiscal '24? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, we talked about some of the headwinds that Beti maybe creating, we've talked about that last quarter, and I mean, Beti has a great benefit to the customer. I mean it eliminates errors and those accrue as value to the customer. And we've looked at that and what that as a headwind that might be to us and really that's from eliminating some of those services that we charge for, and we've estimated that to be approximately 5% of revenue. But we wouldn't expect all of that to go away. So that's kind of as we've gone through and really looked at those areas of our business, that could be impacted, that's kind of what we looked at. Bhavin Shah : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question today comes from Daniel Jester with BMO. Please proceed. Daniel Jester : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the gross margin trajectory, I know it's less of a focus than EBITDA. But three straight years of compression exiting 2023, as we think about 2024 and some of the investments you're making, should we think that gross margin compresses again or how should we be thinking about that for the year ahead? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean we don't, we don't guide to gross margin, only there's several things that go into that. One of the largest impacts to gross margin is really headcount on our service side. And so, we're well staffed going as we're exiting 2023 and those costs continue to carry on into 2024. Daniel Jester : Okay. Great. And then on the Global HCM, great to hear about native payroll in Canada and Mexico out there. Are you actually paying people in both those countries today and when -- and if that's the case, can you just give us a flavor for kind of who or just who you you're displacing, is it some of your maybe US-based peers or is that maybe local providers, a little more color on kind of the international trajectory? Thank you. Chad Richison : Sure. The Global HCM side, again, we're talking about for Canada and Mexico. Global HCM, you can use for many of the -- for all the countries, but our Global HCM side, you're going to displace more of our typical vendors that we may see and then I would say on the payroll side, it's a mixed bag, but it's oftentimes we're replacing an in-country partner or an in-country vendor on the payroll side for both Canada and Mexico, which we are up and running and now we did announced today that we've added UK to that. But as far as Canada and Mexico, we're running in those countries right now. Daniel Jester : Great. Thank you. Chad Richison : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our final question today comes from Adam Bergere with Bank of America. Please proceed. Adam Bergere : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about sales productivity and the retention rate assumptions embedded into the 2024 guide, and how that compares to what you saw in 2023? Thanks. Craig Boelte : Yeah, I'll take the sales productivity. I mean, we've got a great sales organization. We always have. We've had a great sales strategy. We're continuing to get a lot of people involved with our sales organization. We've done a great job training them and we're set-up to go through this year. We did a great job last year throughout the year selling, we had a lot of things working with us on that as we moved throughout the year, we kind of talked about the Beti cannibalization or the displacement of certain fees. Craig talked about that being 5% still total out there, we've seen portions of that 5% already down 20%. So again, that's a successful win for the client. I do think that it takes a certain skillset to be able to go in and work with the client within our industry and we're having a lot of success there. So we do expect that we're going to sell more this year than what we sold last year and last year was a good sales year. Chad Richison : Yeah, and in terms of the retention, as we mentioned, the parts that impacted retention the most this year was really at the low-end of the market. And we're exposed to the low-end of the market very small. I mean we're less than 5% that has under 50 employees. And it's actually closer to 3.5%, so as we're moving into the current year, we have already mentioned that the initial looks are positive. So that's kind of the way we look at that. Adam Bergere : All right. Thank you. And then just a follow-up to that last point. Are you investing a little less incrementally in that lower end of the market, then would you say? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yes. I would say, we are investing a little less. Operator : Thank you for your questions. This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Chad Richison, for closing remarks. Chad Richison : Well, thanks everyone for joining the call today. I want to congratulate the 2023 Paycom Jim Thorpe Award Winner, Trey Taylor from the US Air Force Academy. This award recognizes the most outstanding defensive back in college football and memorializes Jim Thorpe, who is one of the greatest all-around athletes in history. Jim Thorpe also happen to be in Oklahoma. We plan on participating in the KeyBanc and Morgan Stanley Conferences in March and seeing many of you in-person throughout the coming months. I like to congratulate Chris and thank all our employees for their contribution to Paycom's success. Operator, you may end the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Paycom's First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to James Samford, Head of Investor Relations. You may now begin. James Samford : Thank you, and welcome to Paycom's earnings conference call for the first quarter of 2024.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I'll now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's Co-CEO and President. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I'll kick off the call with a few highlights from the quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Chris to discuss client trends and recent awards. Craig will then review our financials and our guidance before taking questions. Our product vision centers around eliminating redundant HR work, eliminating cost and allowing users to recoup valuable time in their day to add value to their organizations. In addition to our single database, which simplifies the client experience and reduces integration costs, another key Paycom differentiator is that employees input and validate their data directly into our HCM solution. With Paycom, employees do their own payroll, fixing errors before they become problems. On our last call, we highlighted 3 key focus areas in 2024 : solution automation, client ROI achievement and world-class service. Led by Beti, our solution automation initiatives continue to generate tremendous opportunities for our clients. We released more product enhancements in the first quarter than in the previous 2 quarters combined. We are leveraging AI and decisioning logic across our solution, adding more value and eliminating mundane nonrevenue-generating activities for our clients.  A recent new client told us that prior to implementing Beti, it would take over 2 days to process payroll. With Beti, they complete the process in only 90 minutes. We've also automated time-off decisioning, allowing managers across the country to focus on value-added activities. With GONE, our time-off product leverages decisioning logic to automatically approve, deny or warehouse time-off requests by employees. This is a better experience for employees and delivers both time savings and efficiencies for workforce management and scheduling. On the client ROI achievement front, our success with Beti results in increased client ROI and is resonating with more and more businesses in the marketplace. Our clients already receive industry-leading ROI, and we are focused on accelerating our product road map to drive even more value.  Now with Beti, clients regularly tell us that their company runs much smoother when their employees do their own payroll, and I know this sentiment is shared across the client base of Beti users. We are changing the way payroll is done, and our clients are telling us we're right. On the world-class service front, we are meeting clients where they live to help identify and close any gaps they might be seeing between their respective total available ROI and where they stand today. We are strengthening our client relationships with service and value achievement, and I want to thank our employees for their incredible efforts on this front. It is working. Our go-to-market strategy continues to emphasize the differentiated nature of our offering and the significant benefits of doing your own payroll with Paycom. We are getting more leads, thanks to Beti, and we are seeing solid demand for our solution. At our recent sales incentive trip, we recognized our first sales rep to sell over $4 million in annual new business. It wasn't that long ago that we celebrated the first sales rep to sell $1 million in annual new business. We believe our unique value proposition separates us from the other disparate offerings in the market that require complex integrations and manual entry activities. We continue to make meaningful progress on the international front, as we build on the momentum we achieved in 2023 and early 2024, when we released our global HCM product and announced the launch of native payroll in Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom.  Today, we are pleased to announce that we have developed and are launching our native payroll solution in Ireland. In less than a year since we announced our international journey, we are already seeing U.S.-based companies with an international presence look to Paycom as a global provider. While still early, I'm pleased to see that all the work on our international strategy is paying off. In fact, we recently won a large international sports organization, thanks to our multicountry payroll and HCM offering.  This client will process payroll with Beti in multiple countries, and this win represents another proof point for our international strategy. While this is a great win for Paycom, I want to be sure to note that we remain highly focused on our U.S. growth, as we still have only an estimated 5% of the total addressable market. To sum up, I'm pleased with the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives, and I look forward to building on the momentum we are seeing. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Christopher Thomas : Thanks, Chad.  Our service and client relations group continue to work very closely together to drive value for our clients. Usage of our system continues to increase as more employees interact directly with their data. Our average DDX score continues to rise and is above 95% across our client base today. Our innovative technology and our client ROI achievement strategy are key drivers of satisfaction and bolster our world-class service model. In fact, we were very pleased to receive several awards that highlight the strength of our relationship with our clients. Most recently, we were recognized as the 2024 winner of the Excellence in Customer Service Award by Business Intelligence Group. It's gratifying to receive recognition from an organization for our hard work and dedicated focus on our clients. This award highlights businesses who are redefining service standards in their industry. This achievement showcases our ability to further drive client ROI while making a positive impact across our client base.  We were also named one of the most trustworthy companies in America by Newsweek for the third consecutive year. These awards are testament to our service model. I'm pleased to see that our relationships with our clients continue to get even stronger.  Finally, we earned the Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award for the second consecutive year, and we're grateful to be recognized among global leaders in workplace culture. With that, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a review of our financials and guidance. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chris.  Before I review our first quarter 2024 results and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2024, I would like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. First quarter revenue of $500 million was up 11% over the comparable prior year period. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $492 million for the first quarter of 2024, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 11% from the comparable prior year period. We delivered strong net income and adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2024 with GAAP net income of $247 million, or $4.37 per diluted share based on approximately 57 million shares.  Included in our GAAP results is a onetime noncash stock compensation benefit of $118 million related to the forfeiture of the 2020 CEO performance award. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $147 million,, or $2.59 per diluted share. First quarter adjusted EBITDA of nearly $230 million was better than expected, primarily due to higher revenue and expense discipline and represented a margin of 45.9% for the quarter. During the first quarter, we paid over $21 million in cash dividends. And earlier this week, the Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-June.  We still have approximately $796 million remaining under our buyback authorization as of March 31, 2024. Adjusted R&D expense was $45 million in the first quarter of 2024, or 9% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $71 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $55 million in the prior year period. We continue to invest in our long-term future growth in areas of automation, AI and international. Our tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 15% on a GAAP basis, reflecting the benefit of the forfeiture of the 2020 CEO performance award during the quarter. For Q2 and the full year 2024, we anticipate our effective income tax rates to be approximately 33% and 22%, respectively, on a GAAP basis.  We estimate Q2 and full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 25%. Quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rates are generally due to the timing of stock compensation vesting and related tax effects. For the remainder of 2024, we expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $33 million per quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $371 million and no debt. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024, up 8% year-over-year. On the capital expenditure front, our fifth building in Oklahoma City is substantially complete and will be placed into service in the second quarter. While we continue to estimate total CapEx as a percent of revenues to be approximately 12% in 2024, we also expect that percentage to decline beginning in 2025. Now let me turn to guidance. For fiscal 2024, we are maintaining our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges with revenue expected to be in the range of $1.860 billion to $1.885 billion, or approximately 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range.  We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $720 million to $730 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range. We remain on track with the full year plan we put in place at the beginning of the year and are beginning to see positive responses from our strategic initiatives. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect total revenues in the range of $434 million to $438 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 9% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in the range of $151 million to $155 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35% at the midpoint of the range.  We continue to focus our efforts on executing on our plan and building momentum. We have a differentiated product, an industry-leading value proposition and a solid foundation to build upon. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Two quick questions. One for you or for the two of you, Chad and Chris. If you think about the strategic initiatives that you're kind of talking about, can you frame them in the -- how does it compare to what -- first of all, what are you doing there? Maybe you can be more specific. And then also how does it compare to -- or kind of relate to what you see in the market in terms of end demand, headwinds from less new hiring, et cetera? Just frame it a little bit like what's going on in the market versus what's going on with you? And then my follow-up question is for Craig. Can you speak to the benefits or extra benefits you might see from less rate cuts this year? Is that kind of helping you? Or how does it play into the model? Chad Richison : Sure. So I'll take the first one, Raimo. And so our client value achievement strategy or as you called it, the strategic initiatives that we're working throughout the year really have to do with meeting clients where they live and making sure that they're achieving the full value of ROI that's available to them through the appropriate usage of our software. And so we've been focused on that. We did call that out in October 31, actually, when we reported, we did call out that we're going to be really focused on that. All of those initiatives are in efforts to continue to drive improvements in retention, and again, be able to set clients up to achieve full value because we do have additional products for many of these clients that can really help them out once they're utilizing the product correctly that we've already implemented. And I'm going to say that's in regards to our current client base. From a new client base perspective, we're focused on our sales initiatives. And those have been unchanged as we move throughout the year as far as what our focus is there. Craig Boelte : Sure. And Raimo, on the rate cuts, I mean, obviously, that changes every day as to how many there might be, but it seems like there may be less than we had originally thought. So that is a benefit towards the end of the year. But the one thing we're also looking at is do we try to extend the duration of some of those funds. And when you do that, you're trading off some of that -- those higher rates. Effectively, you're taking 2 or 3 rate cuts if you do that. So that's kind of what we're looking at strategically with those funds. Operator : Your next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Mason Marion : This is Mason Marion on for Samad. So looking at your guidance, can you kind of elaborate on what you're seeing from a churn new bookings perspective and how -- and the assumptions that you have for those in your guidance? Chad Richison : You sound exactly like Samad. So churn, new bookings POB assumption. What is the -- I'm trying to can you maybe -- can you say that question again? Mason Marion : I'm just trying to better understand what you're factoring in to your 2Q assumptions and maybe for the back half of the year around what you think from a new bookings perspective, from a churn perspective? Chad Richison : Yes, stability. I mean from a new bookings perspective, we are seeing improvement in that. Retention is something that we call out at the end of the year, but all of our initiatives that we're working through our client value achievement are set to have an impact on that, and we feel good about how that's working. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Marcon of Baird. Mark Marcon : Chad, I was wondering if you could talk just a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of variance, in terms of sales performance across the various offices. You did mention that you've got one quota carrier that achieved over $4 million, and so that obviously seems very strong. But on the other hand, we've had a little bit of a deceleration with regards to the revenue growth rate. And so I'm just wondering, when you talk to your sales leaders, and you obviously made some changes there, what are they seeing out in the market? How much more difficult is it to get new sales? There have been some investors that have been asking about saturation in the mid-market. And I'm wondering what your perspective is with regards to that. Chad Richison : Yes. And so I guess, first, I would say, I mean, our best offices are going to have the best managers regardless of geography. And I think there for a couple of years, Tulsa was #1, and it's a city of 400,000 people. We've been in that city for 22, 23 years. So your best office is going to have your best manager. From a saturation perspective, that's -- no, there's no such thing as saturation in the mid-market. I mean you've had the same players for a long period of time. We're all very competitive in the market. We have about 5% of the total addressable market available to us. And so no, I wouldn't say it's from a saturation perspective. It comes from an appropriate management, appropriate training and appropriate leadership. And as we've gone through the year, we've gotten better and better and can call out that we are having accelerated sales if you look at the last 2 months of this year versus the first 2 months of this year from a bookings perspective. And that's not to say that the first 2 months were bad, it's just to say that we are getting better and better at how we move product. Mark Marcon : That's great. And can you talk a little bit about what you're doing with regards to the internal sales group that typically does the upsells? How are you structuring commissions? Is there still a mandate that new clients have to have Beti? And where do you stand with the Beti penetration within the existing client base? Chad Richison : Yes. So there's no change with what the CRR groups have been doing. They've been making significant impacts for us and the client value achieving the strategy. Again, meeting clients where they are today, making sure they're receiving full value of using the system that they've already purchased before we move forward. Selling them additional products, they've done a good job with that. There's no change as far as what their focus is from that, but we are seeing the positive impacts from them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. Camden Levy : This is Camden Levy sitting in for Brian Schwartz. My question is around sales capacity. How do you guys feel about the quota carrying like sales capacity of the business? And are there any plans to increase the number of sales offices in the second half of this year or early 2025? And then just additionally, thinking about just the pipeline momentum, is there anything you guys can provide qualitatively about how the pipeline is building in 2024? I know you guys had mentioned stability, but any other commentary regarding how that's building? Chad Richison : Yes. So first around sales capacity. Our sales capacity numbers, again, have gotten a lot more improved, I would say, over the last 2 or 3 months from that perspective. It would be too early to say exactly when we would be opening up additional offices because, as you know, we take a current manager that's successful, relocate them to a new territory to open up an office and then we backfill them with salespeople who are ready to be sales managers. And so how quick we're able to -- how quick we are able to open up additional offices is really dependent upon that backfill bench and how we are doing there. And so we've continued to have success building that out, but also key for us is we have 55 sales teams right now and it's making sure that all of those are performing at top levels. And that's a focus that we've had going throughout 2024. Commentary on pipeline. Pipelines are very strong. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly of Needham. Joshua Reilly : Can you give us a sense how is the preemployment services revenue trending for the year relative to your maybe expectations leading into the year? And remind us how correlated is that revenue stream to job switching versus any other factors that we should be considering there? Chad Richison : Our unemployment services are stable, is the way I would categorize that. They've been stable. They're somewhat going to be a reflection of the new clients that you bring on as well as the current client trends.  Yes, I mean I would say that increased -- if you do -- I'm not saying we're seeing this, I'm just saying if a company did have increased turnover, then they would have -- especially if they're set up for new hire background checks, then they're going to have to work those, obviously. We don't have any of that to call out from an additional employees leaving clients and going to others any more so than what it's been in the past. Again, there was a period of time during COVID, we're seeing that is happening maybe a little bit more than what you would see in times like today. But we don't have anything to call out significant to that product. Joshua Reilly : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. The revenue guidance implies a little more of maybe a second half reacceleration in growth than what we were previously expecting. Can you just give us a sense of what gives you the confidence or visibility to that revenue growth reaccelerating in the second half? Craig Boelte : Yes. So a lot of the initiatives that we had and we talked about last November and fourth quarter really were front-end loaded. And so that's really what we saw even going into the Q2 guide, is those were more front-end loaded and then we would expect once we get through some of those, we would see a reacceleration in the back half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Enders of Citi. Steven Enders : Okay. Great. I guess maybe to dig into the guide a little bit more. It seems like sales performance has improved the past couple of months or at least better than first couple of months. And I guess with rate environments maybe staying in a little bit higher, I guess, would have expected maybe a little bit better of a guide here. So I guess, is there kind of like any change in assumptions? Or maybe help me kind of think through why the guide has been maintained versus maybe some of the green shoots that would impact that? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean our guidance for 2024, I mean, it included -- I mean, we gave this guidance for the first time, we've given -- we had talked about what we were going to do. I think it was October 31 of last year. And so the guidance at that time included our many organic initiatives that were designed to set us up for 2025. And so we've been sticking with those disciplines and time lines. And we've said, I mean, even at the beginning of this year that it would be back-end loaded because of the many both client value achievement strategies as well as the work that the CRRs and the other groups are performing. And so we've been focused on that. And as we go into any quarter, we're focused on maintaining what we believe are going to make the largest impact on the client base to help them achieve the greatest ROI so we can go forward. I've said it many times that it's a lot easier to sell a client an additional product and to get them to actually use it. And we've implemented several strategies to make sure that clients are able to utilize and achieve a full client ROI in value before we sell them another product and in many cases, before we even will build them, even though we've sold it. We want to make sure they're utilizing the product before we even build them. And so these are some initiatives that have delayed certain revenue opportunities for us, but they set us up for those things as well. And so that's been important for us to continue to focus on that and really meet every client where they're living so that we can help bring them through the rest of the Paycom journey. Steven Enders : Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just to slip another one in here, I guess, maybe to ask it differently. Just I guess if we think about the guide today versus 90 days ago, like maybe how are some of the underlying assumptions different today than they were before? Chad Richison : They're not. They're not changed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of UBS. Kevin McVeigh : Great. I don't know if you said it on the call. If you did, I missed it. How much stock did you buy back in the quarter? Craig Boelte : Yes. We didn't call it out on the call. It was a small amount, I think like $3 million. Kevin McVeigh : $3 million. Okay, great. And then it seems like the margins really overperformed. Was that a function of maybe not being able to hire certain folks you wanted to or just better expense management? And how should we think about that, if possible, over the balance of the year? Craig Boelte : I would say better expense management for the quarter. I mean we've given the full year adjusted EBITDA guidance. We'll continue to look throughout the model for efficiencies. I mean yes, right now, we're like 39% adjusted EBITDA margins. And so still best-in-class and looking at additional efficiencies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Ryan Krieger : It's Ryan Krieger on for Alex. So first one, just to touch on margins again. You kind of previously talked about leaving a little bit of room for potential incremental investment this year. So I'm just curious what are the top investment priorities that, that optionality could be earmarked for? And then on customer cohorts, can you just give us a quick update on kind of the down-market attrition that you were seeing last quarter and how the upmarket cohorts are performing now? Craig Boelte : Yes. So on the cost side, I mean, obviously, we've continued to spend aggressively in the R&D area as we announced the launch of Ireland this quarter. So  that's one area that we're continuing to spend heavily on. And then obviously, the one that you can pull some levers on would be the sales -- or the marketing side of the sales and marketing. Chad Richison : And from a customer attrition standpoint, we did call out last quarter when we reported retention, the impact that the small business group, which we got into really in 2020 that, that had on our retention rate. We're not calling out any -- updating the retention rate today other than to say, I don't -- and again, the small business represents 3.5% of our overall revenue-ish. So -- but I don't know that you would necessarily see anything that would have changed the impacts with the small business, and they're just traditional ways of attrition. And again, I'm talking about the small business portion of our revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Phillip Leytes : It's Phil on for Siti. I just wanted to ask, it sounds like you guys are heavily investing into the product to several enhancements. What are some key features that you're working on? And when can we maybe hear more about them? Chad Richison : Yes. So we did roll out GONE fourth quarter, and we continue to put people on that. From an automation perspective, I mean, we've got several things rolling out throughout this year. We don't disclose what we're developing and/or what we've done until it's actually out in the market. But we're having a lot of success in product and really around automation. That's very important, and I believe that's wins. I mean it's 2024. And to think that any company would buy or implement a system, whereby the payroll department inputs and imports data to do the payroll, I mean, it's crazy. I mean if a company wants to do that, they might as well drive to their office throwing money out the window and run every stoplight because they don't care about liability. I mean to me, it's all going to automation. That's what's important. That's how you do something, consistency the same way and actually achieve value. And so that's what we're doing over in product. I did call out on the call that we did put out more product this quarter than we had the 2 previous quarters combined, and we're just accelerating from there. So it is an exciting time to be in product because you're able to really utilize technology today to make an impact. And I believe we've been at the forefront of that, and we're accelerating it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Levine of TD Cowen. Jared Levine : My first question, how should we think about the sequential headwind to 2Q revenue growth from the annual form filings revenue recorded in 1Q? Chad Richison : There wouldn't be any headwinds there into Q2. Craig Boelte : Not in the Q2... Chad Richison : Sequential drop. Oh, sequential drop, I mean, I don't know that, that sequential drop versus last year, is that -- I don't know if they have... James Samford : [indiscernible]. Chad Richison : Yes. Christopher Thomas : Obviously, it's factored into our outlook. And as far as the sequential drop, we'll see there. And then as we probably could comment on forms filings, we're in line with expectations. Chad Richison : Yes. But we have called out for the last 7, 8 years that over time, the percent of the quarter that your forms filings would have, the percent of revenue that it would represent over time is going to be lower and lower because we've added additional products and additional services. But we really haven't added anything to our year-end forms filing. I mean it's been substantially the same service types. We added one thing to it in 2016, and that was the ACA form. But other than that, it's been the exact same services since 1998. And so it represented a larger percentage for us in revenue during the first quarter can go way back. And then over time, that percentage has dropped, not because it's going down or we're charging less, but because of the other fees, services and additional products now that just represent a larger percentage of that revenue for the quarter. Jared Levine : Okay. And then as my follow-up, any reason why you cannot shift towards PEPM-based pricing for payroll? And is this something that you've considered or you anticipate considering in the future? Chad Richison : We don't comment on specific pricing initiatives in regard to competitive situations. All that's to say is we're looking to win every deal. And that's the mode that we're in right now. I know I have our sales organization listening to this call, and they know that. We're looking to win every deal. And so that includes all the initiatives that would go into that. So I would just stop with that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Zane Meehan : Great. This is Zane Meehan on for Jason Celino. I wanted to ask quickly about the competitive environment. Any notable changes you're seeing there? And maybe any particular strength or weakness you're seeing in any specific verticals or end markets? Chad Richison : No. I wouldn't say there's been change in competitive market. I mean it's always been competitive always. And any time I've been asked about this, I've said it's been competitive. I do think that there's differentiating strategies out there. And I like ours when it comes to automation and really being able to utilize the employee base to leverage that ROI, which they're the ones that care the most about their check and what's happening to their financial situation and hours and health insurance and everything else individually because it impacts them the most. So we've been able to leverage that. We've made that shift. We've been leaning into that. To some extent, our messaging around that as we made that shift could have been better. And I think that we've corrected course on that as we work with every client to move them toward that. From a go-to-market perspective though, that's why clients, companies are calling us. I mean they get to the point of how many back-end people can they hire and even do this work and then correct at all. And so we do have the best process. People are trusting it more and more, as more and more companies have been deploying Beti. Every client deployed Beti since July of 2021, new client that we've brought on, and they've had a lot of success with both that product as well as the suite of products that goes around it as well. And then now we've announced GONE. I mean the amount of time that managers in a company spend on managing PTO is just incredible. And 50% of all PTO requests in the U.S., over 50% of them are approved after the PTO has already been paid. It's already been taken and paid. So people aren't managing it. And 19 states require you to pay it out when someone leaves. And so that's just one category, but what I'm saying is there's ROI available to our clients everywhere, and it's important that we meet them where they're at currently and be able to display that throughout our sales calls. We've gotten better and better at that as we've continued to re-enhance our training -- sales training programs as well as our go-to-market strategies and lead generation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Bhavin Shah : And two for me. The first one, just, Chad, can you just maybe talk about the promotion of Amy Walker as the Head of Sales at the beginning of the quarter. Can you just elaborate on [ season ]? And any changes to the go-to-market strategy that we should expect over the coming quarters or years? Chad Richison : Yes. We changed our go-to-market strategy. I mean Amy was running -- Amy got promoted to run outside sales in late November, and then she took over all of sales not long over that. And so we started shifting our go-to-market strategies, enhancing, I would say. I wouldn't say shift, I would say enhancing our go-to-market strategies, especially in regards to the outside sales group, which represents the overwhelming majority of all of our sales. And so she's had a dramatic impact on that group. And we continue to improve week after week with that. Bhavin Shah : Got it. And then Craig, can you just maybe help quantify some of the headwinds that you guys are seeing for revenue from your strategic initiatives whether it's less paper control due -- I mean, let's payroll runs through to Beti or even some of the other clients success measures that you talked about today that are kind of impacting revenue? Craig Boelte : I mean what we talked about was some of those less runs because of Beti. I mean Beti is making it more efficient for clients in eliminating some of that. And I mean that's better for the client. In the end, that's really a better process for the client, a better situation for the client. So we call that out that we would start to -- we're starting to see those. And most of those are going to -- a lot of those are going to run through the first half of this year. And then towards the back half of the year, we won't see as large of an impact. Chad Richison : And a lot of that corresponds to how we're working with our current clients as well in regards to utilization of Beti. Operator : Our final question today comes from Daniel Jester of BMO. Daniel Jester : Great. Maybe to revisit the sort of innovation and R&D kind of theme that came up a couple of times. I guess when you look at your customer base today, where is the least automation in the workflows? Is there any sense of where there's like the easiest ROI for you to come in and offer some additional automation in the product? Chad Richison : There are so many places that we can go in our product and really automate full items that were multiple steps before. It again takes appropriate client configuration. It takes a client's ability to have a mind of change management because it is different than what they've done before. It takes some trust because you are giving up some level of control when you turn it over to AI, and you have to prove that out. And so there are certain ways that you can work with clients and help prove that out. And so it's everywhere. I mean in answer to your question, it's everywhere. And we've been working on that. I've been working over in product and we've been having an exciting time doing it. And the world's our oyster right now in regards to that. I believe we've always been the leader in  what's new and innovation. And we have opportunities to continue to accelerate that, especially now that we're all focused in the same model from a product development perspective. Daniel Jester : Okay. Great. And then I apologize if this came up earlier, I joined a little bit late. But on sort of the globalization of Paycom, I think you're in 4 countries from a payroll perspective now. Is there any way that you can sort of quantify the amount of penetration that you've gotten? And I know Ireland is brand-new, but can you help us think about sort of what the uptake has been thus far as you've gone more global? Or is there a certain threshold that you need to see before you'll be able to share some more context with us about that opportunity? Chad Richison : Sure. And so separating two things. First, I would want to separate our global HCM product from the native payroll developments that we've done. So from a global HCM product perspective, we have clients that are utilizing that product globally on the HCM side that are not running international payroll through our system, but they're getting value through the HR side of our system by using our global HCM product. Now in regards to that, you also have clients that are utilizing the native payroll and Beti that we have in the countries of Canada, Mexico, the U.K. and now, Ireland. I believe we've put out Canada, I want to say, July of last year maybe. And so that was the very first one that we've done. And I would say well inside of 12 months, we've completed 3 more. We didn't start with the easiest. And there's still a couple of hard ones out there, I can tell you that. We are developing the areas where our U.S.-based clients have the largest number of employees. And then kind of as we look internationally, we are able to really look at -- if you look at it from a whole, we believe that 20-or-so countries, I believe it's actually around 18 represent over 80% of the opportunity available to us. And so we've continued to focus on those. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Chad Richison for closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. Well, thank you for joining our call today. I do want to acknowledge and celebrate our 10th anniversary as a publicly traded company. I want to thank all employees who have contributed to our success and set us up for the next decade of innovation and growth. Over the next couple of months, we'll be attending the Needham Conference in New York on May 14, the Jefferies Conference in Newport on May 29 and presenting at the Baird Conference in New York on June 6. We look forward to engaging with many of you again soon. Operator, you may end the call. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's CEO and President. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I'll focus my comments on the progress we are making on our 2024 initiatives, and then I'll turn it over to Craig, who will review our financials and guidance before taking questions. This year, we remain focused on providing world-class service to our clients, solidifying client ROI achievement, and deepening our automation capabilities through product innovation. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making on these client focused initiatives as they are resonating across our client base. As a result of our initiatives, our client usage metrics and our net promoter score are up and trending positively. Beyond that, I'm very pleased with our achievements on the product front. We continue to lead the industry in automation. Our clients consistently confirm this view. We continue to eclipse our functionality with even greater automation as we rapidly move towards full solution automation. The enhancements we made to our development processes at the end of 2023 enabled us to transform our solutions even faster. Year-to-date, we have more than doubled our development productivity rates and implemented functionality for our clients that eliminates redundant payroll and HR work through automation and employee usage. We are rapidly eclipsing the industry by delivering a fundamentally differentiated value proposition for our clients, which ultimately results in a better employee experience. We are focused on continuing to automate the most automated solution in the industry. Two examples of automation in our industry are Beti and GONE. Every month, millions of checks are processed directly by employees using Beti, delivering our clients measurable ROI through this truly unique solution. One example is an existing client who has been with us for six years. This is a 2,500 employee company that recently adopted Beti. Since allowing their employees to do their own payroll, they reduced their payroll team by half, going from a process that took roughly four days before Beti to merely hours with Beti. Beti continues to evolve and raise the bar as we add more functionality and connections to solve complex decisioning. And we are seeing increased inbound inquiries from prospective clients. GONE, the industry's first fully automated time-off solution was recently recognized as a global award winner for transforming the time-off process. It connects highly complex traditionally disparate solutions and leverages decisioning logic to automatically approve, deny, or warehouse employee time-off requests. Time-off decisions are a hassle for everyone within an organization unless you use GONE. Thanks to GONE, employees get immediate decisions and managers gain back time and increase scheduling visibility. HR and payroll no longer have to track down managers to verify and decision requests and GONE significantly reduces after the FAC liabilities and related costs. The C-suite benefits from increased confidence in operations and resource management, driving improved productivity and reducing liability. We have a retail client with over 100 stores where each manager's controlled time-off requests differently. The client enabled GONE and built unique rules per store to ensure each manager was in control of their appropriate coverage. Now these managers no longer need to take direct action on request. And when the payroll team is prepping payroll, they've eliminated the need for all follow-ups. Their payroll manager stated, GONE took Beti to the next level. Since implementing GONE, this client has automated over 1,000 time-off decisions, bringing up hours of non-productive time. I'm very excited about GONE and its ability to streamline time-off requests for the businesses across the globe. Through solution automation, we are helping our clients eliminate decision fatigue across the entire organization. From the C-Suite to HR and from managers to employees. This in turn creates better employee retention and engagement for all organizations. We are meeting the expectations of today's employees and once they've experienced Paycom, they don't want to go backwards in technology. In fact, we are seeing more and more returning clients as both user buyers and employees are missing the automation that is lacking in disparate and antiquated competitor solutions they had deployed. At the end of the day, the best product will win and we are furthering our product advantage. We continue to leverage AI across a wide variety of areas within our organization. We believe our AI approach toward full solution automation will continue to deliver even stronger ROI, value, and functionality for our clients. On the international front, we continue to make meaningful progress in the geographies that we rolled out in the last 12 months. Beti is now available for employees in Canada, Mexico, Ireland, and the UK. We continue to win new clients with domestic and foreign employees, thanks to our investments in our global HCM product and our native international payroll. On the sell-side, we are seeing strong momentum. Our new outside sales reps are winning more deals earlier than ever before and we've sold significantly more units in 2024 than we did this same time last year. Just this month, we had our top sales week in company history. Sales is energized and last week, we added our largest sales class of new reps placing 67 sales reps in the field across the country. I'm excited about the enthusiasm across our sales division heading into the back half of the year. To sum up, I'm pleased with the progress we are making with our product strategy and with our strategic initiatives. The investments we are making in 2024 and our focus on client value achievement are designed to deliver long-term value to our clients and their employees, which will in turn deliver value to Paycom and its stockholders. With that, let me turn it over to Craig. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our second quarter 2024 results and our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2024, I'd like to say a few words about my future plans here at Paycom. I joined this incredible company nearly 19 years ago and had the privilege of shepherding the company from a few million dollars of revenue to one approaching $2 billion in revenues. It has been a career that has surpassed all of my dreams and I want to thank Chad for bringing me in as a partner in this journey. As a new grandfather, it is time for me to prepare for my next chapter and I'm announcing my plan to retire from my role as CFO sometime in the next nine to 12 months. And after that, I expect to remain with Paycom in an advisory role. With that, let's dig into Q2 results by reminding everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. Second quarter revenue of $438 million came in at the top end of our range and was up 9% over the comparable prior year period. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $430 million for the second quarter of 2024, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing 9% from the comparable prior year period. GAAP net income in the quarter was $68 million, or $1.20 per diluted share based on approximately 56.8 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $92 million or $1.62 per diluted share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA of nearly $160 million, or 36.5% margin was better than expected, primarily due to expense discipline in the quarter. We continue to aggressively invest in areas of AI, automation, international expansion, and our value proposition for the client. Adjusted R&D expense was $55 million in the second quarter of 2024, or 14% of total revenues. Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion were $81 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $61 million in the prior year period. We are building more automation on the most automated platform in the industry, which should continue to distance us from the rest of the competition. For Q3 and full year 2024, we anticipate our effective income tax rates to be approximately 28% and 23% respectively on a GAAP basis. We estimate Q3 and full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 26%. For the remainder of 2024, we expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $30 million per quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $346 million and no debt. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.4 billion in the second quarter of 2024, up 8% year-over-year. During the second quarter and into July, the valuation of our stock dropped below that of slower growth and lower margin peers. We opportunistically took advantage of the low stock price to repurchase approximately 790,000 shares between April 1 and July 31 for $120 million. Since July 1 of last year, we have repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares, representing approximately 4% of total shares outstanding. Nearly 2 million of that has been repurchased since November of last year. Earlier this week, we increased our buyback authorization to $1.5 billion and extended it for another two year period. We will continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock if and when we see dislocations in valuation relative to our peers. During the second quarter of 2024, we paid over $21 million in cash dividends and earlier this week, the Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-September. Now, let me turn to guidance. We continue to execute on several strategic initiatives and remain on plan to achieve the 10% growth and 39% adjusted EBITDA margin that we guided to at the beginning of this year. For fiscal 2024, now that we have more visibility into the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our revenue guidance range with revenue expected to be in the range of $1,860 million to $1,875 million or approximately 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We are raising our expected adjusted EBITDA range to $727 million to $737 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect total revenues in the range of $444 million to $449 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 10% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $155 million to $159 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35% at the midpoint of the range. We have a strong balance sheet, strong free cash flow, and significant liquidity. We will continue to invest in areas that will bolster our competitive position and strengthen our client ROI through automation and the user experience. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. You may proceed. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thank you. And Craig, all the best. Well, I guess we still have a few quarters. My question is around Beti. Chad, in your prepared remarks, you talked about increased inbound like, can you talk a little bit about the perception that Beti now has in your installed base and I'm thinking about the whole installed base and how it's turning into like a sales tool as the industry is understanding the benefit of that for its own business, but also for the employee base? Thank you. Chad Richison : Sure. And so new clients, and everyone by the way, everybody does get a question and a follow-up. He didn't necessarily state that on the call, but Raimo, what's happening with new clients coming in, that's why they're coming in to use it. I mean, they're coming to Paycom to actually utilize Beti. I did talk about a client on the call who had been with us for six years. They have 2,500 employees, they implemented Beti and they were able to reduce their payroll department by half and it went from four days for them working on payroll to mere hours. And so within our client base, we continue to meet clients where they are today as we work our client value achievement strategy to help them maximize the most ROI with where they are today. And then as far as new clients coming on, it's been no change. I did talk about on the call how we've had more unit sales this year than what we have in the past. And so our sales staff is doing really good in our go-to-market as well. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Perfect. And if I -- now that I'm allowed to follow up like may I squeeze one in? You talked about the sales reps that were added this quarter like a record number. How do you think about that cadence on the hiring side, especially on sales? If you think about what you're seeing in your installed base and you think about the economy, like how do you think that will progress? Thank you and congrats from me. Chad Richison : Yeah. So we're better staffed in sales than what we've been in probably five or six years. And what I mean by that is having all teams with the sales manager in it fully staffed and then just the number of staff that we have on each. And so, Amy Walker took over sales and had been with us for 14 years prior to that. She took over sales in April and since that time has really got them in a position, us in a position on the sell-side where we're strong from a staffing perspective and again, our sales tactics and techniques to be able to go out there and even sell more as we're differentiated in the industry. Operator : The next question is from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. You may proceed. Samad Samana : All right. Thank you. And Craig, congrats on becoming a new grandfather, it's exciting news. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Samad Samana : So maybe I'll start with you or for either one of you, but just as I think about the narrowing of the guidance outlook, what assumptions changed or what did you experience and what are you tweaking to get to that new narrow range? Is it a change in new business assumptions? Is it a change in CRR bookings retention? Just help us understand the mechanics of the change going forward, especially considering that 2Q came in a little bit better than you expected. Craig Boelte : Yeah. I mean as we came into the year, I mean our plan had a wide range of initiatives and opportunities. And the high range had assumptions depending on some timing and the magnitude of some of those initiatives. So some of it was timing and now that we have more visibility during the year and it's progressed, we're going to narrow that range. Samad Samana : Understood. And then maybe, Chad, if I could follow up on Raimo's question about the sales hiring and you talked about capacity. Should we think about that as maybe a leading indicator, the hiring that you just did in terms of what you're seeing in the market, either opportunity increasing and new hiring behind that, or is this hiring in anticipation of? Just maybe help us understand what type of signal that suggests, especially because we haven't really gotten an update on office opening disclosures in a while and this seems like a pretty important development. Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean I would say that I've always felt like we've had the best sales organization. I think having the best products part of that. We focus very hard on sales this year. We were very focused on it and what we wanted to accomplish with it. And being fully staffed does allow us to get to the opportunity to be able to open up offices, again, when it's right for us. Right now, we're really focused on unit growth and sales skills development. In second quarter, we sold 24% more units than what we had sold second quarter of the previous year. That's but one data point that Amy just took over in April. So that's helping. And being staffed really helps with that. The more people that you're staffed with, the more you're going to sell. And so we're having a lot of success right now with the sales group and staffing is a big part of that. Operator : The next question is from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. You may proceed. Mark Marcon : Hey. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. And let me add my congrats, Craig, that's huge in terms of being a grandpa. Not really. Craig Boelte : Thank you. Mark Marcon : So I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the investments that you're making, Chad. Can you talk a little bit about, the investments behind service as well as R&D. And specifically, I'm looking at the gross margins and trying to think through. You've ramped up the investments. It sounds like the NPS scores are going up as a result. How should we think about the further pace of the investments both in terms of cost of service as well as R&D and how that's going to unfold over the course of the year? And then I've got a follow-up. Chad Richison : Yeah, Mark. I'll take the gross margin part of that question. One thing on the gross margins, like you mentioned, is a headcount. But this quarter, we brought our fifth building at Corporate Online. And so we saw an increase in the depreciation both on the building and on the equipment and furniture and fixtures as it related to that building. So part of that gross margin was the additional depreciation, which also hit other lines of depreciation in the income statement. Craig Boelte : And I'll kind of add on to that. I mean, from a hiring perspective in operations, I mean we're hiring. So we're open for business. We're hiring there. And again, we only have 5% of the market. We have a differentiated product. We're focused on our sales methods. We're focused on our service and of course, heavily, heavily focused on product, which leads to our R&D expense. I know that, that jumped up in there in the second quarter, but that's because we're putting out a lot of product. As I said on the call, we've put out twice as much a product release of this past month than we did in January. And January was also a good month for product releases. And so, we sell our product. I mean, our products where all our values derived from our clients. And so it's just very important that we're always focusing on that. We have very ambitious goals in regard to our product as well. And so -- but we're also mindful of our spend and we're mindful of having quality revenue that generates a strong bottom line. And so all that's included when we go through this for what we're going to budget and spend. Mark Marcon : Great. And then it sounds like, I mean, with a 24% increase in terms of units sold so far year-to-date, is that part of the reason why we would anticipate seeing an acceleration with regards to the revenue growth in Q3 relative to Q2? Just wondering how baked in is that as opposed to hoping for additional incremental sales from the new salespeople. Chad Richison : Sure. So let me correct one thing, 24% is the unit growth for the second quarter over prior second quarter. Year-to-date, we're about 15% in unit growth, I was just making the point since Amy has taken over. Now I will say, so far for third quarter starts, July starts, which are always the largest of a quarter. Your first quarter month is the largest revenue of any quarter. Our July starts are up 40% from a revenue perspective. And so again, these are about one data point, but it's from where we're starting. And we get to start with the best product, we get to start with the best sales training and we get to start with the best service model. And so for us, it's a continuation of work in our 2024 plan into next year. Operator : The next question is from the line of Joshua Reilly with Needham. You may proceed. Joshua Reilly : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to understand better with the better new customer activity, but the lower -- the high-end of the guidance is slightly lower. How should we think about the impact from the payment -- the extra run for payroll runs revenue coming out of the model? Has that been in line with your expectations? I just wanted to understand if there's any other impact to the high-end of the guidance. Thank you. Chad Richison : Yeah. I would say all of the current client factors that we discussed even at the end of 2023, those still exist today as far as additional payroll run opportunities and inefficiencies gained when someone uses our product correctly. And so all those factors continue to exist, but we also have many mitigating factors that we're able to guess and pull the levers on. And again, we have a lot of confidence in what's going on with both our sales organization, our service organization and of course, our product with what gives us confidence as we head into the end of this year and then as well as 2025. Joshua Reilly : Got it. And then last quarter, you discussed getting better utilization of modules that have already been sold to customers. Any update there in terms of getting customers to maybe utilize the modules that have already been sold at a faster pace than what was -- we've seen over the last year? Thank you. Chad Richison : And so yes, anytime we focus on something, we're going to have some results from that. We've been focused all year on the client value achievement strategy, which does include meeting clients where they are and helping them achieve that ROI. It's impacting our service model from a positive and it's impacting our net promoter scores. And those are commitments that we're not going to be backing off of. Operator : The next question is from the line of Steven Enders with Citi. You may proceed. Steven Enders : Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question there. I guess maybe just kind of pull it on the last couple of lines of questioning. Just how is kind of the back to base motion kind of trending? And I guess on the back of what sounds like solid new units coming on board. Just how are you feeling about that back to base motion and kind of what that's implying for the growth outlook versus what you were expecting before? Chad Richison : Yeah. My opinions on that haven't really changed. I mean, it's very important for us to meet each client where they're at and make sure that they're utilizing the product to get the full value of it. And we're still very focused on that. I mean, you look throughout the history of Paycom, we sold a lot of product and it's very important that clients are utilizing it the right way to get ROI out of it. There's a lot of things we're also working on in product and developing and releasing that also helps with that. And so, it's not like we've abandoned working with clients to be able to help them purchase new modules from us that can help them drive that ROI. But we have changed the game a little bit in making sure that we're doing our part to make sure that clients are achieving the level of ROI needed for their satisfaction. And so that really hasn't changed for us as far as what we're doing throughout 2024 and what we're focused on here. Steven Enders : Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess maybe is there an update on kind of a Beti penetration or adoption so far from versus the last disclosure? Chad Richison : Yeah. It continues to go up every month. I mean, we're adding -- again, we're adding more and more clients in each client that starts, they're starting with greater Beti usage than we have in the past. And so -- and those that are using it and have been using it, it continues to go up. And so with good technology that's easy to use, usage continues to move forward. Of course, we do have a percent of our client base still that may not be receiving the full benefit that it may have to offer at this point just because it's not the right time for them or what have you or it doesn't fit specifically with their initiatives. And so those clients were meeting them where they live. And sometimes they do come on. Again, I talked on the call about a 2,500-employee company that finally said yes, it did reduce their labor cost in regards to working the payroll system by half and they went from four days of working on payroll to merely hours. So that's available to everyone out there. But again, we're servicing clients where they are right now today and that's what we're focused on. And we'll move forward with clients on their timeline, not ours. And then when it comes to new prospects coming in, we want them to receive the full value that we have to offer so that they can achieve that ROI, which is available only through Beti for new clients. Operator : The next question is from the line of Kevin McVeigh with UBS. You may proceed. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. [Technical Difficulty] Chad Richison : [Technical Difficulty] database count from that perspective. So -- and we're furthering Beti as well. I mean, Beti is not the same product it was at the first of the year than what it is today. And so we're continuing to advance all of our solution with automation. Kevin McVeigh : Great. And then with the extended buyback, is there any way to think about the approach around that? Just relative to there's been some obviously variability over the last year or so, just any thoughts moving forward as to pace or progression of the buyback? Craig E. Boelte: Yeah. No, I mean, as we mentioned on the call, I mean, we bought back a significant amount of shares and we actually bought back 574,000 just during Q3 in a large amount since July 1st. So really an opportunistic approach to the buyback. And we were -- the other one was about to expire, so we put this one in-place for another two years at $1.5 billion. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. You may proceed. Phillip Leytes : Hi. This is Phil on for Siti. You guys mentioned you added Beti in Canada, Mexico, Ireland, and the UK. Are there plans to add Beti to other countries? Chad Richison : Yes. As we develop them and as you know, certain countries have certain factors that go into their unemployment law. So -- but as we develop these countries, absolutely, we would expect that to be happening. Phillip Leytes : Well, thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed. Zane Meehan : Great. Thanks. This is Zane Meehan on for Jason Celino. Just one from me on the uptick in the EBITDA margin guide, nice to see that moving up by 50 bps. Just wanted to ask what's driving that increase and where you might be getting more efficient in the next or in the second half of the year? Thanks. Craig Boelte : Yeah. I mean, we kind of look across the entire organization and just look for efficiencies. I mean there's no levers we're really trying to pull to do that. And really it was the second-quarter be really flowing through to the full year and then raising it on top of that. So really nothing that we're pulling any levers for. Zane Meehan : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. You may proceed. Ryan Krieger : Hey, guys. This is Ryan on for Alex Zukin. Just one question on the CRR teams. So can you just provide an update on where the CRR teams were focused in the quarter? Are you still structuring commissions towards Beti conversions of the base and system usage or are they starting to lean more back into the upsell, cross-sell motions? And to the extent that they are still focused on the Beti conversions, when could we see them kind of shift back to the upsell, cross sell focus? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean for competitive reasons, I mean, I'm not going to get into exactly what a CRR's process is today that's different than what it was last year. But I will say that, to a CRR, they work with each client, and not every client is in the same situation, which means a CRR's approach isn't the same as they go into their entire territory, if you will. And so it really depends on if I'm working with the client that has not yet gone through the client value achievement strategy fully or if I'm working with the client that has. And so that's not to say that they can't provide opportunity and additional -- that they don't have additional revenue opportunities with each client. It's just there's certain methods, that we go through today to ensure that clients are achieving that before we just sell them. So -- and I wouldn't say that's a dramatic change from any other quarter, we've had this year. Ryan Krieger : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Bhavin Shah : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just first for Craig. Just you mentioned bringing the fifth building online during the quarter. Any changes to thinking in terms of CapEx for the year? Is 12% of revenue still the right range to think about? And any of those builds that are planned in the near-future that at the tip of your mind? Craig Boelte : Yeah. I mentioned that we just finished the last building. We've got a couple more projects throughout the end-of-the year. So kind of as we talked earlier, what we thought the percent would be for the year somewhere in that 11% to 12%, probably still thinking that. As we look at next year, we really don't have any large projects on the plan. So we mentioned even on the last call, that we would expect CapEx to be potentially single-digits next year as a percent of revenue and that really bodes well for the free-cash flow conversion, which we're also focused on. Bhavin Shah : That makes sense. And just quickly following-up. It appears that Paycom is now partnering with an employment verification service. Can you just maybe elaborate on what this partnership can bring to Paycom from a financial perspective for this year and maybe also a business perspective, how are you guys thinking about partnership opportunities more broadly? Chad Richison : I mean, I wouldn't say we think much of it. I mean any opportunities I think that are in regards to data type things are not necessarily strategic in nature from that standpoint and not necessarily differentiated from -- so from my standpoint, I think that if there's something we can provide our clients that helps them have a better experience with Paycom, that's what we want to look at and focus on and most things would fall in-line with that. Operator : The next question is from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO. You may proceed. Daniel Jester : Yeah. Great. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Chad, on you think about the product roadmap and the focus on automation, should we be expecting sort of more specific modules to help drive that outcome for your customers? Are you going to be reengineering things that you've already put out there to increase the level of automation? sort of any sort of high-level thoughts about the direction you're embarking on here? Chad Richison : Sure. And so I guess we focus on problems to solve and what we want to automate. That's where we start regardless of whether or not that's in our current system of innovation or whether or not that's something new that we add. And so we start with what problem are we solving. And so when you're looking at automation, it's across the entire suite. But it will include additional module opportunities, but those develop as you -- as you're doing the right thing and then you're at the end of your process, you're able to discover the ROI for each and see if there is a revenue opportunity for that. We don't start with the revenue opportunity. We start with automating problems for our clients and solving problems. And sometimes we get to share in those problems we solve through additional revenue opportunities. Daniel Jester : Okay. Thank you. And then just on the four international geographies everybody is available now, have you sold any locally domiciled clients or is it still US centric clients that have employees abroad? Thank you. Chad Richison : Now you asking if we've sold a client that has zero U.S. employees and they're just in the country with zero domestic employees? Is that your question? You may have fallen off. I'm going to answer that question and assume it was. For sure, Canada, I believe, we could have clients that just had that. That was our first one released. I would be surprised at this point if we have a client just in Mexico or the UK or Ireland that doesn't have a U.S. base connection. But I would expect in Canada, we would have some of the talent. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. You may proceed. Jake Roberge : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on that global payroll front. I'm curious what you're seeing on the demand front for geos like Canada that have been in the market for a bit longer and just how long it takes for new geos to start ramping more meaningfully? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, having native payroll in any -- Canada was the very first time we actually ever developed a separate country. We were U.S. for 25 years. And so we learned a lot in Canada. And then we learned a lot more in Mexico and the UK and a lot of the developments we were able to do for a lot of those companies or countries, some of them were transferable, some of the items. And so we've learned a lot by going through this process. Also, we very much strengthened our global HCM product. I mean, it's not just native payroll. We have a very strong global HCM product that we continue to automate as well. And so all of that ties together to make a strong value proposition. Jake Roberge : Okay. That's helpful. And then when we think about the revenue cannibalization of those payroll reruns, when do we officially lap those tougher comps? Is that something that will still be a bigger headwind heading into next year or could that actually be much less pronounced given it will be a smaller base as we've kind of gotten through that this year? Thanks. Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean, again, the factors that we talked about that were impacting us at the end of the year are the same factors that impact us today. When you're talking about how fast or what have you. We also have mitigating factors that factor into that as well. But when you're talking about what happens there, you're really talking about how fast is our client base going to utilize the most efficient product in the industry and then utilize it the right way. And so, we've kind of quantified the expectation of the opportunity that could be cannibalized from good usage, but it's also differentiation. And I think we get that back in other areas. So all that's to say is, when will we be through that type of thing, I don't know, but I do think that there's mitigating factors that we're able to deploy. Again, to achieve client value, to help the client achieve value that they're helping us there as well. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jared Levine with TD Cowen. You may proceed. Jared Levine : Thank you. In terms of float revenue, can you discuss what the updated annual guide is embedding surrounding float revenue, including Fed fund rate assumptions? And was there any extending of duration during the quarter or plan for the rest of the year here? Craig Boelte : Yeah. I mean, we're definitely looking at extending the duration as we're talking about some rate cuts the back half of the year. So as you're looking at the full year, we start to kind of factor in some of those potential rate cuts that seem more certain at this point. And then as you start to layer in and extend duration, you're basically on that amount of money, you're basically taking a rate cut because it's going to be lower than the short-term rate that you could get on that. So yes, we're definitely looking at that. Jared Levine : Okay. So considering it, but that's not currently in motion right now. And then in terms of the sales performance, can you discuss how specifically within the inside sales, how you're doing in terms of those sub-50 employee clients, just given the notable new logo acceleration? Chad Richison : Yeah. I mean the logo acceleration is going to be our mid-market group to 50 and above. The below 50 represents approximately 4% or less of our overall revenue and that hasn't been going up as a percentage. Jared Levine : Sure. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Zachary Gunn with FT Partners. You may proceed. Zachary Gunn : Hey, there. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask in terms of new client wins, has there been any change from a mix perspective of where you're seeing those wins come from, whether it's competitive takeaways or in-house or regional? Just any context there on the competitive side. Chad Richison : No. I mean, we've been in a very competitive industry for 26 years. This is our 26th year. Arguably, we're the new guys from specifically who we really compete with. And so it's the usual suspects that we continue to compete against and with when we're out there in the market. Zachary Gunn : Got it. Thanks. Operator : There are no further questions waiting at this time. I would like to pass the conference back over to Chad Richison for closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. I want to thank everyone for joining our call today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Paycom's Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to James Samford, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. James Samford : Thank you, and welcome to Paycom's earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2024.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com. I will now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's CEO and President. Chad? Chad Richison : Thanks, James, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. I'd like to discuss how Paycom's automation continues to transform our industry, then I'll review some recent client wins and industry recognition, before turning it over to Craig, who will review our financials and guidance before taking questions. We are investing in our highly-differentiated automation platform that is delivering ROI for our clients. 20 years ago, user and buyers bought the Paycom system because they wanted to do more for themselves. And today people buy Paycom because they wanted to do more for them without the need for day-to-day involvement in the software. We already have the most automated system in the industry and we are rapidly moving toward full solution automation, driving even more ROI for our clients. Our award-winning solution, GONE is just one example of how Paycom simplifies task through automation. GONE was recently named a top HR product by HR Executive Magazine and for good reason. GONE is the industry's first fully automated time off solution that decisions all-time off requests. Before GONE, nearly all time-off decisions were unmanaged. A recent Forrester study found that GONE can generate an ROI of up to 800%. By automating time-off decisions, individual managers save nearly a week of unproductive hours annually. In addition, the study found that on average, companies using GONE saved nearly five weeks of unproductive time in the areas of HR, finance and accounting every year. Without GONE, 10% of an organization's labor cost goes substantially unmanaged, resulting in increased costs from overpayments, errors in scheduling, staffing shortages and operational disruption. One example of a client utilizing GONE is an auto dealership with nearly 500 employees spread across multiple locations. GONE saved this client approximately 200 hours of unproductive time per week, while ensuring a consistent time-off request process in apology management across the organization. With Gong, this client reports having reduced decision fatigue among managers and team leaders. Not only is GONE automating mundane task, it is also having a positive impact on employees. Beti continues to be a differentiator and clients using it are experiencing its benefits. We recently on boarded a 1,000 employee hospital organization with over 20 locations. Utilizing Beti, this bilingual workforce has already reduced their payroll processing by 85%. This organization also appreciates that their managers benefit greatly from Manager on-the-Go, which consolidated their managerial task into a single app, streamlining approvals, PAF management, applicant tracking, and more. This client currently boasts a 99.7% DDX score, reflecting the user-friendly power of Paycom Software for the organization. Our development teams have been focused on automating tasks across the platform that are easily adopted by our client base. Because of this focus, both this quarter and throughout the year, we've launched more products and enhancements than any time in our company's history. There are several examples of automation we recently launched that are having a big impact on HR and recruiting departments. One such automation is our position management enhancement that automates reporting structure and hierarchy changes needed, due to individual employee changes such as promotions and transfers or large-scale organizational changes such as an acquisition or restructure. Another example of automation is how we enhanced our recruiting module. The advances in our recruiting product have dramatically increased the application completion rates and significantly reduced time to fill. What was already a very fast time to apply process has now been reduced by 50%. Internally, we developed and deployed an AI agent for our service team. This technology utilizes our own knowledge-based semantic search model and enables us to provide service to help our clients more quickly and consistently than ever before. The AI agent continually improves over time and is having an impact on helping our clients achieve even more value out of their relationship with Paycom. By utilizing our own AI agent, we were able to connect our clients to the right solution faster, improving our immediate response rates by 25% without any additional human interaction. As a result of our continued focus on solution automation, ROI achievement, world-class service, we also increased our Net Promoter Score 24 points year-over-year. On the sales side, we are seeing continued momentum, particularly with our outside sales reps. System automation matters more to business than ever before and our sales force is delivering on the market's needs, which is driving our goals. We still have less than 5% of the addressable market. We remain focused on executing strategies that will produce extremely high ROI and automation for our clients, while continuing to differentiate our solution to automation. Finally, I'm pleased that Paycom was recognized as one of the best employers for tech workers by Forbes and one of the world's best companies overall by Time Magazine. These testaments showcase our culture and the impact our technology is having on workforces all over the globe. We are executing on our 2024 plan and I'm very pleased with the progress. Our success in 2024 will set the foundation for future growth. With that, let me turn it over to Craig. Craig? Craig Boelte : Thanks, Chad. Before I review our third quarter 2024 results and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, I'd like to remind everyone that my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. We delivered solid third quarter results with revenue and adjusted EBITDA coming in above expectations. Third quarter revenue of $452 million increased 11% over the comparable prior year period. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $445 million for the third quarter of 2024, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter and growing nearly 12% from the comparable prior year period. GAAP net income in the quarter was $73 million or $1.31 per diluted share based on approximately 56 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $93 million or $1.67 per diluted share. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $171 million or 38% margin was better-than-expected, primarily due to revenue upside and our continued focus on automation. We expanded our investments in the area of AI, automation and international expansion, resulting in a 20% increase in adjusted R&D expense to $55 million in the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted total R&D costs including the capitalized portion were $84 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $69 million in the prior year period. Our tax rate in the third quarter came in higher-than-expected largely due to one-time discrete items recorded in the quarter primarily related to return to provision adjustments. For Q4 and the full year 2024, we anticipate our effective income tax rates to be approximately 28% and 24%, respectively, on a GAAP basis. We estimate Q4 and full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 27%. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $27 million. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet, including cash and cash equivalents of $326 million and no debt. The average daily balance of funds held on behalf of clients was approximately $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, up approximately 10% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares for $44 million. Since July 1 of last year, we have repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares representing nearly 4% of total shares outstanding and we have $1.49 billion remaining on our buyback authorization. During the third quarter of 2024, we paid approximately $21 million in cash dividends. And earlier this week, the Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share payable in mid-December. Now let me turn to guidance. Following solid Q3 results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, our revenue guidance range for fiscal 2024 increases to $1.866 billion to $1.873 billion or approximately 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We are raising our expected adjusted EBITDA range to $745 million to $752 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% at the midpoint of the range. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect total revenues in the range of $477 million to $484 million, representing a growth rate over the comparable prior year period of approximately 11% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in the range of $184.5 million to $191.5 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range. Overall, Q3 was a good quarter with better-than-expected revenue and significant adjusted EBITDA upside. We have an attractive high margin recurring business model, a solid balance sheet with no debt and strong cash flows. We will continue to focus on strengthening our competitive position through automation and delivering even more value to our clients through ROI achievement. With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Congrats on a great solid quarter. Chad, if you think about, like, the reporting season so far for the payroll names, it does speak towards more of a stabilization or like a really stable market, and everyone is still hoping for like some sort of recovery. What are you seeing out there in terms of, like, end demand, et cetera? How does the pipeline evolve? How are the sales conversations going at the moment? Do you have any kind of more color there, please? And then for Craig, any comments on float and how you think about float going into next year as well? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, the demand is strong out there. I mean, we have an automated solution and more and more people are looking to automate. We continue to get stronger. In fact, last month was our largest sales month, September, both for this year as well as over the history of our company. We continue to get stronger in sales, and that's been important to us to continue to move the product into the market, so the clients can experience the ROI that can be derived from the fully-automated solution. Craig Boelte : Yes. I would say, Raimo, on the float revenue, for every 25 basis point cut, it could impact us as much as $6 million on an annualized basis and we've already seen 50 basis point cut and maybe a couple more this year. So, as we're looking into next year, that's going to be something that's going to impact us. And then, but, we're starting to also look at layering in some more longer-term on that float balances. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first one, Chad, for you. Interesting to hear about using AI in the customer service organization. I'm curious if that's technology that Paycom has built or if you're using a third-party and how you're thinking about that translating into like the savings on the cost to serve side? And do you think that, that can be -- something that can be monetized as a feature at some point as well? And then I have a follow-up for Craig after. Chad Richison : Yes. So that's internal. We built that ourselves and we've been using it. And so, it gets better and better as we mentioned on the call. It sped up our process by 25% as far as being able to connect clients to the solution quicker, whether that be a configuration question, a tax question or what have you. And so, that's really been helpful to us and it continues to do more and more from that perspective. And I'll let Craig answer. Samad Samana : Great. And then Craig, maybe just as a follow-up, when I think about the acceleration, it was good to see that. Have we turned the corner on the CRR cross-sell headwinds and any associated Beti headwinds? And should we think about the fourth quarter guidance as a good starting point for 2025, now that we've started to see a reacceleration? Craig Boelte : I mean, there's still benefits being gained by clients that utilize Beti. I mean, even when you look at our tax resolutions this year versus last year, same time, they're down 1/3. So Beti is still driving efficiencies amongst those clients. As far as CRRs, they continue to help clients achieve the full value of the software and they're continuing to do well. But in order to sell a client an additional product, you really have to make sure that, they're utilizing and having success with the products that they've currently purchased. And so, we have a lot of CRRs that have got their clients in the right solution, and we have a lot of them well over plan in their quotas now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Hi. Good evening and really nice to see the acceleration with regards to recurring revenue. Chad, you mentioned several things, but I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the drivers behind that acceleration. To what extent is it increased module uptake for things like GONE relative to some of the improvements that have been made with regards to kind of the sales go-to-market and training that you've implemented recently? And then I've got a follow-up. Chad Richison : Sure. I mean, I would say that GONE definitely helps sales because of its automation. GONE isn't priced separately, so it's included in one of the modules that most all of our clients already have. So, GONE is just a way to automate that module fully. And then that also is helping sales. I kind of said on the call, I mean, 20 years ago, people bought our system so that they could do more with it. Today, people buy our system so that it can do more for them without their involvement. I mean, 20 years ago, I'd go to a fantasy football draft and do the draft and then set my lineup, maybe one week I'm playing two kickers on accident. Today, people can go and have that draft set it on auto draft and set it on auto lineup. They're usually ones that win the season. And so that's really the concept of our system. If you set it up right, it's going to automate everything for you. And Paycom has the best case scenario for usage in our industry and it's getting more and more clients to that. We have a lot of success with that, obviously, in our go-to-market with new clients. Mark Marcon : Great. And then, any comment with regards to just kind of the sales process and the sales training? Chad Richison : Yes. Sales is doing really well. I mean, unit counts, as I mentioned last time, continue to be elevated. Go to market, they continue to sell more than we have in the past. As I mentioned, yesterday or earlier last month, September was our largest sales month we've had to date and ever. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Brian Schwartz : Thank you for taking my questions. Chad, I had a follow-up on the AI agent or the AI technology that you're developing. Do you see an opportunity in the future to productize what you're developing internally, maybe like in your in future versions of your recruiting product or other products in your platform? Chad Richison : We -- I mean, I would say this isn't the only area in which we're using AI. We have it in several products that we both have released and will be releasing. And so, there's definitely opportunities to monetize AI. As far as this particular solution, it's really helping us on the back end and helping our client as well. So I think we're going to see results and benefits from that in other areas of efficiency across the board within our own organization. Brian Schwartz : Thank you. And then one question for Craig. Just in terms of the EBITDA upside in the quarter, it was a much bigger beat than we've seen in previous quarters. Just wanted to ask you about the expense profile. Did any expenses slip into Q4? Or is that just primarily from the upside in the top-line? Craig Boelte : Yes. I mean, it was primarily from the upside in the top-line. I mean, there were a couple of things that kind of impacted the beat. I mean, some of them were at the corporate level and then some of the marketing maybe a little bit of timing, but other than that just efficiencies throughout. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Riley with Needham. Joshua Riley : All right. Thanks for taking my questions. So you mentioned in the press release moving towards a full solution automation. How should the investors think about this period right now, where you've kind of been aggressively making some changes to the platform behind the scenes? Is this something that you think is largely complete at the end of '24 or sometime in '25? And are the implications that we should be thinking about from our end is that the EBITDA margins can potentially move up, as we move past that kind of elevated period of investment? Chad Richison : I mean, automations do drive efficiencies. I mean, there's no doubt about that across the board. We're also very ambitious, because we only have 5% of the market. And so, there are certain areas we want to capture. I mean, I would just say about automation, since our founding, we focused on innovating for our clients and differentiating ourselves from our competitors by delivering that maximum ROI, which is good for everyone. And so, we've doubled down on innovation to include the full automation and the softwares used in our industry will look different in a couple of years and we're the ones who are building it. Joshua Riley : Got it. And then just following back up on that client utilization of modules that have already been sold, it seemed like the last couple of quarters, you've been monitoring that pretty carefully yourself. Are you seeing any change in terms of making the effort with the cross sell team to get the utilization higher, or is it still kind of consistent with what it's been the last few quarters? Chad Richison : Yes. It's continuing to go up in a good way. Sometimes utilization isn't always reflected in time spent in the system. Oftentimes, the best way to utilize our system is to set it up and leave it alone, so that it can actually do the work for you. And we're having a lot more of that where people trust the system. I mean, you can make 20 decisions today and help us configure something in a way that it will fully automate 4,000 decisions you would otherwise be making every day. And so, so much of what we bring to market is about doing that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Enders with Citi. Steve Enders : Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess maybe to start, just want to ask a little bit on the 4Q guide and the outlook here. I mean, I think kind of pretty good beat here, but it does look like the full amount kind of rolled through to the year. So can you help us maybe think about what's maybe happening in Q4 that leading to a little bit of the change in the guide or some of the puts and takes that we be thinking about for Q4? Craig Boelte : Yes. So, as we look to Q4 and then the full year, we narrowed the range, we increased the bottom end and narrowed the range some. Q4 is the one that is the hardest to predict, based on the number of bonus runs that you have and other type of off-cycle runs, as well as we had a 50 basis point cut in the interest rates and potentially a couple of more as we're looking to the end -- towards the end of the year. But that's really what I would say as it relates to the -- as we were thinking the guidance for Q4 and full year. Steve Enders : Okay. And so, is it -- are the factors going into it, it's primarily changes on the flow assumption side that there isn't, I guess, other changes being accounted for in the outlook? Craig Boelte : Not that I would really call out. I mean, more interest rate cuts on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. I wonder in terms of the EBITDA beat, Chad, I think you talked about revenue and some automation. Is there any way to think about, like, how much was the revenue upside as opposed to automation? And as you think about that automation initiative, how much of that is kind of through the organization already? And how much more is there to go, I guess, in terms of maybe not necessarily numbers, but percentages, whether it's on the front end or back end? Is there any way to frame that a little bit? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, I think there's a lot of automation to go. I mean, in the perfect world, the system would just work it for you as you look at it. You wouldn't even have to log in. So, I mean, I think there's a lot of automation to go. We're a company that eats our own cooking. So, of course, automation is going to impact us and our back office as well to the positive. So, but yes, I mean, automation, it's fun. It's fun to do. It's fun to actually watch a client enact it and be able to trust the system and watch what it can do for them, because that's really what it's about is the return on investment that they're achieving, and being able to do something that they couldn't do anywhere else. Kevin McVeigh : That's helpful. And then with the commentary on that September, the largest sales month ever, is there any way to -- how much of that is kind of white space as opposed to competitive takeaway? And what's driving -- is that kind of just incremental Beti adoption or just because obviously it's a really nice data point? Chad Richison : Yes. So that's going to be our bookings. So that's going to be pretty much new business, new logo ads. That's going to be the overwhelming majority of it. Of course, all those will have Beti as well. But that's that number. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Devin Au : Hi. This is actually Devin on for Jason today. Thanks for taking our questions. I just want to double click on the outperformance in the quarter on the revenue side. Would you attribute the beat there just mainly on new logo strength in the quarter? Was it stronger back-to-base motion, or did you see maybe perhaps better over or better retention among employees within your customers? Just more color there would be helpful. Craig Boelte : Maybe it's primarily going to be just new logo ads. I mean, that's the overwhelming majority of our new revenue is going to be new logo ads. Devin Au : Got it. That's helpful. And then just one more for me. Just curious how the new cohort of sales rep, I believe, you guys added 60-plus new sales rep last quarter. Just curious how those have been ramping versus expectations? Chad Richison : Yes, very well. I mean, we have a very strong sales model, a very strong go-to-market. I would say that, our sales reps are very fired up about the product that they're selling and what can be delivered to our clients. They've been doing very well as reflected by both the starts number and unit numbers that we gave both last quarter and giving some comment on bookings this quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler. Arvind Ramnani : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see if you would comment on sort of Beti adoption, particularly with sort of the cohort of customers who were kind of slow to adopt. You definitely had some customers who were slow to adopt Beti. Have they -- has that adoption increased between that quota folks who were slow to adopt? Chad Richison : Yes. We definitely are still meeting clients where they live to help them achieve value through the products that they utilize from us, whether they have Beti or not. But you do continue to have clients that see the value of Beti and continue to implement it as well. And of course, all new clients have been coming on with Beti now for about three years. Arvind Ramnani : Yes. Terrific. And then, can you provide a bit of an update on some of the progress in the international markets? And I know it's much smaller, but any details around that would be helpful. Chad Richison : Yes. So, we're in four countries right now, native of us having developed payroll, but our global HCM actually encompasses all countries and we continue to build that product out as well. So, we're doing well in that and I know we -- Craig had a comment. Craig Boelte : Yes, I mean, we recently added a manufacturing company with locations all over the world and they had native payroll in U.S., Canada and Mexico. So, we're seeing more and more companies, primarily U.S. with a multinational operations adopt that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah with Deutsche Bank. Bhavin Shah : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, congrats for Chad. And going back to earlier comments, just back to the CR team, where are they in terms of helping clients achieve full value for that software? What percentage of base have you gone through and have optimized their spend with Paycom? Chad Richison : Yes. I mean, I would say CRRs is that's one of the groups that is helping clients achieve full value. But if I'm a CRR and I have a quota and it's my job to go out there and help clients make sure they have all the products necessary to reach full ROI, there are certain products I want to sell them. But in order to sell them those products, I have to make sure they're utilizing the current products that they have. And so, where CRR is going to be involved in that is during that process. But whether a CRR is out there or not, working with an individual client, we at Paycom continue to do that. We do have service individuals that focus on helping clients to make sure they're configured the right way to get full usage and value for the systems that they've purchased. Bhavin Shah : Got it. Craig just on gross margin, they compressed this quarter at similar levels to what we saw last quarter, even when I take into consideration higher depreciation costs. Can you just give us a sense like what else might be impacting gross margins? How much of it is kind of industry pricing dynamics or needing to hire more customer support reps or anything else? And when should that stabilize going forward? Craig Boelte : Yes. So, some of the pressure on the gross margin was the new building we brought online really at the end of second quarter. So, we had a full quarter of the cost of that new building. And so, it's not just a depreciation, but some of the other allocations of some headcount, some corporate headcount and things like that. So, some of that went into the gross margins. And then, some of it's also headcount as well, just a client service headcount. As the margins get too high, we might be a little understaffed. And so we're in a good place staffing wise on that group. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester with BMO. Kyle Aberasturi : Good afternoon. This is Kyle Aberasturi on for Dan Jester. Thank you for taking our questions. Can you talk about capital spending trends and how you expect that will evolve next year? And then secondly, on segment performance, was there anything to call out in terms of up-market versus down-market performance during the quarter? Craig Boelte : Yes. I mean, I'll cover the capital spending trends. I mean, obviously, we're going to spend for growth first and so definitely going to invest there either in sales and marketing and then also on the R&D front where that's one of the line items that's continued to grow some. After that, we're looking at the stock buybacks. We've done some stock buybacks this quarter that you guys have seen as well as dividends. Chad Richison : And from segment performance up or down-market, no change on that. We're seeing strength in both. Craig Boelte : Yes. One thing I would say also on the capital spend, we finished that big building this year. So we would expect maybe CapEx next year to trend down a little bit, probably below 10%. Operator : This concludes the question and answer session of today's call. And I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Chad Richison for closing remarks. Chad Richison : All right. I want to thank everyone for joining our call today, and I want to thank our employees for all their hard work and commitment to Paycom's success. We look forward to seeing investors at several conferences this quarter, including the UBS Conference in Phoenix in early December and the Barclays Conference in San Francisco in mid-December. Thank you. Operator, you may disconnect. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
